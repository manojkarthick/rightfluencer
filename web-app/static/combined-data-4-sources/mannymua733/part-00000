hey guys welcome back to my channel so today's video is going to be a fun testing of a product video you guys know I absolutely love doing these videos you guys send me the weirdest craziest most random ass shit and today is no different whatsoever I got so many tweets and dm's about this brand this is the brand pop luxe I believe it's called pop luxe and this is a glow-in-the-dark highlighter I've never seen a glow-in-the-dark highlighter before so I'm actually really fucking excited so as always if you guys don't like this video if you guys do not like me please don't fucking watch it you know the drill with that yeah but if you guys do like this video please subscribe to my channel if you're not already and therefore you knew what's up a man anyway and welcome to my channel thank you so much for being here I really really appreciate it yeah you guys let's go ahead and get into this review on this glow-in-the-dark so this is in the shade nightlife nightlife this looks delicious eight grams of product twenty two point twenty eight ounces we got actual highlighter here there's a mirror which is awesome and this has a really really cool intense greenish hue green the bitch go fuck at work honestly this could really fuckin work so let's talk about the product and their brand really quickly so a little bit about pop luxe I believe he's also a youtuber this is I think the brand owner I'm not quite quite sure I'm looking up the actual product the shop section here we go we have nightlife glow-in-the-dark highlighter $23 so it says here for the best results start a minimally and build up no glow baby this highlighter is cruelty-free vegan tuck free gluten and paraben free so we're just gonna go in kind of fuckin excited okay guys so this one looks like I guess again I showed you guys this what it looks like it has like a really intense greenish undertone it's crazy I kind of want to put it against my light and then go like this and see if it closes you know I'm saying so now we're gonna turn off the lights and see how it looked in the dark okay I'm putting it directly in front of the camera can you guys see a glow huh I don't really see a glow in person not too much I'm gonna shine my light okay we're gonna do this this is what we're gonna do here we're gonna feed this motherfucker some light honey yeah you can call me some lab buddy it's glowing more oh my god I can no 100% see it oh one of you guys can tell in the light but I promise you in person it's totally fucking working Oh No okay guys the lights are back on and it 100% got brighter when the lights were off I was like shocked that it was absorbing light because I feel like one of the this is one of those things where it's like is this gonna work is it gonna work I'm gonna go ahead and dunk my little brush my little more feet and five ten you guys know it's not too powdery whatsoever which is nice we're gonna go ahead and highlight oh my god this is fucking beautiful I'm sorry I'm shaken to the fucking core the color itself though is really pretty and it's very very reflective but I'm very happy about because I mean it's working because of the fact that it does have that greenish blue undertone it's definitely going to make you look a little bit more pale a little bit more dad it's not one of those highlights doesn't make you look so healthy and alive this is gonna make you look like higher cheekbones and much more like intense and contoured but I'm actually really living for it so far and I'm gonna shine my motherfucking flashlight on my face and he's got it done and we're gonna see how it looks in the dark bug I'm excited so as you guys can see I'm right here in the center I'm gonna see if this highlighter actually does glow in the dark or not so let's go ahead showing the light onto my cheek and start absorbing that fucking highlight buddy I don't know you guys to me this is not glowing in the dark this is like a really fun reflective intense green blue highlighter for sure I don't see how it's not glowing for me okay cool so the lights are now on and this is where the height looks like of course with the lights on it does it's extremely beaming it's a fucking intense it's very very blinding and actually quite beautiful but when I turn the lights off it didn't glow in the dark it didn't like I didn't see a difference maybe you felt I was out I like the middle of the night at like midnight I don't I don't think I did I mean my room was fucking pitch-black and I saw absolutely no glow Klink off from my face but in the pan it does glow I don't know this is one of those products works like a conundrum really the park is all have you bought this you wouldn't be so disappointed because the park is fucking stunning on the face it really truly is but I don't know if it really goes in the dark so what are my final thoughts on this highlighter do I like it do I not like it what do I think does actually glow-in-the-dark I always expect to go full fucking glowing streak on my face but I think I was having a little bit of a high expectation when it comes to this yeah technically it did not work but the product still was a hit for me I actually really enjoy it I think it's really pretty and I'll definitely wear it again I'm not disappointed look at what the flash how blinding that fucking bitches come on look at that mm-hmm it's so intense let's watch on the hand it feels great look at this shit guys what the fuck dude like that she's that is wrong with how blinding that shit is it's wrong it is 100 sound proof for me hell yes potlucks I just I still feel like I'm using it a little bit wrong and it could have glowed in the dark for me but who knows let me know in the comments if you guys have tried to if it does glow in the dark for you what I did wrong hey guys thank you guys so much for watching I'll leave this of course it linked down below as always have a great for the night or day wherever you guys are and I will catch you guys in my next video bye you guys mwah what cool fucking work bro I mean it's pretty it worked pretty like what a woman's I don't know what the fuck's it in your guys sorry mommy I didn't mean to hit you thank you holy fuck it's working I know yeah hey though jingles can get picked up on the fucking mic I need to know that hey guys that welcome back to my channel No

to be as authentic as I can be as I am in my real life and in my real life I curse all the time so I want to be myself I want to continue to be myself so I'm sorry if the cursing bothers you like if I'm cursing in my videos and I say bad words - is how it is man I just curse like a sailor in my everyday life okay I hate it I think I hate this guys I honestly is oxidizing pink like straight-up going mad pink on me yeah this feels super super heavy it's a very thick BB cream you guys see the difference on the color on my face right now holy shit okay we're gonna actually just use only light we're not even go with medium because it is oxidizing it's just like the thickest BB cream I've ever tried it's shocking we think but does not even get talked you're pretty funny cuz I'm just not a BB cream person I've never been a BB cream person I just feel like it always has looked so hot on me and I just feel like look so intense and it's so shiny it's like the oiliest BB cream I've ever used I look oily like I look like an oil slick so far I'm not the biggest fan I feel like it gave me obviously the creams don't give a lot of coverage or anything like that so it is what it is so I'm gonna take the light concealer so we're gonna take this little thing it's actually the packaging is not bad like the packaging of this is not bad at all basic as fuck obviously but it's just a classic little package so we have this long-ass petal this is in the shade light this truly on and I mean this from the bottom of my heart looks like mustard like I don't think I've ever looked as terrible as I am right now oh my god this is like burning my skin this does not happen to me I'm not sensitive like that at all I'm upset because like it looks so bad like I've never never experienced this never had this it's never done this never was this okay guys so we try to soak the beauty blender and it didn't grow at all and it's still hard as fuck cool so it's rock hard and this is the worst one I've ever tried for sure by far I don't think I've ever tried anything as bad as I'm pregnant like this is the probably the worst it's ever been and it's taking off all my makeup like it's soaking it all up okay so since I don't have any a setting powder from there like they didn't actually sell a setting powder I'm gonna go and set it really quickly with my Too Faced ethereal powder just quickly cuz I don't have a product from them but that's what that was so I'm gonna set everything in place powder is trying so hard to make it look as good as it can like it is the powder is trying but there's no saving it like there's no saving hat we tried the BB cream so far hated it the concealer hated it more than I've ever hated you can see there my entire life sponge hated it I'm gonna keep it going and see how much we can make myself upset on this one also simply me Beauty 7-eleven makeup has some brushes that we got as well actually comical it's like comical how these feel like how bad do you feel I like killing her this Wow Wow so let's go ahead and bronze up our skin we're gonna go and take the assembly me Beauty son glow matte and shimmer bronzer this I believe was like four bucks as well four or five bucks what you guys are seeing right now like the powder has made it look a little bit better than what it is but it's truly terrible like the powder helped anyway so this is the component of this guy it it comes with a little okay this is actually like really it feels terrible like it feels cheap as fuck the fact that it comes with a little brush as a mirror attached to the bottom of it you close it and you get like the powder I think it's really cool I think that the idea was definitely in there and they try their hardest okay we're gonna go ahead and take the bronze this is the only bronze with a half by the way and as you can see it's literally red brown it's so I'm scared okay we're gonna go ahead and put that into okay fuck the brushes I'm is go ahead and try to go in with a real brush that we can see how it really acts like on our skin like what is it really supposed to be like you know saying so we're going on with the bronzer the bronzer is straight-up red doesn't blend very well it feels actually pretty good and it swatches really nicely that's actually pretty good but it's literally a red Brown - it's um Swiss chocolate from Mac like that is war I'm true this is turning into a fun like fuck us kind of situation at this point like it's so what's so bad like oh my god let's see save a book on blended with like this oh my god oh my god it's so fucking terrible I think all we can do at this point is laugh because if not we will crying and I don't feel like crying right now so now we're going to take some colored blush we have this blush right here this actually looks really cute does the blush looks really pretty pigmented as fuck super pigmented oh my word was not expecting that at all almost too pigmented and usually I'll say such a thing the blush I don't hang actually I think it's really pretty and I should I'm gonna try it out when I'm actually doing a real glam where I'm actually set and I have a good foundation on and all that chick the pigmented is fuck I know we can really get somewhere with this blush highlight time I think we're going highlighter guys I'm sorry if I'm getting less and less energy as this videos going along I I think it's called two feet and I'm Haley crying but the defeat is really hello Reno you know it's like really hella so it's going try some pie later now we have a radiant highlighter highlighters here we have a peachy one we have a yellow one I think we can make that work though I think we can definitely make that work we're gonna take the peach here one and I wanna see it can't be that bad I mean we can't do worse than we already have right now look see we're highlighting that works that totally works nice this actually works really really well oh my gosh I'm savvy mm-hmm you got something that works you guys I'm not kidding you and I see I'm actually like trying really hard to make this work like I am trying my best to look my best highlight to Phil Phil and what I mean felt I mean my face is filthy we got these three guys we have these three done okay let's go and talk about these real quick the bronzer was an absolute fuck no an absolute fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck no I would say if you're in 7-eleven and you're in a in a hurry for a blush you need something I would buy this like this for four bucks it's actually pretty good it worked really nicely on my skin and I would suggest this one is the only thing so far I like and this guy I mean it worked like it's all my skin at work this is something that you can just I wouldn't I wouldn't buy it personally cuz it looks looks pretty on the camera but in person I just don't like it whatsoever the Cuddy doesn't let me heat the chickee uh-uh I watched cocoa and literally I'm so obsessed my name is fucking Manuel good chair is like I am Mexican and I just grew up and like my Nana my Tata I'm like in a Mexican household so it was just like so fun watching this movie that I was like that's celebrating like Mexican culture and it was just so much just so cool just ride me it just brought me back to like my childhood in like it was great like I really loved it and if you guys like Pixar movies it was an amazing amazing amazing Pixar movie I would suggest watching Coco because it's so so good mmm did that let's go and zoom in for the brow okay so now we're gonna go ahead and go in with the brows and with the brows we have this dark powder and wax when I brothers showed me this one I was like bitch this looks like this reminds me so much of the elephone cuz elf has that little like a brow powder wax thing that's like this is of course a lot cheaper and is cute whatsoever so we're gonna go ahead and go in with the dark wax with the little brush we came in fuck this brush because we're gonna go in with a real brush like a good one one that's not an inch long this reminds me so much the elf one like literally so much of it which I used to use awful unlike when I couldn't afford anything else this brings back some memories bringing them back relics terrible I hate it maybe we got this come on I know our Facebook like shit but we can trying because this is what the brow looks like with just the brow wax in it it's almost comedy so now we're gonna go in with a brow powder which is like a little bit powder on the side this will be dark brown this is straight-up black I'll go over to set the brow wax right you guys the reason I don't like these brow wax is and brought powdered bullshit shit it's because it for me it just moves around so much like I like to go in with my spoolie and links pulling my brows out and try to do like the best I can but with this it just looks so fucking ugly anyway I'm gonna go ahead and finish the other brow off camera and I'll be right back anyway I probably my eyes off of camera really quickly so I can give this a real fair shot this is the matte and shimmer eyeshadow collection little palette Soho thing this guy was another like five bucks so we have this right here looks like a Bobby Brown shimmer brick so it said it's a matte and shimmer but every single shades Ishimura there's one matte actually it is a very very top it's a nude these are not like that terrible oh okay what we're gonna do I'm gonna go ahead and take the bronzer that we took earlier we're gonna put that into the crease so we actually have a crease color down cuz damn we got shit dude we're gonna do a quick little bronzy eye let's go into one of their brushes and let's take this like all of the green sheet right here we're gonna pack that onto the lid I hate it I hate I'm giggling because I hate it like I am uncomfortable googler onto the lid are you doing good we have graduated from bad to actual trash I don't see the shadow I mean it works does there's nothing clear going down but it's just such a bad like it's just a bad color it's not pretty the finish isn't pretty it's like a weird shimmer blend a little bit of the darker one under the lower lash line you guys I feel like with the darker color it's saving it like I definitely think it's looking so much better with the darker color thank you goodness gracious on this earth okay so we have this on the eye so far the smokey eye situation going on let's take the matte shade my brow bone me me another mustard color awesome at least you ever condominum all time and just what I got also guys they have an eyelash curler so it's going to our lashes and see oh you got it here I feel actually terrible but we're gonna try it anyway oh and also just this cut lash curler its freaks me out because that's like a spring like spring on it I don't know why it like freaks me out open it curl totally curl my lashes okay Chloe work honestly like how bad can you make a lash curler like I feel like no matter what you'll at least get some type of curl somehow okay curled lashes are done and now we're gonna go and take the volume and Link mascara new money new money actually the wand is not bad at all like has it goes like little tiny spikes let's try it let's try it for real for real for real let's try it do what's crazy is that I'm not even hitting this that bad it gives you a major major major separation they're not it's not right while you might think I'll get me wrong or lengthening for that matter it gives you a nice nice like lash separation see that okay guys so this one I don't hate as much as I hate other things so that's really it makes me happy oh my god yes okay but the gag is it's like is it that I'm impressed like I think it's good or is it everything else was so bad that I feel like it's good because everything else is so bad and to compare to you guys oh my scary is on now this is what we have so far so it's just a basic run in the mill not that great mascara but for a quick couple bucks like it's not terrible like it's not the end of the world like I think that you can like definitely get bite with this one liquid felt oh we have a liquid felt tip eyeliner oh fuck oh fuck packaging is not bad at all there's a little fill tip I mean this is not the fattest felt tip liner I remember seen one this is honestly so it's like annoying look how fat it is it's like it just hmm so we have on our highs right here so I mean I don't like hate it hate it like I don't I definitely don't hate it as much as I hate oh there's product and if you're in a pinch I would grab this it's really like it's it's black it definitely like you can see that eyeliner on it doesn't like skip so bad but with a little wing with this I don't think so like I guess we can don't hate it don't hate it like don't him his bad nearly and actually like I like the packaging of this is like really sleet it's like a matte black packaging like I actually really enjoyed this one I'm gonna apply the other eyeliner off of camera and apply some lashes really quickly and I will be right back to finish off with the lip and we'll have a final verdict on this makeup line we got the lashes on I think the lashes on helps so much I think it gives it much more of a glam appearance even though the look is an actual flop I think the lashes look great thank you morphe for the new lashes or we just came out with lashes by the way I don't you guys knew that but they're fucking sickening like they're actually sickening in there ten bucks Bob we're gonna move on to the lip and we are done I grabbed a bunch of items you're guys let's go ahead and do a dark lip there's lipstick we have a cream lipstick in the shade wine I don't drink wine but for this video I will we have a lipstick right here not bad like it looks totally fine okay smells like crayons okay so this is the shade of wine and actually looks really really pretty it took me about seven layers but we got there and it's full pigment right now feels super comfortable on the lips not sticky at all honestly I think the lipstick is probably the best of the entire brand this one so far was nice I grabbed the other shade Clementine and I got the other shade of Rouge let's see what those look like I'm actually really curious to see what squash like this is a cream lipstick so these are the type of you have to build up to be full coverage which is fine because it is a cream so we got new Clementine which is like an orange shade let's see how this one looks on the hand right there and then we have this shade Rouge we have a shimmery cream finish hate it hate that one hate it wine is the prettiest by heart okay guys so this is the final look using all 7-eleven makeup oh my word she went through it with this one guys like she really really went through yeah she went through a lot okay guys all about what do I think about the 7/11 makeup what I think about the products or anything with the brand collectively 7-eleven makeup was a flop like it was absolutely no I think it was a Miss Baldy and I was like even redeemable was this I've tried and I was looking out with the glosses as well which I never really got to try but how can you fuck up a glass to have that I hope Oh hopefully it's fine the mascara wasn't terrible and the eyeliner wasn't terrible either I got a wing down I used a to clean it up I got it on and the blush wasn't that bad either everything else was a flop and I need a flappity flap flop like Oh flaccid dick flop like la I would definitely suggest not purchasing any of these 7-eleven items not just try to be a bitch but I think that yeah I get that it's five dollars and thunder but why spend any money if it's not gonna work like what's the point of spending money if you don't have to on things that don't work and that's it guys that's all I really have to say I just it was a big flop for me and I'm kind of bummed because I had like a little bit of hope for this one I try not to be mean and try to be not to be like oh maybe this'll work for someone but it's hard when the products just don't want to cooperate and you really want them to you know I mean like I can't even think of someone that would like this like that's like that's why it's crazy because I can't even think of like people enjoying it that's why I'm like frustrated so anyway you guys I hope you guys enjoyed it two days of video as they just wanted to join me my little Christmas angel don't forget to enter my giveaway and go ahead and comment down below where you

hey guys welcome back to my channel how are you guys doing I feel like it's been so long since I films I've been out of town recently you know I've been doing so many shit I went to VidCon I want Ohio for a wedding today's video is going to be a full PR unboxing I did one of these videos about a month and half ago almost two months ago I went over so when you guys loved it so I was like okay cool I'm gonna do another one of these I believe I asked you guys in this video if you guys wanted to see me do a series of unboxings and using the PR I literally just got in the next video and a lot of you guys did say yes and combine those two videos have over 2.5 million views so I'm like you know what I think they like them yeah so yeah it says video is going to be a PR unboxing just so you guys can see some of the random things that beauty influencers get online sometimes it's makeup sometimes it's not like this random things you never really know online before I can start on this video I try to say a huge huge thank you to Beauty lish because we are partnering up in this video this video is sponsored with Beauty lish and I'm just so excited because I've worked with beuliss before and I think they're a fucking wonderful wonderful company and I wanna say thank you guys so much for wanting to sponsor me you know I don't really get a lot of it I've talked about this before but I don't get a lot of sponsorships you know and the ones I do get are from brands I don't want to use so when I do a sponsorship is really special to me because I don't really get to do them very often and it just means a lot when a brand believes in me and doesn't want to change my opinions or want to make me seem like I'm someone that I'm not because that's never gonna happen so thank you to be delicious for believing in me as a man emu a and not trying to change me but we'll get more into their brand later on in the video as always if you guys don't in this video if you guys do not like me please don't fucking watch it you know the drill with that but if you guys do like this video please subscribe to my channel if you're not already and if you're new what's up I'm an emu and welcome to my channel thank you so much for being here I really genuinely appreciate it from the bottom of my heart Breanna is going into this PR unboxing [Music] so in case you guys are not aware of what I'm doing technically what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do a PR unboxing and I'm gonna be using the makeup I use in this PR boxing in a tutorial like literally right after I'm done unboxing it and that will be going up in the next few days let start the first box and of course is going to be a beauty lish package so what we're gonna do is we're gonna start off with butyl ish and we have some products from the beauty list hm-hm-hm first thing I want to talk about really quickly is the ordinary I talked about before in different videos a favorites videos I talked about on snapchat the ordinary is a skincare brand that I sold on Beauty lish and they are a really really inexpensive skincare brand these are the things I use the most I use the retinol one percent and I use the advanced retinoid 2% I interchange them when depending on how much I want to slough off my skin a reason I'm not wearing makeup right now is I kinda wanted to show like I'm not wearing any makeup at all right now and I feel like the texture of my skin has really improved don't get me wrong I have texture I have gnarly pores I'm a dude that's just what it is but I feel like it's really definitely improved and I do genuinely believe that it's from the ordinary using these two products and six and eight dollars like you really cannot beat those prices and the ordinary has tons tons of stuff like for example natural moisturizing factors plus H a Azalea acid suspension 10% aah eight thirty plus either how to read they have such a wide variety of products that it would fit any skin type you can find a product for you from the ordinary and I honestly would highly suggest checking some other stuff out on Beauty - what awesome beauty - we got the Cicely Black Rose skin infusion cream plumping and radiance masks okay honestly Jeffrey is like a freaking huge fanatic of Cicely and he's one that always tells me you have to use this new product somebody skincare talk to you also loves them too so I'm excited so I got a couple shadows from sugarpill which is a really cool indie brand that has really bright intense ass shadows I absolutely love them for like bright intention we got this Charlotte Tilbury instant look into pallets five-minute face on the go let's open this girl I love I love Charlotte Tilbury and also with that we got a matte revolution luminous modern and matte long-lasting lipstick in the shade below talked she got this little cheek on the go pal which is actually really cool we have the face highlight face bronzed cheek cheek pop cheeks wish I smoked i enhance and I brighten we have the beca x chrissy teigen face palette and this is what she looks like i have not tried this out yet and we have a plethora of the new england a quest ik a qu AST I see acrostic acrostic equesticle a cur cream eyeshadow bitin glut let's open one of these up and see what they look like whoo so liquid shadow let's see a swatch oh oh I'm sorry I didn't realize you guys weren't planning on so that's it for it be a beauty list products I just wanted to say one thing about you dish that I absolutely love about them in case you guys didn't know they are an online retailer that has sells so many different brands they have Jeffrey's brand they have so many different brands on them I absolutely love butyl ish and what's really really cool about their brand is that they have flexible payment which means you can make payments on your actual payment for example so if you bought something that one hundred dollars total you can have three months to pay it out rather than just pay it in one total and you have to pay for the first like one third of the payment right than in there IG that's really awesome you know like you don't have the money to pay for the whole thing but you still want that product you can make monthly payments on it and I've never heard of online like makeup company being able to do that so huge huge kudos to you a beauty list you're doing something so badass and different and that's it for beauty list products let's move on to some more of these of these be out of magazines what do we have here next week is that stain it so we have this package from Kim kardashian-west Beauty Kim kW Judy I went to her event recently where I met Kim Kardashian she was so sweet so professional just actually look just a nice genuinely sweet

what it is specifically it says a richly pigmented lipstick that adorns lips in a lightweight veil of opaque color for a modern matte finish fashion was essentially surrealist golden let the destined to be the cult status basically it's mostly be a high-end lipstick for a high-end price point so we're gonna go ahead and take the skin show lust Metron so this is like the nude collection basically we're gonna open now I think it's cute I may be wrong I think it's like a very different unique way of packaging but it's such a mess and makes me really hit noise actually like I don't like to open except getting nervous it's gonna spill buck see a couple went down a couple down so you know three lipsticks right here they come in their own little individual baggie we have ami oh me oh my flesh 3 and 1995 each of them have a little sticker that shows what exact shape so let's go ahead open these bad boys up oh okay this is fucking sickening this is a beautiful ass component oh my god it's like a medal with a really pretty gold lips we're gonna take the shade a 19 and 95 okay are you the world's most overhyped lipstick I hope not but if you are okay so this is the park pushed up all the way each of the lipsticks come with 0.2 14 ounces they are made in Italy Maine Italy it makes it fucking sound rich I'm very intrigued let's see okay okay I'm impressed so far so this is one layer of a 1995 right here as you can see it is definitely full coverage full pigness as it was going on if felt very nice it felt very lightweight on my lips right now it does feel very very very light it's not like a heavy feeling lipstick I definitely would not say that this is a matte lipstick kate matte lipstick by any means the way that this looks in the tube I'm like wow that's so mad holy fuck that's some bad as fuck but on the lips it's not as mad as I thought was gonna be it's actually a little more of a satin finish it gives you a budge it's very very comfortable let's try the shade ami these are so pretty like the way they just they have a very just unique look like no shine whatsoever is coming off of these okay so that was literally a one two full fucking coverage god damn this is the shade o me or om I Tommy same exact consistency as the other shade it is a very very lightweight full fucking coverage so I was thinking that it was gonna be so Matt like I thought it was gonna look like this on the lips I really did it does not look this matte on the lips whatsoever but I'm sure let me see yeah so this is definitely the type of matte lipstick that will 100% transfer if you're gonna kiss someone if you're gonna eat something if you're gonna eat someone hey I don't know your fucking life it's definitely going to transfer a little bit so just be cautious of that and last but not least of the entire nude said we have the shade flesh 3 wears actually the darkest of the three oh shit it feels identical to other shades like literally exactly the same feels nice and lightweight I have no complaints whatsoever so far so good on the nude shades so now let's go ahead move on to the brights and now for the bright collection oh that was a good fucking ribbed you see that Wow that's all fucking good we're gonna take the shade Elson e LS o n our first bright okay L so let's see what you got buddy it almost feels better than the last ones so we have Elson right here this one actually felt a little bit different than the other shades did this one felt a lot more creamy and then the other ones it I felt like this one actually looks a little bit more shiny than the other a flesh tone shades did I think the color itself a stunning it's like a beautiful blue toned red it looks beautiful however this is definitely much more of a satin creamy finish than it is matte for sure did you see how that fucking applied how creamy that was God that she almost made me sick with how nice that was perfect so what do we got next we have the shade obsessed excavation point so we have obsessed right here which is a really intense bright orange coral let's go ahead and swatch this one how are these swatching so fucking what is in here okay so this shade feels identical to the last bright shade not the nude ones the last bright one this one again has a lot more give it's much more of a satin finish it's not as mad as the other shades are but it is stunning the coverage was beautiful no streaks whatsoever the color looks fucking great okay obsessed I'm obsessed well it's nice it fits Bernay we can't do any better so now we're going with the shade full panic ever I like Manic Panic so we have a brightest fuck hot hot pink what it's just so crazy how matte they look on the tube but on the lips they have such a satin finish I don't understand let's see okay so this one it feels more like the nudes and this is the shade a full panic it's a hot intense ass fuchsia full ass coverage right away again just like all the other shades were this one feels more matte like the nude ones did than the other previous hot intense colors which I really like because I feel like this actually is more true to name to the Matt trance name I feel like this is more of a matte a modern matte finish of course let me see if I kiss my land again hella I never wear the pink like this is like really weird for me to see and now we have one more so first one to go in with the shade antidote which is a beautiful like right it's like a bright plum okay something okay okay that's washed a little weird it could be mate okay I'm gonna start it off I'm starting it on my hand first I'm sweating on my hand let's see now and here we have antidote this is the shade right here um is actually talking because I feel like usually I feel like colors like this and make my teeth look super yellow and I'm always like I'm alone to care about these colors but this one doesn't make my teeth look at that bad so this one it felt a lot more like the nude shade so I had much more of a tug then the bright shades did so this one definitely gives you much more of a matte feeling going on however it is still pretty shiny on the lips it definitely looks like as if it is not a full matte lipstick but I'm not obsessed like this one I'm just not that obsessed with like the way it went on I'm not obsessed with the way it looks on the lips I'm not obsessed with let me just a personal thing exactly love purple lipstick so mmm personal thing now obsessed with this one my lips are burning only two more now I'll take the shade who isn't stunning Micke shade mcmenamy's mcmenamy's mmm this was slightly more patchy than the other ones aren't hey mom what's up yes I am this one I would say is slightly more streaky than the other shades are I don't how to apply two layers two to three layers to get it full opacity but it could also be because my lips are very very like raw right now and it just like they don't want to take any more lipstick on the lips at all once you get the layers down the two or three layers I feel like the coverage is full coverage it's beautiful it looks really really nice on the lips but I definitely had to build this one up to be full coverage and to make sure there was no like up my skin peeking through even though I still feel like there's little spots of great they're not in the Sun or anything but went on very smooth very creamy okay guys so we are now down to the last one and my lips are so happy and ready to be gone with this they're very excited so we're gonna take the shade deep void that's a hot fucking sound show you so this one looks black we have a black lipstick okay so this is definitely not black this is deep dark fucking purple glides on so good okay guys so this is the shade deep void which I love the shade name I don't really like shades like this these are just not my thing I think they look a little funky on me my whole mouth is so red right now from like wiping off and putting all these lipsticks on wet on extremely creamy it has more of a satin finish than the other mats do and I think now we have the final verdict to see whether or not the matte trans lipsticks by Pat McGrath are overhyped or not okay guys that's it for today's video so what is my final verdict do I think that these are overhyped so I think that they're nice what do I think about this lipstick formula I think that they are actually not overhyped I think that they are absolutely beautiful they are definitely one of the nicest lipsticks I've ever worn ever the price point is definitely a little bit high but that's just honestly how it is when you come to high-end products you know like why sell lipsticks Tom for lipsticks they're expensive but they are nice quality just like how this one is this is $38 but the quality is so nice they're definitely not as mad as I thought they were going to be though that is like one thing I was kind of confused about I'm like this is much more Saten and creamy feeling then hey Matt lipstick does like even on my lips right now and that's with blotting on my hand once it still looks very very satin and does not look very matte to me not just my personal opinion I guess honest to god these are actually really worth it I'm shocked like I think that they're actually really really pretty really nice and definitely worth the hike so if you guys can I would definitely get your hands on them definitely more so the nude shades for sure the bright ones are really nice as well the dark ones I'm not a huge fan of they will probably like get all over your face to be quite honest because they are so creamy of course I'll leave these lipsticks down below if you guys are interested to check them out you guys thank you guys so much for watching as always have a great to the night or day wherever you guys are and I'll catch you guys in my next video bye you guys [Music] hey guys that welcome back to my channel hey guys that welcome back to my channel but if you guys do like this video please subscribe to my channel spit everywhere kidding I'm kidding [Music] another one with sequins [Music] 
hey guys welcome back to my channel so today's video is going to be a weird and fun one I just recently purchased this product this is from the brand 1/2 lash and they are magnetic lashes like literally they have a little magnet on it and you press it together and it becomes a full lash that's why I'm not wearing lashes right now I had done this makeup earlier and I had lashes on earlier but now they're off and that's why my lashes look a little fucked right now because it's a because they're low fun so I forgot the lashes and I really wanted to reviews because I've had this for a while and I completely forgot I had it and I'm like dude because it just looks so funny so different and so unique and honestly it was 70 fucking dollars for this private lashes and I was like you're kidding you're kidding go get into that more a little bit later on what I'm talking about the product a little bit more so yeah you guys that's what today's video is going to be it's going to be a review and demo using these little magnetic lashes and are they going to be worth it or not are they worth the price or not is it a hit or miss we will see in today's video but as always if you guys don't like this video if you guys do not like me please don't fucking watch it you know the drill with uh if you guys do like this video please subscribe to my channel if you're not already and if you're new what's up and ran emulate and welcome to my channel thank you so much for being here I seriously really really appreciate it from the bottom my heart I really do thank you for watching my videos yeah you guys let's go and get into this review on these little magnetic lash [Music] this is what the box looks buying it's a little powdery okay guys so let's quickly just read up on exactly what it is it's from the brand one two Cosmetics one to last sandwiches at your natural lashes between two ultra lightweight fiber strips to create a bold dramatic lash line in seconds and our unique patent-pending design makes lashes look long thick and luxurious while looking unbelievably natural this breakthrough solution works for people of all ages ethnicities and fits any eye shape experience the one to last revolution today so we'll see if it really works so this is the original lash and it is $69 as a five star review and 145 reviews my new it's on their website so you never really know how truthful that really is no messy glue ultra lightweight budge proof safe for everyday use comes in a case like this it's a really big like hefty a squeeze so this is what the lashes look like in the case where you guys literally just little lashes with a little magnet on it and it comes with two pairs of lashes per little bundle came with a little instruction booklet one whole top one to lash the one without the red dot oh my god sue me you guys in we're gonna try a position lash on top of your natural lash so the outside edges line up gray leave the top lash where it is and pick up the bottom lash without blinking place the bottom lash under your natural lashes so it meets and connects with the top lash magnet sounds honestly really simple so let's see if it's going to be as simple as it sounds you see that says without blinking it's kind of hard to do it I'm thinking uh grab the bottom and magnet them ah oh my god it totally just did it so quickly it freaked me out oh my god oh my god uh okay they're on my eye you guys even see them can I see that shit hmm but that's not on another pair cuz I feel like that is so little like you're kidding on the realest realest level I thought this was a straight-up joke like truly I thought of the joke because it seems so foolish I have two pairs of lashes on right here yes see okay why Libby was trying to move it and he literally came off so I'm still magnetised came off like it was nothing huh I will ask him off page Oh bitch I was gonna put on both pairs for both eyes but honestly after just doing one I know quite well how I feel about the lashes and so um yeah so on all my verdict guys I do not think that these lashes are worth that I think that they're way overpriced for the effect that you get the effect is definitely not anything special or anything crazy I still think that the lashes look very plasticky the you can feel the magnetic little band on your lash and it feels so weird it feels heavy it feels like a little magnetic lash it's super super weird and uncomfortable I think that the price is so ridiculous for the fact that you get one pair of lashes or two pair lashes it's honestly a highway robbery what they're what they're trying to ask for people to pay for these I think it's ridiculous and I think that you guys should definitely not fall for the fucking trick of magnetic lashes who knows maybe I was using it wrong but honestly I don't think you can it's literally just a little eyelash the reason I wanted to try them out it's cuz I honestly thought the idea was kind of cool and I was like dude maybe it'll give a girly cool fluffy effect maybe it'll stand straight up maybe it'll be something cool but it totally wasn't it was I was so let down because I actually had high hopes for it even though a skeptical I had high hopes for it but I'm like okay then I guess uh we're just kind of I guess we're just not gonna work great so um sadly just did not work for me at the end of the day it was a Miss for me completely and I would definitely not suggest purchasing these at all but of course it's your money you guys do what you want to do I just wanted to review them for you guys to see if you guys would be interested or not um behind guys I think that this is a flop and I say no-go not approved nod for battle but yeah you guys I hope you guys had fun watching a text video as always have a good night or day wherever you guys are and I will catch you guys in my next video bye you guys mwah pull powder pull out work oh they look hello genetic Omo on this love video God and out of the shitty lash goddamn bullshit lash that was a shitty ass fucking lash yeah and I definitely would not suggest perching these and I definitely would not suggest purchasing me I can't say that 
hey guys welcome back to my channel so today's video is going to be a quick get ready with me I'm going to be doing a quick date night get read with me I'm actually going on a date tonight and this is the routine that I do whenever I'm going on a date it's like a really quick easy routine cuz I don't going on a date I want to look really fresh and really natural I want to be pretty much unlockable like this is super random but in the gate world like wearing makeup is not seeing as something that's like so like cool and masculine like it's not really like that in the gay world yet I'm hoping it'll get there soon I'm praying so when I'm going on dates I don't ever really wore full glam when I'm doing a smokey eye or some crazy glitter I'm not doing that I'm just doing a really natural unlockable glam on this motherfucking mug so that'd be fun because I'm going on a date tonight and I actually go on dates pretty often not okay not that often you guys are thinking like oh my god man you're fucking Wow I'll do like once or twice a month and that's not that often brah going once twice a month I think it's a super fun it's just nice to meet new people I don't mind asking people unday - I don't mind getting asked on dates I'm just like why the fuck now and today's actually a special video because it is sponsored with h2o Beauty I'm gonna be using one of their products and this get ready with me h1 that you guys know that I'm sponsor with them but I absolutely love this fucking product so thank you to h2o I love this product so thank you for sponsoring me in today's video as always if you guys don't like this video if you guys do not like me please don't fucking watch it you know what you okay but you guys like this video please subscribe to my channel if you're not already and if we knew what's up I'm an emu and welcome to my channel thank you so much for being here I really appreciate it because going into this cute little date night get ready with me glam and let's do it okay guys so first thing is at first I'm going to hydrate my skin I like my skin to look really plump and fresh when I'm on a date and supple like I just look a lot better you know what I mean so I'm when you're taking the h2o Beauty hydrating a booster I absolutely love this so much as you guys can see this little beads inside this bad boy and these are filled with concentrated forms of vitamin A and vitamin E to deliver a long-lasting hydration throughout the entire day which I thought was really really really cool so what you do is you mix these with serums you mix it with moisturizers you mix it with your foundation you can mix it with anything if you want it to be more hydrating so what I'm gonna do I'm gonna take literally one to two little dollops of this one too I'm gonna take two drops I love it I just feel like it gives me like really fresh plump dewy looking skin in I just really I just really really like it I like to mix it with my SPF in the morning I will literally mix this two drops of this with my SPF every single day because I do not like the feeling of really intense SPF like sunscreen I hate it I literally hate it so what I'll do is I'll add the two jobs it makes the product glide it's so much easier than the keeps my skin hydrated today so yeah thank you so much to h2o beauty for partnering with me on this video absolutely guys this product so much and if I was you I would definitely definitely check it out get a sample of it if you guys can it's good so now that we are moisturizer down and complete what we're gonna do is we're gonna take a pore feeling primer I'm gonna be taking the benefits of pore fessional about that much and I can start it on the center of my skin and blend it outwards and I love using a pore filling primer when I'm going on a date because it's completely clear and invisible and you can't even see it but it makes the biggest difference in the world we're actually trying to have a nice looking skin I can literally tell in the mirror right now that my pores look smaller Neela what is X my next part of my routine is I take the tart shape tape concealer and I take literally the smallest amount ever I'm taking the shade light I do a little guy right there in the center and I head on now and I go on my date like this you guys this is a quick date night get ready this is not some type of like I'm gonna sit in front of them here for seven hours and get ready this is literally like quick and easy I'm gonna put this on my under eye what I like about the Tarte shape tip is our little products go such a long way and I'm just trying to make my icicle a bit more awake and what I like to do is I like to really concentrate to a lot of the concealer on the inner part of my eye because a lot of the darkness does hide there and I'll lure just blend it down just a small amount looks really really nice and it's pretty unclocked ball bitch that's on coal lockable I'm not trying to clock me also if you notice that you have any intense breakouts going on in your face I'll play a little bit of concealer right there just a spot conceal that's totally great too right now I'm not too bad I know I have like little nuggets along the way on my face but it's not too bad and I'm just kind of like you know so now for the part for my face what I like to do is I like to take v it's cosmetics CC cream and this is the full coverage cream SPF 50 I know it says full coverage and that sounds intense and you're like whoa Manny this is what to be natural I am what I like to do they'll take a little bit the smallest amount ever so now I'm gonna do them take the CC cream I'm just take a little small amount of animal put it on at this morphe and 439 any large kabuki brush will work great because what you want to do is really were just I blend it out so it's not detectable so I'm gonna do that I put on my cheeks Lulu time it might not be my color huh hmm it's all good we're gonna blend so we're gonna do is gonna put on the center of the cheeks and we're going to blend into the temples without giving too much coverage a little bit on the nose and I really love this it CC cream because it gives you a really lifelike appearance but covers up a little bit like it covers up enough but it doesn't make it look like you have any makeup on I don't know how they do it I don't know how they do it I'm like shook and as you can see it just gives you a little little a bit of coverage we have to use the smallest amount and blend it out really nicely with the kabuki it gives you like a really really even coverage on your skin it's not too intense I really really really like this so now what I'm going to do is I'm gonna set the under-eye specifically because most of the times skin has a more dewy skin like appearance it's not like match that's a little more like bitch or invoking making furniture so I'm gonna take a little bit of the RCM a no color powder because this is a great powder for people that are more dry and it's more of an undetectable powder and I'm taking on a brush now I'm gonna sponge no no fucking sponge because that is much more like oh you're fucking baking today huh so we're gonna do is I'm gonna set under eye from the backwards going in Jack no more sanding with this powder so as you guys can see right now the face is pretty natural-looking it's not too intense but you have a little bit of coverage you get a little bit of a nice complexion we're doing good fucking learn huh so now we're gonna go ahead and take a little bit of bronzer I'm talking like a smidgen a smidgen we're gonna take the Physicians Formula butter at bronzer we're just gonna do a little quick quickness mm-hmm or take a little bit on the cheeks huh just a little bit of mmm dimension as you guys can see on my skin too it doesn't look completely matte it definitely has a skin like appearance which I want to keep it out I don't want it to make it look too fucking Clocky so this is basically gonna keep my face out guys this is exactly what I how I keep my face I don't do too too too much past this now I'm gonna go and work on the brows what I do is I'll grab a tinted brow gel I do not grab like a brow pencil I won't grab like anything too intense I'll lay just got my tinted brow gel this is from anastacio I love her brow gel so fucking much I should use gorilla glue goddamn I'm gonna go and just run because it will give you a little bit of coverage in color and make your brows look a little fuller and thicker as you can see right there boom what I like about using a brow chose that once it dries down it looks super super natural and it looks like your brows are really really groomed and nice and they're just more full so now we're gonna do is I'm gonna curl up my lashes this is an important part of my date night process cuz bitch my lashes go straight down so much cuter with curl lashes yeah I just look away god damn fucking die on it pinch myself to just curl the lashes a little bit make them look a little bit lifted not so mmm what I'll do now is I'll take a mascara any mascara works I try to stick with brown mascara but I don't know where I put my last brow mascara so I'm just kinda like fuck it I'm gonna do is take this little mascara I'm gonna literally like press against my lower lashes I'm just giving my little some-something not to show that I'm wearing mascara but just so that my lower lashes aren't as neglected because I feel like they get neglected a lot you know now that I'm done with basically the faces all I can do I'll take a little bit like a colored cloth I'm talking like a smidgen this is a NYX gloss in the shade that tiramisu like a little like uh huh like four little dots does it give me a little bit of color a little bit of glossiness just of my lips like really plump and healthy let's see that dude you guys I'm getting some big tonight come on I'm just kidding I just wanted a look more plump and just more supple and more like look at your lips pretty and that's it you guys this is it for the entire date night get ready with me love this is why I like to keep my face I I don't like to overdo it I just wanna keep my face looking really really natural but yet corylus and as nice as I can possibly make it you know this is me really enhancing my natural features as they are I'm not really doing too

hey guys that welcome back to my channel no giggle today cuz my friends make fun of mine giggle in real life just kidding what's up you guys so I decided that I wanted to do a little intense PR unboxing out of the boxes right behind him to me grabbing behind me I was gonna do one on snapchat and I'm like wait I kind of orange do one on YouTube and just open up a bunch of things just because recently I saw a video from Tati here on YouTube I'm sure you guys are well aware of her she's absolutely amazing she's like the queen of everything really I guess but I'm she's super super cool and I saw her do some unboxings recently and I was actually really really intrigued and I was watching them so intensely and I'm like what are you getting so since I always do snapchat unboxings I thought I would take it to youtube and do a big PR unboxing just show you guys some of the random ass stuff that beauty influencers get or Beauty youtubers get it's pretty funny and sooo a random there's a lot of boxes there's a lot of papers a lot of noodles a lot of ribbon there's a lot of things going on so I thought we really fun to do this as always if you guys like this video if you guys don't like me please don't fucking watch it you know Joel thing and if you're new what's up a Manny MUA and welcome to my channel thank you so much for being here random side note I'm not wearing any makeup right now I'm not wearing primer no concealer and literally no nothing because I thought it would really really fun to turn this video it's gonna be a two-parter so I'm gonna do the unboxing right now unboxing a bunch of random boxes and then using those products I unboxed in my next video so basically I'm gonna try to upload tomorrow when you're watching this which I put tomorrow the next day and I'm gonna do the tutorial using all the products I literally just unboxed and see if they're good or not it's literally give me a first impressions of this unboxing that I just did so right after I'm done filming this unboxing I'm going to put the makeup on and film that as well I just I would be kind of fun to turn this into a little like two-parter make it a little different for you guys to see if you guys wanted to see that heaven whoo so now let's go ahead and get into this pyaare unboxing madness [Music] okay guys let's go and start this unboxing with this first box this was actually the biggest actual box that I had so I unboxed it downstairs because it was honestly too big I couldn't ring it upstairs I couldn't even fit it back here I was like this is crazy there better be some massive esting in here for there to be such a massive box and there wasn't so that kind of gets on your nerves right upside no I'm sure this also happens to other Beauty people in the industry when you get like this massive massive massive box with all this massive paper in it and you got a good product that's like that big and it's like dude you are seriously fucking with the environment so hard when you do that brands we ever watch this try to be more conscious of the environment and paper and usage of cardboard it sucks to see that much paper and stuff like that being used when the product is like this big and I only say that because I want to be more conscious of our ecological footprint and wanting it to be just lessened not using too much paper and things like that so I know that's random I know I never really talked about that but I try to be more conscious of using excessive amounts of paper cardboard and things like that when you don't have to so random sign out sorry tangent just try to save the world here so what I got is the Mac next to nothing foundation so what it looks like this is the cool packaging only have DNA and we have the little foundations oh I've heard about this that this is a very very very lightweight almost non-existent formula of foundation smells like Studio Fix things like to actually just watch the Laura's video on it recently and I'm like hmm this is not really what I'm gonna like because I'm a full-coverage kind of girl but we will see in the next video what I think about it so I'm gonna try this on and also came with the little

way shape or form this is what I do full-time this is my career I am a beauty youtuber full time so part of being a beauty youtuber is receiving a PR to talk about it for promotional purposes and I just want this video to look like I'm bragging in any way shape or form because I'm not this is just what I do for a living and I know sometimes it can look like really annoying like really he's

place of like literally just trying products out for you guys just see if you guys wanted to test them out or not it's like when you work at a plastic surgeon's office and you get free Botox you

hey guys welcome back to my channel so you guys say this video I am going to be doing a full face trying to follow someone's tutorial and have you guys see a title I'm gonna be trying to follow Jaclyn Hills tutorial the first person I watched do this video was actually Thomas Halbert here on YouTube he's another beauty boy on YouTube which is like so cool shoutouts to my Beauty boys ki followed a Jeffrey star tutorial and I was like oh my god this is such a fun idea and I loved it I feel like I've seen this capacitor on so so so much and I actually asked you guys on Twitter who you guys want to see me do a recreation of I'm not kidding you when I say the vast majority was Jacqueline Hill everyone was like dude Jacqueline Hill and I was like okay I'm like she's in beauty world now don't I need to do a little quick shout out to other people that people were suggesting I had someone do of course requesting me to do Laura Gaby and Nikita of course had somebody who asked me to do Jeffrey star at so many people asked me to do glam and gore Mikey here on YouTube as well nikkietutorials simply illogical etc except I had so many Jackie hyena but by far the most was Jacqueline O so I was like okay I'm gonna pick Jaclyn hill I'm also gonna link Thomas's Aboriginal video at down below so you guys didn't see exactly what I'm even talking about if you guys don't even know what kind of trend that's going on right now this is what it is as always you guys if you guys don't like this video if it's not like me please don't fucking watch it you know the drill with that but if you guys do like this video please go ahead subscribe to my channel if you're not already and if you're new what's up I'm Annie anyway welcome to my channel thank you so much for being here but yeah it's going to get into this trying to follow along and Jacqueline Hill tutorial [Music] why decided to pull up the Jacqueline Hill video where it's my radiant glow foundation routine because I do not do radiance foundation I don't do anything like this is not like my thing I am really really oily and she is more on the drier side so she's really into like glowy luminous perfect pretty like foundation and I'm really into like matte highlighting certain areas but really matte foundation and I set my whole face with powder translucent powder so I thought this would be a really really fun because it's something I do not do normally cuz I feel like a lot of the tutorials that Jaclyn does I do a lot of those kind of similar things too when it comes to like eye makeup and things like that you know how I used to watch Jacqueline back in the day so it's like one of the things was like dude I had to do Jacqueline - Jacqueline was literally like the first beauty blogger I swear I watched like I was obsessed Oh Jacqueline I'm not gonna lie I mean I live I live her and now of course but we're friends now and it's like a different like obsession obviously like I was a huge huge fan back in the day so I feel like it'll be really fun to do this it was kind of an ode to Jacqueline cuz she was one of the first blood tools okay I can't pin my hair back because obviously is what comes before you or even touch your makeup on your skin which is your skincare routine and your skincare that you my agree underneath but it's true you guys you guys really need to focus on the prep of the skin first Jacqueline I feel like is like the best at doing this she's so good at teaching why she doesn't think she does and that's kind of why I want to do this I'm gonna take the double Tintin she uses this a lot so I'm gonna try this out I don't know what she used today because she doesn't fucking family I personally exploit in my skin four days a week usually four times a week Oh bitch pretty well it keeps away the texture oh my god this is literally like Chucky's okay we're starting we're starting we're starting okay I have a better stick okay colors but this is not necessary for you guys to do at all it's just right now I am kind of a very strange in-between shade where I'm not really like perfectly matching any one color so I'm just kind of mixing a bunch of them but please don't try this at home I'm trying to this at home oh oh we're going with a white shade a bitch we need to pause you hold on okay Jacqueline went in with a really porcelain shade so I'm gonna go in to really porcelain shade and she did a cross on her forehead she did one right here damn - here she did one here right there with the lightest ones and the normal ones on the sides the foundation in the shade 21 this is a usually like my go-to shade unless I'm really fair than I am shade ten I'm gonna pump this on the back of my hand just a few dots right there never tried this before I'm gonna grab my damp Beauty sponge any Beauty sponge if you love the most will do you can use a Beauty Blender a lot of people have music bloggers - okay Beauty sponge mmm I have a Real Techniques one no more for you better let me pour a part and this routine for me is grabbing a luminous spray so I will you okay you're wealthy it's fine yeah well it's good right like this and get that nice and wet I love pumping - actually I love it flat side a sponge and just pressing and pouncing it into my skin it is the most satisfying feeling in the entire world I can do it for hours I've never thought I've never sprayed with something doing and then put it on my face never never I just love watching all that unevenness and all that redness and hyperpigmentation doesn't just appear before my eyelids I don't have any redness hyper - mutation I'm perfect I'm a model so I don't really know what Dr mean you know okay I've never used the duo forever foundation ever and the bitch looks pretty I thought was gonna be too late for me but it actually fits me pretty nicely okay guys I pause Jacqueline so I could finish up with the foundation but honestly the skin is looking real good I have mostly sparks all of them but most I don't have like me I have light neutral and then I have medium so I'm just like nothing you're really fucking putting us through it huh spray dead bitch wants to be real doing okay how did you put my chuckling you better hold on we've got more oh my word my eyes if you guys feel like concealer doesn't work for you Oh their plan the eyelids - oh shit wait we're pausing it we're pausing it she's going too quick she's moving too fast okay okay I get it though because I move pretty quick on my tutorials - so this is like such a normal thing for as like a beauty blogger dude because you don't want the actual videos to be too long because I feel like people have like a shorter attention span I'm gonna put it on my actual nose I'm gonna put it up here in the center I feel like this is something I will never stop doing highlighting the center of my face it just makes such a difference like a Sun like a Sun so much dimension and it just really gives you that like like sharp like Hollywood like Megan Fox look I live I live I might be too light for me like this is rough absolute you know so make sure you get in there with the pointy side my botox is like completely worn off of my forehead pretty much same same using on my face so it is time to move on to powder so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go in with these Charlotte Tilbury flawless finish airbrush powder and shade number two right here and I'm also going to be combining that with the Lancome absolute powder this is why you guys I do not have the Lancome powder that is something I do not have but I have basically almost everything else I'm gonna take that side the beauty sponge and just go right in and you can see how much it picks up right off the bat it picks up a generous amount and then that and I'm gonna begin just to press it into my skin very lightly because I don't want to make myself like matte as can be she looks like so gentle doing it it's literally like once again we are always padding and we are always kind of rolling and just mess oh my god I should not be using Shea - oh my hold on you guys where you think she'd one because I'm bigger now okay she'd one mm-hm I'm more pouncing lightly Japan are for it too right it's better for it to write I deposit like I'm taking off so much foundation doing this my tripping ok under eyes now okay we got the pad we got the shading light we had that here she uses this shade all the time I mean the bitch went in I went on here okay we're using the same yeah we're really Beautyblender get up okay hold on I'm not they're trying to that girl okay oh my goodness okay so we're setting it with the pinky under-eye powder Oh bitch this is definitely different than what I do like I could already tell like with the shape of my face like it's definitely different but that's it right we're just putting the pink powder underneath here it looks so bright though and I live actually living for the bright under eye right now like whoa she's a bright girl okay so I'm gonna go do my brows my eyeshadow Jacqueline are you kidding me you're not giving me your shadow is that what you're gonna end it you done pull the fucking pageant on this card you done pulled the bad you guys okay I'll be right back I'm gonna go do my brows in my eyes on her camera and I'll be right back okay we are now the eyes are done you guys the faces on the lips are on okay so I do not have this Lancome powder so I pulled my lemare powder because I'm like Jacqueline I have something linear you too but anyway you guys the Lancome powder actually is like has like a luminous finish this is obviously not the same guys it's not gonna have the same effect as Jaclyn's i press it in the more kind of melt into my skin and doesn't give that white cast it just becomes a beautiful radiant powder like oh bitch that's like a glowing powder on her Oh mine's definitely any more luminous - Oh sick I don't have the Stockholm one but fuck Zilla Maryland's pretty good and it wasn't me that dreads warming in bug if I would have known okay so we put delamare all over the skin the lemare powder has a glowy finish twitch I feel like this is gonna quote be the closest thing I get to jock lens without it being a highlighter so this is a cool one title we got it's matte but it's like glowy Matt fuck what if I do like some type of like what if I get this powder and I mix it oh my god with a glow powder my crazy okay so I'm gonna go ahead and mix a little bit of this Kylie Jenner Fiji glow powder this really might be a really bad idea we'll see I mean mix a little bit of this powder this glow powder with a little bit of the lemare glow powder to try to see if we can get that effect that Jacqueline has on her skin the literally just looks like a luminous sitting primer right well that's good pretty glowy let's try it oh my gosh this might be really better dear mm-hmm oh it's good Oh bitch it's giving me something this is looking someone to my Jacqueline's so much more mixing it with translucent powder oh dude yes Jacqueline wanted to glow all over the face so that's we're gonna do okay so what we got you guys so this is definitely much more like what Jacqueline's looks like it has like a globe to the skin but it's not obvious a highlighter it's just like a glowy all over the face glow okay you guys so I do not have give me Sun bronzer but I do have medium golden mineralized skinfinish from Mac and I actually it's like the same thing they're both mineralized skinfinish Azure go ahead and use this as our bronzer a lot of people kind of gave up blush in 2017 but no they didn't I love a good blush life to the face and it's so necessary for me okay we got some bronzer on us get some blush we're gonna get some bluish a blushing bride nothing ham okay we're blushed we're bronzed and now we're gonna take some highlighter I do not have that NAR spot that Jaclyn has so what we're gonna do instead fuck I don't know we're gonna get another highlighter that we do have what we're gonna do with the method that Jacqueline suggests to do it so we're gonna go ahead and take a highlighter but we're gonna take it beyond I'm really honest hacia highlighter take the same sponge how do we do this how do we do it to just dab that and oh my god that's skips if you want to smooth this highlight the world use your beauty sponge to apply it it makes such a difference like a long time ago I used to apply my highlight and then afterwards I would go over and kind of got it with a sponge but actually initially going in and applying it with a sponge it's just like a game-changer Oh bitch applying with a sponge is kind of everything holy shit spray it makes your face super super glowy so if you are oily you'll probably hate this cuz it's kind of like oil in a bottle it just makes you look you have like that fresh glisten like you just got done running on the beach I don't know I'm obsessed with it but I love to look like wet and sweaty the truth oh my god I am glowing police okay you're using a settings favorite Jacqueline will take Tata we'll take touch I don't have that how you really been that betray no girl she's wearing gloss I'm gonna put a gloss on okay y'all so we completed the look this is a falling Jacqueline's glowy skin from within makeup LA and I definitely will agree 1,000% that I've never been this glowy in my entire life when it comes to my routine look at my fucking forehead there's pebbles of glow and I've never had that before but it looks beautiful actually doesn't really really really pretty I think this is a little too much I'm not gonna lie this might be a bit much let's go ahead and Pat that down much much better okay much better oh my god so this is it guys this is it for reals like if I'm not doing from within bitch I'm doing from without okay bitch we are done with this video we are done with this tutorial what do you all think I think actually looks really pretty actually really really do there's a lot of steps we had to do we had a lot of mixing a lot of shit we got a Dubonnet say I think it turned out really really really good I had so much fun doing this video I think it looks beautiful the skin looks really really nice well I do this ever again no I will not because I am more on the oily side this is just something that I really want to try out for fun because I was following Jacqueline's video this was fight off my face in about an hour maybe two hours if I'm lucky this would like not be here because there's literally like I said it was like little

hey guys that welcome back to my channel so today's video is going to be a favourites and disappointments video I have not done one of these and they  Minaj I'm in minute not threesome I love favorites and disappoint his videos I love watching them I also don't see a lot of other Beauty youtubers doing favorites and disappointments anymore and it just makes me sad because like I love watching them I don't know maybe they're just not as popular anymore maybe they just don't get the music they used to and random sight know a lot of people like to go and rag on YouTube for talking about views but honestly when it is your full-time jobs views is kind of important you know it really really is like that is like part of your income I know a lot of people will try to like send me like oh it shouldn't matter how many of you guys just took mission mad about the content and of course it's just the content should matter but views for a full-time beauty youtuber or an a youtuber in general views do matter to keep up with your life you know what I mean like that is your full-time job just saying so I do understand if people don't want to do this video these kind of videos anymore because they aren't as popular as they once were I'm trying to do them at least a couple times every so often you automate I really wanted to do one for this month of November November was amazing if flu bi were already in December right now I love the holiday season I love a holiday time I love when like holiday stuff comes out there's so much makeup that's out during the holidays I'm rambling let me stop a favorites video and display this video that's what tasty I was going to be as always if you guys don't like this video if you guys don't like me please don't  watch I cannot drill with that what do you guys do like this video please go ahead and subscribe to my channel if you're not already and if you're new what's up a man um you a and welcome to my channel thank you so much for being here I really really really really appreciate it yeah it's going to get into this favorites and disappointment video of [Music] look you guys first things first first favorite of this month is this I got tatted you guys I got tatted again this is my tie right here this was done by Evan tattoo in New York I was there recently and I got this tattoo and it just is so cool Navy I love Evan he's absolutely amazing he is such an amazing tattoo artist and I love his dainty detailed work on the tat I just want to talk about real quickly because that is my number one favorite of the entire month I love it I feel like I have a tattoo bug this one is covered up right now because I had to get it retouched and because it was like coming off on the finger apparently like it's like hard to keep a tattoo on the finger but this bitch hurt like a  the second time getting a tree tattoo hurts so much more than getting a tattoo I don't know why she was making me like I was twitching for moments of this one okay guys anyway so it's going it started outside video first one I wanted to talk about this really quickly cuz this I have been going through like crazy over the past couple months this is from freshness of these fresh sugar lip caramel hydrating balm I'm gonna show you the obsession is  real so fresh is actually really expensive it's a it's Brandon sin Sephora to skincare brand and they're like lip balms are so good I love them so much but they're usually pretty expensive they're like 25 bucks I think actually don't really know exactly how much they cost but this guy is like 20 bucks and it lasts such a good amount of time and it's so great it's such a hydrating balm and it literally tastes and smells like caramel if you're like a fan of caramel you will love this you will love it because it is that so soothing so hydrating it just feels so good on the lips I just want to bring it up because I have been going through this like a madman look at that look at that I love it so so so much so you guys are looking for a really good high-end lip balm that's not gonna break the bank this was twenty bucks I mean that's a lot but something that's good good quality I would definitely check out the fresh lip caramel it's on rau it's on Ram next we're gonna talk about is this this is the Bobbi Brown vitamin enriched face base actually purchases because of a Jeffrey he was a huge huge fan of this and I bought it back in the day and I had never really tried it and then I started getting on Bobby Brown's PR list and they sent me another one and I was like ok I'm gonna try it out Jeffrey loved it and I never really like give it a chance I've been using this for the past month non-stop and honestly I've noticed a major difference in the way my makeup looks throughout the day so this is great because it as if it's a moisturizer but it also acts as a primer as well it really just makes my skin look so much prettier with it on like literally like my fine lines out of you guys and see like I usually have fine lines gnarly like right here right I'm wearing this today sigh no but my fine lines don't peek through as much of weighing this I don't know why I think it's is just so hydrated and the skin foundation lays better everything about it makes my skin look so much better this is a pricier price point it really is don't get me wrong our deadlines are just going to support and getting it maybe a little sample and a little sample cup instead of buying it right away but truly I've noticed a huge difference with this it's great for all skin types I'll check out the Bobbi Brown enriched skin base because me in the ass if you guys know where that shows from if you know where that's from we are  soul mate Nexus go and talk about an eyeshadow really quickly that I have been wearing now i some and actually this came out really recently like within this actual month of November and I've worn it a couple times this is the Stila these are new these are new the new shimmer and glow shadows so you guys already know I'm a huge fan of the glittering glow shadows they're amazing I'm obsessed but not everyone wants glitter all the time you know I'm saying they just came out with these shimmer and glow shadows that act the exact same way I was scared that they were gonna like dry differently or they were gonna crack on me or anything like I was just kind of nervous I was like please don't with the formula like please steal you kill it but these are spectacular key honestly look at this bitch I'm sorry you guys these shadows are stunning I'm sorry they're literally like some of the most beautiful shadows I was so shocked I'm like oh you guys came up with the glitter and you come out with the shimmers y'all really trying to  destroy the game huh also I talked about this in my holiday haul force' for this is something I said that I would suggest this Stila set comes with glitter and glow shadows and shimmering glow shadows so if you guys wanted to get a cute little deal this guy I believe was like 30 something dollars for six so I thought that was really really good deal I'm very happy this is in the shade kitten I've been wearing a lot I talk about a palette that I've been loving all month long I mean it's not like I've used it like three or four times but that's a lot for me in like the makeup world that's a lot for me that's a lot for me though what I'm getting like a new makeup in the mail and also buying a new makeup like when I'm using something constantly consistently all the time like three or four times in a month that's what I know I'm like oh I liked you I liked you so the palette i'm talking about is this palette by kylie jenner this is the nice palette it's gotten a little beat up not gonna lie it's got a little hit it's just so good this color scheme guys look at her it's just beautiful I don't I really don't know what to say other than the fact that I love these colors I love the way that these shadows blend I love the way they look on the eye everything about it truly I'm so pleased with it and apparently a lot of people did like a review on the kylie jenner holiday kit right and the whole holiday set and a lot of people reviewed this palette didn't I shot a look with it and used Blizzard on the lid I had no clue how people were like commenting like why'd you have to use blizzard everyone use blizzard I'm like bitch and I didn't know I just like that color and so I used it me and Laura apparently did the same look had no idea I'm really happy with it and it's $44 it is of course a higher price point but it's great quality and I do think that Kylie cosmetics really killed you with this one let's talk about what my highlighter really quickly that these are actually brand new these are from colour-pop these are the luster dust as you guys know I feel like a lot of brands are coming up with these kind of shimmery dusts like highlighters under shimmery I feel like artist Couture was one of the first brands that I really had them going like they made them a little bit more popular I just want to talk about this really quickly because they aren't incredible they are incredible this isn't shade know me it's in the shade know me so this is it right here I'm wearing it on my cheeks right now cheeks they're on my cheeks and it's just such a beautiful finely milled dust have you liked it that Kylie Jenner one that like that those little dust in the jar this is literally exactly the literally exactly the same but a fraction of the cost like no shade - Kylie head off because I just talked to me I just talked about a product I love it I think they're  amazing I think that they did an amazing job I use like a really packy brush to put them on and then PI so good I literally feel like I'm beaming from  space on my yo-you the astronaut over there eh I don't know I just think that they're credible I really do I really do you guys and the last product of the month in the favorite section is this guy right here this is honesty I talked about it really quickly because it's so  so I think and I'm so proud of Laura for doing this so Laura Lee and Claire pop Cosmetics created a collaboration together and all the proceeds from this collaboration go to no kill la a which is an animal shelter here in Los Angeles Laura gets no proceeds ramp does not get any proceeds as well they literally are donating full proceeds to no killer lady do it every single year and I'd want to talk about it really quickly because I just think it's such an amazing amazing thing she came out with three little products with color pop and she came out with a eyeshadow quad with clip off as well for me personally my favorites is the gloss the ultra glossy lip in the shade Wham I'm just gonna swatch a little bit on it because it's literally like the prettiest glossiest wet looking gloss it's right here it's just like a wet gloss like it's a wet shimmery clear gloss with beautiful like finely milled to glitter in it it's stunning oh my gosh the quad is so perfect it's so beautiful like Laura really did that Laura Lee Laura did that Lee bitch okay I'm gonna go ahead and swatch the quad on my hand right I'm gonna swatch the quality we worse watching right now glicks we have a glitz on the hand so we're gonna switch swatch Ritz which is a glitter right there a clear glitter with next hiney Laura is like hilarious with me the up and we have hiney right here and it's really pretty rose gold last but not least we have shiny which is a more like a set it's like a satiny brown satin brown shade right there these are the four shades that it comes with the quad it's a beautiful quad it's goes to an amazing I'm using comes the quality is incredible and before people come at me and me like Laura's your best friend you're only talking about it because she's your best friend no I'm talking about it because it's an amazing cause Laura doesn't even get any proceeds from it and I'm gonna just mean that much to her and it's just amazing to me I really makes me really really happy to see people doing good things you know I mean good things with their platforms so a color pop and Laura you guys killed it with that club and I think you guys are amazing okay first things first first disappointment of the month is this guys I don't you guys saw my video I posted a little while back this is the Pat McGrath palette these is the mothership palette the mattes of this palette were incredible they really were but honestly my issue was that it was a hundred and twenty five dollars for ten my shadows and that was such a problem for me I couldn't even believe that I bought this  ballot like I was shocked and some of the shades here they're really flaky I had a lot of Fallout on my face I was like how the am I gonna use like how do I use this and get my money's worth because it was not cooperating at all how so think there's no transition sheet in here whatsoever it's like shimmers over here and then to Matt's and then you have this metallic and doing chrome chains over there I did understand the pallets I didn't get them at all I was a little pissed not going so that is my first disappointment of the month and my second is women of the month not just this it's the whole collection Maybelline and Gigi Hadid collaborated and they came out with this entire amazing collection that had like so many SKUs and it was a crazy amount of product and the reason it's in my disappointment is another price point thing their palette that came out was like $35 and it's Maybelline and I think the reason that I pissed me off because the thing is the quality of all the products were great the quality was actually really really really nice I was watching them and I was like oh my word like most of the things were incredible but I couldn't believe that they hiked up the price point so much more because I had G's name on it I all know it was like I don't know it just didn't make any sense a $35 palette from the drugstore I didn't understand it and I don't think hitting the items should have been priced out what they were I think like the some ellipses for like 12 or 13 bucks when they're usually six or seven or eight a lot of people I'm sure did not buy it because of the fact that it was a lot it was a lot more expensive than the usual Maybelline products was I was disappointed in the fact that was priced so high and I love Liebling I worked at Maybelline before and I think they have beautiful beautiful drugstore products but at the end of the day they are drugstore brand and I wish that the price point stayed more at a drugstore more affordable price point and that is that you guys that's it for my entire favourites and disappointments video of this month I hope you guys had fun watching I really do love doing these videos and if you guys if you guys don't like them just let me know like I do not have to make these videos what's

they just came out with these shimmer and glow shadows that act the exact same way honor the eye as the glitter ones do like I was scared that I was gonna this is exactly this is exactly okay guys and last a favorite of the month are or is this right here  Sam sorry mom you should've been there and that is it you guys that's it for my entire video today talking about these favorites and disappointments of kidding I need to have this one can make up the study that is over all of it is burnt it's a  you guys think I look crazy but look at the bottle eternal snatched for and I don't know why I don't know why it is like that buddy a yeah 
hey guys that welcome back to my channel so today's video I have been asked okay I've learned I don't think I've ever been asked more to do ever if you want something in my entire existence in my entire visa total las vidas on youtube mmm that's not right I don't know I just had hard to be really honest all the lives of YouTube I don't know anyway guys I am going to be reviewing today the new Tarte double duty Beauty shaped ape foundation this is what it looks like this is the PR package it came in I already soaked the Beauty Blender that's why it's out of here we have two formulas we have the hydrating and we have the matched this is obviously not all the shades this is the PR package that he sent me but before I get started on today's video I wanted to bring up a thing real quick let's talk about the elephant of the room with this this has been under so much controversy and so much hype because of the fact that the shade range is so little I believe is only 15 shades and the majority of them are lighter complexion shades and there's not enough for deeper complexion shades and I completely agree with you guys 1,000% I think you are definitely should have launched more deeper complexion shades I think only 15 shades is definitely definitely not enough when you're a brand like Tarte people just expect a lot from you it just it is what it is Hart honestly you guys should have known better and hopefully you actually coming out with more shades in the future and they're coming quickly because I do think that it's unfair for I can't imagine being someone with a darker complexion seeing and really wanting to try this foundation out and not having a shade for me because of the fact that they didn't come out with enough shades and they only cater to Landor complexions I just think it's unfair and yes it's not a struggle I might face and I don't I don't face that kind of struggle I don't really know how it feels to have a darker complexion and to not be able to use a foundation shade because they don't have my shade and I don't get that struggle but I do a nice the fact that I am privileged in the fact that I do get a have my find a shade in the Sun you should and I wanted to use that privilege to at least talk about the fact that I think that there should have been more shades it's not fair do you recognize the fact that I am lighter complexion and it is easier for me to find my shade and it sucks that that's like that in the beauty industry and I feel like more brands needing to cater to a variety of shades into a variety of genders and just I'm all for equality you know at the end of the day I'm for equality that's not going to change my opinion on what I think about the actual foundation at the end of the day this is a foundation review on that core quality of this foundation I just wanted to say that and have my with the fact that I'm like yo I think that needs to be more shades is is ridiculous that there's not enough but I do half my face with the glowy one and half the face with the matte one I think that'd be like the most fair shot I can do with this one nation I'm gonna wear it for next couple of hours and see what we think about the foundation so anyways you guys have to take video is going to be as always if you guys don't like this video if you guys do not like me please don't watch it you know the drill with that what do you guys do like the video please go ahead subscribe to my channel if you're not already and if you know what's up I'm an emu a and welcome to my channel thank you so much for being here I really appreciate it yeah that's gonna get into this heart shape tape foundation review and demo and let's see if it's worth the hype enough okay so what do we have here we have a hydrating foundation and we have a mattifying foundation I'm so sorry about this let's go ahead and go on the Tarte website let's go and read the facts about these foundations specifically okay guys so let's go ahead and read about the mat one first which is one I'm a little bit more interesting because I have oily or skin it is a vegan oil free full coverage foundation with a creamy texture and modern matte finish it provides a the same full coverage as its concealer predecessor it dries to a flawless matte finish concealer inspired wan formula absorbs oil and shine I'm gonna try the shade light/medium neutral and see what we think oh let's prime my skin I want to give this bitch a fair shot this is exactly gonna I'm gonna do the same routine that I usually do on my face I'm taking the Tarte little beauty sponge that I came with we're gonna use it this is actually kind of a harder sponge but it's soft it seems time this reminds me a lot of my cult classic cake and baked sponge from Vera Mona that's what it feels like it's like hard but it's like very dense but it's soft at the same time I'm gonna Bobbi Brown taking Bobbi or take a smidgen of professional I benefit with on the t-zone cool we are primed and we are ready to go we're gonna go in we're gonna go in with the matte foundation first one takes is shaped like the immature like we said earlier we got a huge asset doe up here this reminds me a lot this honestly could be like the same as the Clinique the beyond perfect foundation I think it's called has like that huge ass toe applicator looks like this it's very very similar that should match we're gonna do a good couple dots bitch okay okay as we're applying it it's pretty thick this is the lightest shade they gave me and it's still a little dark for me so we're just gonna kind of go literally that's one that's one that's one no foot that's just one okay so as we see a little yellow okay we're gonna blend this in with the sponge that they came wait let me see the coverage it's full it just is the coverage is there was a drying pretty quick oh it is too dark for me way too dark for me okay it's fine okay so it sets in pretty quickly you guys so you definitely want to use I mean usually with matte foundations they set pretty fast so this is half the face with the matte foundation that's going to get closer I don't you think the one with a bit more to be really real I think that using it with a sponge of course is going to sheer it out a little bit let's go ahead and take a little bit more also I noticed that it seems to oxidize it's getting a little bit darker like as you see application wise it's a little bit of a lighter consistency or it's a little bit lighter of a color but when I'm blended out and it's drying it definitely dries down to a darker finished it's a little bit deeper for sure I'm just noticing the oxidation but honestly look how pretty it looks on the skin I would definitely apply this with a sponge instead of a brush I think a brush would make it look like we ignore the fact that it's not my shade sometimes I won't get the right shade it's fine happens consistency was really nice it was very more so on the thick whipped side it's not too liquidy of course it's much more than a thicker consistency I'd ride down math really really fast like the set was quick so let's go and go in with the light medium honey in the hydrating one that's going to read about the hydrating shade though by the way you guys both of these are $39 okay this is a hypoallergenic luminous finish gel foundation featuring the same iconic buildable full coverage same as shape tape concealer padded boots of skin smoothing oil-free hydration same full coverage I supposed to be a weightless gel formulation anna has a hyaluronic acid in it which means of course hyaluronic acid adds moisture to the skin throughout the day so I'm imagining it okay its oxidizing this bitch is oxidizing hard if you guys soaked are did not send me the same shade or the hydrating foundation I don't know if they have the same shade oh bitch I'm sorry for worried about it look like right now if we're going to use light medium stand so these are the shades these are the two closest to each other so I'm not to use those these undertones are a little bit in I'm not you have to go online and buy my crutch shape because these are not what I expected shade wise look Oh dark disk on the oxides like a mofo anyway that annoys me like that really gets on my nerves oxidation anyway we're gonna go and try it be luminous side now I want to take this and I can definitely tell already that's a consistency on this side is definitely very different it's not as thick it's definitely more like a like they were saying a gel-like consistency so I guess technically it's a little bit thinner in consistency H these undertones I don't really know all that I don't know all this okay we're going to blend it in with the same sponge we're gonna see what we think of the coverage and the feeling of this one as I'm blending in this one definitely feels more lightweight of course wasn't feels nicer to me actually think this side might be a little bit too matte for me like now that I'm looking at it once it's actually set bitch that is like so mad like I don't even need to use powder to set this side like that's how intense it is this side I would definitely say as we're looking at it still gives you a nice medium to full coverage I wouldn't say this is as full coverage as the matte side to me it really doesn't look like that it definitely gives me more of a skin like I can still see like my little pimple going on right here I can still see some red spots around here but upon another layer just like I did with the other side I can clearly see a difference in color obviously so we're gonna do a little bit more but you guys see how it like blends into a different color than it applies I don't really get that I would say this one you can definitely apply it with like a like kabuki style brush one like this and it will not look as heavy as the matte side would have with that kind of brush see how well it does uncovering of my discoloration on my neck because I have discoloration down here I think that's to do with my vitiligo I don't really know but knowing this applies really makes me what this kind of brush to okay as we can see this side mattes this side definitely has skin like texture it's very hydrating looking and it definitely gives me a sheen to the skin I'll actually have to set this side to last on me for sure so at least you can see there is a very harsh real difference between both sides of the skin this is definitely definitely luminous glowy more with skin like finish this is mattes I actually really do enjoy the luminous side a lot more I'm gonna go and set both sides of the face just so I can set them and see what we actually think we take a little bit of the protective concealer already in the tart shaped tape world right now let's take the shade light and see how it acts with the Fang I feel like Donald Trump on this side honestly it looks too orange and the light under-eye pitch really ug light works for me but because of the fund you should shade is so dark on my skin right now it's really contrasting quite intensely okay actually at least with the concealer I feel like my face doesn't look so like up because of how much of a contrast the shade is like it's just it's rough I'm not living as hard as I thought I was in me I really thought I was gonna live like a different heart-shaped ape like I really dead we're gonna be a hard living like living breathing gasping for air but so far the side with the luminous finish I like so much more okay guys we're gonna go ahead and set the face see what we think and we're going to let we're gonna wear this for a couple hours I'm gonna do my makeup for real I'm gonna set my face I'm gonna give it a real fair shot like I'd do any other foundation I'm gonna put powder on both sides so you only think and we're gonna come back with the final verdict seeing whether or not the foundation is a hit or miss we're gonna do some powder on this we're gonna put we're gonna powder both sides I always powder my foundation so I'm gonna powder even the side and that is matte no powder right to give it a fair shot okay let's go and look at it now that we are set in place I feel like the matte side is a little bit too heavy looking it feels actually kind of heavy on the skin this side I really enjoy this side a little too heavy and I don't know if it's me being distracted as by the color cuz I'm obviously very distracted by the fact that the color difference is whoa I'm gonna go ahead and do the rest of my makeup now and wait in a couple hours and see what we think of both sides which side got a bit more oily and we will get back to you so it's been about I finished everything else and I eat so it's been about an hour and a half maybe two hours since I first put on the foundation so I already have a little bit of a verdict here so this is the side of course this is the matte side I sprayed it with Urban Decay all nighter by the way when I finished everything when I finished everything I sprayed with Urban Decay all nighter just to melt our being together the foundation is still looking very pretty honestly like I think this side this iron this side is the side with the luminous more lightweight coverage the matte side with everything said and done I actually do like it a lot I was at first I was kind of like I really wasn't like living for the mattes I don't know why I was living more for the luminous side I just feel like goes more buildable of coverage was a little bit lighter in coverage and it just looked prettier on my skin to me also on my eyes if a guys are curious about the shadows I use I'm using the morphe 25g palette there's morning if I have a grande glam huge ass pans on this bitch you guys wanna check it out it's really really cool I love the color scheme of it you can use code mani MUA in store online if you want to check it out you'd save some coin you don't have to of course if you don't want to it's all good I just want to let you guys know that has what I'm wearing on my eyes as well as some Urban Decay heavy metal liner okay so anyway I'm gonna go and wait a couple more hours and see how the foundation is settling into the skin right now I feel like it's at a perfect point two hours in I feel like it looks really really really pretty and I'm really happy with it I think it looks nice I don't really have too many complaints other than another color and undertone it's not my favorite thing I don't really really like the undertone and color of them but anyway I can definitely tell this side is still more luminous than this side this side is staying a lot more matte this site is definitely more skin like ignore the highlighter as its settling into the skin I think it's looking a lot more pretty so this is the skin as close as I can really go so we have the pores on the skin it's not they're not too emphasized which I really really like this is the matte side there's no like major creasing on my smile lines which is a big deal to me not too oily so we have this sign and we can see the pores definitely still are there there's definitely pores areas then the matte type zone the matte side is better at concealing the pores then the site is but I just still feel like my skin looks prettier on the side regardless of like the poor showing or not I'm not mad at it right now like I'm not mad at it but we'll see how I feel in the next couple hours so I will be back what is up you guys okay guys so I've had my makeup on for about six hours and now it is on I think I basically just have the verdict I think I know how I think about the foundation now I don't need to have it on for any longer for me to know how I feel about it so right now this is after about 6 hours of where it's about 6 o'clock and I handed and I started putting makeup on at 12:00 so still looks pretty mad I see some oil speaking through here oils peeking through around my chin a little bit more here right here as well as definitely well speaking through in the t-zone the Dewey one is looking real duty at this point you know the the hydrating one is looking real hydrated the skin is looking hydrated besides looking more matte it is what it is it's the claim is correct miss mama so you guys I forgot to mention earlier that part of the new shape tape range we also have this sponge I did of course usually it came with like PR package and this brushes well they're both part of the shape tape collection both of them I believe retail for $28 in case you guys are interested in that I really liked it the sponge wasn't the biggest fan of this brush I'm not a huge fan of these brushes anyway to be honest unless it's for powder I think powder application with this is really good applying this fine foundation whether it's the Mac or it's the hydrating one is better off with a sponge but all know what do I think about it so the matte side this is the mad scientist really pretty and honestly I would buy both of them they are both approved for me I really do like them on the face right now I still feel like they look really beautiful on the skin to be honest though first impressions you guys saw earlier I wasn't living you know I feel like for the color selection the color selection was bad not only was the color selection bad but the undertones were just not good and these are obviously not my color I cannot wear these again I don't have to go and get my correct color and it is frustrating that the undertones are so strong in these foundations because it's just kind of like can I just have one like that's more in the most neutral like a neutral one not the one that's too peach not one that's too yellow as we all know the arrangement of colors in general is not the best when it comes to light and deep complexions there's not enough for deep complexions but this our nation is a $39 I think that's a really fair price point it's not too too too expensive but it's not very cheap either and you get one point zero one fluid ounce in here which is pretty average for a foundation and I think the cost of this being $39 is actually pretty fair overall this time I think the matte one actually played better on my skin what's your shopping because that's what I didn't like at all first going on the hydrating one looks beautiful too and I really really really enjoy it I just wish I had a little bit more coverage because I had to build that one up a lot more and the thing is too with the matte one for me the reason that it I feel like it worked out in the end is because I do have natural oils that will seep through because I'm more on the oily side so if you're not really at all and even yeah if you're dry then I really think that you're gonna hate the dry the matte one because I think that the reason that even looks pretty now or that's actually some Mex mixing in with the skin nicely is due to the fact that my oils are sleeping through like honestly just go with the hydrating one it is hydrating it's beautiful on the skin yeah that's my thoughts those are my opinions I think welcome end up turning out really pretty both of them are a hit for me so I hope you guys enjoyed today's video all-in-all I use them again if I get my right color down I might use the hydrating one again but I don't know it's still not my favorite foundation ever I still like the concealer more than the foundations and that is it you guys hope you guys enjoyed today's video I'll leave a link down below where you guys to check these foundations out I believe they are available on tarts website my shelter available Ulta just yet hope you guys had fun watching have a gist of the night or day group you guys are and I'll catch you guys in my next video bye guys I love you what looks slightly a message just woke up had a meeting this morning came straight home filming great just what I wanted to do on a Tuesday matter I looked a little

god what happened to it why is being held so calmly don't let me go I'm sneezing a fly or something he's so cute sponge instead of a brush I think a brush would make it look like ah me I these undertones are rough like they're really rough I'm sorry but they are okay so now that we're set in place guys what do we think of this I'm gonna clean it up coke horse you know what I hate you so bad oh my gosh I want to eat you 
Hey guys, welcome back to my channel. So, today's video is going to be part two
of my PR Unboxing video. If you guys are watching this, I'm assuming
you guys watched the video previously. I literally just did a huge PR Inboxing. I inboxed all of these different things, and I wanted to make it a part two,
and try on the parts right away. I literally just filmed that video, right now. So, I literally just have a bunch
of products here, and I want to just try it on right away,
see what my first reactions are; if they are good, if they're not good. I just think that First Impressions
video are so fun to create, and it's like, you can't hide
if you like it or not, you know what I mean?
Like, I just like- And I love that. I love that you can just be like, "Hm-hm-hm." So, I'm gonna try to incorporate as much
as I possibly can from them new stuff, and yeah, that's what today's
video is going to be. I hope you guys enjoy it. As always, if you guys don't like this video, or if you guys don't like me,
please don't fucking watch, you know the drill with fucking that. But if you guys like this video, please subscribe to my channel
if you are not already, and hit that little bell button
to notify you when I upload. Are you hitting it? Are you hitting it? Hit it. So, let's go and get into this First Impressions
using the PR Inboxing stuff. Okay, so, first things first,
we're gonna prime. We're going to prime,
and I did unbox a primer. We are going to use the SA Edit
Pore Vanishing Moisturizer, Matte Hydrator, and Prime. This is supposed to- Controls oil, blurs pores, hydrates, and primes. So, bold statement, SA, bold statement. Feels- Feels thick. Oh my God, there's perfume.
That's different, and you don't expect that. It does feel hydrating on the skin, which is cool. Okay, First Impressions: I don't feel like it blurred my skin whatsoever,
but it does feel moisturizing, and it does feel like my face is primed
with this product on it to help it [inaudible] different foundations. So, I do feel like it's a primer, but do I feel like it blurred out my
pores in any way, shape, or form. Not at all. Not at all. Okay, next thing we're gonna
try out is a foundation. I'm so excited I got a foundation to try. So, this is the MAC Next
to Nothing Face Color. This is one of their newest foundations
that they came out with, and it's supposed to be a very,
very, very lightweight, almost non-existent amount
of color and coverage. That's really not my M-O guys. Oh, it's very- it's liquidy. Woah, woah, woah.
Woah, woah, woah. I'm very much into coverage. So, I don't know how I'm gonna like this. I can always just add coverage
on top, it doesn't really matter. But, this is in the shade "Light Plus". I don't really what my shade is,
but I'm ass- like, hopefully, that's my shade. It's "Light Plus",
come on, I'm fucking pale. So, I'm gonna take it on a Y6- oh, it feels very- on the brush it feels way thicker,
when I did this. We're just gonna blend into the skin. Oh my God, that smells like Studio Effects. We're about at half of the face;
we can see a difference between the other half. Okay, looking at the V Finder,
I can definitely tell that this side of my cheeks does have foundation on. It's a very, very sheer, natural foundation. I'm actually not hating it as much
as I thought I was going to. Swear on my life, I thought I was gonna
fucking hate it, and I'm like "Oh, this is so stupid.
Why am I even doing this?" But honestly, like I'm not even mad at it. So, this is super, super natural,
and very, very lightweight. I would wear this to like,
the beach or the pool. Not that I ever wore makeup
to the beach or the pool. I'm just saying- I don't know
where I would wear this. But, it actually looks very pretty on the skin, like, for a natural no makeup kind of day. I will be adding more coverage, though. I will be adding more. Also, it's oxidizing. Not surprised, a lot of MAC Foundations oxidize on me. Okay guys, so, this is with
the foundation on, and... More foundation. So, since the coverage is not
exactly what I want it to be, I'm going to add a little bit of the
Wet'N'Wild Photo Focus Foundation, which I tried in my Full Face using Wet'N'Wild, which I loved. And I really ended up liking
this foundation a lot. Haven't tried it since, so,
we'll try it out again, just for more coverage. Cause shit, mommy needs it. That's more like it. So, this came into the package,
it's like some of the HD concealer. I'm using the shade R30, it works. Guys, and I've actually used
the HD concealer before, and I used to be obsessed
with this concealer. I think it's so beautiful. I haven't used it in so long, I just feel like I'm refalling
in love with it right now. It's so pretty. The coverage is beautiful,
it looks so pretty on the skin. It doesn't fall into your fine lines
and wrinkles as easily. It's just a really, really pretty,
pleasant concealer. Makeup Forever also sent me
a new HD Powder- this is the Ultra HD Powder, and it says that this is even more blurring
than the last powder was. So, let's see, that's a bold statement. Okay, let's see. Let's put that
underneath the eyes. I feel like the effect is so there. It makes my skin look so blurred,
and so pretty on camera. But, for some reason, I feel like the foundation maybe it's a Photo Focus underneath it, but I feel like it's- it's making my skin oxidized so much darker. Like here, literally looks orange. Like, it's straight up fucking orange. This is why First Impressions
sometimes can be a bad idea. I'm sure you guys know this by now already, but you guys need to be carefull
with the HD Powders, because they have [inaudible] ass flashback. So, right now I'm not taking
any photos with any flash. I'm just doing this for a video. But I would not do it if I was getting
photographed with Flash Photography. Like, it just doesn't look good, so, this is what we have on the skin so far. Let me at least put some Studio Effects
down on my neck, man. Cause shit. Cool, so now that orange face is back,
I grabbed some bronzers. I told you guys I had some NARS ones downstairs,
I knew it. I knew it. These are the new NARS bronzers. Maybe these aren't new NARS bronzers,
but they're repackaged, because now they're like this
little square packaging, and they look like this now,
which is really cool, I love it. Let's go in and bronze using the new NARS,
repackaged, bronzers. Very, very cute. I really did
not need to go in. I should put a little bit on
my neck as well because I feel like my neck is looking a little pasty. So, let's go in and use "Barely Legal"
and "Cotton Candy Cream" as our blush and highlighters. I mean, I have so much of the color pop stuff, I can just use a lip from theirs things,
I don't need [inaudible]. Packaging looks like this. It's kinda hard to see the Kiley part,
but it's all good. So, first let's go in with some blush. We're gonna go in with "Barely Legal",
on a Morphey E4. Okay, it's pigment. I mean, there's pigment coming off, for sure. Hmm. Honestly, I'd thought I was gonna be
a little bit more impressed that this, and the reason I'm not that
impressed is because I feel like the blendability isn't really there. I'm like, really having to go in many, many times to try to blend this out whereas
I can use a Becca1, and it's like blended in fucking three seconds. That's when I have to be like, really conscious
of where I'm putting it to blend. Okay, so, this seems to be going
on better on my left side, so maybe I should retract that statement. Doesn't look as bad on here. But I do have to... this is like my third
layer going into, so, there's that. Cool, so we have the blush on, it's there, it's pretty. I'm not like, blown away, but I mean, the color is there,
so that's cool. So, now I'm gonna go in,
and highlight with the shade "Cotton Candy Cream" with a little Morphey Art 12. Let's swatch on our finger,
see what we think first. Okay, swatching. The swatch was not that pigmented. Oh my God, I was like, really shook, I did not know it was gonna be like that. Okay, well let's try on the face,
and see what we think. Oh, it's not bad. This is not bad. Like, for real, this is not bad. That's a pretty color, dude. That's actually really pretty. That texture. I can't speak for the other colors,
but so far this color, "Cotton Candy Cream",
is not bad whatsoever. I had just heard so many bad
things about these highlighters. When I was gonna do it, I was expecting to hate them. I mean, I like the highlighter
more than I like the blush. That's for fucking sure. Okay guys, so the brows are now on. My eyes are primed. I just don't know which palette
I wanna go on with first. So, of course we have these
guys from Color Pop, but we also have a dose of colors- these guys. We have these guys too. Let's go with the "Baked Browns" palette,
by Dose of Colors. Oh my God, that white. That cream shade, [inaudible 00:07:24] Oh, it's so pigmented, fuck me. Okay, I'm actually gonna go in
with this transition shade right- Does a little fall out? But look how much fucking
pigment gets picked up. Holy shit. Like, these are fucking pigmenting. Okay, let's go in with a Morphey Y16,
fluffy brush. So nice. Look how easily that just blend,
are you for real? Yo, Dose are onto something with
this formula though, for real. Taking the middle shade,
with a Morphey M433. Just be careful with the dri- the fall out because they are so pigmented, like, just be cautious of that. This is such a Manny palette
right now, though. Like, tell me this is not me. And I'm gonna take a little bit of that darkest,
darkest shade on that same brush, and let's put it on the out right corner. Just for a little bit more definition. And I'm actually gonna take the little brush
that came with for that one, and I'm gonna put that on the brow bone. Oh, I love colors like this. Fuck. I wanna put this all over my lid,
but I'm trying to be strong, so I can use a Color Pop one. So, now for the lid, I decided
I wanna keep this as the crease. I'm gonna take a new shadow
from Color Pop. This is the "Super Hardcore"- no, it's called "Super Hardcore". I'm not saying it's super hardcore anything, it's literally called "Super Hardcore". And it looks like a really pretty champagny- like, champaign. So, I'm gonna put that on the lid. That's pretty. And I'm taking that same shadow
that I swatched earlier, which is called "Ego". I'm gonna put that on top of the cream. Call me [Inaudible]. And I'm just gonna press that over it. It gave me a nice rosey tone. Oh, that's so pretty. Oh my God, this is bridal as fuck. We should do it for the bottom lash line.
I think I'm gonna use this color. That color looks really, really pretty.
It's like a really pretty pinky peach. Oh, that's so spring. I love it. Let's just take a bit of the Clips
on the inner corner. Should I just do brown shadow liner? Like, that just sounds really cool to me. Like, a dark brown shadow liner. Taking that in that same
Baked Brown palette, and a little angled brush. This is a Morphey R45. Just give me a little bit of definition, without having to do a full wing, and go ahead and wing it out
if you guys would like. Why not put a little bit into
the fucking crease? I think we're just having fun
today guys, all the way. Don't know where I went with that one, but I really like the direction
we went in with that. Cool, well I'm gonna go finish the other
eye off-camera real quick, apply some lashes, and I'll be right back. Okay, there we have it. Now, I'm gonna try this setting spray by Pixie. This is the "Makeup Fixing Mist"
with Rose Water and Green Tea. Oh my- That smells so good.
That smells like fucking Nikita. Oh my God, it smells like Nikita. That felt amazing. If I'd- I just got some fucking Nikita's
[censored] on me. Okay, you guys, so for the lip I have a bunch of little Color Pop options. We have to use the Color Pop one. There's lip products that
they have. I have to. This is the last of the last
things that we're doing. We're gonna look through
all the Ultra Satin lips, cause I really don't like the Ultra
 Matte Lips that they do. Ouh. That's gorgeous. I might just- I might just plop that bitch on. So, we have four Ultra Satin Lipsticks. These are the options right here. I think I'm gonna go with this cool tone one,
which is so rare for me. Me? Cool tone? Bitch. This is in the shade "Strut". I like that shade "Strut",
it's like "Strut your stuff". These are like, impressively pigmented. And they're so easy to apply,
are you kidding? This color is so fucking pretty.
Oh my God. And, yeah guys, that's it
for the entire video. Hope you guys had fun watching
this kind of Part 2 of PR Inboxing turn into
a First Impressions. I really like how this look turned out. It looks pretty cool, it's very graphic for me. I like the graphic liner. It's really, really intense, and the lip
turned out so pretty. I'm actually really, really living
for this look as a whole. It definitely took us some like,
building to get there. I didn't really like the MAC foundation. Of course, it's more of a sheer foundation. I knew I wouldn't really like it, and I was right, I don't really love it. The finish was pretty on my skin, but it oxidized really, really dark, and I was like, "What the f-" But, yeah you guys, I love you so much.
 Thank you so much for watching. Have the greatest of night or day,
wherever you guys are, and I will catch you guys in my next video. So, let's go in and get into this full Brush... Fuck, I can't speak. I don't know what I'm gonna even
call this video, honestly. Oh, it's a freckle. I thought
it was a piece of dirt. Okay, that was great, that was great Manuel, you did fucking great. I look fucking orange. Which is not like, that far fetch
to what I normally look like, but this is like severe orange,
not like my normal orange. You know? Ew.  Woah. Woah. You guys, look how dark I have to go
because of this oxydation, are you kidding? Like, I- I mean, I like to go more tanned, but fuck,
this is a whole new level. So let's go in with the "Marvelous Browns"  No, [inaudible]. But, yeah, I'll see you guys very soon. Oh my God, Zaya took
a fucking shit in my room. She did, she fucking shit over there,
and I smelled it from here. 
hey guys welcome back to my channel so as you can see from today's title toys video is going to be a fun and different kind of video I was kind of organizing my makeup with the other day and I came across these two palettes these two highlighter palettes and this actually gave me the idea to create this video they're actually these ones right here it's from sleek and this one from Technic as you can see they're literally identical seeing that I was like wow how do that looks like such an intense as to do from the original which i think is the sleek one so I was thinking to myself I'm like wait do I have any other products that have a dupe for them and I'm not just talking Duke I'm talking about like almost where it looks blatantly copied so I found three different products I wanted to test out on camera to see is the original product as good as the copied product so I thought would be a really fun idea to film I've never seen a video like this before I don't know maybe someone else has done it I have no idea but I saw these products and I was like wait this looks literally like a blatant copy of the other who knows maybe it's not a copy maybe it's just a brand came out it and it's a coincidence I don't know I'm not the brand I have no idea also do not forget I have a giveaway going on on my channel right now there's gonna be two winners the first prize winner will get a $500 gift card to Sephora the second prize one will be getting a $250 gift card to Sephora and the only rules are to be subscribed to my channel and yes there are ways I can check if you are subscribed to me so don't treat the system I'll leave everything linked down below like the time it's over and things like that so yeah let's go and get into this video as always if you guys like this video if you guys don't like me please don't fucking watch it you know the drill with that yeah but you guys do like this do please do give this video a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel if you aren't already we have to all get to this testing makeup products that have been copied versus the other I don't I don't know I might Alice [Music] so the first product I wanna try out is the highlighting palette from both these brands I have the Technic one technique technique I don't know strobe kit and I have these sleek solstice palette as you can see when you open them bitch in the sleek one we have the lavender highlighter the really pretty champagne one we have this yellow gold don't have a cream highlighter right here let's look at the other one in the other colors oh you know we have a lavender highlight a peachy champagne one a yellow gold and we have that same lavender ii cream shade as well we're gonna test these out on our face and what i'm going to be using i'm going to be testing out specifically this shade right here and the other one is nice in the same shade so i'm gonna swatch over here on my hand how much I guess it looks like this is one of the most intense blinding as highlights I absolutely love it so much now let's watch the technic one hmm right off the bat the sleek one is so much more smooth so much creamier feeling has a little bit more of a peachy tone to it and this one's a little more of a cool tone they're sleek right here and we have Technic right there sleek which looks a little bit more blinding on my hand for sure more reflective and Technic right there so we're gonna do is we're put on our face with the same style brush and see which one's better taking the sleek one right here oh how blinding this bitch was it hello texture how you doing though and we have the sleek one on that is with two full layers now let's take the Technic one same exact shade same exact brush we're gonna pile that one on God what if it's like really good we'll see okay my focus okay umm okay now we have both on we have boom sleek right here Technic right there technique I'm just gonna call it technique is techniques on 'stevie sleek right here blinding is fuck technique pretty fucking blinding is fuck - hmm I will say that the sleek one is a little bit more reflective like a lot more white and like reflection to it but the technique one is also extremely extremely brightening I was shook I did not expect this to be like good to be honest I can't even find the fucking price on this bitch like Amazon selling it for like 4 bucks I don't even know personally I do like the sleek one more it's more intense more effective more like pow but the technique one it worked but it's not as good as a sleek one I mean it is four bucks and the sleek one is 13 so for this one I will definitely say that the sleek one and the copy did not move on to the next product we are going to be testing a blush out haha so we have a product from makeup revolution or just revolution makeup I guess and this is from Too Faced this is the sweethearts blush blush let's bust these bitching oh okay I'm screaming like I'm fucking scream Ming do you see this shit we have the revolution triple baked blusher peachy pink kisses and the Too Faced perfect flush blush and peach Beach let's open them up we have to face right here boom beautiful stunting wait I'm pretty sure to face came out this first so we're gonna test it both out on our faith in oh my god I have to like look at the back to even see we're gonna swatch the whole thing right here in our finger two-faced we have this color it's beautiful beautiful peachy color we're gonna swatch it the other one ah oh my god that one feels really good and really pigmented the middle one right here to make a revolution one okay guys so I just watched it we have right here makeup revolution peach and two-faced peach the makeup revolution one is a lot more highlighting two things one is lot more peachy is a lot more blush like we're gonna be testing the original products on this side taking a little blush brush right here in e4 and I'm gonna take the Too Faced blush we're gonna put that on this side of the face and see that's a beautiful color come on to face god damn that's a good blush so now organize the makeup revolution one which is so much more high lady so weird okay whatever as I'm packing into the makeup revolution one this one is so much more powdery and so much more flaky like there's a lot more like dust that picks up on that one so I basically just for highlight all over my face yes fuck no fuck now let's see if I can fix my face up with just please brush away okay guys the verdict stick to the two-faced one it was actually a real blush it went on a beautifully revolution triple baked blusher was literally like a highlight all I can type a highlight all over my cheek the whole thing was covered and so intense it wasn't like a pretty intense it was like a sitting on top of your face gross intense so the original one again the dupe copy move I would not suggest this one unless you guys like a very intense shiny blush topper I would say go for this one but if you guys want a normal blush I could you like a really pretty satin lifelike finish go to this one for sure okay we are down to our last product so this is the last certainly certainly not least we have the Kat Von D shade + light eye palette and we have the makeup revolution a revolution makeup ultra eye contour light and shade palette come the fuck on girl shade + light eye light and shade eye over here same exact color scheme - t I died too because Kat Von D like posted on her Instagram about about this palette saying how it was a blatant copy and they're like riding her back and I just thought I'm like girl you know you know how it isn't like there was drama online you're kind of like where's my D F and this is D B so what we're gonna do is I'm gonna do a really simple easy I look just to test out some of the shades in comparison I've already used the Kat Von D shade light palette the eye one it's absolutely amazing I think the shadows are so so good and so creamy and so pigmented it's just a great palette honestly it's a great great everyday palette so I'm assuming make a revolution so I was like I wanted make a great everyday palette - I'm just gonna swatch a couple of these I'm to swatch the first three feel smooth actually shocking so got these right here is what the three top ones feel like this is happen I don't understand so on the original side we're going to take like really pretty apricot shade a little bit of this one and that one just to kind of mix our own custom transition shade there's literally no denying that comedy has some nice s shadows for real I just dumped in to the revolution one okay I already notice that this one is so much more powdery okay I'm a little shook knock online because it went on and what I'm pretty good I definitely did the job it blended it deposited the color even though it was a lot powdery ER and there's so much more kickback and I was a lot more intense so now let's go and just dip into this really pretty chocolatey shade right here with this r39 amazing amazing brush for blending so fucking pigmented you guys the showers do not play no there's so much powdery or anymore and don't stick to the brush as much but let's see how it goes online that's what matters [Music] okay I notice that the Kat Von D colors are much more rich in color and they last better this one it when you blend it like kind of blends away though it does blend don't get me wrong it's definitely definitely blending okay last step I'm gonna pack on this white shade onto my lid this is the Kat Von D one eye so pigmented oh I'll take the makeup revolution sign same exact color you guys make a revolution palette though is so fucking chalky so much just powder M re we're okay so definitely the highlight e type shade on the lid is not nearly as good on the make a revolution side as it is on the Kat Von D side verdict on the Shane light versus the light and shade palette I would definitely go with the Kat Von D shade + light eye palette over this one did the revolution one work it totally did like honestly it totally totally worked you can get definitely at the job done it's just not nearly as pigmented and it's much more chalky than the Kat Von D one this one's way better if yours way sturdier it comes with a mirror the shades themselves blend easier they're more pigmented they're much more rich in color that's just my personal opinion okay guys that's it for the entire video because I had fun watching I had so much fun creating this weird dupe / copied video I thought was so much fun to film and who knows with the brand even really copied I have no idea it's allegedly it just looks really copied to me my opinion or it could be a coincidence who knows but to me it looks like literally a duped identical product because of any other products that you guys have seen out in the market that had a definite copied makeup product dupe let me know in the comments bar below and I'll definitely check it out don't forget to enter the Sephora gift card giveaway and some makeup if you guys want to of course everything will be linked down below I have Grace at night or day where you guys are and I'll catch you guys in my next video bye guys what ready okay Toros hey guys that welcome back to my channel stupid shit what the fuck Oh another one bites the dust all right hundred banging so take a look fuck me that was wrong that are I can make about that with door to the top [Music]

fever had chills but it wasn't like to an extreme level I had the flu shot maybe that helped I'm sorry that this best of 2017 video is coming at you guys a little bit late but I still wanted to do it I asked you guys on Twitter and I did a poll and the majority I said please continue to do it and even though it's coming a little bit late into the year to do the best on 17 and I have so many products here I really want to jump right in because I feel like it don't take so long for me to do this because I have a lot of like drugstore items I have a lot of like higher-end items / like medium and items so now as we're gonna be doing today you guys we're gonna doing a fool best of beauty 2017 I do not have any skincare in this video because would like me to do a separate video on skincare or if you want me to do like a little like snapchat like thing on skincare or Instagram or something I can definitely do that for you guys but I just figured it would take way too long to glue skincare because I feel like with skincare so as I explained a lot more but anyway let's go ahead and jump right into today's video as always if you guys don't like this video if you guys do not like me please don't watch it you know that you're with that whether you guys do like this video please go ahead subscribe to my channel if you're not already and if we knew what's about mani MUA and welcome to my channel thank you so much for being here I really really really appreciate it Bay that's one get into this the best of 2017 beauty video okay let's jump right in so I could do this face slash complexion products right now and then I do a little break and we're gonna do the eye and brow products after that so let's go and start off with each category I'm gonna start off with primers and I have a to Primus here that I really really like this year I'm also gonna go ahead and try my hardest to not repeat products that I included in my 2016 best products that includes like tart shaped tape which I have here I haven't talked about that if you guys have not seen that video I'll go ahead leave it linked down below all those products still apply I love them all so much I saw you have used them all this year as well anyway you guys I don't talk about these two primers really quickly that's going to start off with the Bobbi Brown vitamin rich skin base I'm obsessed with this I literally think this is so amazing this is like a beautiful moisturizing primer that keeps you and I'm not saying that keeps your makeup on a lot longer you know I'm not saying that but when I do use this I know something the makeup looks so much more beautiful on the face after you do this because it's so so so hydrating and it really just gives my face this really beautiful suppleness that I can't even explain and a little bit goes a long way I literally just dip my Beauty Blender into it and I've been using it all year and I barely use any of it like it's crazy it's amazing I highly recommend it another primer I really really like which is almost similar to the Bobbi Brown one is the Too Faced hangover RX replenishing face primer I've been using this all year I  love it it's one of those that's a very very hydrating one and it just makes your skin plump and supple it isn't really filling your pores last year I'm talking about pore fessional from benefit which was amazing that's like what I always always always use still to do my little t-zone but for all the over the face I like to use the Bobbi Brown or the hangover RX from Too Faced because I feel like it really gives the foundation some life I highly recommend I think they're amazing I don't really have a drugstore primer that I use very often so if you guys have any drugstore primaries that you guys recommend I would love to get to comment down below because I don't have any for myself so it's kind of annoying anyway it's gonna move on to some foundations I have three aunts to talk about first and foremost my most used foundation of all is the hourglass banners stick foundation this is my favorite foundation of the entire year it swept me away it gives a beautiful amount of coverage it looks beautiful on the skin it's buildable and then realized I'm getting beautiful and I cannot explain it I always I literally use this every day I'm using this today it makes what's under foundation but I always use this with my base foundation because it gives me all my coverage and it's stunning and it plays well with others you know I'm saying you need a foundation sometimes that plays well with others and this one does I've gone through it this is like my third stick that I've gone through bitch I live like literally I would like I can like plow another stick randomly like I love this so drugstore one that I've been loving in this entire year that I used so often was the Maybelline matte and poreless foundation why was i sleeping on mainly men for lists like I don't understand I'm booking this is such a beautiful foundation it does say matte and poreless but to me it doesn't really give you a matte matte finish it gives you like a satin matte finish it still gives you a really pretty Sheen to the skin I think it's stunning it's a medium coverage buildable cover as well and for the drugstore price like it really really cannot be beaten and I just love it also shout-out to Loreal Pro Matt infallible I love that foundation a lot this year as well but this one for me took the cake for a drugstore as you can see like I use it a lot it's up it's there man and so I'm for my last foundation I have not been using this foundation for a long time I've only been using for the past two months but honestly you guys I have to include it and it deserves this shoutout a dice this is the NARS natural radiant long wear foundation I did a video with NARS a little bit while back talking about this foundation and it is so beautiful maybe I've been using it for a month not two months mmm it's just the most beautiful foundation I've had here I'm actually wearing it today so I have a stick of hourglass like a boom boom boom boom and then I have this on top to blend with hourglass and I just honestly feel like my skin looks Iranian and beautiful and it's set with powder and I just think it gives you the most beautiful amount of coverage and lasts nicely on my skin when you set it with powder it's very important because this is more of a luminous foundation it's definitely more on the dewy side I would highly suggest setting this with powder because it will move on the skin if you do not if you're oily I'm telling you you will want to set this foundation but honestly when you said it it stays on beautifully it looks beautiful on the skin I'm looking at the at the monitor I mean out W finder to make sure I'm in focus I always catch myself looking at my skin and I'm like oh I'm sorry whose skin is that highly recommend ten out of ten NARS natural radiant long wear I've been only using for the month and it's already my best 2017 that's what I'm saying it's that good I use it all the time let's go and talk about some concealer so I have to just talk about this even though I talked to our last year heart-shaped aimed I thought this is the bitch that took the world by storm the beauty world by storm I literally noticed like this one this bottle is like empty like it's scratched on the side that's like I'm like I've gone through like four or five of these at this point I just think such a beautiful concealer it gives you a full amount of coverage I love that obviously it's like the I like the consistency of it it's almost like a whipped liquid it's not too liquidy but it's not too whipped either I just really really really like it it doesn't settle into my fine lines really fast and I'm wearing it today and I love it and the other concealer I loved it for this year is the NARS soft matte pot this is my second one and she's going through it she is going through it this pot you guys this is like the the concealer that I'm like discovered this year where I was like oh my word it's such a beautiful consistency the coverage is fullest but it doesn't settle into your fine lines fast or anything like that either you said it it looks perfect the entire day and I love that it's a little pot you get a little brush it's perfect it's stunning and I love it so much these are the only so every is all year I wore these consist have Lang sometimes together if I'm feeling zesting to powders I used non stop this year I'm really trying to blow through this thing but I already know it's gonna be so  long so I'm trying to like not explain too much about each product you know what I mean so I'm sure you guys have seen me use all these products on my channel I tried to do a little end-of-the-year recap you know last year of course I talked about like Laura Mercier translucent powder RC made no color powder I'm not gonna include those this year I wanted to include two new ones I want to talk about the Too Faced Born This Way ethereal powder this is like the powder of the year for me like that's the powder I'm wearing today this powder it is so good it is so good it's beautiful on the skin it blurs the pores it makes everything just look look at me it makes everything just looks so snatched and if you're dry I feel like it's not gonna pull at your dry patches whatsoever it's not a drying powder whatsoever but if you're oily it does keep your oils at bay very very nicely you can bake with this powder it just looks really really good on camera and in photography it doesn't flash back and the other powder I want to talk about is the Charlotte Tilbury airbrush flawless finish powder this is the guy right here so what she looks like it's like a little airbrush powder this powder you guys oh it feels like silk it feels like silk and it looks like silk on the skin this powder is like my holy grail powder I will use it to set my under eye I'll use it to set my face if I'm just not if I'm not in the mood to use this one I use this one because it's so beautiful on the skin and it's so lightweight and like honestly like the more I apply this one it never gets cakey on me like I literally will keep applying like three layers of it throughout the day never looking cakey whatsoever because it's such a finely milled soft powder and I highly recommend it okay guys let's go and talk about some bronzers the bronzer from the drugstore that I literally slate my whole existence Physicians Formula Muhtar bronzer oh my god just open and smelled it again oh my gosh how do you do this oh my god dude only smells like it was like crumb doughnuts from the 7-eleven you know those doughnuts I feel like an orange you with flakes on them it smells like that technically it's like a coconut like cement cement smell and scent Clocky right now technically it's like a coconut scent but it smells so good and it gives such a beautiful finish on the skin I really have no complaints about this bronzer I think it's amazing I can't believe that this is like a drugstore bronzer it looks beautiful the shade I use is in bronze bronzer it's not a shade technically I think it's like the medium shade it's not too warm it's not too cool it gives you a nice bronze ass look and it's from the drugstore like I really it's a Fritz brunet I can't complain okay guys so now a high-end bronzer that I literally use every single time to my makeup I'm not kidding you every single time Marc Jacobs tantrik you guys have seen me use this so much the rest when I had shattered that was devastating because this bitch was like limited-edition as and I'm really hoping that they bring this back because honestly the color is stunning and there's so much product in here like I feel like I've used this all year and I'm not even hit pan yet and I use it every single day so I don't understand no one can know how it works but it honestly is so beautiful the formulation is stunning highly recommend it summit edition hopefully they get bring it back but I don't new last and final like bronze retype item at 417 is the Urban Decay Naked skin at shapeshifter palette anyway I use a shade liked to medium and this is the shape sort of palette so what it is it's like you get four powders I use them a lot I like thank them and you get like five creams in here it's called shapeshifter because it is a contour and highlighting palette you get your little powders if you're not into using creams you get to use creams if you're not into powders I love that I use it all the time I always use these two shades specifically this is a very very very cool toned Brown if you're a little bit darker than me I probably wouldn't even recommend it because it is gonna look really I fee like it'll look a little bit ashy on darker complexion but it has a nice warmer tone over here it comes with one little highlight I never touched this I should and I do like to use at these two guys right here to brighten up my under-eye or contour with creams so honestly I use this all the time take with me when I travel that's what I know I use something very frequently if I'm traveling with you bitch I am using you so I highly recommend that and I think it's great for us perceive like if you wanted to throw in your kid there's a medium to dark one as well I just things really really really practical let's go and move on to highlighters now drugstore highlighters first it's one talked about the main two the only two that mattered for me right here Maybelline master chrome bitch the Maybelline master chrome and molten gold are you joking this like Slade my whole visa ready yeah I don't know how they didn't even guy you think it's so huh stunning it's like what I think it's like ten bucks but truly you guys I'm not kidding you this highlighter acts like it's a high-end highlighter it's so nice I will literally use it when I'm like going out to an event like I don't even care like it's not like oh it's not high in high light who gives a it's literally so nice and so beautiful I'm obsessed I love it and then I also really really really really loved the wet'n wild highlighting powders base laid with these highly parts I came up with a slew of them a slew look bitch like that's the hone right here second one right there boom this is in the shade golden flower crown this is like even cheaper than the other one things are like 4 bucks like it's crazy these are really really really nice and they're very very very affordable it literally like is high-end to me even though it's out of the drugstore they're  bomb okay it's go and talk about hey let's talk about cream one I used to use this like Larry all the time I don't use as much anymore but I use this all year long this is the Marc Jacobs dewdrops do you guys remember this when this came out these are the dewdrops and these were literally so poppin I Larry will take the smallest amount like a little dollop we do that no daughter Cordell piece of coming out yeah the tiniest amount would take my Beauty Blender and I would pat pat pat on my cheekbones and like on areas I would want to highlight it's stunning it just gives a beautiful golden shift and it would really really intensify highlight if I was using a highlighter that I really wanted to like being from the  ground to the sky I don't know if they still sell them or not but 10 out of 10 recommend next time I won't talk about this is the nikkietutorials Expo for collaboration in the shade glow goals this highlight are you guys I'm actually wearing it as a topper today like slayed me slayed me to the ground third one okay now I'm getting crazy oh man my hand looking crazy I'm not even if I can swatch it it's amazing the only problem with this Highlander I would say or with honestly any Oprah highlighter is that they're so soft that they're really really crumbly like I literally like have pieces falling apart because they're so delicate which are noise the out of me I wish that they were pressed a little bit harder Nicki and Oprah killed the highlighters that they came out with Vicki she came up with three logos is my absolute favorite and I love it and last but not least I want to talk about really quickly is the Anasazi aglow kit specifically this one this is the that glow glow kit and I want to talk about also Nicole Guerrero's collab with an associate as well which was literally the most beautiful last collaboration can't find in my drawers anywhere I don't where the that bitch went honestly that collab that palette was so stunning I want to talk about it because it's gonna make me but here you know it's literally was just so good and I just loved it so much they killed it so this is the that glow kit I have used these three didn't really use that one that much don't know where I would use it for other than a shadow it doesn't really go with my complexion but honestly I love Donna siglo kits I think that they come out with such an amazing array of glow kits this year and I would highly recommend getting a glow kit from an associate and just slang with it because it's so pretty now we're gonna move on to some blushes and then we'll go on to like eye stuff or whatever so now blushes I have three blush price I want to talk about for this year number one blush product of the year for me hands down my obsession is the Tarte blush Bazaar this bitch right here you guys that no not ten ten and it's so compact it's perfect I travel with it everywhere I go this is all I wear this I'm wearing as my blush today this is what I'm wearing fortunate honestly you guys I just feel like this was such a practical thing on up to I came out with I think this is like retails for 40 bucks I was shocked at how cost-efficient this was came with ten blushes great size product great amount you got any I'll just like bitch like it was amazing I want to talk about this blush real quick the height literally always always always wear from the drugstore this is the wet and wild color icon and blush and pearlescent pink hi faith in this shade for a long time oh just give me a little a little touch high but honestly this is like three dollars and it was and it's just beautiful it's the most beautiful soft pink blush a complement so many different skin tones it blends so nicely I kind of like I can't anything else good about it like it's just that good there's so much product and I'm like bitch I have no complaint that's great and then the last question I'm talking about is my district list this is from their Mint collection this is in the shade amazement and it's the most perfect apricot peach blush ever and on the skin it's so beautiful I travel with this one too I travel with these three these are the three blush products that you honestly shouldn't and it's too much it's already crazy what I do and I love all three of them and those I would highly recommend for blushes if you guys are blush people you will be obsessed with all three of these have too many I only have two brow products I loved it this year last year talking about the of course on assessing brow Wiz and I think I even talked about a definer I love dipping in the rain this year been picking out with a slew of brow products that came out to hold her range which was absolutely amazing they came out with so many I specifically love it there precisely brow pencil I just love this one because honestly it is so pigmented you could do like the easiest like little hair like strokes with it like it's so easy to use and it's pigmented it's not too waxy where you feel like it's like gonna come off super super easily I thought that's very very like transfer resistant and they had a great color range I just really really liked them so and the brow gel I always always always use is the anastacio tinted brow gel and the shade granite or espresso it just kind of depends how I'm feeling I didn't today actually it's going to use that well honestly you guys this brow gel I love it so much because I feel like you really use my brows in place it gives me a little bit of color not too much where I'm like bitch that's like too much but I just like it really tames the brow you know and it keeps them in place and they do not budge this is like some gorilla glue like this don't budge and I love it for it like I don't want my brows to budge I want them to stay put the ten hours I have the makeup on these are the brow products that I have been loving all year long and they our staples in my collection and I travel with them constantly oh you want to drop again so it's going to move on to V here we're talking about some eye products I don't talk about pallets I like to have only three so it's not like anything crazy so the eye products that stole my heart this year are these guys right here these are the glitter and glow and shimmer and glow shadows by Stila you guys you guys already know how I feel about these these are literally the best thing that happened this year to me like their number who maintain this is the glittering glow shadows which I use consistently oh my word oh and they dry to a like drier finish so they don't like transfer on you and at the shimmering glow shadows which they were just released or recently right here you guys I don't know what else to say about these I have not said already I've said a million times how amazing these are like other brands have tried to recreate products like this they turn out to be a flop they're too sticky things like that these right out perfectly these look stunning on the eye they just look great they're bomb and then I also really want on weather this week with this is a super shock shadow in the shade rich this is actually color pop and Laura Lee collaborated they did a thing for no-kill LA which is so amazing they did a collaboration together and all the proceeds went to a no-kill early and Laura came out with this shade called Ritz and it's the prettiest  shade it's literally just glitter it's like an easy way of using glitter without it being too intense and too scary like literally right here that's like a glittery beautiful shade right there you see it actually a little bit on my eyes just pressed unlike the inner part of my eye just a little like and I think that Laura did an amazing job I think club pop did an amazing job and I think really honestly clever I've just had an amazing year in general they  slayed it in 2017 so the palette that like ended up hots for me in 2007 pain is the Jaclyn hill palette this is the palette I used the most often this one is not the one I use this is a newer one that I actually just used recently because my I get my other one to my mom because she really loved it so I'm like okay mom it's fine honestly the giacomo palette was one of my favorite palettes of the entire year if not my ax will play my palette the entire year because I feel like it's the most practical it's the one I traveled with the most as one the easiest to bring around me also traveled of course with my modern Renaissance by talking about that last year I loved it the palette and I just think it's really really great anything more he really sensitive this year two more fees another brand in general that really really took off in 2017 which makes me so happy because I've been with the brand for like three and a half years now for a long time and I've been really behind them since the beginning so seeing them do so well for themselves makes me really really happy and I just think that Jacqueline and more if you came out with this beautiful beautiful palette there's no denying how nice it is it has everything you could really really need at all the transitions you need it's got everything so I loved that ballad so much also my last pie wanna talk about this wasn't one I used like so so so much but it's one I use so often I had to bring it this is the Kylie Jenner Kylie cosmetics nice palette and this is what it looks like inside you guys this color scheme to me was literally everything I was living like I was living breathing gagging dying gasping I loved it so much I thought was such a beautiful palette and the colors were so nice they were so blendable they were so pigmented and I'm just like Kylie really stepped it up with her eye shadows to Kylie's another brand that just killed in 2017 so congrats to all these brands just slaying the game and it's really really cool to see and it's very inspiring and it helps inspiring me too because i'm course coming out with my own brand it doesn't eighteen so I'm very very very excited for that to happen and it's just really cool cuz I feel like very inspired by the beauty community in general so those pallets and those eye products were some that I loved it so much in 2000 and and the lashes that stole the show for me in 2017 were Lily lashes Miami these are the pairs that I wear the most often actually not wearing them today for some shocking reason I'm wearing Makino's you will always catch me in the Miami other than today but honestly I just feel like this lash killed it for me and it was the most beautiful Ashe look at it it's just so stunning oh my god well I honestly I put it on everyone like if I'm doing someone's makeup if I'm doing a collab or something I always want to put Miami on first and they're like no they're too dramatic I'll like go to a less dramatic one but I always just go to Miami first cuz I feel like it makes everyone's eyes look so big and bright and intense and they're not as subtle lash or definitely more of a dramatic lash but I'm a dramatic kind of girl and I lived for them so Lily lashes Miami highly recommend okay so now we're gonna go and move on to the lip products and we will be done with today's video oh sorry it's probably like it's probably a long one I I tried to go as quick as I could penny was gonna talk about some liquid lipsticks of the year that I was living for this one is from the drugstore this is V wet'n wild liquid catsuit megalast liquid lipsticks these are $5 wet and wild killed it they killed it in 2017 I couldn't even believe how well they did with how many products came out with how nice the products were I'm like if they can do it for $5 why can't some of the higher end brands not do it for 50 mm anyway I thought that these liquid lipsticks were so phenomenal for $5 I'd really think that you couldn't beat the price point and I want to bring them up because even though I don't wear them as often I feel like they deserve so much credit and I think they just did an amazing amazing job with the liquid lipsticks I'm like wow and while and then cruelty free a little bunny also another leg lipstick I wanna talk about it so I drugstore brand but it is a lower like lower price item these are the morphe liquid lipsticks morphe liquid lipsticks killed this year they came out with liquid lipsticks this year recently like they are so nice and I think they retail for like $10 and you use a discount code on them like it's literally so nice they're on the more like moosie frothy side which I really like I want some wave or something here you know I want some like product I don't want to be too liquidy too thin they're like kinda weirds me out and if like it gets everywhere I don't know why I like formulas I'm a bit more than a thicker side so morphe killed their liquid lipsticks but the liquid lipsticks that ended on liquid lipsticks for me in 2017 work from Smashbox I don't know if Smashbox had liquid lipsticks in 2016 but doesn't seventeen I really started to use them a lot more and honestly this formula is so good like I just don't have any words like I just don't do it like they're so nice that book hair is super cute I love I can do a little sharp point I loved Smashbox liquid lipsticks they're so comfortable they're full coverage they last very nicely on the lips they don't dry down too intensely where it's like hurting you but they do last so long so honestly these three liquid lipsticks were the ones that like stole the show for me in 2017 and to gloss type items I want to talk about are one from colour-pop I don't like a mulcher glossy lips this year I have no idea but I think they did an amazing job with ultra glossy lips I think that there beautiful thing they feel amazing this one is in the shade a moon child and this is the one that they did with Kathleen lights she did collaboration with them they came out with three lip products and a palette but moonchild is the gloss color that literally stole my  heart my Reda was gone right there that color glass are you joking it's everything it's literally everything I wear it all the time but they have a ton of varieties that I also really like this one from the Laura Lee collection this one is in the shade Wham and this is literally just like glittery gloss no swatch it mixes - this one right here it's a glittery pretty gloss and honestly these are like six bucks I'm like normal and last product I talked about which I lived for this entire year are the Kylie cosmetics Kim K West cream liquid lipsticks bitch these were on my lips when they came out consistently so much they were the most comfortable ass lipsticks they didn't last very long on the lips of course they didn't dry down matte they'd even dried down like their satin ones did they were just a really pretty cream lipstick in a liquid form they were stunning they felt amazing on the lips the colors were beautiful the arrangement this is in the shade Kiki my favorite one was Kimberly I wear all the time I lost it because I wore it so often and I lost track of it yeah knowing this bitch we are really honest because I love that color so much anyways you guys that is it for today's that video I feel like I'm already like so many minutes in I apologize if this is a long video hope you guys grabbed a snack grab your man grab me I'm not gonna say that I want to stay water tight but anyways you guys thank you so much for requesting this video I had so much fun filming it for you guys I hope you guys enjoyed it I loved it doing these end of the year 2017 favorites videos like they're really really important I feel like it's really cool to be able to recap on the entire year previously and see some of the best products that came out in the year and just give credit to brands and different collaborations and different people that came out with beautiful products throughout the entire year and it's just really really cool to see how far the beauty community is going and is coming and I hope that 2018 brings amazing experiences for you guys for me for other people in the beauty industry you know I hope there's so many more changes happening in the beauty industry after this more diversity shown in the beauty community up is more shade ranges released in different brands I hope that there's more diversity when it comes to male and female being shown in campaigns men and women instead of just only being women in campaigns and things like that or only being lighter complexions in campaigns not darker complexions so I really hope that chosen 18 brings just more diversity and I think we're getting there I feel like we're really gonna get there this year where it's just gonna be a big clusterfuck of everyone in the community being represented the way they want to be represented you know and I'm really excited about it and I cannot wait and I cannot wait to see which has an 18 that brings for us and brings for me brings for lunar beauty I'm so excited about my first product to launch hopefully it's unbecoming out and like mayor Jun that's like the goal time so I'm like really praying praying you are amazing and I appreciate you not cooking off the video even though it's probably so loud I love you guys so much okay so that night

little bita for it it's called on thirsty you know like for water hands for dick whatever but what I do use this I know sometimes oh hey hey cuz and uh yes and uh or just blown right through this or blown right through it yes on [Music] 12z I decided to join us I use the shade lay okay I'm back I had some chicken nuggets now I'm happy again okay guys so now let's go ahead and continue on to the brow and the eye brow do we even have brow yeah yeah yeah one okay magnificent metals glitter and glow and we have the Magnum and the shimmer so we have a lot can't speak can't speak  I feel so sick I need to go to bed 
Hey guys that welcome back to my channel Ha ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha Anyway guys, what is up? How are you guys doing today? It has been a wonderful day for me so far. I have chilled. I'm have not chilled I went to get laser hair removal on my ass cheeks, so it's been rough, and now I'm feeling so uh Getting some shit done today. You know I'm going to movies a little bit later on so Its gonna be a fucking chill day So recently I uploaded a video, and it was a Sephora gift guide kind of like showing you guys What were the best deals at Sephora like holiday wise holiday gift sets and gift sets I thought that were actually really really cool for Sephora things that were actually worth the money things that you actually like save a good Amount of money on and a lot of you guys really really like that And I don't know what it was but the idea just kind of hit me to make a video that was kind of like the opposite Of that so basically you guys this video is going to be the antithesis of that video I think I use that word correctly. I could be wrong. Basically this is going to be an anti holiday gift sets haul. I don't know if that even makes sense This is like I know I've seen anti hauls going around everywhere all over YouTube It's basically the products that people are not going to buy because I feel like it's they're not worth a hype That's surrounding the products or anything like that I really thought I was never really gonna film one of those videos So I'm like no it's kind of mean, and I'm gonna do it I always just felt like kind of guilty for the brand But I did tweet about it and you guys Really requested me to do an anti haul for the holiday gift sets and I feel less bad because it's not like a core item Of the brand it's like a holiday items, so it's like you just don't buy the holiday item, and it's all good It's not like it's part of their permanent collection so that's what today's video is going to you guys It's going to be an anti holiday gift haul. I screenshotted the things that I would personally not buy at Sephora Or things I'm not gonna buy for holiday and things like that cuz I just don't think that it's worth it and the same with it's not Just the holiday stuff. It's like other products as well that are just i'm like This is so not worth the money, and yeah. That's what today's video is going to be. I hope you guys enjoy it. As always, if you guys do not like this video, if you guys do not like me Please don't *bleep* watch it. You know the drill with that. Hey But if you guys do like this video, go ahead and give it a thumbs up and like it. Also let me know in the comments bar below if you guys do like this kind of video if you guys want me to continue to do like anti hauls or things that are a little bit more on the Hypercritical side because this video is very much me being more hyper critical. It's not me being like- oh and like- yay gung ho for these holiday things. This is like me being a lot more like critical of the Product and the price point and the brand so if you guys like that Let me know and I can totally create more videos like this. But yeah, let's get into this anti holiday haul video Okay guys so before I started this video I just wanted to disclaim really quickly I've seen an anti haul before and the person that was doing it did disclaim to their followers that, yo, even if you do like this product it does Not mean that it's a better product. If you guys like it and I don't, that's all good That's a cool thing about having different opinions about makeup You know if a product works for me great, and it doesn't work for you Then that's kind of how the cookie crumbles you know and vice versa. So if you guys do like a product that I don't like Like it's all good. Do not take offense to it. It's really not that big of a deal It's just literally different opinions like different things different people are into different things so don't even worry about it Please don't get offended by it also So what I did decide to do because I do have like this guilt in me doing these kind of videos what I decided To do was yeah, I'm gonna talk about one product from that brand I don't like for the holiday sets so I'm going to suggest another product from that brand as well that I would think that is worth the money and is worth the Bundle price and things like that okay, so the first item I want to talk about is from the brand Becca And this is the Apres Ski Glow face pallet, and this guy comes with six shades and it retails for $54. This is the first item that I'm not going to be purchasing for holiday Because I feel like all the pallets are starting to look the same. Like Becca's coming out with pallets. That i'm just like girl I literally I saw the palette like last season like the exact the exact same thing and honestly if like $54 It is a higher price point and yeah of course you are getting six minis But I do feel like 54 bucks is a lot of money the packaging itself is beautiful I think they did a beautiful job at the packaging, but I think the color selection is up. I'm like I don't know. It's like boring like I feel like they come out with the same exact palettes over and over and over again I want to see something else. I want see something new something more fun So that is why I'm not gonna be purchasing the Apres or a-pray. I don't really know how to say it either Apres-E glow face palette? And so the product I do suggest buying from Becca during holiday seasons because I have to do this cuz I feel better This is the Glow On The Go Highlighter Set and this is 20 dollars And this guy comes in two different shades that comes with a Champagne Pop, or you get Opal so those both are shades I absolutely love. Of course Jaclyn did Champagne Pop. Opal is such an amazing shade that's like my ultimate number one shade from Becca for literally ever so basically the reason I really really like this set is because it's $20 it comes with two different little highlighters of course It's the same type of highlighter So you get the liquid glow of that color You get the powder glow of that color and for only 20 bucks of course They are mini travel sizes But I do think that that's a really really great value because Beca highlighters are usually about $38 if you want to try out some of the Becca products I think that that would be a really really really good deal. Okay next product I want to talk about in my anti not gonna buy for holiday haul is the Fenti Beauty Galaxy eyeshadow palette it looks like this this guy retails for $60 comes with 14 shades. I just think that $60 for 14 shades is a lot of money, and they're all like glittery moon dusty type shades. I was actually in Sephora And I swatched the shadows on my hand and they were pretty- like don't get me wrong They were pretty but they weren't anything to like gasp over like I wasn't like screaming for it And I know I'm talking about Fenti Beauty. This is Rihanna's line of course And I'm sure a lot of people are gonna be like "you don't know *bleep* shit" I love Rihanna so *bleep* much But it doesn't mean I'm gonna talk highly about all of her products because she's a *bleep* badass queen of another dimension in different lands Because she is. She is not from this world. It does not mean I'm not gonna criticize her products, so I personally don't think that that is worth it I don't think that the colors in it are very very wearable honestly And I actually really don't like the hexagon-y type shape of it. It's like -too all over the place. I'm like, no! No! My OCD's not having it. So what I would recommend from Fenty Beauty is their Invisimatte Blotting Powder which is $32 and that of course is not a holiday item. This Invisimatte Blotting Powder is literally one of the best blotting powders I've ever used, EVER so I touched up my face because I was getting oily so I like blotted my face the first time I used it and Literally hours later. I looked in the mirror and *bleep* was still matte as *bleep* And I was like I would like some of my oils to seep through so I look pretty. And it literally was not letting them Seep through so I think it's such an amazing amazing Amazing blotting powder if you guys need one if you guys are more oily I would definiyely suggest trying the Rihanna Invisimatte Blotting Powder because it's *bleep* bomb. So the next item is from Hourglass and Hourglass is a brand that I absolutely love they have such beautiful products There's such a luxurious feeling nice-ass brand, but for me this like just doesn't it just doesn't fly like it Just does not work for me. This is the Confession Refillable Lipstick set this is what it looks like right here it is $54 and as a retail value of $78 and the reason why I'm talking about this is because I already do not like the Lipstick price point of the lipstick that they have the confession lipsticks the lipsticks themselves are so nice They're very luxurious feeling they last beautifully on the lips they feel so good They're creamy, and they are beautiful, but honestly they are too expensive I think that they're way too expensive for what they are okay guys so the confession ultra slim high-intensity refillable lipsticks are $34, normally They are $34 and it comes with .03 ounces, .9 grams It literally has no *bleep* product in it It literally is such a small amount of product and the refillables of them are 22 I already feel like that's too high it's like honestly too much I think that the price point is ridiculous even though the lipsticks are beautiful with the amount that you're getting It's just like it's I have no words like I cannot speak It's too small of an amount like if it was like a big normal sized lipstick like it had a normal amount like a normal Lipstick does, I would totally be maybe more into it, and I'd be like you don't it's a high-end brand it makes sense That's a no-go for me So what you can buy instead is the Vanish Seamless Foundation Stick by Hourglass. It is $46 and has 7 grams of product I'm wearing it today I'm wearing it today. I absolutely love You don't understand. I love the Hourglass foundation. I think it's one of the prettiest foundations I've ever tried It's so full coverage. It looks so beautiful on the skin it just I cannot say enough good things about it I wear it all the time. I've gone through two of them already It is annoying that there is not that much product in them there's only 7 grams of product in there But, for the foundation I will accept it because that's what goes on your face It covers a big wide variety of your *bleep* caraita so I'm fine with that I'm like you know what if is expensive. It's fine. It's fine because it looks so good and I understand It's just such a beautiful Foundation so the next anti holiday haul item that I'm going to talking about is from Bobby Brown This is the nude drama eyeshadow palette and it retails for $59 and it comes with twelve eye shadows. Personally, I think the palette looks boring as *bleep* I literally have so many pallets like it give them the Morphe 35F. You're fine. You're good. You don't need this palette It's just so basic to me. It's so boring and for 60 bucks for 12 shades. I'm like You know I mean like it Just it literally makes no sense to me, so I will not be purchasing the nude drama eyeshadow palette I just will not but from Bobby Brown what you could purchase that's absolutely an amazing amazing Amazing deal is their BBU Palette, so it's actually really really weird So it looks like this actually has all the foundations all the concealers from Bobbi Brown packed into one palette. It is expensive- It's 250 bucks *whispers* It's expensive It's actually so worth it if you are a working makeup artist if you are someone that Wants to do makeup on other people if you have clients and things like that honestly the Bobbi Brown foundations- the concealers They're so nice so when they pile it all into one palette. It's just so it's just so practical to me I think it's like such a great idea. And that's like an- I know you can only buy it online, and I believe you are saving So much money when you buy this palette I don't personally have it myself, but I have used the foundations, and I've use the concealers And I think they're beautiful so if you guys are interested in doing a palette that has like good quality items in it That's already done and filled you don't have to fill it yourself I would suggest doing the Bobbi Brown concealer and foundation palette. The next item is from Beauty Blender And this is the Beauty Blender Midas touch, which is a little holiday like duo, and it's $25 and the retail value is $28 So you only save three bucks usually during holiday you want to say a little bit more than three books you know I'm saying I'm just not the biggest fan. Actually don't think it's very very cute either I just think it's not like the prettiest product I just don't think it's worth it 25 bucks for this just to be like a little kitschy little like in a little ornament I Just don't think it's worth it whatsoever. I think be abundant of course is great. They're 20 bucks and that's expensive Don't get me wrong. It's an expensive price point I don't think that buying this Midas Touch kit is worth the extra 8 bucks. Like just we're having a little bit more of a solid cleanser. It's it's not worth it But the Beauty Blender product that is worth it to me is the Gold Mine Set that they have for holiday it comes with two Beauty blenders It comes with blotterotzi blotting paper, and it comes with a cleanser. It is $40 with a retail value of 68 so you're saving $28 rather than saving just three I think that that gift set is so much better the Goldmine one is so much so much better I don't even know why they came out with the Midas one- when I'm like *bleep* it's not even that good Good you getting so much more bang for your buck when you're spending a little bit more money So I would suggest not going with the other one get the Goldmine because quality okay guys So I have two more items first one right here is going to be from Tarte This is the limited edition goddess glow highlighter rainforest of the sea collection limited edition it retails for $35 And it is the golden champagne shade the packaging of it. I thought was really really cute very adorable I loved the press on it. How like it was so beautifully embossed But that was actually for me the the highlighter was just too chunky and too glittery I literally could not work with it I usually try such great ass face products And I absolutely love their products you guys know me and Tarte go way back But this one was something that I was kind of like it just like didn't sit with me Didn't like the way it looked on my hand. I like the way it looked on my face It was just too chunky, and of course it gave a glow it is a highlighter It definitely made me glowy, but it was like glowing the way I didn't want to be it was like chunky on my skin I mean
I really emphasize my texture even more then I already have you do get 12 grams of product though You get a lot so what I would suggest instead is getting the the Tarte Bazaar blush, but this I'm wearing it today again I literally have been wearing this non-stop I've been using these two colors Mostly think this is like they're my favorite of the entire holiday like season finds this baby is like 42 bucks and you get ten Blushes and this like really good like easy to carry compact I don't know it makes me like geeky with how much of a good deal That is because I believe it when I did the last video It's I said that you like save 106 bucks like when you're buying this, so I'm like oh Actually, I don't have two more that was my last one. I hope you guys enjoyed today's video I hope you guys enjoyed my suggestions on getting things from the brand that are better or things I think that is personally just a little bit more cost efficient and a little bit just better of a price point I really actually enjoyed making this video is actually so much fun I didn't really think that I was being mean and any way shape or form to the brands it's just my personal opinion and I Hope the brands understand that I'm not trying to be shady towards you guys at all This is just what I personally think but shit if you guys take offense to it, then *bleep* it It's not my fault, it's not my fault. I tried. But honestly, I had an amazing amazing time doing this video it was actually really really fun. I kind of want to another one I'm sweating. The *bleep* AC is off. I don't know why I don't know why in God's green earth. It's off No idea what it is so I'm gonna head out now all the parts I talked about in today's video will be linked down below like I always do in every single video And hope you guys had fun watching it Have a good rest of your night or day wherever you guys are and I will catch you guys in my next video Happy holidays, happy shopping.

hey guys welcome back to my channel so today's video is going to be a fun ass reviewable because reviews are always so much fun and I love doing these so much and today's video is going to be a review on the derma coal film studio waterproof SPF 30 hypoallergenic full coverage foundation god that's a mouthful I've been getting tagged so much on Twitter to try out this foundation and I bought it on Amazon I think it was like 15 bucks on Amazon and it won prime so I got it within literally like today so it was really really cool to get it so yeah guys that's today's video is going to be I'm going to be doing a review on this derma Col full coverage ass foundation you guys always find the most random as things for me to try out so I'm like oh hey cool you guys have not led me astray yet Oh have you maybe a little as always if you guys don't like this video guys do not like me please don't watch it you know the Jo with that okay but you guys like this video please subscribe to my channel if you're not already and if you're new what's up and man you a and welcome to my channel thank you so much for being here yeah guys it's going to get into this full coverage foundation review on the derma Cole found nation is this the most pigmented foundation in the world who knows that's what everyone's been saying so let's test it out so let's go ahead and get started on today's video I'm just moisturizer on my face I have nothing else on I'm gonna go ahead and prime it as well I'm just into my normal face routine like I normally would so I'm taking benefit Porefessional or any kind of pore minimizing primer those ones are like the most because God knows that he'd help you guys I'm seriously starting to graze on the sides here into my hair but I'm not mad because I'm so into dudes I have like salt-and-pepper hair so like that's so daddy goes oh bug uh-huh there's the okay let's read up on this bad boy so benefits of this foundation it is waterproof hypoallergenic for all skin types SPF 30 preservative free and the coverage is full / extreme was created as the first of its kind in Europe and one of the first in the world boo that just gave me my title world's first full coverage foundation the license first foundation was eventually sold to Hollywood it contains 50% pigment which makes it a weapon against skin imperfections economy covers acne lots of imitation vitiligo was a post bruising tattoos etc you guys I bought three shades because the color selection online was so shitty and I had googled like swatches of the colors who knows maybe none of them match me because I thought it was a really really tough color selection but so it comes like this in this golden little tube it has like that little sharp point so I'm assuming it's one of those that you like pop yep a little popper don't do poppers we literally just to do ad okay guys so I grabbed a couple shades of foundation this is in the shade 221 guys honestly the color selection was really really rough so I grabbed this shade right here I mix these two together 210 and 221 I mixed the two light shades out so we're gonna do so I'm going to take a little bit on my finger that's we're going with so oh yeah that feels very very viscous but also at the same time it does feel kind of lightweight shockingly so on my hand like when I'm feeling on my finger I'm like oh it feels pretty like wait I'm gonna dot it with my hand on the right side face I mean use a brush with other side I'm gonna use a sponge on this side so let's test if this really is the world's most full coverage as foundation let's see you guys live you guys need to let me know oh I think we are definitely getting somewhere with it okay artists you guys this is probably the most full color tension I've ever tried not gonna lie do you see that this is some drag honey this is some drag makeup okay honestly claims I am yeah I'm Chuck because this is honestly one of the most full coverage foundations I've ever tried and this is with using with a sponge I literally took the smallest little like pea not even a pea I'm sorry I took like a small ass amount and I just mix them together and that's what we got so now we're gonna take on a more feat m43 9 and I'm gonna try putting it on with this brush and not with a sponge and see how this one applies is apply more full coverage is a bite less who's know oh it looks so intense I'm actually taking a little bit down my neck as well I usually don't like to do liquids on my neck but I do have discoloration on my neck like it's like a ring I will I will get that checked out soon I really should get that checked dogs I don't know what the that is I'm soon honey this is some cake oh my gosh okay honestly I neck feels disgusting like yeah this is basically a full face of concealer my face has never looked so porcelain ever it's like insane how full coverage this is I couldn't even I can't even believe it really it's insane and the part that's tripping me out is that this is a more of a dewy finish as you guys can see like it's almost like a has a glowy finish it's not matte and I would think they have a more really intensely full coverage foundation we have more of a matte finish I don't know why my mind I just see it as being more matte it's a very dewy finish and I'm shaking to the core I'm just gonna set it real quick has it set I want it to crease I was gonna lightly set the rest of my face with our CMA no color powder and I have my verdict for this foundation and there we have it you guys this is the face completely set as you guys can see it has covered up literally everything god I can't even I can barely even see that mole barely my discoloration is gone I don't really see it in the camera on if you guys can but I can't see in the mirror I'm looking at I cannot see my discoloration on my neck uh this is really intense this is definitely the most intense foundation I've ever ever tried or ever worn it's literally as if I did a full face of full coverage concealer that is like the level of what this is right now it's so intense it feels pretty heavy on the skin doesn't feel very lightweight um even though it is a lighter weight consistency I was kind of shocked it wasn't as thick and intense as I thought it was it's a little bit more lightweight than I was expecting but it is like honestly like I think it looks really pretty and I think it's full coverage as and I think if you want a lot of coverage it's super super nice and for those of you guys who do have automatic skin or texturize skin or things like that like I do you know I get pimples all the time and I have textured skin I think this will really work for you guys and it's only 15 to 20 bucks I don't think that's very bad but the color selection sucks it really does I'm really bummed at about the color selection 220 which is like two shades away from the darkest color is like barely darker than my own face and I'm light so I think that's kind of annoying and I don't think that's very fair and I definitely think there should be more shades made for different skin tones but other than that I think that the foundation worked I think it's definitely the most full coverage foundation I've ever ever worn and if I'm sure if I had a tattoo that she would cover it up on the face I want to tend to but yeah you guys I hope you guys enjoyed this review and demo of this derma coal foundation it's very intense very full coverage very in-your-face but honestly I end up really really liking it and I think it's definitely definitely man MUA approved it's full coverage is awesome looking on the skin I look like a  porcelain mannequin and I live yeah guys anyway I'll leave it where to buy this linked down below I love you guys so much of grace tonight or day where you guys are and I'll catch you guys in my next video bye guys mwah my backgrounds holographic cuz I don't you can press that bitch in Han has that beautiful so far little speckle ahead or why huh that is a different language oh there you don't ache [Music] 
hey guys welcome back to my channel so it's been a fucking minute since I had filmed a video I've been gone I was in Bora Bora and right now when this is uploading I'm probably gonna be in Fiji I've been traveling so much in the month of August I'm basically home for a week and then in September I'm also traveling a lot because I'm doing drag con with Jeffery and Laura we're doing a meeting view together and a panel together and then I'm there for a week for Fashion Week I believe so it's gonna be a hectic ass month so today's video is going to be a review of video I do apologize if I'm doing a lot of review because recently I'm only here in LA for two days between my Bora Bora and VG trip and it's basically all I can really really really accomplish in the time frame that I have I can't really do full get writers with me like full-day videos right now so I need to be able to pre film like two to three in one day to be able to still be able to have content for you guys two times a week it's really really really really hard and I hope you guys do appreciate the fact that I kill myself to get these videos up for you guys but I really you know act like I want to you guys you know I feel like I owe the content to you guys I am a youtuber I am a youtuber first and I'm so grateful for them but it doesn't mean I can't put up content for you guys so uh that's why I do it so today's video what are we doing what is what is the review today guys we are going to be testing the farmer maker Dyer sk's di re si s il dire Sol faceshield we'll figure that out as we go along with the video but yeah you guys that today's video is going to be we're gonna be testing out this peel-off foundation is also put it as your base then you pay foundation on top and it becomes like a sealant I don't know how it works really but yeah you guys have you guys enjoyed today's video as always if you guys don't like this video if you guys do not like me please don't fucking watch it you know the drill with that but you guys do like this video please subscribe to my channel if you're not already and if you knew what's up a man um your way and welcome back to my channel let's get into this face shield peel-off foundation [Music] okay so let's go ahead and start on today's video so let's going to read what this bad bitch is is what it looks like and took a little box it's very Korean I was gonna call it face shield instead of Darcelle aware of the fuck facial can help reduce the amount of casual sebum produced by your skin and refresh your tired skin made in Korea okay and if it looks like right here it's like a cool little cute to be it has ten milliliters or 0.33 fluid ounces and it's basically a shield patch that soft skin problems we're gonna this big job so I bought this product on Amazon for $15 and it was free shipping so I got for 15 bucks so basically it says once the patch is firm you can apply makeup on top of it it's supposed to be a protective film over the face put it over all the areas that are porous areas that are more oily things like that so that's what we're gonna do guys hmmm smells like nothing we're safe too clear viscous fluid right there yeah this much and we're gonna put it on the skin oh this feels fucking weird Oh ciao woah cha ha it's cold all over this skin we're gonna put a pretty thin relatively thin layer nothing too intense oh my god guys if you're so fucking weird I'm gonna put on the areas I have the most intense pores and all my smile lines because we need to be able to see if it's gonna crack and you guys I have acne going on right now because uh I have been in Bora Bora and I've been using sunscreen every single day all day and it just been clogging my pores up and there no RAF okay looks like an oil slick I'm not really sure I don't really like the way it feels it's a very very very heavy feeling liquid it's not a lightweight thing by any means it feels like a mask so we're gonna let this dry down and see we're gonna put some foundation on top of it and see how it looks and see if it looks good is it gonna make our skin look more pretty it's gonna look more poreless it smells weird definitely so I'm like chatting with this dude on Instagram and like just casually just chatting on DM like hey dude what's up how are you kind of thing he's a really handsome guy and right now he's like I'm trying to get into YouTube would you if I post a tweet will you retweet it just feel like people trying to hit me up or right like they only talk to me because they think they can get something from me and it really really gets on my nerves nah man no no I don't play and see what I'm gonna say back that's see I'm not I don't know you like that okay guys we're almost drying we are almost dry even though we're so he's looking suck that doesn't look like a little bit drier I think we look fucking good fucking donut okay guys we are now dry on the face everything is dry I'm gonna take some of my fears foundation this is the coat Gendo foundation aqua foundation and a trusty ramona sponge we're gonna go on top I got more tan in bora-bora guys um which is shocking like you would never think I would get more tan so this is actually like a little life for me shocking love you can see like my vitiligo is much more prominent right now hey if you're new I'm an emu a I have vitiligo just random sign no but you can see much more intensely because I'm darker okay we're gonna put it on the skin okay so I'm lightly patting on the skin I can normally would and I see areas like on the like the corners of my face or here they are starting to lift already and the foundation is not even fucking dry yet another one I would close and personal look at the pores right here do you see this bullshit right there right here hella fucking broken up intense as fuck pores again okay so that's a flop so far when I wrinkle my forehead you can see this like weird little like film of like almost like a plastic bag ah fuck me look how ugly that looks do and honestly us fucking fucked we're starting to pull off now what I will say okay what I will say about it though as I'm pulling this off I can definitely tell that in the areas I have the face shield it's a little bit more smooth than the my skin so it definitely is smoother oh my god ah that's getting my baby ears okay so as you can see here foundation is completely gone it is just so weird I'm not taking this you know okay we're gonna keep we're gonna keep beside chillin we're gonna go ahead and apply a layer of powder on the right side and see how it acts with the layer of powder if it's more matte or not because I feel like it's very very very shiny even underneath the foundation it's so shiny I still look like a fucking donut man okay guys honestly it looks a lot worse with the powder on I'm not gonna lie it looks much cake here it much heavier oh my god please no ah when I was 18 did I think I was gonna be peeling off foundation off my face no sure didn't sure did now I'm just thinking about getting some dick just kidding that was straight back then right okay so what are my final thoughts on this a face shield of products I think that you guys should definitely save your fucking money I do think that when you put it over your poorest areas or over your pimples it doesn't gives you a flatter layer to place foundation on but the problem with this is that it cracks and it feels way too fast any kind of movement that you do on the face no matter where you put it I can tell even on the police's on my forehead I know it's super super shiny underneath and it's like you know that there's something there's like a type of a weird masky film underneath it so I just don't think that it's the most practical thing ever out of me say for me this is a Miss I really don't like how it looks and it's such a bitch to take off look at me I'm a fucking I will leave this link down below just in case you guys do you want to check it out you guys want to buy it I would not really suggest but maybe if you guys have a pimple on one area like a very very small pimple just like and that could work I guess just fine but I would definitely just fuck I just let the pimple live let it breathe let the bitch breathe and go away okay as always guys so grace for the night or day whoever you guys are and I will catch you guys in my next video bye you guys we're done we're good--we're Gucci Malcolm is gonna fucking take Hey look at my good eatin look at that shit it's fucking nasty I'm gonna go wash it off

hey guys welcome back to my channel so at today's video is going to be my current skincare favorites my current skincare routine what I do every single night before bed I get a lot of questions all the time about my skincare because I had to switch it up pretty often but I've come up to this routine that I've been using for the past ik 4 or 5 months and I absolutely love it and I have not gone astray from it and I have not been breaking out as much as I usually do which is really really really really why I've been sticking to this routine and I just really fucking love it so much and it really works for me very very very well so I noticed it would be kind of long because I'm going to be going through each step of what I do so I'm going to go ahead and go right into it as always if you guys want this video guys like me please don't fucking watch it you know the drill with that you know with that but you got eggs video please give it a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel if you want already and if you're new what's up I'm Annie Mui and welcome to my channel thank you so much for being here I really appreciate it today I'm wearing a mesh top a mesh shuddhi hi guys my name is Manny this is the color I like to be this is my real color great I'm happy we established that great let's go and move on to my current skincare so the first thing I like to do with my skincare routine is wash my face of course I wash the face every single day morning and night and what I used to wash my face is the Korres Greek yoghurt foaming facial cleanser so this is literally my fourth one that I've gone through I absolutely love this cleanser so much it's so gentle it does not strip my skin of any moisture it's absolutely amazing I literally have like two empty bottles in the bathroom right now I'm gonna go get it ha ha I told you I literally have so these two are completely empty and this one still has some product in it I absolutely love the Korres cleanser it takes up all the dirt and grime but it doesn't strip my skin whatsoever it feels very very very moisturizing it's just a beautiful face wash and I honestly would not have gone through 4 if I didn't love it to death this is my Heaven Sent for a cleanser so right after I cleanse with my foaming cleanser what I like to do is I take the tacha polished gentle rice enzyme powder and I exfoliate with this night and day this is literally like all I have left from this like I go through this motherfucker this is my second one I go through this literally so much because I use at night and day and it's meant to be used night and day so what you do it's a little powder as you can see a little powder and what I'd like to do is at one place is cleansed and wet I've dumped some of the powder in my hand make it emollient like you really want to like do this and scrub and make it into a actual foam that's what's gonna coil your skin you don't want it to be grainy like that's the great the granules are gonna be too harsh on the skin what you wanna do is you want to make it into a foam literally cleanse your skin as if you're cleansing it with a cleanser I just feel like this really exfoliates my skin so beautifully without being too harsh and it does not strip my skin again if you want a gentle exfoliator that's very very nice and it cleans your skin so well without it being too harsh check out the rice enzyme powder by tacha it's absolutely beautiful so my next step on dry skin once I've cleansed my skin I'm officially it's officially cleansed and clean and babies ask great so we're gonna do next is I'm gonna be taking the etosha the essence this is a new step for me I've been using for the past two months this is such a new concept to me leave an essence I never really heard of an essence I never tried in essence before I never really knew an essence was and so basically what it is it basically allows your other skincare to penetrate deeper that's kind of what it's for that's what was explained to me as so basically I do is I put this like two two pumps of it like boom boom on my hand do this and I literally press into the skin on dry skin press it into the skin and let it soak and absorb into my skin and allow my skin to basically just be more receptive to receiving the skin care that's coming next so basically this is like a catalyst this is a plumping skin softener 98.7% how to c3 anti-aging complex I had never used an essence before it and the glow thing about this too is like it you get so much bang for your buck in this product like I literally been using it for two months straight and I barely got do any product on if you guys can see in it it's kinda see I really do feel like it's a catalyst for my other skincare and it really really helps my other skincare penetrate even deeper obsessed so once my essence is on and I'm nice and plumped and ready for more skincare I go in with the lush tea tree water so what I love about the tea tree water it's a toner and I really really like to use this because I am oily and acne prone and tea tree is an agent to help prevent acne and help keep your oils at bay throughout the day thinking Brooks or very very very well if I feel like I'm getting a breakout happening I'll spray a little bit extra of the tea tree water on my face and I really really does help ensure that my skin does not break out as much as it could have because the teacher really keeps that acne at bay and it really fights the acne and I'm like thank God for tea tree Patrick was want to introduce me into chichi water and I was like girl girl I don't know how this works if you're dry because this is for more oily skin there's a little bit more of a harsher ingredient but I do use products that are so so so hydrating that I don't really notice it drying at all whatsoever like I couldn't really tell you because it doesn't really drive me out at all it just really helps prevent my acne from breaking through so what's like toners settled in and it starting to absorb into my skin I like to go in with my serum and my eye cream so what I like to use are these bad bitches are her I use the Kiehl's midnight eye recovery Kathleen was when I turned me on to this one it really really helps prevent darkness underneath my eyes that's all you really use it for I don't only use it for anti aging or wrinkles I just use it to prevent the darkness underneath my eyes and it really does help this like the third bottle I've gone through and I've noticed that when I'm using this I do notice less blue hue underneath my eyes I don't know how I don't know how restorative concentrate of essential oils and botanicals for fresher younger looking eyes I just feel like it really does restore my eyes and my time and I wake up and my eyes aren't as blue and puffy and gross as they could have been without it so I notice that when I am using this it really does work for the darkness underneath my eyes and for my serum I cannot live without this this is the Sunday Riley good jeans all-in-one lactic acid treatment this brightens exfoliates plumps lines reduces the appearance of hyperpigmentation and instantly boosts radiance literally all the fucking claims are true I talked about this in a favorites video recently this is my second bottle and it's almost gone yeah I uses every single night I really do notice a massive difference in my routine after I started using good jeans I don't know how it changed my skin so much I thought my skin looks more raining the lines of my skin have been diminished I feel like the pores have got a little bit smaller everything about this I feel like has really helped my skin care so much if you're looking for a good a serum that's a promise that I feel you're really gonna notice a difference in your skin like an actual real radiant different check out the Sunday Riley good jeans it's so fucking bomb all the things here I feel like this is like my favorite item honestly like it's just so good so once my serum and eye cream has settled into the skin it's looking very plump and beautiful and just chilling I'm gonna go in with Sunday Riley UFO oil this little bad bitch right here is a little green oil and I use it for fighting acne you guys might have acne prone skin I break out I have a breakout going on right here here like I have bumps on my skin I have a lot of texture and I do things because I really wanna prevent the texture from being much worse than it could possibly be and I found this oil this is for oily acne prone skin it's at 1.5% salicylic acid treatment oil doctor use my serum I put this all over the skin and let it settle into skin for about two minutes before I go with my next step I really do notice a huge difference with using this as well for acne if you guys are acne prone check this out it's a really really easy step and it really works so so well fast-acting quick-drying medicated oil clears acne and blackheads causing build-up and debris from congested pores for smoother blemish free skin oh we have some tea tree oil line into all these claims I feel our care completely true I really do feel like it clears out my pores makes my pores look a little bit smaller it clears out all the dead skin it really does actually worked and I feel like my blackheads are less noticeable and less there when I'm using this oil two or three drops of the whole face you're good to go amazing two more steps I know I'm sorry this is a very very very excessive nighttime skincare routine but it fucking worked I have not straight from it and it has not done me wrong that I've been honestly really really really really happy with my skin recently and I'm like I know it's this routine because I've not switched up anything after I put on my dry oil I'm gonna go in with a moisturizer this is the Kiehl's pure vitality skin renewing cream this is so so amazing I actually discover this over the last two months between all the steps what I actually change out the most is the moisturizer the moisturizer is the one that I like interchange between different brands but everything else I pretty much keep consistently the same the moisturizer is what I changed after I found the Kiehl's pure vitality renewing cream I haven't really switched out my moisturizer at all I've only been using this because it works so well this is infused with red ginseng root and manuka honey and it's reduce skin for smoother texture and healthier radiance I love a smooth radiant skin I love smooth radiant skin that is a gold mine that eyes honestly what I want to have smooth radiant skin is this a fucking heart is for fucking smooth radiant skin so I like to use products that will help me achieve the smooth radiant skin and manuka honey is also great for acne as well honestly notice that what I'm using this the next day my skin is so so plump and so smooth and it just feels so hydrated I mean is a heavier cream you don't need a lot of it at all you literally just get like a little tiny fucking and two peas sighs rub it in put into your face and massage it in it feels wonderful it's very heavy cream though if you guys are not into heavy moisturizers for nighttime I wouldn't really grab this because it is heavier of a cream but it really does like moisturize the shit out of you I absolutely love it and I would definitely suggest it I promise you it works very well and last but not least one more item one more item so the last step is this oil by Sunday Riley this is the Luna sleeping night oil this is a retinoid oil that reduces the appearance of pores and wrinkles while fighting the signs of premature aging and redness it said it all it said it all I know is that with this oil working hand-in-hand with the serum and with the other oils and with the essence I just feel like it really does help keep my smile lines at bay keep the lines underneath my eyes at bay I just feel like my skin has just been looking a lot more clear and pretty and radiant and I do really feel like it's because of the Nile after I used it once I couldn't stop using it I literally have gone through three of them it's so so good it's so plumping it's so hydrating and it does again it makes your skin smooth and it radiates your skin and that's all I fucking one amazing cure honestly of all the brands here Sunday Riley has really like beat the pussy up really just works so freaking while sunny Riley products I love you I wish this video is sponsored by Sunday Riley I work can pay for something you love it that's a goal that's goals right there Sunday Riley hit it boy up yeah you guys I hope you guys enjoyed this skin care routine what I've been using for my skin care I get a lot of questions about what my favorite sinker has been I've been getting a lot of comments when you guys say that my skin has been looking a little bit better than it usually is and I honestly thank you so much I really appreciate that so much I really really do that makes me feel so good but I do think that's because of this routine that I've been using and I know it's an excessive routine I understand that I really do it is so much and it's an expensive house routine and I get it but this is what's worked for me and you guys have been asking me what I personally use I'm not gonna just bring out some random drugstore moisturizer because it's cheap and I don't even use it you know what I mean like I understand that this is an expensive routine and I apologize for it but it does work for me and I'm not gonna lie about another product that I'm not using just to make someone happy you know I mean this is what I'm using this works for me and I wanted to share what it works for me to you guys and I hope you guys enjoy this video and hope you guys learn something from it and hope you guys can take some of these skin care items and actually use them if you guys want to honestly would suggest to go to Sephora get samples of them do not buy them full price right away they're expensive skin care is really expensive it's something you need an invest in but I feel like your skin will look great the makeup look great on top of your skin if you do in mesons skincare that works for you skin care is honestly about finding a routine that works for your skin it's not about like this routine for me it may work for being fantastically but it could not work for someone else I don't you know what I mean so this just works great for me and I hope it works well for you if you guys ever try any of these things and so I don't have any affiliates for any of these products I wish I did it would be so nice to be able to get you guys to code to save some money on the skincare because it skincare is fucking expensive but maybe that'll be a future thing maybe it maybe I can make an final code somehow or maybe a brand will want to do affiliate with me I don't know I don't know maybe but for now I don't have any codes for these brands and I apologize for that but they work they're amazing I'm not sponsored by any of these products either I wish I was a worship bitch was but I'm not these are just the things that work for me fantastically

some let's watch this bad boy right here so smooth a blush let's watch fortune which is like a highlighter oh they're so creamy ahaha that's brightest fuck I'm still gonna try to contour with that lost soul shade it doesn't work then it doesn't work I'm gonna try I'm taking on a y9 of course favorites contouring brush it's a matte shade I'm just gonna pray that it gives me a little bit of a contour lo some Sun okay contour shade is working a little bit of product clearly goes a very long way I barely dipped into it and boom like massive massive pigment where I'm like fucking trying to blend that shit out but as a that's a go right there guys a girl right here son this color itself that was actually really light like I was not expecting it to be such a light shade looking at this palette you guys I really would not really suggest this for darker complexions look it just doesn't look like it would work sucks to say that but I just really don't think you would I'm just being honest and I'm frying I might go I got a work that's big underneath this shit real quick because mommy's looking a little shit the contour works for me okay I'm light enough where it worked so it's going with that middle blush and going with Caribbean that middle guy huh that was literally two little dabs oh shit from you that is pigmented and so smooth that blends out like butter Paula Deen would be fuckin rolling in green right now for this shit okay I just watch the three highlighters I just want to see which I want to do at gold I think I want to do that really intense color right down golden color in the shade star reader more free and 510 this one's actually a really powdery flaky shade it's a very very very powdery as you can see it's like falling all over it the highlight itself is pretty subtle actually pigmented but it's pretty fucking subtle take a little bit a fortune on top yeah we got some Zahn for taking fortune comes out of the nose does she just looking brighter than my future damn mommy how much is this let's look let's look up how my connected looks guys so this palette is $30 which I feel is a very fair price for six shades it's five bucks each that's really really good as a prom than ready to go so now I'm going to be taking the palettes right here this is so cool looking and it's like a little compass treasure on the Stars I don't know with this sorry there's like a little extra thing here there's nothing in it maybe I can hide things in it I don't know like your virginity who knows but the palette looks like this color scheme not my thing let me do a little close-up shot so I can see what it looks like we're going to go in we're gonna go to suck in I'm going to be taking this morphe m57 six amazing blending brush and then I'm gonna take the shade a pirate's chest which looks like a really pretty apricot a transition shade looks like this on the brush right there I'm gonna take that into the crease yeah we did a pigmented if ready blend it out so easily - nice so I'm taking a little bit of the shade Menace which is a really dark like Foresti intense green on a more feet m57 for which like a pencil brush any pencil brush works great this is just a nice pointed white haired pencil brush I'm going to take that into the crease on the outer corner of course putting that into the crease as well a little bit be very careful with these kind of colors guys because they're kind of a bitch to blend out nothing to him because you don't want to look too muddy so we're gonna take that about halfway in and keep it really concentrated on the outer corner right out here this color from this palette is not that used to blend out you can definitely blend it out and get it there guys to the point where you want it to be just takes a little bit of patience so now we're going to do is want to go and cut out the crease a little bit take whatever product want to use to kind of cut out the crease I'm just gonna take a little bit more of the Mac painterly paint-pot because that's what I have as my base and now oh my god they came with a burst in it I'll take the brush I came with I'm gonna take the brush it fuckin came with so now I'm gonna take that shade see haze and I'm gonna put that and pack that right on top the Paint Pot shuffle with the fallout that's really real now go ahead and blend the two together so they look too harsh yes bitch fucking fucking snatched honey okay I'm gonna finish the other camera and I'll be right okay guys I'm back now I went ahead and I put on lashes and liner off of camera and this is what I look like so far I'm wearing the lashes by Kim Chi and cake face beauty these are in the style lion-hearted they are fucking sick these are drag these are a drag fucking lash and I live for it now we're going to go ahead and do the bottom lash line but for someone take a little bit of the shade shiver me like shiver me timbers on a little more feet Emma three to six and I'm gonna highlight the inner corner the shade and a little bit on the brow bone as well so this palette also came with a mini black eyeliner so therefore I just think I have to use it and I'm going with that in the waterline LBX creamy and then taking a little ether t6 I'm gonna blend out that black real quick and once we do that I'll blend it out we're going to take a little bit of the shade black pearl which looks like a really cool pearlescent bluish Brown reflect on that same brush I'm going to blend out that black with this one to kind of really tie in the whole kind of greenish look together well I was so real holy shit I just thought that guy okay guys so I finished my highlight this is what I turned out to be and I actually really fucking liked it I'm really done I look like this I think it's really really pretty it's like a smokey sea wench you know so now I'm taking this product this is a list and lipgloss in one duo in the shade risk it all that's the straight I bought it's literally like a lipstick and lip gloss in one that is not a lot of lipstick in here that's just my personal opinion I also grabbed the shade sparrow just kind of diffuse it a little okay combine and now I'm going take the glossy side which is like a purple Brown reflect which is looking really really really cool so this is the final makeup look you guys so let's go and see whether or not each item is worth the price or not hit or miss let's check it out okay so first items into a quick here miss done quickly the first item of course is the cheek palette reading this is a hit or a miss is it worth the $30 I think this is actually a hit I really enjoyed the powders I thought they were super super creamy super smooth very very nice I just seems that the color range is not the most vast for sure I just don't think it is but I do think that the quality of the products is very very nice and I would definitely recommend it the cheek palette second product is this bad oh my god how much is this tell it honest it's fine now so this palette is $52 and it comes with 18 shades so is this a hit or miss so I think this is worth the 52 I do not think this is worth of d2 only because of the shade range I just don't think it's that good I joined that such a range is really basic and I would not suggest buying this or $52 that's a fucking fuck ton the shadows of course do work and are definitely pretty under pigmented and they blend nicely as you can see but the shade range and the price it's too too weird so I definitely say that the palette itself is a Miss for me and last but not least are the little lippy lipstick and lip gloss duos let's see how much those costs these are the mod lip cream duo and these are $26 this one's actually really hard 26 26 26 isn't worth 26 I just feel like it's fair because it's a lipstick and a lip gloss and 26 is and not crazy for that for them both and the formula of the lipstick was really nice and it feels really nice on the list is very pigmented creamy I think that for $26 the low duo's are very much worth it I think it's a very very very fair price you get a lipstick and you get a glass for 26 bucks I think that's really fair and they're both a fucking pigmented feels very smooth glosses not sticky or goopy whatsoever it just feels nice on the lips so what I think about the glass duo's do I think that they're worth it I do think they are and they are definitely a hit for me yeah and that is it you guys that this my entire review on this pirate makeup by lorac Empire to the Caribbean I do think that this collection is really cool and I there was definitely some hits and there were some misses for me it's your guy just call whatever you guys want to do with your own money of course it's your call I just wanted to come on here and give you my personal opinion and whether or not I thought it was worth it or not so hope you guys enjoyed this video as always have a great for the night or day where you guys are and

so bye guys honesty times right now in the beauty community a rough a little rough I'm really tired of seeing other people's fathers bash each other and like I'm just started at the hate man not even for me I'm just seen in general like so so much aggression and the beauty community supposed to be like a happy place where we talk about really ugly but luckily there is of course of so much of love and positive area but there's no denying that there's been so much more hate you recently yeah I don't know what it is what do you what what change I'm even getting each of a lot longer than I oh yes and it definitely wasn't also YouTube's just changed so much it used to be like even the videos like the content used to be only tutorials but I get it like even myself I got gonna burn out on doing makeup tutorials every day only men is this thing right can we move on you know yeah I got tired with it too that's why don't do it like now I'm like I never like even do tutorials I just do like more like it raises me and I like show you know how I do a makeup I'm not ever relieved and I like to put a spin on it too late a full face of this and so just like a plain ol makeup squirrel again and again and again Oh peach perfect powder I know I know okay let's try it okay yeah peach powder okay not for me taste it taste it just let me do a little it's just like yes it tastes so good with the candy yeah we're fun dip yeah oh here we go I think you're being like fucking ratty and I mean disgusting fucking here we go you have to go there here we have you here again laurleen it's not getting a different color cuz I'm very yellow undertone more so and this is more pinky but yeah it doesn't really give me color same so what do you think I like it continue I like it mm-hmm it's a little like drawing looking on you yeah yeah okay so we're basically done on the base portion now we're gonna do some bronzer and it's not have any bronzer but I'm excited to talk about this drones or this is the limited edition hoola bronzer it's so cute we both partnered with benefit and we did this really cool Desert Island campaign and it was such a fun experience I will have shared together like a mouth uh-huh and blow with my first bronzer I ever owned so it's like a really warrior so organized yeah like 360 for me it just like nuts like when I was working in Sephora this is the first bronzer I ever got as a gratis yeah and so being I'm like the face of it for in Sephora it's like really nice and everything blows my fucking mind look pre-snap talking life so cute I chose a hoola bronzer specifically because I love the color I think it's such a beautiful like natural neutral color sure it's not too orange it's not too cool it's not too anything it just gives you a nice bronzy effect this is what makes it right here head a little brush so this is actually limited edition packaging so this is gonna be in Sephora for the next couple months I believe yeah it's a with you or is your precisely brow pencil has her face on it yep you guys go into Sephora and you see it just snap a pic and tag as we want to see have you been in support to see it yet No oh my god I'm so fucking we're going after this so I would say my favorite way to apply it is with a big fluffy brush so just getting it all over bronze and then of course you guys can use its little brush and if you guys want to just do a quick little precise application for example it has like more of a tapered brush you can do a little one to give it a quick I know I know okay guys so we also have the new peach peach FRA it's as happy fun this is a new highlighter they came out they came out with Rogers and blushes that are cream as well oh I didn't know that those you have to tell me what looks like yeah specially in person like the lights are so soft in here it kind of gives me something personal in person to see nothing so I really like the V in primary and the foundation a lot yeah but this one I'm not the biggest fan of unless it's like a real real natural yeah this is peach broth but you know what no it's not yeah yes please look good build it honestly yeah you don't even see them at shimmer do can you see it on me and I'm a lighter complexion so like a little bit like I see a little bit but it's not a blush I would do like we're all so I don't remit many of our deeper skin tones this one is called peach blur peach blur translucent smoothing finishing powder what you're kidding oh look what I did look what I did I couched it so you're telling me this is translucent powder trés is it smoothing finishing powder and peat infused with peach and sweet big cream I would never put this all over my face is shimmery but it definitely gives you a soft peach tone I would definitely not use that Peter I'm just so confused by this probably just being honest same okay I want to use as I late oh yes I have not tried this out yet i've swatched a load on my hand and i wasn't like not like blown away no do you know the color pop highlighting kids I suppose I'll do the darker one okay I'll do this Goldie what are you thinking um maybe this way you do that one let's do this this was really known looks really nice this isn't it's shiny as fuck but it's a really powdery oh it's thick I bet this is why me okay I'm gonna do the light gold try it that's pretty that's nice that's more like it like I like a blinding my light yeah it's pretty like that's blinding this gives off such an intense that's like golden sheen oh and I chose yeah that's like a white gold shit oh my god so nice on you gold would not look that good on me like more like you chose okay that's a hit for me yes I like it approved okay guys we have the new to face of peach mist mattifying a setting spray yes more matte but no spray you can smell other spray when you smell a lot of peach a to peachy oh it smells good it's almost fucking good nothing lying I'll mix a little bit with a touch of any because it is more mattifying I can't like other than the blush yeah it's pretty nice oh the highlight too but the rest of the products I love including the foundation that was great me too okay guys so next is brows in yukking he's that one but I have the new market brow pencil a brand new shit happens I'm so stoked actually love love love the component of it nine seconds really it looks really good I get the pencil side we need this please I'm like living doesn't my color let me see good oh yeah yeah that's better okay guys we're using ljubka okay so this color is a little still too light for me he's pretty much black huh okay guys so I'm thinking the color just doesn't really imagine me very much what do you think about the pencil is not bad at all I can't wait to try those like it is really like crits creamy yeah it's like small precise it's Miami I wanted like the NYX micro brow pencil no they're cheaper they're half the price of the NYX one Nixon 980 fucking dollars wow I'm so good I mean I definitely like my Anastasia brow Wiz over this one okay I just figure because I just feel like it applies a little bit better okay but for five bucks guys no I really don't think you can be that like it definitely gives you a nice yeah like brow age for sure look at that like that's pretty good so we have the brows on yes actually I'm really really liking the broad way I tried it out too on the end of this brow and it worked out very well girl that's how we end so what are you used for your eyes from my eyes I want to take V just peachy Matt damn two-faced really did that with my most

I did or not because what I did  shitty and I'll be really sad that I really buggins that if you love me in my shitty makeup so I decided to just film the intro without any makeup on so far and I'm gonna go ahead and film the video using only my left hand I am predominantly a right-handed person I do everything with my right hand right side of my body that's what I do everything with so I'm gonna be trying to do my full face using only my left hand my weak hand the hand I don't use for literally anything literally anything I wasn't doing this like imposing other than that like I don't use it for anything so we're going to try to do the full face using my left hand I'm very nervous I've seen achill people do this so far and they turned out so great and I'm like I'm gonna like I know I'm not gonna do good because my left hand is so weak I literally cannot do with this hand I can't write with this hand I can't I can barely wave with this hand like and it's already awkward come on

of weak now we're gonna go in with our foundation oh my god this is gonna plug in this is gonna be a trip this feels awkward but I did the no mirror challenge I did more coverage to make it look like I knew what I was doing and I feel like that's kind of I'm doing today I'm just gonna add more coverage and I feel unsafe about something and more coverage left-hand spray but the Vice I have to give you guys is when in doubt add more coverage pass to be deep this feels  wait I was I couldn't remember how I actually grabbed the buta motor that was weird okay so pounce the V bun in oh my god I feel

it's like a lot hello okay clean it up coke or I'm just much more forceful I've noticed with my left hand there's a lot more force a lot more power that goes into it slightly hurt myself a little bit more with this one Mac Studio Fix powder for the neck this feels wrong oh wait oh my gosh of all the moments this is the most weird wipe away any of the excess powder you might have on your face like

nose contour Oh idea I'll move my head what can you do when they come for you you know mmm it's terrible but you know what I think what we can do to really cheat the system is go ahead and took the nose a little bit just a little bit like I'm not good of a cook like 350-degree is nothing crazy just a quick 350 so I think with cooking the sides of the nose I think I can really make it work so let's go ahead and do the eyes now and the brows bug browses what I was like the most scared for an eyeliner come on come on it's me fine no I hate it I hate it I hate it we're gonna do we're gonna go for the really bushy brow today where are you even going with this manual honestly there's no hair up there that's happening oh that is happening currently now let's go into the right brow which I'm

stacked pairs of lashes right here as you can see they're great on the outer corner and I feel because of my wing is such a little nugget we're gonna go ahead and do that to accentuate the wing that I

hey guys welcome back to my channel so today's video I'm actually so excited to be filming this video I got this video idea from miss Laura Lee here on YouTube she did a full face using basically like beauty guru collaboration and brands so basically it's like beauty gurus have come out with brands and I've done collaborations with different brands and she did a full face using their products and I thought that was such a cool idea I wanted to do my own spin on that kind of video and I grabbed a bunch of different products here that I wanted to do a full face using collabs and influenced her own brand products just a side note I think it's really really important to show unity in the beauty community you know sometimes I feel like community it can be a really really like dark intense place where I feel like there's not a lot of support revolving a lot of people and a lot of like just  that goes on in our community I feel like this is a way that I'm trying to combat that and it doesn't eighteen I really want to show more initiative in the supporting the beauty community as a whole whether it's a big influencer or a smaller influencer it doesn't really matter to me I want to show us as much support as I can because this is the community I'm in and I really wanted to flourish and do really well and I'm very excited about it I think it's amazing that so many influencers have done so many amazing things as like the years have gone on you know what I mean it's been crazy but I actually decided to pull some products here that weren't as like seen or as used as often by using products that aren't as like conventional when it comes to like a beauty guru products you I mean I didn't want to take like products that are so so so overhyped and not overhyped for a bad reason they're overhyped as because they're good but I just want to take products out where as like talked about you know I mean I want to take some products that warrant as talked about as much and things that are new hope you guys enjoy today's video I'm so  excited if I was i'ma stop rambling because I talk fast as actually got caught in my last video that was like bitch you talked faster than my Mexican mom when she's mad at me and I'm like bitch that's fast you know the bitch is quick yeah you guys that's it for today's video as always if you guys don't like this video because don't like me please don't  watch it you know the drill with that please don't watch maybe you don't like me but if you guys do you like this video please go ahead subscribe to my channel if you're not already and if we knew what's up I'm Annie MUA and welcome to my channel this is the Manny act channel subscribe before you go now I'll be really cool if you wanted to subscribe here we are thirsty for water and thirsty for day [Music] okay so let's go ahead and get this video started so actually I really think out of the box for this one because there's a lot of products that was like  dude how am I gonna do a full face using collaborations or brands when there's like things like concealers and powders and foundations and I'm like oh my god primers so I decided to do was actually really think outside the box for this one and so for the primer I'm taking the benefit Porefessional primer it's not technically a collaboration with a brand but last year me Karen I left saw de Nicole Guerrero Jeffrey star and Laura Lee were all part of a big campaign and we collaborated on our favorite products with with benefit so Karen's collaboration was with professional so I'm like you know a bitch I'm gonna take that as a collaboration honey professional is one of my favorite primers of all time I use it literally all the time I travel with it that's why it looks so up and doesn't have a cap on it I travel with primers are hard what you guys I was like wait how the am I gonna pull a primer out of my asset now who's clad with the primer so next we're gonna do is rent go and grab some foundation so for foundation I'm gonna be taking the huda beauty foundation this is the flow filter high coverage cream foundation and if you guys don't know who the beauty is a because like on Instagram she's a beauty blogger first she created her own makeup line and now she has an entire makeup line called who the beauty of course and this is one of her products in it which is super super cool I have worn this foundation maybe one time because I got the wrong shade so ever since like I got the wrong shade I'm like I haven't got the right one so we're gonna go and put that all so pale  okay you know what it's fine we're gonna go anyways in the shade cashew in case you guys are wondering is it paler than my shade that's the real guide you know you guys already know I'd love to go more deep with my foundations know what's funny I'm rotting trying to be shady or anything like that this is just like a random sign no I tend to do I use huda beauty that often because I don't feel like on her brand page or in general with her brand I don't see a lot of support in the male Beauty community I don't see a lot of like posting men on her Instagram as I see over a lot of other brands doing it's just something I noticed so I noticed these kinds of things that I noticed when friends do not post boys and I notice when a brand is very very conservative with their promotions and I do get it like I do understand that buying makeup is much more of a woman's niche than it is for men men do it too and it does feel kind of shitty when a brand doesn't support that or your brand doesn't acknowledge it you know and I do get say who would abuse and a lot of us thought is really really nice but it is there something I've always noticed and I'm not trying to shade her in any way she reform and you know maybe because she does have a big middle-eastern following she doesn't want me to get hit on her pages or anything or something like that I don't  know so I tend to like not use her products as much because I just don't see as much love back in the male beauty community you know that men in beauty are not just a fad and that were  here to stay and that we're like doing things like oh my god but I didn't have a lot of options in the foundation realm you know I'm saying so now that were pale as pale can be weird ago and take some concealer so I was like I was really nervous about this one cuz I'm like I don't have a concealer that is like done by a beauty guru I've never seen a beauty guru clap and do a concealer I could literally ever but I remember bitch Kylie Jenner you know I might be thinking she's not a beauty guru and I get that she's not really a beauty guru but she's definitely a beauty icon at this point and she does have a YouTube channel where she's done makeup on her channel so I'm like you know what we're gonna go ahead and just count it so honestly like I had to think outside the box of this one again and this one is going to be using miss Kylie is concealer I'm literally taking that alight is considered a possible I can find just because I'm already so Kayla my foundation might as well be a pale bath bitch today I guess if you all don't think that she's a beauty guru or just a beauty world wake the up she is she's part of it I didn't think I can go any lighter than the foundation already wasn't wearing but bitch I thought wrong so funny cuz I feel like I'm actually really this pale like I'm a really light girl bitch I'm a light bitch but I just enjoy going a little bit deeper with my complexion civilities scuse me more about healthier appearance so now let's go ahead and take some powder and we're gonna powder up this face so for the powder I'm actually taking the Mac X Patrick Starr powder Pacha start clad with Mac last year and they created this powder and it's been a very popular powder in the community so I'm gonna go ahead and set my face lightly with this powder here this powder I would say is really good for oily or complexions because it keeps your oils up a very nicely I've worn it a couple times and it definitely keeps my oils bitch I'm not let's just say I'm not shiny after this like when I put this on bitch there's no shine so we're gonna use that to set the face I cannot wait to see what kind of collabs come out this year I'm very very very excited to see what different influencers and different brands have in store for us when it comes to collabs I'm sure clouds are not ending anytime soon I love a good Club you guys I live for a collab I try my best to support all the collab so that is what we're doing right here I'm just kind of powering around the premieres of my face a little bit taking off powder with my morphe two brushes just like honestly it's like really just good big powder brush if you guys are into like really fluffy powder brushes to apply powder or powder foundation or anything like that I would really highly suggest the morphe to remember any morphe brush you guys get this come with mani emulate she's a pusher oh my god like drugs probably y'all know I'm a pusher I don't push drugs but I push a code okay we are now set with the face and for the bronzer hey gave me some are you gonna be taking hoola bronzer by benefit me and benefit collaborated last year and we did hoola bronzer that's my face that's my gut eat that I'm gonna be taking this bronzer and putting it all over my nose another one that I was like  like what am I gonna do but we found her I'm just taking that same key to brush and lightly bronze ring maybe rods ring with the bun bronzing my face hoola bronzer is such a iconic staple in the beauty community bitch hula is everything and we have hula light now get back to reality bitch you're too pale to go that in right now usually it's totally fine for me by forget how light my foundation is right now so if you're as pale as I am currently at this state of foundation I would suggest hula light what took us a minute but we got there anyway you guys let's go ahead we walk to the contour I'm actually taking the k'kaw Beauty contour hit and the shade light bitch if y'all don't think miss Kim Kardashian is a beauty guru she's had some of the most influential Beauty looks in like the actual world so she's like changed the game technically he was Mario but Kim was the face that launched a thousand ships didn't take a little bit of that contour shade I was to put it right underneath the bronze are just a hair is really give us that Kim K luck okay we need to go ahead and just is this amount of powder unnecessary maybe how many minutes lately for this  mmm why is Shawn Mendes so fired John posted this I didn't see him right at this moment four minutes ago the bitch already has 140,000 likes for a good reason oh my god you guys I'm even wearing my Nicole lipstick NIC merch we got support all around here bitch you guys for blush I'm gonna be taking this guy out of you guys remember this this actually the Becca shimmering skin perfecter mineral blush split is like a champagne split Jacqueline Hill and Becca collaborate and they did these champagne splits and I'm gonna be taking the shade flower child cause it's literally one of my favorite blushes from Becca ever and if you guys don't hold hands on these they're this is amazing my favorite one was this one this is the champagne pop and if our child duo but I thought it'd be really fun to use this because I needed to brush it I'm like bitch I eat literally already use this all the time oh that color is perfect you guys do you know what I've been watching recently I just started up all over again Avatar The Last Airbender have you guys seen that show because I swear to god you have in me not my talk I sit down we are blushing like a bride uh we are blushing like a bride who is about to be left at the altar no I can't be like that it's February I have no David Valentine's Day I'm being cynical ignore me I'm gonna be taking the Anastacio armor easy highlighter you guys this highlighter this highlighter full on this I hate her it's literally like it goes from being subtle to blinding in three seconds probably faster oh my goodness oh my word I can't like I actually cannot I don't know if this videos coming out before the highlighter releases but it probably is and I swear to God if you don't pause this video and go buy the highlighter I will like this we'll get you there so I'm gonna keep that at that the highlighter is on the face I wanted to highlight my nose and like a little bit on the forehead with something else because this was my visa in 2017 this is the Jeffrey star X mani mu a highlighter in the shade eclipse this is our old pres our old thing this is literally like history this is history so me and Geoffrey collaborated last year and we also did it how later name Uranus like the colour is just beautiful and it's like the perfect nose highlighting color and of course as you guys know Geoffrey has his own brand just literally like killing two birds with one stone because I am an influencer Geoffrey's an influencer but he also has his own brand week lab you guys so now we're going do the brows and I was admitted to brows off camera because I always do brows on camera because I was like there's no brow products but there is miss Laura Lee and Laura's product was precisely brow pencil she literally was on the cover of the box and I'm taking precisely breath pencil and we're gonna using that on the brows today which I already be like I love this Robin so today I'm gonna take the shade number six thought is try it out buck this one's dry now you know why it's dried up I'm just gonna press a little bit harder okay now the product started melting my skin more I think it was just starting it out was a little rough though since Lord did the bra pads I also wanted to choose a brow gel and I would take the inacol Guerrero collab mm-hmm with benefit and we're taking gimme brow she collaborated with them to do gimme brow this is one of her favorite products and we're gonna go ahead and use gimme brow and set her in place his brow is on time out we are gonna sit her down you guys so now I'm gonna go eat some food and finish other Bravo camera I'll be right back so you guys are the brows are now officially honor the eyes are primed now we're ready to go in with the eye shadow you guys I've been wanting to use this so badly finally I'm about to so this is the Dominique Lotte palette this is from Chris's Dominique she came out with her own brand it's called it nominee cosmetics I believe it's not many cosmetics anyway you guys so this is the allotted palette I think it's beautifully done it's such a beautiful color scheme very wearable so I really wanted to do something with this today because it's okay you know again this is a another Beauty influencer brand product I'm just so exciting to me I get very excited about these things so you know I'm coming on my own brand it's very exciting and it's hard or seeing swatch will take the shade caramel we're gonna be taking out on a morphe m57 6 so we're gonna take the shade caramel we're gonna put that into the crease just like a very very light wash of the transition shade it's a very very pretty just classic caramel trend that called caramel for a good reason we're gonna put that into the crease not a base color down I really like to put transition shades down first and then I'll start to going with heavier colors and things like that I'm gonna do like a purple and blue I should the shades blend very beautifully and they feel like butter on the skin this is very very exciting congratulations Kristen again so we're gonna take the purple of the palette which is named double shot and this one when you put it in it picks up not too intensely it is of course a more of a powdery shade but usually like purples and things like that the ones that are a little more pigmented are a little bit more powdery so let's put that on to the outer corner of the eye I'll take down a morphe r39 blending brush I'm gonna put that into the crease oh that's so pigmented okay you guys so with this kind of color you want to go a little bit more light in hand because that's the word of god you will lose it you will lose it sounds easy to blend out a purple like it is to blend out like a soft brown you know so more cautious such a beautiful color oh my gosh mmm prep Alicia's Frigga let's just make myself go Loco y'all know I've been living for a cut crease recently so now I'm just layering that purple making a little bit deeper now I'm gonna go ahead and take a brush and carve out so I'm gonna go take that some of that Kylee concealer are really really pale shade and I'm gonna take this this is a Smashbox a lip brush I've been really loving it for carving out a crease and just like it makes it a lot easier for me because it is so tiny but it has a nice rounded end to it which I like literally like the palest concealer I got we're gonna go ahead and carve her Oh beautiful and I'm not saying cuz I did it I'm gonna take a little bit more of that double shot purple and we're gonna blend the two together a little bit and get one of a seamless moment right here and then taking a vanilla cream which is like more of a yellowy softer lighter color I'm gonna go ahead and Pat that and set the white and I'm packing that on with a morphe M 210 brush nice just lightweight Packers and like a super teeth to it I think it's like three dollars it might be a little wild for this one but it let's go and take a little bit of cold brew which is the blue turquoise shade looks cute it's not sloppy they thought it was gonna be I really like this it's so cute I was thinking if y'all want maybe a little bit of the gold glitter from Urban Decay and right between the cut crease and the purple get up a little bit of a gold flare what y'all think I just thinking gives it a little pop I know this product is not a collab with anyone but I just thought I would really fit nicely and it does I worked in thing to transition new shades caramel hazelnut things like that we're gonna go and just put that underneath the lash line I'm making it too heavy of a lash line the lower part I just kind of want to keep the focus on the top as you know I love a good table I'm so peacock II okay guys I go for the off camera and I'll be right back okay guys so now that we have our eyes completed I did eyeliner off of camera I could not find an eyeliner that someone had did with the brand I literally had no idea so I'm just taking the Kat Von D tattoo trooper liner come on to yourself is a beauty icon as well you don't mean so I figure I would use something in that realm so I use company beauty I don't want to put on some lashes and my lashes I mean we're for mascara and lashes so a mascara I want to take the Maybelline big mascara in the shade black this was a collaboration with makeup by Shayla technically it was already out but Shayla clad ended three colors she did I believe it was purple and blue and black and so I wanted to take the black shade was actually really crazy because like big shot is the campaign that I was in with Maybelline when I was their first male ambassador and it was so crazy and I was so happy to see that Kayla got a club with them after me and her were like the main models of the thing so I'm like a bitch if it went to any other person out even livid I'm so happy it went to Shayla for this collaboration with Maybelline grassle Sheila again so we're

Mom, when my product comes out you have to be in my videos. I'm gonna glam you with it. Hey guys welcome back to my channel! So today's video you guys, I have been  seeing at this type of video floating around for a minute now And I believe that Safiya Nygaard, I believe, is that is how you say her name?I know it's Safiya I actually met her at a dinner once and she was the sweetest! I thought she was amazing I think she actually started this video where she mixed all of her foundations together in to doing one Foundation on the face and recently I saw Laura Actually do and she inspired me to do it because I thought it looked so fun It literally look like a big-ass science experiment, and I was like I'm very intrigued. I literally have uh a lot of foundations here. Yeah, this is basically all my foundations I have at this place. Like my mom and dad like they have like all my stuff from San Diego So they have like my San Diego foundations technically over there But this is all these are all the ones I have here at my house in LA and I'm pretty sure this is gonna be Plenty this is a lot of foundations it's gonna Take me a minute to mix all of these together, and so I thought it'd be really fun to get a little bowl. I got my little mug here. Little wink. Are you f***ing kidding? It's cute its little tongue Actually this is Nikita when she's in Kpop form. That's what today's video is going to be. I was gonna sit here and just kind of mix together all my foundations. I thought it'd be super super fun. Thank you to Safiya and Laura for the inspiration. I'm excited to do this.But yeah guys That's going to be today's video. As always if you guys don't like this video, if you guys dont like me Please don't fuckin watch it. You know the drill with that But if you guys do like this video Please go ahead and subscribe to my channel if you're not already, and if you're new what's up I'm Manny MUA and welcome to my channel Thank you so much for being here. But yeah, lets go ahead and get into today's video. So what I decided to do is I'm actually going to kind of hig grig a situation here So you can actually see me filling up this cup with the product. I saw Laura Do this she like did like a little like mounting situation when she recorded looking down. It wasn't with her phone I think was like her iPhone or maybe her vlog camera. I don't really know. That's what I'm gonna be doing as well Honestly, it would be impossible to like dismount my camera do the whole thing I'm like no no no no no So we're gonna really try to make it work with the iPhone instead this has a great camera on it So why the fuck not? I'm gonna try to set this situation up and we're gonna literally just sit here and mix. We're gonna apply some primer because we Want to really make sure that we do this like hella right. You know we're doing this hella right and really fair So we're just gonna go in with the Bobbi Brown skin base We're gonna go the fuck off and just go in and just prime I'm very intrigued to see what the turnout of this is going to be I'm so so curious Let me also do a little bit of You're lucky I'm a cat, and I have cat-like reflexes. So imma do a little bit of porefessional in the t-zone. Because we have to give this Foundation or 40 foundations a shot. We're also gonna go ahead and count down how many foundations are in this We're gonna see how many foundations we put to mix in this bowl. Bowl and peanuts Laura says that. It makes me f***ing laugh. Great, so now we're gonna do a little hig grig and you'll see me doing the mixing There we fucking go, I mean it's not perfect, but uh it's something Okay.....Ahhhhhhhhh! Okay you guys. We finally finished mixing up the concoction. Tell me this does not look disgusting. I'm sorry, but for real this looks vile. I'm trying to destroy the chunks. You know there's chunks in there I'm trying to really mix it in I'm like okay We can then had some primer in here or what? And we can have more liquidy foundations. Huh okay? Oh my god I'm actually so excited I think we got the concoction to a point where it's more like frothy and smooth frothy I would never want to describe a foundation as frothy, that sounds disgusting. The moment of truth, we have a color here. Oh Bitch oh bitch we're going in now how much do I use? oh my god This is so pale, or is it so me? that's the guy do you see that chunk? Do you see that chunk I feel like I'm painting almost like I really do feel like an artist right now. I'm sorry I'm so fucking cunt like I can't help it. You know? okay now. We're gonna take our little Real Techniques beauty Feels like it's burning mm-hmm. Oh, it's because I just shaved oh, I'm like why are you burning? Okay, we're gonna go in. Uhhh oh my word Okay come on. Why is the color actually everything though? That's the gag of it all okay, so we have a full coverage here We have a full coverage Queen full coverage cunt. The gag of it all is that why am I actually living? Hmm, that's what I would like to know is why am I living for this right now. Why is the color? Something I'm living for the finish I'm living for, the coverage I'm living for Okay actually so I decided I wanted to grab a brush to go with like down the neck, and a little bit more on the face To add some more coverage i'm taking a morphe m4 39 by the way if you guys are ever interested in a brush That's really really good, not too expensive for like buffing out foundation and giving you like a really flawless finish I would really suggest the morphe m4 39 It's kind of amazing and it's only like, and I'm not saying only like it's really like it's inexpensive, But it's pretty affordable for a nice brush And of course you guys can use my code at morphe you all know this I mean by now come on y'all know I'm a morphe kind of girl, okay I don't like doing liquid down my neck, but I lost my Studio Fix foundation and the powder Technically the color is still like a little bit deeper than me. I'm not surprised cuz I like to go darker for foundation Oh my god, okay. I guess it's like different areas or giving me different chunks Different finishes. I'm gonna add a little bit more on the cheeks we can do it with the brush I don't know why I'm living for this so hard, like I actually am Okay, mix mix mix. Okay you guys, so this is the foundation right here and Honestly, I'm slightly blown away with how much I've been enjoying this. I'm shocked like it Literally is so beautiful has so much coverage it feels heavy on the skin not gonna lie I feel like there's definitely foundation on my skin. Definitely more on the Satiny side it's not dewy, it's definitely not like crazy dewy or anything like that. But it's definitely not matte either It's definitely a nice satin finnish with a nice a lot with a lot of coverage look at my fucking face Bitch look at this look it look up close so close okay ready We're not emphasizing the pores the pores don't look crazy. Coverage is there, let's go ahead and apply some concealer in Kylie ivory Right there, cause that's more of a warmer color, and we're gonna do some Kylie I wanna take a little bit of bone, and then we're gonna set it With powder, and then we will have our final verdict of what we think. I really like the Kylie concealers by the way. I really just love them. Do you know what's funny? Is that like I actually never watch I haven't watched one of them yet But a lot of people have been like comparing Kylie and Colourpop concealer saying they're similar I haven't tried them yet, but I didn't like the Colourpop concealer. So to me It's like confusing because I didn't really love the Colourpop ones I only tried it once though maybe I should try it again, and I do live for Kylie so I'm like mmm. Oh my god I'm so full coverage like I could actually scream. And the color looks f***ing good too. Y'all know I live for a good color. Okay guys, so what I'm thinking is what I'm gonna go ahead and do is I'm gonna check back in in a couple of hours and see where we are at with this foundation I'll know how I feel about a foundation in three hours like three hours is like my cutoff point where I'm like bitch I know if I like you if I don't like you so I'm gonna wait about 3 hours and See where we're at with this face and this foundation, so I'm gonna go ahead and just finish up my makeup And I'll be checking back in later on tonight to see what we think but so far so good Obviously, I'm mad as fuck right now because I just powdered everything, but how to give this shit a fair shot and honestly. I'm really living for her first impressions is I love it and I'll see you soon. Okay guys, what is up? I am officially back I've had my makeup on for about Three and a half hours now or really my foundation is on it's been on for about three 1/2 hours random side note today is actually the premiere of RuPaul's Drag Race all-stars so I'm going over to jails and Joey's right now, so I'm gonna get going But I'm gonna take off this makeup before but I just wanted to talk about this and do a quick little check-in technically It's the foundation to end all foundations like it's the accumulation of foundation on my face So this is what that face looks like up close. So we can see I am definitely a little bit more oily than I'm when I first started out of course My oils have started to seep through and I have a lot of texture going on right now on my cheeks over here I think I have like a little breakout happening but hey, you what can you do. It's still looking so pretty and honestly like I would have to say at the end of the Day this looked really great And I think mixing all the foundations was kind of genius and Safiya, you fucking killed it And it looks so incredible like I'm actually really happy with how mine turned out. And I still feel like I still have a matte finish it's not super glowy And I think it's because I feel like I have more matte foundations than I do dewy Foundations because I am more on the oily side, but I feel like it just looks really really good. Of course I'm getting a little bit oily in the t-zone, but I think it's a really pretty oily But not a fucked up oily where you're like. Oh god. Oh god All and all I would say that mixing all the foundations was a win for me I think it turned out so pretty. Anyway, You guys that is it for today's video I hope you guys had fun watching as always I will see you guys in my next video Have a great rest of the night, or day, wherever you guys are and I'll catch you guys in my next video bye guys I love you so much mua.

What's a pore bitch? I feel like Heavenly Father you know his tunes in the sky I Feel like he came down and blessed me with this fucking Gotti that he said let there be a paint and I said okay on The seventh day he said let there be makeup and I said That's right. I swear if someone doesn't turn on this AC I will kill a small village.

different Halloween makeup from the literally Halloween store it's a grant this random one a Hollywood when it got some Halloween makeup there's tons of different that they have there and I thought

paints I have like cream paints I'm gonna try to mix and get a foundation shade from we'll see how it turns out I don't really think you know but I think it's gonna be really really really really fun

deck out my backdrop so she did a little she got all these little goodies and everything we're gonna take this one I don't because I don't like it so yeah you guys we're gonna do today we're going to

was seven bucks so it's not too bad of a deal so pretty that's a pretty good deal actually because we clean paint so I figured what I was gonna do for effect my foundation and I want to combine that some cream paints to like make my like right color foundation shade let's see if we can make that happen I don't really know so let me just open up this real quick okay guys so we have our little cream palette right here and we have our little mixing palette that we're gonna be using here so we're gonna take some white cuz mommy the white ass bitch oh this is like really creamy okay so we're gonna take some white yeah how much do we take I have a big face whatever or take a little bit of brown I'm not as ghostly is worth you guys are thinking I'm gonna go a little bit of brown take a little bit of pink take a little bit of yellow or yellow undertone now we're taking a little bit of green like a hair a smidgen I think these are like the cars that you mix for a foundation is what we look like this is our cream color okay we are giving a color that does not resemble a foundation whatsoever holy  I'm gonna be so dark after this okay that's gray cool we have gray no so we mixed yellow white a little bit of pink a little bit of green and some brown and we have this color we have two going on right now which is not as bad as it was okay guys we're gonna do this I need it kinda not be like kinda eat it but it's fine it's for the video how funny this is gonna make me look so dead but that's probably gonna match my face better than what I normally match it to that's the dark side guys that's the that's the sad truth oh my god I can ugly this is kind of working what we instantly know it's a machine guys I know but I'm not like hating ya know I am I mean okay now we're gonna go and Pat it in with a more py6 oh this was so nasty like I don't think you guys understand how bad this feels on the skin and now we have to conceal that so we have to conceal conceal our feelings you know I'm just kidding you expressed feelings do you want you we're in take a little bit of the orange the white and the pink maybe a little bit of yellow too  this is hard it's more peachy cool why we got a little bit of a wider color we're gonna go and put that underneath it is you what this feels like underneath my eyes it feels like Greece feels like I'm about to start cooking a  chicken that's real yellow I didn't mix that part well whoo we're gonna blend it all in together guys and see what we got here was just a terrible idea maybe maybe let's take a little applicator a little sponge applicator from the thingy and put that anything I just blend that in we have no harsh lines or edges cuz we want to look smashed hunty okay why am I feeling so Kent now we're gonna contour taking our palette again we're gonna take a little bit of brown a little bit of gray a little bit of gray is I'm getting scary let's mix up stick it in see what you got okay that's a little more cool toned like we're getting someone here guys we're getting somewhere mix it on our finger right there right now this one we're just kind of more of a it's more of a prayer we're gonna pray to his stools that just turns out better than we think it's going to she rough she rough for sure I can't tell if it's the product that's patchy what is well that's a that's a fact it's patchi's  and it's coming off but my skin also has patches that don't pick up on product this is the harder part right here that blends it's so much nicer okay on the way I'm gonna try and even do something else oh that's cocky top round that is cookie that Brown for sure good blend we're gonna use a brush to blend guys cuz a brush with this I've noticed works the best as we can see any worse than best this is literally so funny like I cannot handle this right now we take a little bit of the pink and mix it with the red a little bit gonna make that our blush okay that's really good me dude that was really good me dude more so then I can blend out with the brush this is a brush that heals all this is the brush that heals it all oh she looks a wing I like that guy is she cute we have other makeup stuff we're gonna use for the highlight what we'll go back to her we'll go back to her uh-huh okay guys so I just forgot I had this but we have eight glitter set so we're gonna use this as our highlight or days a little good about wearing use this shade right here it's a glittery yellow we have to roll the punches your guys this isn't one of those moments we have to really roll we're really testing our scowl so we're you're using this uh iridescent yellow green glitter oh oh so the only the top layer has glitter oh not even the base wow this is so rough no it was everything was going so well okay so we have the highlight on it might be a little intense for some of us some of us maybe not some of us maybe so this carita is looking snatched by just volume on downstairs when I was emptying my memory card and she said Wow and the funny part is like the worst part of it all actually he's actually said that this looks better than some of the foundations that I've worn in past so in case you guys didn't know my mom's actually you savage and she hurts my feelings sometimes and I just had this one hit eighth wanna constantly know just try it oh so we are don't the face guys I think is all I can really do I don't really have any more option buy it we're gonna go ahead with on to the eyes now and do something sickening yeah okay guys so I got these little crayons that came with the kit came in the kit I'll see maybe I can use the black one for the brows we'll see how it goes let's just try it guys we're actually trying to look sickening do not forget sickening is the goal we're not trying look like a full up I'm just take any little spli and splay out the greasepaint that's in my brow right now you guys a memory guard to this as if I wasn't like already  okay guys we got the brows on okay so now we're gonna do the eye makeup guys this is where we're gonna it's gonna get a little hairy ah dude I don't know what to do with this okay we're gonna take black we're do smoky eye we're gonna take black cream paint from our little cream thing I'm gonna make this is our black base for a smoky eye we have black let's take a little bit of brown above that should we be using brushes for this I think taking the brown paint we're gonna put that right above the black we're a blend on this little fluffy brush the brown cream paint into the crease and blend her al hunty and if all else fails you can blend with your finger which is nice as well what I recommend going out like this probably not we have a smokey eye a little bit more black on the middle in we're gonna take this glittery shade with that right on top to give us a halo why I guess Oh we're gonna put the glitter all over the lid that's organ do you um what I recommend doing this no because this is some random-ass glitter from the Halloween store is this safe I don't know but I'm willing to risk it for this video also all the glitters are the same like you're tricking me you make me sing others pink glitter and green glitter and multi duo glitter they're all the  same as you can see on my eyes get a pencil we have a pencil let's see if we can't make it work as our little no don't touch my face hmm that looks ugly gonna take a little brush like this a little tiny pencil brush we're gonna wing around just blend that in with the lash line just blend her in yeah okay we have some wings on actually I see this beautiful you're dissin glittering flakes this is also calling my name now guys now we're just around we're take a little bit of this adhesive  what kinda accuse of is this oh oh my god I haven't never smelt something this vile in my existence I take a little bit of the he's on the back of our hand a little very very very little bit on the lid wow this smells like actual rotted flesh and they're gonna take the little iridescent flakes yeah but little flakes are on some more brown underneath tie the whole look together you know if you really want it to be cohesive you know we really want a nice seamless blend and if you have some fallout with the glitter it's okay cuz you're still beautiful I don't have mascara obviously this is does not have mascara I mean do some black paint but this tiny brush and will fake lower lashes at least cuz I don't have my ski around faking them till you make them looks like all good it's all good because we're gonna put lashes on we're gonna take some big ones from the dead dolly collection how about are they really oh really Wow I'm disappointed in myself man I'm really disappointed because I thought I was gonna kill it I just don't want to go hein like I don't understand why they're so shitty mm-hmm okay moving on to the lip and when we done I think what we need to do is over and create some  pigment please please don't stain my lips please we can really blind let's do a nude found it's like soft pink this lash is the wonky slot I've ever tried on and like literally doesn't want to bend but I don't understand what's wrong with the glass hey guys this is I'm getting who's gonna get the last okay guys and there we have it we have a full face using only Halloween store makeup and it looks like we only used Halloween store makeup usually I'm very very very adamant about trying to make us look you know very Chanel a very Tom Ford a very high-end even we don't have high-end products to use this case I flopped so this is actually really really hard a lot harder than I thought was gonna be I think the only part that I did like someone okay in was the base the lip isn't like terrible terrible but  it's rough it is rough eyes are the worst the actual worst so I would definitely challenge you guys to do this kind of thing I think it's really really fun it's really hard much harder than I thought was going to be I think if I had powdered shadows I could have made this work 100% I couldn't find any powder shadow at the fugging theme I was all pains it was all paints only so that was like the hardware that's the part I kind of flopped at all in the lashes to find different lashes buck the whole thing could have been a different story anyway guys hope you guys had fun watching this video I had so much fun creating it I think it's really fun I love October I think October is really really a fun ask month and it's so festive and creative and just such a fun time I'm not the best at doing Halloween makeup it's not really my forte I've never really been very good at it I usually have fun in experiment with me get more so in like a couple years ago when I was first starting out and I would try to do more weird things but I actually had like hours and hours and hours of time on my hands I don't really have as much time nowadays and I feel like sometimes like if the work if the look doesn't turn out I feel like it took a waste of my time you know so I have to like it out of that mindset and really try to get back into doing more just fun makeup just fun things just practicing a little bit more and getting better at the crafts that I am not always the best at you know I try my hardest but doesn't always work out that way I'm self-taught of course I'm learned from YouTube just like a lot of my fellow peers are and the space I learned from YouTube on how to do makeup learn from drag queens I learned from different beauty gurus and things like that so that's kind of how I did my makeup yeah this is hope you guys enjoyed today's video guys as always have a great rest of the night or day wherever you guys are and I will catch you guys in my next video bye guys hey guys

guys know that I literally do this every single one of my friends it's not just Jeffrey I do this to I do it to Laura I do to Joey I do it to Daniel I do it to literally Nikita Gaby I do it everyone in my life because for me when I repeat something that someone's saying it's just me and green with them and just enforcing what they said that's like how I see repeating I guess I never really knew I did it until this video happen and then all my friends were like oh yeah you totally do it to me and I'm like and you never you never thought and you never thought to bring it up to me no at the deads windings Center holes look at it and they edit me to be like nothing I was gonna say other things I'm sure if you guys watch these videos you guys won't you mean able to notice that I do this but this person caught on quick and made that coin cake like more like cake like smelling and I said it's cakey like it's a heavier feeling is this a video defending myself no I want a living slaw might be the main when I get to like hyper I get too tight or something like the veins pop [Music] same same I think that's my favourite of all crime embers I remember that part from the last I watched it expected

oh do we throw so many fucking videos holy shit that's the best my best friend right there that's green it's really pretty crazy everywhere I'll keep my eyes closed for sure all weekend is everything everything we'll give it okay well my right we can do it one more any quantity its blinded it was it really lies by me so loud so buddy [Music] exactly and that is it you guys I hope it was just as cringy for you as it was for me at the end of the day honestly I really don't give a fuck I think when the memes happen or when someone says something about me and it goes viral on Twitter or on YouTube or something like something happens and it's like a fun huge moment I think it's actually really fucking hilarious and it's like cool it is literally just more promo for me and for the people that are involved I don't mind very much and even if it is making fun of me I I make for myself every single day that's why I have bloopers in my videos that's why I fuck up in my videos and don't edit it out I don't mind at all like I literally do not mine I think it's funny I used to be so like people-pleaser crazy I used to really care and I was like oh my god I was like oh my god I as long as like I make them happy or as long as I make the audience happy or something like that but now I'm just like fuck it bro bug as long as I'm making myself happy and that's what really matters the more hanging out with Geoffrey the more hang out with Laura the morning I would talk to you with all of my friends the more I pick up on their lingo the more things I say that they say and I don't know why people try to come from me or come from my friends when like we talked similar to the other when it's like yo we're spending copious amounts of time together why would we not say the same things because we have the same inside jokes the same inside stories things like that so I just think it's pretty funny when people try to come for us like that cuz I'm like at the end of the day we're chilling at home having fun being close friends and that's all that really matters is having close friends and close people that you love in your life if you guys do this too please comment down

Im MannyMUA and welcome to my channel. Thank you for being here. Yeah, that's gonna get into this get on ready with me So I screenshotted some questions from you guys, and we're gonna go ahead and start off with the first question First question is from Angela Dolan, and it says if YouTube never existed, Where would you see yourself now? By the way, I love you so much. Well. Thank you, babe. I love you so much as well. By the way, I'm taking off my makeup using the bye-bye makeup balm. You guys know I love I love, love, love, love removing balms I love the Clinique one so much. I just ran out of that one, so I'm using this one right now I love them both though honestly. They're both fucking amazing a lash comes off a lash coming off So if YouTube never existed where would you see yourself now? Oooh, that's a good fucking question. Honestly guys if YouTube never existed I would probably still be in like the medical field or like I would be trying to reach out or do stuff in the medical field. I literally was going to school full-time. I got my bachelor's degree in health sciences. So I was already going to school for my science degree got it, and I was in the process of going to med school Or applying for med schools and make up kind of hit me in the face. That kind of like stopped me from Pursuing on that dream so if I didn't do YouTube that's probably the route I would be going it wasn't my passion. But I would that's probably what I would end up doing if I wasn't doing YouTube. Daniel Freita asks When are you gonna do Daniels make up? I'm gonna make it happen Daniel Preda, bitch, if you're watching this, I'm going to fucking glam the fuck out of you or we're gonna Do it get ready or something like we're going to do something together like we're gonna fucking film You little ratty ass rat. I fucking love you. I love Daniel and Joey so much. Ooh, okay! We got we got a cute one from Emily We have if a company offered you 1 million dollars to give an amazing review of a awful awful product Would you do it? And be honest! You guys this is a really great question it happens a lot in the beauty community This is like one of those where it's like who would you and actually you guys are gonna be shocked when you're applying anything Yeah, fucking right. I actually would not do it like I would not film I wouldn't film it like I just would not do it for example. I've made my career off of being honest I have made my career off of things that I love I actually truly love them And I feel like I love you guys Will use my affiliate code that you guys will buy things that I loved because I am honest about it And I'm not I don't give reviews because I get paid for it to be a better Like product than it really is I'm really honest. You know and even when I'm sponsored. I'm fucking honest I won't do a sponsorship that I don't like for me I've built my whole brand and built my whole entity off of being honest And I couldn't do a review on something and say it was amazing when it fucking sucked Reputation like my honesty would be shot who the fuck would ever trust me ever again after that you know I'm trying to come out with my Omega, Brannon trying to do my own fucking thing I'm not gonna like waste that opportunity on getting a quick buck like I'm just not and you guys always tell me so much about how you really really trust my opinion and How you guys wait for me to try something before you even buy it and I love that and I'm gonna keep it going like That so if someone offered me a million dollars to review a product that was fuckin trash what I do it no Okay, this I was getting asked so this is my most asked question of all the fucking ask Manny's on Twitter my most asked question is asking about Kyle and Whether or not mean Kyle Krieger would date and what's going on between us and are we dating and what the fuck is going on With me and Kyle right so you guys me and Kyle are Not dating we did do that video together where we kissed to Figure out what the chat the traffic tell we do the chapter sound together and a lot of people were like oh My god they were living they were living They've never seen me kiss a boy before and a lot of you guys were like You guys were gagged and it was so funny reading your guys's comments. I loved it so much I actually he used to have a huge crush on him. Thank you secondly. I got like a little crush on him whatever I don't think you ever those like ever really go away But he has his own thing going on like he has his own life. He has his own thing He has his people he's talking to and things like that He has his own dating life that he has and maybe in the future if the timing aligns up ever would we ever Date, I don't fucking know. I have no idea who the fuck knows man I I would totally date him, but right now has him now It's not it's not like we're not having and a lot of you guys I mean half my questions are about Kyle and asking if we're an item we are not an item um And it is what it is man. It is what it is He's a great guy and I wish him the Fucking best of everything and anything that he ever does a lot of guys do wonder about my dating life and be like Why don't you have a vicodin Ben, and I just don't sassy aive asks. What is your thoughts on cheaters, bitch? Cheaters you got the wrong bitch. I think cheaters fucking suck. I think cheaters are terrible I think that if you're a cheat You need to really really really evaluate your life, and I mean cheer when it comes to like a relationship I mean if you cheat on a test in school shame on you, but who fucking hasn't but I'm talking about personal I'm talking about cheating like in a relationship. I think that's so fucked up I can't even imagine cheating or getting cheated on out probably like fucking Call up in a ball and die this is a Q s question from Jeannie Hernandez if you were a drag queen What would your drag name be I love you. Well. I love you too, okay you guys I didn't tell this story because I've never told it online I don't think I've ever ever ever ever told this ah guys Gasp, but the first time I ever tried wearing makeup was for drag I actually went out and dragged before I actually became like Manny anyway her before I started doing makeup like That's a before I worked at Sephora It's like it was like literally like my first ever like wearing makeup experience ever was me going out and drag with some friends So we did Halloween of course we did a Halloween we we didn't save the Sailor Scouts I was Sailor Mercury so after that we thought was so much fun so our friend was actually going to be leaving um The state he was going to how it works like in the military. He was getting docked somewhere else I'm not really sure how that works But he was not gonna be in signing anymore so he decided that he wanted to do a drag outing and drag like going out Party all this one out and drag and I was like my first experience ever with makeup ever and that's kind of how I fell in love with day I was doing drag drag was the first thing I ever Did with makeup like it was the first tutorials ever wash was drag queens tutorials It wasn't a beauty influencers or anything like that. Yes, drag is a huge influence on my career Jennifer asks Are you and Jeffery going to do any more? collaborations so the answer to that is no me and Jeffery with the Uranus is our last collaboration our last part two of our collab I'm actually not coming out with any more collaborations until my brand comes out So I'm actually currently working on my own brand a lot of you guys do know this and originally it was gonna be one item But with packaging it's been such a fucking bitch, so I'm working on my second item right now And I'm so excited about my fucking first item I'm coming out with I can't really say exactly what it is because I'm not done with it. Yeah I'm like in the halfway process right now. I've worn a lot of it so far. I worn it on my Instagram I've not tagged it you guys have definitely seen me use it. I will say that the product itself I think it's a little bit different. It's a little bit fun. It's a little quirky. It's very it's like very mean It's so hard explain. What the product is without saying what it is I'm excited to write for my first product launch for my own brand. It's something that's gonna. Be really really fun and creative and gives me inspiration so that's what my first product is it's that thing that has given me so much inspiration in my past and my present and Something that really helps me express myself, so that's what it's going to be first I know it doesn't make any sense like with how I'm talking and last question from Mary What age were you when you had your first sexual experience I was 19 a month before my 20th birthday was my first sexual experience with a boy Just kidding guys that is it for today's video Thank you guys so much for asking me some questions and being along for the ride with me I just want to take off my makeup and just chill and chitchat with you guys I love you guys so fucking much don't forget to enter my giveaway I'll leave the information that linked down below about the giveaway, and yeah, I love you guys so much No grace of the night or day wherever you guys are and I will catch you guys in my next video.

I can't I can't talk too much about it. I'll see you guys later Yeah 
hey guys welcome back to my channel so what's up you guys today's video is going to be a review video and I'm so excited I'm so so excited to film this video because it is the world's first brow cushion I'm sure a lot of you guys have seen there have been so many different products that come out that are like cushion products so it's like foundation that's like in a cushion or it's a primer that's Ana cushion or bronzer or blush or highlighter and like a little cushion that you like hold it you press down and it literally feels like a little sponge and so this is no different iconic London came out with a Moroccan and I'm so curious about this because I've never seen anything like this eyebrow cushion I'm like what the fuck like bitch that's like little use a little sponge do you see the shit oh delivery guys as you can see it's literally a little sponge so fucking weird and I'm like you know what this looks like really really fun and I really wanted to try it out I've been very very intrigued by it iconic lemon have such a beautiful products they had like that really really nice illuminator that I used in a couple videos back and it was so nice I was like do I need to give them a try so I left my brows completely empty so we were going to fill in the brow and see how we like this a brow cushion I'm very intrigued by this guy so that's what's a zero is going to be as always if you guys do not this video if you guys do not like me please don't fucking watch it you know the drill with that but you guys that do like this video please go ahead and give it a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel if you're not already and yeah guys let's go ahead and get in to this brow cushion demo video review thank okay guys so let's read on the product really quickly before we start getting in to it we have the a'course iconic London limited edition sculpt and boosts eyebrow cushion it retails for $39 which is a higher price point actually that's a pretty high price point not gonna lie so I believe it comes in three different types of shades it comes with a medium a fair and a deep shade so this guy comes with six grams of product which actually is a great amount that's great what you do is you use a little brush that it comes with which looks like this which is really cool that it comes with a little brush comes with a spoolie and it comes with a brush you use this applicator use the brush end of the applicator to brush your natural eyebrows into place so balance the angled brush and okay great I'm so excited just try it so you guys we're gonna go in we have this logo right here it looks like a cushion it's a cushion I'm gonna go in with the brush just gonna dip in and we're just gonna start to lightly feather this this is it's a very quick drying formula so you can layer if you guys want to so this is well looks like so far I'm starting to build on and pile on the color where the pressure is going on a very smooth it's literally like going on like water if that makes any sense I'm like this is the most liquidy thing I've ever gone in on my brows with ever and the brush it comes with it's actually pretty good it really does angle it quite nicely it's very very small I'm kind of living and I'm using it the medium don't even thought you have to be careful though because this can go awry real but look at that look at that it can go awry it's gonna move around until it dries fully so be careful with that the part that is kind of annoying is right here it starts to get a little bit streaky so I'm sorry there so right there it's streaky right there it's tricky like this product doesn't go on full pick it gives you like a little bit of leeway so this is one of those things where I would actually prefer to go on a little bit more intense and a little bit more full coverage and not as like streaky because it does leave you streaks in your brow which of course is not the luck just knots not the look tiny it's not the look okay let me quickly go ahead and clean up this brow because I feel like she's getting a little messy okay guys so this is the brow so far I don't know man I'm not like living in truly I'm really not I think it's kinda hard to use but what we're gonna do is I'm gonna go in with the deep one and see if that makes a difference because I do think because I am using the the medium maybe that has something to do with it like maybe that's why it's making it a little harder for me let's go and try to go in with the deeper one and use that to outline and do like the darker moments I thought I like this brush I think that I need something a little bit longer for me yeah it works but I think that view to get optimal usage out of the product itself I would use a different brush bitch that she got Nast which means that it would last a long time on the face which is good I'm over here kind of filling in a patchiness with the darker shade which is working though it's kind of fixing the problem right there this needs to be longer and less fat that's another thing too I just noticed this needs to be much longer okay guys so this is the brow so far this is all we got I think we finally got it there it was not the easiest thing to achieve doesn't just see like it the more like if you go over it trying to pile on more color it takes off the color underneath which is frustrating me that's the part that's getting me pissed because I feel like it didn't do that I would actually be liking it a lot more but the brow on camera it looks sickening there's no denying it I actually really do like all the brow Lux but I don't know it's frustrating me okay I'm gonna finish other brows off of camera and I'll be right back okay guys so she just got this brow on right now we're here the left one I put on off of camera so I used the Anastasio number twelve brush and it went on so much better than using the brush that it came with so that is something I wanted to note in for us right now that it went on so much easier so much better so much smoother using a different type of brush one that is like a little bit thicker a little bit more dense and a longer spoolie like I was saying earlier I don't think they're very even I feel that this is a little bit hard to manipulate I think it's not very user friendly so for example if you are a beginner or someone that doesn't do the brows that often I think this is gonna be actually really really hard for you because the formula itself is so lightweight any little movement can really fuck you up truly and I'll just go all over the place and when you're blending out the brow continuously the product underneath it will lift off and it becomes like really really patchy and streaky that it's kind of an annoying thing that I am noticing I have to kind of read go over it with a smaller detail brush it gets out to like lay down the product at the ends so it doesn't become streaky the side has gotten a little bit streaky as I have continued on but girl dust I feel like it's kind of unavoidable at this point I feel like it's a little bit unavoidable so the cons to me with the pro wise I really do think that the color turned out really nicely and it feels like it's very dry on the brow I bet this shit would last you like oh three days on your skin like it just feels very very like it's not going anywhere I mean look I try to wipe off the fucking gun from my finger and that shit's still there like it's not gonna come off easily I can't have you fucking tell even on the box is said to use oil to remove so I'm like oh so those are the pros I think it's gonna last a really long time on the brow finally on nice and I do with like how it looks now kind of it's not like my favorite brow product so I decided to do guys is I'm actually gonna go out I have plans later on tonight I'm gonna go eat dinner with some friends and then go to the movies and I'm gonna come back later on tonight and I'm gonna keep the makeup on I'm gonna keep my brows on at least the brows and I tell you guys how they lasted throughout the next couple hours and see if they faded how they look you guys aren't able to tell me on camera I see how they look on camera and we'll do a check-in to see what we think of the brows and how they turned out I don't know Matt I feel like this is like the old school brow I used to do like it's so fucking sharp and so like intense I always see you guys very shortly prepare yourself or make it double just kidding I saw you guys we were doing a quick check-in on the browser now they are still on and what do you think of them it was it was difficult to apply but it still looks good we went to dinner we watched a movie everything's still on like exactly how I left it just so oily it looks like your skin we have sister James Charles Brody and we have Tyler anyway guys the brows are looking pretty good they're not like touch it no okay anything cool we'll see like that was like trying really really hard that's a good sign that's pretty good yeah whoa so guys I'll check in a couple of next what is up you guys so I'm finally back I know it's been like a two seconds for you and it's for me it's been about seven hours since I have applied at this product it is currently 112 in the morning I can see that it's literally 1 12 in the morning pretty late I actually filmed that like around 7 the bitch is going fucking strong here ok so this is a moment I know you guys saw on the clip but here there's a little spot that's missing edges here and that wasn't it with Nikita using her nail to kind of like go like this and see what happened and of course a little part of it did come off because it is like a dried product on your skin you're gonna scratch away at it it will come off hopefully other than that you guys it stayed on so absolutely well I feel like it looks completely the same and you can see there's still so much product left in the brow even if you did wipe it hard I really do think that this product stayed on my face very very very well that looks pretty good like it looks pretty good for six hours of wear bitch I'm not mad like I'm not mad like you can be like this and nothing's going anywhere like it really is truly dried down very nicely and there's no product on my fingers either yeah you guys I think we have the final verdict ok guys so all in all what did I think of the iconic London brow cushion so this are my price point it's $39 so ok like 40 bucks plus tax like plus tax plus shipping it'll probably end up being around 50 bucks I already I'm sorry is too high of a price point that is not what I'm jamming with on associate dip brow is like 20 bucks so that already is like mmm absolutely not I just come with 2 colors so it's kind of like so I would say the price point is already way too high product itself going on it's actually really really hard to use it's not the most user-friendly I think it's because it's so liquidy it gets all over the place it's not like something you can put down and like manipulate while it's down it's like you have to know and be sure why are you putting it down because it's going to get there it's liquidy it's going to move all over the place so you need to be very sure of it the actual applicator itself it's too short to actually get a good grasp on it and it's a little bit too long weird like it applies to long and saw thick and dense enough I do think that it looked beautiful on the brows my friends were all complimenting me saying how good my brows looked on like the brows Holly on like the product itself in the brow looked amazing the way dry down it looked absolutely great everyone was saying that and it lasted a very very very long time and I that packaging is cute it does come with a mirror it comes with little compartment for the brush you get your little thing which is covered with a little plastic container which is great it really I'm happy they did that and this is made in China and PRC whenever something says made in PRC by the way it's made in China the mirror is fantastic by the way I mean it's great oh my god I'm such an oil slick and disastrous mess I haven't touched on my foundation one time all in all I think the product worked really really well but is it worth the price from all I don't think it's worth the price I think it's too expensive at 50 bucks it's just a little bit too far out there but the product worked so well so this is something for you guys like I'm not gonna say it was hit or miss cuz it really for me it was a hit it worked but there's so many different things that play into it like the price point usability on it when you're actually applying it on the brow how easy it is how it lasts on your brow how it looks when it's on there's a lot of moving parts guys to me it was a hit but for you guys it could totally be a Miss because of the price point being is so high and I totally understand it's very very very expensive and I really don't think that it is worth $50 I would pay 25 bucks this is a cushion fucking brow park it's so unique in so weird but I really like that about it I wanted to review it and if you guys aren't into like weird quirky products like that I think you guys would enjoy it a lot but yeah you guys that's it for today's video hope you guys enjoyed it and had fun watching you guys know I love doing reviews cuz there's such a fun intricate process of being a beauty youtuber is like getting to do reviews on weird-ass shit that you're like is this gonna work or there's gonna

already primed my face by the way and let's go in with the foundation what this video is mostly about and so this is the NARS radiant long wear foundation let me give you all the deets on the foundation and then give you guys that deep this is a 16 hour wear foundation with 33 shades that's narses biggest shade range they've ever came out with so that's really really exciting and so awesome for you guys NARS it's supposed to give you a full coverage with a natural radiant finish basically think of it as like the radiant screaming concealer and like a full bottle form that's not Nikita explained it to me I was like No so we're gonna go in with the shade Vienna 4.5 light and I'm gonna try this one when I do do it three pumps right here right so as I'm saying right here we have as like a nice consistency - it's not too heavy but it's not too thin either which I really really enjoy let's go in with a morphe M 439 great foundation brush let's go on Ian I'm excited so this is supposed to be oh but I supposed to be a full coverage without the heavy full coverage feeling so that's kind of what it was described as honestly like as I'm putting on my skin it feels like nothing so which is that's already like I'm so excited about I kid you know I feel like this is like just packed with ultra pigments so that's why oh my god it looks sickening oh my gosh she said this is like her go-to foundation like it's been her coach at foundation since you got a sample of it in New York during Fashion Week with NARS and I was like no and she said yes so thank you nurse for wanting to partner with me in this video to test out your new foundation because I've been really dying to try it out anyway so I'm gonna use a little beauty sponge to do the nose I always just like doing a beauty sponge on my nose cuz I feel like it just looks more pretty also this guy is sweat resistant transfer resistant and it also resists oxidization so actually stays the true color when you put it on honestly you guys for some pressure I think that this is stunning I really truly do I'm so happy that this looks so good like I really really every look stunning to me like I love it it doesn't I would not partner with NARS if I didn't think I was gonna love this I used to love wearing my foundations and I worked at Sephora so I'm like y'all have such good enough foundations I need trying I also love this point delivers a weightless feel with superior blend ability for an impeccable effort that looks natural like skin never drying never cakey bitch I believe it I think you all know first impressions so far this is a hit so now that we have the foundation on I wanted to go in with the kaity concealers I've used these twice now and I really wanted to get more of a fair like keep testing them out to see what I think about them so these are $20 when I first tried it out I really really liked them so I want to keep testing them out and see what are my continuous thoughts honestly I'm living like I actually live where it's gonna be real radiant today because this cuz you already didn't finish as well oh she's a drag queen tonigh Oh hunty she's a queen now go ahead and set everything in place with whatever you want to use I'm gonna take my Charlotte Tilbury airbrush finishing powder because this is like my go-to so I'm gonna set all the high points with the shade one and I set the perimeters with the shade two basically everywhere that I put concealer shade one and show you everywhere else you guys honestly this face is beat and I'm obsessed like with how everything looks NARS you guys really did that really damn so that would just be fun for us to sit down to chat and talk about life and how things are ghia healing you know I'm saying how is your guys's holidays going do you guys celebrate Christmas do celebrate Hanukkah Kwanzaa New Year's what do you all have to like what are you guys to do during the holidays like what is you guys's traditions if you have a family tradition what do you guys celebrate during the time for me I know this year we're gonna be going down to San Diego to visit my little brother of course he lives in San Diego stole actually for us during Christmas Eve we opened all the presents I thought that's like a very Mexican thing to do like I know a lot of other Mexican families like that opened their presents on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day like the Santa ones you know I'm saying on my dad's side we do like a Secret Santa situation like every single year we do like Secret Santa and we're like okay bitch who the did you get which cousin did you get I love it I don't know I love like family traditions and things like that they're so fun Robert like a family traditions kind of family actually we never really did much traditions ever but parents are cool [Music] okay next new product we have going on right now we have these new L'Oreal True Match highlighter pellets L'Oreal really stepping it up bro and we also have these shimmery stones like little like loose powders this is sick like for a drugstore Bren to come out with these kind of things this is  cool a moon kissed absolutely not they just felt really you know good chunky flaky just not cute so let's go for these let's try these out look at this one of me a little harder for me cuz I'm like so here look this woman here this is what I'm talking about L'Oreal this is what I'm talking about I wanted from these but that was chunky and nasty these remind me so much I like the Kylie cosmetics and color pop like the artist could tour those like loose powders that are really shimmery and intense we're gonna take moon light I believe it's called Oh stun it's just like hella lit though like this is like blue I like a bluish reflect to it because this one is actually too dark for a skin that will show up like this was stuff like that all my skin like it'll be way too dark and moonlight is like green and blue and purple Nori's instead we're gonna use the NARS double take man ray highlighter Nash's are being sweet in partner I mean why not give him some extra love this actually looks I needed something beautiful something gold something solid oh my word man ray excuse the hell out of me sir you did that yes you did well I like about this one a lot it's buildable it builds to something blinding but you can do like a subtle soft layer and it will be like just like beautiful and lightweight like I love that about this one she's feeling really snatched and I'm living it so I'm gonna go ahead and do the brows off camera real quick now we'll come back we will do the eyes and the Lupe's alrighty then I just watched Ace Ventura for the first time ever and now I'm like living for  that movie uh so good you guys so we have the brows on there's a quick little brow fill nothing too intense nothing too crazy let me go ahead and zoom you on to get into this mug okay so now we're gonna go and talk about the new wanted palette by nurse it's beautiful I'm not gonna lie it's s so here we have 12 shades for finishes we have a buttery matte shades of shimmers metallics and lustrous satin shades as well and I believe at 10 of these guys are limited edition shades I just like this power lot because I feel like it's very very diverse like you get a good variety of clothes in here and you can actually get all you can actually accomplish an entire look I get frustrated with palettes that don't give you the big transition colors that don't give you enough lid colors and things like that so I'm really pleased with this one that gives you everything that you could need to create different types of looks I want to swatch a couple of them real quick let's do this one just like oh that's unique so three metal shades right here let's do it matte as well you guys these are really nice we got one swipe right here these are all obviously all metallic shades I'm feeling festive this is also a new formula for NARS so this is a pure pigment formula which gives you like the ultimate color payoff I just really like the shade range and I feel like you can be any skin tone any color well you'll find something that won't work for you in this palette so cute little on-the-go palette watt Ted okay now we're gonna go and do it iLook with it I'm not really exactly sure what kind look I want to do this color though is like right here this Shane makes me gag so bad looking it okay you know what we're gonna just start going in we're gonna start playing with the colors and then I'll start to decide as I dwindle alone okay we're taking morphe m53 three okay guys we're gonna go right on in one take this shade right here this beautiful neutral Brown match my name morphe m-53 three this shade is I believe seven have in the crease that is already primed and beautiful a little pocket right there see that beautiful pocket that I have so effortless to blend so happy about that so now we're go in with shadow Hill which is a really beautiful warmer Brown on a morphe r39 great brush for applying shadow and blending because these shadows are so buttery and soft like they're just nice to like they're just  nice mmm beautiful I love it now it's gonna get tricky I don't really know exactly I want to do really new actually you know what I think I'm gonna go with something just pretty and actually very holiday so I'm gonna go in with this shade up here this beautiful champagne stunning shade I'm gonna put that onto the lid and that shade I believe is called delirium so I'm gonna go in with the shade delirium right here I'm gonna put that onto the lid uh it's so beautiful and I'm gonna do something more festive on the lower lash line and we're gonna make this holiday 8s because this is the top of the ice so far and I'm literally living and breathing for it and I wanna take a little bit of coconut grove which is this really dark chocolaty Brown doesn't go in the outer corner just a deeply everything uh-oh that's a dark shade I'm taking different brushes things we're taking that autumn or if you are 40:1 it's a very very very deep brown almost black shade and this is just going to accentuate the outer corner like everything a little bit deeper okay so we finished at the top of the eye this is what it looks like so far just a really pretty winged out situation going on just mmm now I'm gonna finish the other eye off of camera and I'll be right back okay so these are the tops of the eyes so far so we got going in classic gorgeous champagne smoky stunning so now what I'm gonna do I'm gonna do a little bit more of a maroon a lower lash line just to kind of keep it more festive and little more warm we're taking a brown eyeliner and a brown eyeliner that you guys have works great I'm just gonna be taking me Marc Jacobs a rokoko eyeliner is my favorite one in the lower lashlines like a shimmery bronzy brown just give me that smoky definition without being too harsh and like a black shade so I'm gonna take the shade wicked game we took a beautiful cranberry and I'm gonna put out my lower lash line and I'm gonna deep it on the outer corner just to give it that fast to be look but I wanted to keep it very fun and fall so now that we have our base color down this is the base color for the lower lash line and take that same a36 pencil brush I'm going to mix temptress and coconut grove which is this warm shade and this cocoa mean deep shade I'll put on the outer corner make sure we really keep that deep out there and we have a cute little holiday moment going on right now so I wanna take this really pretty pinky satin shade which is called that is a little bit it's not like a crazy intense shadow it literally just cuz a soft Sheen do that there's a beautiful little subtle thing that is going on it with a morphe one six seven okay so now that the eyes are done I'm gonna go ahead put some mascara and lashes off of camera and I'll be right back okay guys and this is the final I look that we have going on using the warm today palette I love how it turned out I think it's so pretty I think this is a really really cool way to incorporate a little bit of color during the holidays you know holidays are filled with reds and greens and golds and things like that's not what I thought really fun pretty champagne on the lid with a little bit of maroon red and on the bottom but I'm making it to red where it's like scary looking where people were like being too intimidated so I think using a chocolate brown in the waterline really really really helps keep it looking a little bit more wearable you know and I think that turned out great I think this is a really fun look or the holiday season to incorporate a little bit of colors now that we're done with that we are going to go ahead and do the lip that we will be done I'm gonna take this colour-pop lippie pencil and I'm gonna take this in the shade BFF - I'm just gonna do a quick lip line cuz I really really really want to use the Kim kardashian-west Beauty rose gold lip gloss things I wasn't mean okay okay this is the liquid just a little so far we're gonna test the loss and I'm taking the shade rose-gold like I said earlier this is a lot okay gonna have to fill in the whole lip with the pencil now we can use the glass it feels good it's a little sticky it's not too bad bad though and that's what you guys that's it for today's entire video this is a look we came out with using the goodies we didn't taste video honestly I feel like my face looks completely snatched to a ground and I'm literally living only that didn't really work for me was the L'Oreal products like to Lauri a little glow palette everything else worked really nicely everything looks really pretty

hey guys welcome back to my channel anyway you guys today's video is going to be a testing Sephora's lowest rated products video I've seen this video floating around a ton I honnestly have no idea who started out this trend I truly have literally no idea who started this if you guys can comment them down below who started this video first I'll be really really cool it's just a cool idea so basically what it is it's going out to Sephora or if you have products here that are on Sephora's lowest rated list and it's actually kind of hard to do this it took me literally like an hour to pull all the products you go to Sephora or the website whatever it is you go to top rated and you scroll all the way down to the lowest rated and spectrum of things and I was like what do we do how do we do this and they're gonna be like how low are the ratings and honestly those are for ratings aren't that low which is kind of shocking to me at first I was a little confused cuz everything was rated like a 3 or higher so then I watched a couple other people's videos and that's basically normal so Sephora does it really have really really really low ratings of things on their websites I saw a couple like ones and twos I was shocked either have never seen him before in my life but it wasn't like that for everything but anyways you guys at NASA today's video is going to be I'm just gonna be testing out a full face using really low Sephora rated product a lot of these products I haven't even tried myself yet so I'm actually very very intrigued about this is basically a first impressions I have like a couple products I've tried but not that many but that's what I'm doing today as always if you guys like this video if you guys do not like me please don't  watch it you know the drill with that but if you guys do like this video please go ahead subscribe to my channel if you're not already and if you knew what's up I'm Annie MUA and welcome to my channel thank you so much for being here come into this den of dreams I was gonna say den of death oh my god dark so you guys let's go and get into today's video before we get started right hey went ahead and did I screenshotted all the products I wasn't using so I can tell you guys what the reading was on the Sephora app because of course we're gonna go ahead and start off with foundation primer we're gonna be taking the Laura Mercier foundation primer blemish list and this guy has a rating of about a three point four which is really love for Sephora I don't if you guys know this but like Sephora ratings are a little wonky like I was saying earlier so a three point four is like pretty low rated for Sephora standards like the lowest rating and the primers was like 3.1 or they went to so like that's like the lowest I wish everything was like a one-star but they don't have one star items here on so for its website and we're gonna try this foundation out I've never tried this primer out this is a foundation primer it's a base I'm quite intrigued by it it comes out like a lotion that was a little intense I'm open to I suppose a little tense pretty tacky actually as I'm like rubbing it in so basically it's a water-based gel that creates the perfect canvas for makeup and improves the appearance of blemishes maybe that's why people write it a low because it doesn't really improve their appearance of my blemishes then the day it's basically just like a hydrating primer that's what it feels like on my skin so that's what that looks like ooh look at that beautiful prime face let's go in with foundation so for foundation we are going to be taking the NARS Velvet Matte Foundation stick this guy was rated what are you rated on here this is a three point six which is actually pretty low for the foundation standard I've never personally tried it myself so I don't really know why it's rated the rating that it is take the shade light number four and we're just gonna go right in and go in this is supposed to be a Velvet Matte foundation stick so we'll see how it looks on the skin so far it glides on pretty nicely I have no complaints about the glide ability of here I bet you anything the complaint is about the sponge like I just bet you know we're not using the sponge oh absolutely not honey but spongeable we're not gonna use I'm actually really shocked that NARS even included a smudge in here because their motto is usually like using your fingers to apply the foundations and concealers so that kind of shocks me a bit but whatever we're gonna go in with that we're gonna put it on it does lose like a ton of coverage so we're gonna use a big old brush when using morphe m-43 9 in classic kabuki i love this brush you guys know this though this is like one of my go-to to apply foundation i just think it buffs in a very nicely very seamlessly and as we're buffing in the foundation as you can see there's basically a shirred a medium amount of coverage it's not a lot of coverage whatsoever so basically it's a lot more on the natural side which is another reason people could have rated it lower okay so this is what it looks like on the skin so I'm actually gonna play a little bit more just looking in a clearer tell a bit that's not oxidizing which is nice it's when I play it with a little bit of a sponge I shouldn't go and block the sponge and then see what we think okay so the foundation is on the skin as we can see I've built it up to about of a medium coverage more of a sheer to medium coverage you can still see my redness and I kind of like some situations peaking through you see the redness of my cheeks peeking through however I don't think it looks bad on the skin I really really don't I think it actually looks really pretty and skin like on the skin I would definitely definitely say it is not really a matte finish I'd actually say it's more of a like satin almost do your finish maybe that's why I was ready to go because it's more of a glowy foundation but to me it's not very matte to me we have the face on this is what the foundation looks like a little bit up close as you can see honestly I think it looks really pretty on the skin it's definitely not like my go-to like full coverage foundation or anything like that but on this skin it does look nice it doesn't emphasize your pores or texture or anything like that at least it doesn't for me we're just cracking a little bit who knows what the real issue is is it the primer is it the foundation okay guys so for concealer we are here we are queer and we are going to be using the Smashbox Studios skin a 24 hour waterproof concealer so this guy is rated here on Sephora site as a 3.2 which is a pretty low rating it'll be in first impression swings I really don't remember if I use this already so we're gonna be using this to conceal our feelings shade light okay so we're gonna go and try this out it's a doe foot applicator feels really nice going on really smooth actually feels kind of intense I'm not gonna lie okay so what I will notice though is that this is oxidizing a little bit okay guys so since this guy is oxidizing a little bit I'm actually gonna take a little bit of the shade fair and we're gonna put that right here and mix it with the shade light because I did notice I sizing pretty quickly honestly we're gonna go ahead and use it and actually the fumes of this alright bit strong it's a little bit of a stronger step I'm gonna lie um we're gonna go and try it out and see how it acts and reacts to our skin blend it out like a dream but I will definitely an make the scent is little bit strong ones out like great actually I'll say the coverage is more of a medium I just feel like I can still see the blue hues right here going on feel like coverage wise it's not really there for me I would say it's definitely more of a medium coverage but it honestly looks really nice on the skin it looks really nice and I would definitely maybe you recommend this more so for someone guys a little bit more on the don't waffle coverage side come on any of you guys so for the powder making me taking the makeup forever powder let me set this I'll talk about after hold on let me set because because this is a silica based powder and I know for a fact that this will you up with flash photography I'm assuming that's why people did it but at the end the day to it's like okay this is an HD powder it's not meant for flash photography it's just not I mean as you can see it has I'm putting it on it's probably bunching up but I probably shouldn't play off with that what the this guy would say has a good more of a 3.8 3.7 rating powders is actually really hard I could not find a lot of powders out of low rating this is like one of the lowest lowest rated though but we have a low rated powder right here and I honestly didn't think though is that bad I've used this matter before but I only use it for video I do not use it for photography because it does flash back like a mother okay I mean on the skin the bitch looks pretty like you are looking blurred by it my undereyes looks a little bit darker so I think that's a little odd I don't know what's going on but my under eyes are a little bit darker than the rest my face and look you can see it is fine we're gonna just keep on moving around because we are so now we're going with some bronzer bronzer was another really hard one to do like that was a hard one to find but I do have it this bronzer from NARS is another NARS product right here this is the Laguna bronzer and it's not that it's necessarily Laguna bronzer as a whole it's this style of bronzer that may like repackage this bronzer it has like this like divots and it sounds like this madness going on rady 23.6 like a 3.6 3.7 and I'm like so I'm like you know what let's go and try this now I have not tried this in like the new packaging like this so we're gonna go ahead and bronze off the skin we're gonna see why the this was rated so  not that great I'm really annoyed by the fact that I look like yellow jaundice under my eye but it's fine hmm so I feel like this going on it's not I just don't really like the application of e I feel like it doesn't go on super smooth laughter really like I'm continuously I'm just doing this still blending and blending and blending can feel like it's gonna be really easy to be up with this the reason I go higher up with my bronzer my contour is because I have facial hair so I can't really go like down here which I would want I would love to go a little bit lower but I have to like be able to show it on my face so that's why I go in the areas that I do go anyway I'm like I was saying like I'm literally like I was digging and as I'm putting it on Dom this da clearly we have a very natural bronzer we have out of the womb natural mom over here because we don't have no coverage okay yeah so that part I would definitely say is a little bit annoying and I can see why it's rated lowest of like the bronzer section because you're not really getting a lot of product and it's kind of hard like I get more kickoff and payoff from my Physicians Formula one and the color itself like as it's on I think actually looks really nice I think it's nice like neutral color it's not too warm it's not too cool and the color itself is beautiful I wish I could actually get more of it off and use more of it okay so that bronzer was quite confusing I'm not gonna lie I didn't really love it yeah that was just a hard no okay guys so we're moving right along so this is what the face looks like so far I think that like on camera it doesn't look that bad it really doesn't so with highlighter actually found this liquid drops by Urban Decay bees are the liquid Ora illuminating mixing medium it's basically like a mix in you mix it in with things to become more illuminated but this was in the highlighting section so I picked it up this has eight reviews on it and it's ready to add a two point seven is our first two I think is our first two rated item so I was like oh my god I need to use this I said I said dirty little bitch I'm not gonna lie alright it's a nasty little nasty little thing you're tiger so we're gonna go and just basically put a little bit on the back of my hand and we're gonna put that on a cheekbone it feels like lotion it definitely does not feel like a highlighter in any way shape or form come on a little rough to see it's a little bit too purple I literally look like I'm wearing purple sort of purple ass highlighter it's really not the look and it's not that blinding either so I guess I understand the low rating I get it but I mean it is technically more of a mixing medium [Music] well you so for the blush I'm actually gonna kind of combined the blush with like everything else so basically we have this sweet peach glow palette this guy was rated at a 3 point 3 / 3 point 4 I was actually kind of shocked about like this is such a beautiful looking palette I've used this maybe once and I only use the highlighter so I don't exactly know how the bronzer or blush work as much my mom's used them both she really likes them so we shall see what we think of it and actually that would be kind of fun because I'm not really living for this highlight let's go ahead and apply the highlighter on top of this base highlighter and see how we look like right here so okay I mean the color itself is beautiful however we're really really layering you guys I mean cuz even so that's not that blinding it's really really not I literally don't remember it being like this I want to live I do want to live you guys know I want to live a thousand lives but oh that looks nice on the nose but it's just not that blinding it's just more like a an afterthought it's alright but it's something anyway we're gonna go with the blush because I was little point to the middle guy we're gonna clock the middle right here this was such a like item in the beauty community like so many people were like bitching about this item because it's not like you don't get enough color payoff right so even when i'm swatching this i feel like i just pressed a little hard but it swatches pretty nicely like I said on the finger he doesn't really look blinding necessarily or look that great but it might swatch pretty good so I'm gonna go and take the blush we're gonna put that on the cheat see what we think this is my third dip going in okay guys so I would definitely say this is more of a natural blush very natural you do have to dig in a little bit more than usual with this blush but once the blush is on the skin on the face it's beautiful it really is I think it looks really really nice it's almost like there's too many layers you have to do with like this is like almost four layers I just went in with blush just to get it to be like this soft dainty looking bitch I'm like now take the bronzer just a little bit see if we can add some buff I mean honestly anything at this point we had more bronzer okay well adds that a lot more than the NARS did the shirt that sure it's in I don't you guys didn't tell on camera but it just me added more bronzer for short oh yeah that's way better than just a North one look see there's color okay so this is the face you guys I'm gonna zoom in a little bit more I'm gonna scoot in I'm just really not living and the funny thing about this video I actually really wanted to come into this and like just try to slay the out of my face and be like these ratings you can get anything in May get work you don't mean and I feel like I'm making it work but you don't want just make it work you wanted to be  sickening so we're going to a settings right now and finish off with the base of the face we're gonna take the cover effects illuminating setting spray was a rating of about a three point six three point five which was very very low especially for the setting sprays as you shake it actually little metal ball in here I've never tried this I'm actually quite intrigued about this so just waiting on my skin in actually yeah definitely definitely gives it like a dewy luminous glow why people bitching about this let's see why their complaint team so basically everyone is saying that the product is too glittery and honestly when I sprayed on my hand I noticed little bitter flakes and I'm like okay you know what it's fine just little glitter flakes maybe it doesn't translate on the skin and I will say that there's definitely some tiny glitter particles on my skin do I see that white residue at the cap I think that's good er oh I see on my hand intensely oh there's definitely little glitter flakes on the hand I definitely can tell that my face is a little more dewy looking now because it was straight-up glitter on it let's keep on moving the lung imma going to my brows off of camera I could not find a brow product to use like that was actually really really hard it I was searching forever I mean there was like some that were like not that great rated but they're more so like brow gels and brow brushes not really brow pencils and things like that so I'm just going to do my brows off-camera and I'll come back with an eye palette the brow looks so good today don't know why they just do so I go like this on my okay I'm enjoy my brows I opened the mirror and look at myself this done me up because literally there are chunks of white glitter all over my entire face oh my god like it actually looks so bad oh my god I'm honestly so shocked I did not know it looked like that I would just on the camera looking at the viewfinder and looking at myself in my own mirror which is like far enough away where I can't see the flakes and it looks so bad anyway brows done eyes pride let's go and get into a palette so we're gonna go in with the Too Faced white peach eyeshadow palette - peaches in cream collection this guy retailed oh I mean this guy has a 3.2 rating if they put one through boom - oh it smells beautiful I actually really really enjoy the packaging I love the ombre effect I think that it looks beautiful a little peach class this is actually very well thought out I think it's super super cute this is the color scheme I think what it is - the color scheme is not the most liked but at the end of the day it's a peach palette like what you expected you get peaches how the shadow was good do they blend what's the tea what's the grease I don't know let's just go on and with peach sorbet powdery bitch huh okay we're take peach sorbet I'm gonna take peach criminal apiece I'm gonna put that into the crease we're gonna make a really just a peachy I happen okay now this color getting put down I was a little nervous nothing right also these shades are so powdery oh my goodness and I'm down for a powder don't get me wrong I don't mind it too too much and the shadow is blending the shadows are blending so I don't hate it but it's like the bitch I just dipped in a couple times and they blend and it looks pretty but they are not very pigmented either but right now we're in the transition moment so maybe that makes a difference but so far okay we have a peach crease I love a good peach crease I think it looks so pretty I wish that like it got there quicker and I didn't need to dip in so many times but it is really really pretty color so let's go in with you just wait on a little morphe r39 brush this is gonna be a little bit of a deeper peach shade that color is actually really nice I like that peach suede this one right here I love that take a Rosie go Rosie peach so Bryan right here she's a Ryan but they blend very nicely like this is like blending very easily to me I'm not struggling with the blend of whatsoever I don't know why people give it such a low rating I mean I get the fact that it's not like maybe it's not the best color scheme for them I don't really wanted something more I get that aspect of it for sure however the two shades basically just blended into each other can you guys tell if there's three colors on my eyes right now be honest can you tell it's a three cuz there is anyway it's gonna take glistening peach oh that's gonna go on the lid just feels not that good it looks beautiful right here I'm gonna put that onto the lid it's a very like hardened shade like it's kind of hard I don't know why necessarily it looks so much prettier on my finger it's so funny cuz like whenever I'm doing videos like this where I'm expecting to not enjoy something I actually try my hardest to want to like it like it's like a part of me that's like inside it's just like no man you're gonna like it you can make it works and refine like you're going to be fine but honestly so  happens and your we're gonna try spray it and see if we get any better result I mean it's better for sure but there's chunky ass glitter in this shade I just realize it was like chunky glitter oh I thought I did but I don't like it now that I'm actually like playing with it and going in on it I'm like I'm taking on the grill on the grill like bitch who needs a black in this palette can you give me a dark brown oh my god I'm gonna ruin this I like it's literally gonna get ruined just make it a little bit deeper just a little part of me it just makes me want to quit do you guys ever get like that you're just like this this I like how my makeup looks I'm over it go into some eyeliner on this part like I'm legit getting annoyed so let me go ahead and do something else real quick because I'm gonna this is gonna be quick anyway okay so guys now we're gonna go onto eyeliner really quickly to do on this side I'm gonna be taking the hourglass voyer waterproof liquid liner this has 38 reviews and has three stars a hard just three stars it's three okay well let's try it it is a felt tip applicator okay it's a little bumpy okay so this is the eyeliner so far I mean it's just like oh whatever I'm not a fan of felt tip eyeliner pen pencil pens whatever because I feel like you can't get a sharp line but let's go ahead and try to do a wing okay that's a little too crazy I feel like this is a bit pigmented ass bitch not gonna lie this is a real pigmented in Cod doing a sharp wing with this is impossible it's bad I don't know if it's me just bad at eyeliner or the situation right now but um pretty bad I'm gonna go ahead and do the other half of camera and I'll be right back he kept on getting thicker and thicker so we have some sukira going on right now with the eyeliner and as I use this more eyes like put the highlighter shade on my inner corners and my brow bone I just don't like it I just don't I really don't so I'm kind of bummed about it this I know is fine I mean it's fine to me it's really intense but the problem is that one it's $34 $32 just crazy for it a little regular felt tip eyeliner I don't know it's hard to use it I hate the felt of it everyone's saying that it's not waterproof and that as smudge is everywhere so we're gonna go ahead and keep on scooting on so I'm actually going to be taking this which I'm actually was so shocked the reading and how quick the reading was low for this this is the new benefit BADgal bang mascara literally like a bunch of influencers just went on a trip to Utah with benefit to celebrate the launch of their new bad gal bang mascara and this has a three stars on the Sephora web serie my guess three stars what did just came out like days ago so I'm like you know what I haven't tried this yet either actually really cool benefit was so sweet and they sent me Laura Gaby and Nikita a package in Hawaii cuz we're in Hawaii during the trip but just because they sent us a cute package and they were sweet tez does that mean that I'm going to alter my opinion in any way shape or form but if it knows that about me I'm very honest about the products that I use so I think the packaging itself is so cute it literally just look like a little rocky it's like so adorable this is the wand they're gonna seems like a longer wand so let's go ahead and see what the hypernym like it's about like I have no idea that see it's just a really good job at separating my lashes like god damn these bitches are separated okay as you can see okay so I made the lower lashes look incredible my lower lashes never look like this they separate them very nicely okay so these are the lashes this is what they look like I think that the bottom I should look incredible any think that's weird that the lashes like the mascara is not drying down which I find a little bizarre that's kind of annoying I feel like if you lived in a hot place and they were still not dry yet that would get everywhere like dead so yeah that was rated a 3 think I mean my lashes look really pretty my lower lashes my top lashes it really I mean it separated them nicely it didn't keep my curl or anything like that it didn't do anything special for the top I don't know what's going to live and we will be done with today's video and then we'll go back and I'm gonna test the lashes again and see if they haven't dried yet cuz if they did it after the lips bitch there's a problem so I'm on the Sephora website right now and the one I had clicked is actually the mini and that's rated 3 but the benefit back out mascara that's like the full size is rated a for really weird really weird the thing is for 24 bucks you don't want not too bad you want it to be good I don't know this is something that you guys have to like just take into your consideration I think that the mascara was pretty good I like roller lash a lot more how are we on dry ability at least a dry no witch anything a lot happier but I can definitely see myself using this mascara for my lower lashes because they look great so honestly I was shocked to see this in the lowest of the lipstick product rated it's very hello it's larrya 3.1 and it's the anasazi really hills lipstick in the shade tree in the shade trouble 3.1 what's the so I went ahead read the reviews and basically everyone was saying but this is like a really deceptive product in the bottle in here looks like it's like more of a cool tone pinky Mavi color but more on the cool tone side right but everyone says that well has it's drying down it goes so much darker and more brownish and it doesn't even become more cool tone anymore and people are like what the I look I wanted a cool tone mommy color and it looks something completely different on the lips so I've never tried this before but now I have to come so intrigued of what the bug it looks like so let's go ahead put it on no so everyone said that it's too drying wash is drying quick holy the coverage is really nice applicator is a little bit harder to use because it's a flat paddle what do you guys think does it look different to you honestly let's see how it dry sound Folio I don't see it pulling Brown on me whatsoever so I don't know maybe there was like a bad batch that circulated who knows dude it looks a little bit different actually oh man the nose I mean look anyway let's see how it tries so it straight down basically fully okay honestly it is darker it is definitely darker than it goes on but I don't see really pulling Brown I think it's still more of a cool tone purple I don't know that's just I guess that is my personal opinion I don't see it pulling Brown on me a little bit darker but not that much darker come on three come on a three that's a low reading that's is my  opinion though that's what you  watch it on the floor it's gonna write fake opinion okay you guys and that is it for today's video hope you guys had fun watching actually had so much fun creating this video it was so much fun it was actually wild trying out all these products have such a low rating because most of them the rating was actually warranted for sure I was like it's like that like it a lot of them were just not that good and I was kind of shocked that the rating just so much like reflected what the product actually did at the end of the day I'm not living I'm gonna take this off like I just it doesn't feel good on the skin it doesn't look beautiful on to me I just don't like the way it looks at the end of the day that make a forever powder it's saved it because it gives you that like soft filtering effect but bitch in person this is not that cute okay guys anyway I hope you guys had fun watching today's video if you guys liked this kind of video let me know what I can definitely do like make and you like an Ulta version of it

Jeffree Stars boyfriend. Nathan MUA. Natha--. That’s cause we’re in a three-way relationship. When he’s with me it’s Nathan MUA
and Natedog with Jeffree. He’s done Jeffree’s makeup
before and I was like “Dude that was such a fun idea and my brother
will never do my makeup on camera.” So, I’m like “Nathan I need
to take advantage of— I got you. Another male figure in my life. It’s actually really funny
because this came about because Nathan was actually
the one who suggested it. Didn’t you? Yeah. I did, I did actually. I was like “How about I do your makeup?” Yeah, he really did. We were sitting down like normally
and we’re talking about I don’t know, video ideas I guess. And he was like,
“What if I do your makeup?” And I was like “I didn’t know
that was an option.” I just bought a bunch of things
but I’m sure we can just kinda— Yeah. This desk— Yeah, I’ll be taking a few
 things from this area. There we go. What’s your Instagram just
so everyone knows? It is Datschwandt. Datschwandt. D-A-T— Why do I keep saying Natedog? It was-- It was that, right? It was Natedog yes and then I changed it.
-I keep thinking Natedog for some reason. I know it’s Datschwandt obviously. Datschwandt. Dat-schlong. Just kidding. Alright guys. So anyway, as always
if you don’t like this video, if you guys don’t like me please
don’t fucking watch it. Why did I say it with you? That’s like homie. Alright guys. We’re gonna go ahead and
start on today’s video and let’s see Nathan glam me up. Let’s do this. Okay guys, so we’re gonna
start on today’s video. I brought makeup, put it on the table
and I’m like Okay Nathan. You did Jeffrees makeup before,
so you should know what to do. Have you ever seen one of my videos? I actually have. Quite a few today actually. You’re not coming over
'cause you’re embarrassed. Yes, I did. Okay cool. So, I have makeup here and you
can just literally grab and go. some of these things are familiar. Okay good. You gotta prime that face baby! Mhmm. Prime the face.
You sure do. That pearl functional benefit. Are your hands clean? Yeah, they smell good. I don’t usually really put
stuff on people’s faces. Mmm, debatable. On Jeffree. Yeah. I hear stories Nathan. You got me! Am I good? I think so. Can I see the other side? I look so straight oh my god. Yeah. You’re like ‘yeah I do” What is next? I mean this one looks familiar
and the name is familiar. Mhmm. La Mer. Bouncing. Bouncing. Is this my color? Is it? How does it look? It looks I mean—
-It looks really good. It’s not blending. It’s not orange? No, you don’t look too orange. You need quite a lot for this- Oh my god. That’s all you got? That’s like half of my face. It’s going on my hand. When did we first meet, Nate? It was—I don’t—It was— Was it at the mall? I think it was.
-It was at the mall. Yeah, yeah when we were
having dinner—lunch. Yeah we had lunch. It was me,
you, Jeffree, Patrick. Yip. No wait, shopping— Yeah, yeah, yeah. And we went to like late dinner. Yeah, that’s like two years ago guys. That’s like two years ago. Yeah, that was a while ago. I don’t think remember that. I think it was like one of the first
times I met Jeffree too. And then concealer, I don’t know
what the fuck that really looks like. You’re gonna start pulling. It’s shaped—no wait. That sounds about right. Let me pull it out and look at it. Let me pull it out. It looks a little dark. Let me see if there’s a— Okay, there you go. There’s the white one. I know how it goes. I was just— Okay. figuring out how much. Oh, lets just put it in your
eyelashes or your eyebrows. Eyelash. A little hefty. Is it? A hefty amount. Is it? I know it goes there and then
you put a little bit there. And you do a little bit down here. Mhmm. Your hand feels great. I feel like you’ve definitely done this before. You have more light like— Oh. This way. Oh sweet god. I don’t know how far this goes over. Mhmm. Luckily this is your video. Yeah this is. And you're good at this [inaudible]. Mhmm. Yeah. Christian likes when I do this face. So what are we gonna do now? Powder under that, cause
it needs to dry. So I know you gotta pat so I don’t
move everything around. Oh my gosh, you’re so knowledgeable. You should get your own channel. I know. I should just start— MUA by Nathan. I’m gonna come for you. Oh! He’s coming for my fucking gig. I’m coming. You like to do your contour next, I believe. Mhmm. The contour then your blush. I’m just gonna show you
a couple of items. You can just guess what
you think would work. Alrighty. I have utter faith in you. I feel like this isn’t the right
brush for some reason. Hmm. Do it! Do it! I’m gonna go ahead and go on
with this Marc Jacob. Mmm. So I think it goes right around— Oh my Atlanta! Added a little too much on it. I’m starting to freak out. Fucking boys. I know you love it. I know you love it, my Myrtle voice. He doesn’t like when I do Myrtle. No? No. He doesn’t like Myrtle. Moaning Myrtle. It is. That’s kind of what inspired my idea. Yeah, that’s your own. Yeah, it’s my own twist with no lips. Oh. Like that. Moaning Myrtle. It literally sends shivers down my spine. It’s relatively even. Does it? Yeah. It’s not very severe, but— I didn’t see anything. Just a little peak. Hey, but it’s cool. It’s fine, it’s fine. People say— People want to be my color. Yeah. It’s a little white. It’s hard to figure out what
brush to use because— There’s like so many brushes. I don’t understand how
do you use all of these? Oh, they’re used. Oh, they look used. Every single one of them. They look used. This looks kind of cool. Have to apply blush. Mhmm. What did you first think when we met? Cause I met you with Jeffree. Yeah. yeah, I know. I mean obviously we’re both— Yeah. We were both like trying
to gauge like your coolness level. Mhmm. You know? No, we actually liked you right away. We actually were like “Oh my god”. We were like “He’s actually really cool.” Like he’s never had a gay
friend before either, Oh wow. So I was like yeah all of them. No, he had never had a gay friend
before and he was just so excited. And he was like telling me that
he was like actually excited because he hadn’t like a really loyal,
cool gay friend before. It’s always been dudes because he has
always been in the music scene. Right. That’s true, yeah. It’s always straight guys and— Yeah, yeah. Girls. I mean I was pretty stoked too. I was so happy when I met you guys. I was like they seem really, really great. It’s cool cause I wasn’t really like a fan. I didn’t really get that feeling at all. I didn’t really watch Jeffree or
like follow his life as much. I knew who he was but I wasn’t like
a follower or a fan of his. Which I felt was good because I didn’t like— it makes it like a— you can just become friends without
having any preconcieved notions. That’s totally true. They are Do you know what I mean?
-Yeah, of course. I feel that it like a cool thing. That’s how we hit it off so fast. Yeah, we did and I feel like we’re
hanging out in a week. Yeah, no we were. I was already coming over. Mhmm. Yeah. It was kind of serious. It was really cool and
then we’re here now. Mhmm and here we are. And you’re glamming me. Yes, I am. And you’re turning me
into pretty princess. Now we do highlight. This is like the one brush that I know for a fact—
-There we go. Is this one. So, let’s use— I can, I can. I think I may be able to find something here. We can perhaps— We can perhaps use this one.
-I think that would be a really good move. Yeah I see a lot of highlight getting
put on, so I kind of like You know. I know. You know. Cheekbones. Not this side. You actually know where it goes. I’m very impressed. How’s the layers of highlighter? You can’t go wrong. You can’t, especially not
with this color Eclipse. Sold on Jeffree Star’s cosmetic website. My collaboration with Jeffree. Use code MANNYMUA for 10% off. It’s hard to see over here with— Right. Oh yeah, yeah. I can see. You see it? Are you blinded? Blinding now. What is next? Well, I failed to do contouring on your nose. Which I know that requires
like a stick of some sort. Oh! Did you see that or was that just me? My god! It’s gone. Like, it literally just slid the fuck out
like a piece of shit. It’s on the ground right now. It looks like a tootsie roll. Hula, Why you gotta do me dirty like that? Okay, we need to try put it back in. Should we put it back in? Oh, there’s a hair. Little one. Hair. Oh shit. We’re not using this anymore. Alright. Poised. Oh my god. This feels right. Does it? It feels right. That damn Hula stick. It’s like I really like that. I know. I was totally fucking ready for it cause I was like gonna use the Beautyblender
and blend that shit out. To perfection. Now I don’t even know. Can I use the fucking Beautyblender
on that shit? If you want. Okay. We got the four and the five
brow pencil Benefit. Okay. Ultrafine. So guys I gave—I had [inaudible]. I gave Nathan a little puff. So he can rest it on my face. I want to take your face and I’m like no. I want to touch it. So we put a little puff on his hands so he can
brush it on me just incase he needs to. I want a lipstick nick brow. You want a lipstick nick brow? Mhmm. You might wanna call her. Oh! Like when you go thick with that
eyeliner and you just go thicker. It’s a— What did you do? No, don’t worry about it. It’s fine. The Beautyblender I feel like it doesn’t
solve a lot of problems. Oh my god! It is. It’s like go around here. That looks a little big to me, but— Okay. Here comes the puff again. He just wants to silence me. That’s a hard touch. I know. It’s not like— You are a man. A little rough on the top there. She’s so rough. Check out the guys by the way, sorry. Even if I look this way
there’s nothing to see. Yeah, you can’t see anything no. I don’t wanna see. I don’t wanna ruin it for myself. Stop laughing. I’m not laughing. I’m not laughing at you,

eyebrow through your eyelid. Oh that’s weird. You’re totally right. Is it weird? I mean, I’m sure it’s weird for you— I’ve never touched an eyeball like this before. Once again, there’s so many brushes. We need options. I know you like to use Morph brushes. I think these are all Morph brushes. They are, they are. Hmm. What creative vision are we going for here?

recreating a fans makeup look because someone suggested to me on Twitter to do that and I was like wait that's actually a really really cute and adorable idea I love it so I asked you guys to send me a bunch of samples of your guys's work and a bunch of samples of your guys's art I literally had thousands of photos from you guys and a couple hours asking you guys to recreate some of the looks I live it kind of all over for a little bit so you guys can like but one other people if you guys wanted to get some likes on it whatever it might be but honestly it's wanted to say you guys are so

amazing and I'm not saying I can't do work like that but that's not like my focus is not my core focus I mean whenever I see people do these imaginative beautiful looks it's so like inspiring for me

nervous because I've never tried doing a video like this is where but it's fun I also think James Charles her to be like this so shout out to James because I believe that he did a video like this as well cuz there's a couple other people have done it but I remember James is the most clearly but thank you again to everyone that suggested doing this I wanna put that into the upper crease up here I really build on that yellow this is on a more feet r39 amazing brush do you guys know the more feet are series the rose gold series is amazing cuz we got this so far and then it goes like in tune orange okay so then we go into an orange shading taking the same brush we're gonna go ahead and follow that not super orange but it's like an orange moment kinda okay Mary the to marry the two and then we're going in with pink there's definitely a soft pink moment there's a lot more purples and blues and this and honestly dozen really matter if it's too messy because at the end of the day we're gonna be it's a cut crease we're gonna clean up the bottom of it anyway this my idea to recreate a followers makeup is such a fun it's just like a fun idea like I just thing it's really cool and I think it's still possible to give some credit to up-and-coming talent cuz it's fuckin are you kidding me like there's so many talented people out there that are just like beyond amazing it would be really great to be able to show some more left to them you know I mean oh honey this bitch just is its actual perfection like I I really can't come with some purple start to define it a little more we're just following this little crease along dragging her out okay okay we're starting to get somewhere the whole thing with this kind of look is basically it's all about the blend and just consistently blending throughout the whole thing just taking it slow blending and kind of just like leaving space here so you can do the white carve-out it's coming together I had thought I was gonna be more flat but I'm not as fast as I thought it was gonna be which is nice to see I definitely did a lot more purple than the blue and Arkham align like purple more I'm just taking this as it's like inspiration you know let's go and take the blue from this palette the Smashbox palette really no it's fucking hard you guys like Paul just not talking that much during this I swear to God this kind of shit take some concentration like I'm not even gonna lie okay alright just a constant blending out you guys cuz I swear to god this bitch will get you she'll get you okay guys we're getting somewhere I feel like this is gonna be where we should stop because I swear to God if I keep going I'm gonna fuck shit up okay guys what do we think of this this is the top of the eye so far we're gonna cut her out to be carve her out with some concealer I think we should okay this is what we're gonna get this is gonna get tricky cuz you don't do me and her me and Keira we don't got the same eye shape y'all so we need to be smart about this okay guys so go and take them to conceal it we're gonna go ahead and cut out because that Ranaut call I hope think that's one will close it off so that we can just do the eyeliner - that's just gonna be our guide that'll be our guide to where we want to keep it okay so what do we think what are we thinking I think it looks pretty fucking good actually I'm Chuck I'm not so disappointed in myself you guys the rotor failure you like the little spot right there that's kind of annoying you're right there and a little spot right there there we go so now what we're gonna do guys we're gonna set the entire thing with white eyeshadow the whole fucking thing whoa so we got the eye on you guys oh my gosh we got somewhere uh uh actually looks fucking cool I'm really really really happy oh my gosh I'm like actually happy hold on let me do a little wine over here - okay so guys so now we're gonna actually do the eyeliner part and I think that's gonna be a little bit easier cuz basically just doing the top part and like putting it on the bottom literally the exact same thing so we're gonna take like the literally like the yellow and put that in the beginning I don't know how she got them to be ass pigmented as they look cuz I don't think mine will show up that pigment in so we're literally gonna do eyeliner with the eyeshadows she probably added a little bit of like saturation on the color and a little Photoshop on it which is totally fine it's all good no hate at all like no hate at all I live you know I bit I fucking I'll fucking live so it is not gonna look exactly the same as hers because of it which is oh this is getting so real you guys it's getting really real we're trying to make it look the exact same as the top solito see yeah we can make this happen now we're using a morphe 35c like a lip brush for them but I actually really like because it's so so so tiny and so thin I can really get into I look with this because it's so little see that okay film like a clown feeling like a clown hey and now we're getting into the deep blue now we're getting into the missus deep blue abyss we can do this I believe in us okay now we're gonna take it on a more if you are 45 notice outlining it with the lighter blue because it would really a really deep blue like an in deep blue she I'm thinking that it was your Pellatt again you guys I feel literally like I feel pressure I don't know why like I feel like I can't fuck also it's really hard to do with all those fucking fallout okay and if you feel if the look is not clean enough by the end of it we're gonna do the same thing we down the top on the bottom we're just gonna go ahead and this is where we are currently act they combined at the end this is what we look like up here pretty good top of the eye is done you guys this is where we keep it as so the inner corner had something really really shiny really really really intense I'm gonna take the little sleek makeup rockstars collection this shader right here I'm actually wearing it as a highlight today I'm gonna put that on the inner corner should so intense this is a look this is a fucking look okay guys so what did you have on the bottom lash thanks we're gonna just do one eye on camera and uh one eye off camera I mean if I can get oh god I really hope I can finish both eyes on camera because I swear to God like I have plans tonight the bitch has plans we're ready to yellow and we take the orange line up with the on the lower lash line a nice hefty amount I don't mind a nice hefty amount okay and then what if he do need she took pink a little bit lower than that and in the purple okay got the pink down and now we do the purple look I need a deeper purple than that it's not deep enough oh my god this is like the prettiest look I've ever done we're gonna take a darker color actually we take a little bit of the black from that Sephora palette on the lash line we're gonna really deepen that up a bit oh she's taking all the way in okay [Music] so look something like that you guys this is the final look bitch this is a fritz Bernays right here honey did I do it I accomplished a lot I think that I definitely have to look done miss Kira definitely slayed it harder than me but it's a little hard to go based off of just the photo damn it I think looks beautiful why is this L'Oreal mascara better than so many of the higher end ones I have why the dude I'm talking to slash dating slash scene yes oh my god he lives in San Diego and he's staying over the weekend this look is so fucking beautiful like wow I'm so distracted by myself hey guys I'm gonna go try to do the other eye off of camera and see if I can even do what if I can't do it the same as the same this took like literally like 30 minutes wish me luck I see that okay guys and this is the final look we have both sides done the left side I did in literally maybe one-third the time as this one so it's definitely like ugly stepsister of this side but you guys get the gist this is dilute I honestly thought I was gonna be a complete flop at this I'm not gonna lie I thought it was gonna be a look that I was like fuck teeth looks like really really kind of hard these are just looks I don't practice as often so that's why for me it's a little bit harder because I just do more so like they say copper eye nude lip kind of looks which I love those are my favorite kind of looks to do I just don't do it as many intricate looks like this but I can definitely do them and they're so fun to do and it's really fun to just kind of go outside your comfort zone a little bit more and this is what we came up with again I just want to say huge shout out to Kira for coming up with this beautiful look it's so fucking stunning like honestly I am blown away with your talent it's absolutely beautiful your page is beautiful everything about it I'm like god damn you're good and thank you for tweeting me your looks they're so so so beautiful and to everyone else that tweeted me your looks you guys are wonderful thank you so much for the tweets you guys are so incredible and it's so amazing to see how talented you guys are and it's just so awesome and I honestly like it makes me feel like I want to keep doing this like I want to make this kind of a series where I keep recreating your vices looks just to give you guys more of an opportunity to be seen on different platforms you know I'm not saying My Mind's like the biggest platform ever or anything like that but it would be cool to get more eyes on your guys's looks if you guys like this idea let me know in the comments bar below and I will definitely make this a series or something continue to do because honestly I'd so much fun doing in and it's really fun to just look at a photo and try to recreate it and see if you can get the vibe of that look and for me it's cool because usually if you guys just see a photo on Instagram you're like dude this looks beautiful but you don't know how to accomplish it this is kind of like a way to see how to do it are these the way I like to do it or the way that I accomplish the look or something similar to it and yeah that is it you guys I'll leave everything I talked about linked down below all the products I use the palettes that I use for Teddy's video the brushes I use the links to everything discount codes if you

hey guys welcome back to my channel so today's video is going to be a testing of some new products video I recently got this huge package in from Maybelline and Maybelline just came out with a ton of new Maybelline products and know this video is not sponsored or anything I know I have worked with abling in the past I will always disclose whether or not I'm sponsored in the video and this one is not sponsored I literally just have a huge amount of Maybelline makeup and a lot of you guys were asking me on Twitter to review it knew what Maybelline makeup that just came out and I got a package and I snapped it and you guys were like yo review then you Maybelline makeup so that is what today's video is going to be as you can see my hair is a little different cut it a little differently this time you know it sparked it a little bit differently I feel very like very like Danny Zuko or something I don't know greaser ish I don't hate it I'm just not used to I don't love anything you know I'm saying yeah you guys that'll taste vo is going to be that's why I already have my base completely done I'm what are you testing on the bronzer the highlighter some of the palettes and you powder that they have as always if you guys don't this video if you guys do not like me please don't watch it you know the drill with that but you guys do like this video please subscribe to my channel if you're not already and if you're new what's up I'm a name you and welcome to my channel thank you so much for being here but yeah let's go ahead and get into this testing of a new a Maybelline products come on drugstore so first things first guys we have this new little Maybelline master bronze face studio highlight kit I really want to use these guys right here to bronze and contour this one has a little bit of like gold glitter in it I don't you guys can tell in the camera but there's if you like show it differently there's a little bit of gold specks on the powder hmm I'm like praying that doesn't translate on skin because I really don't want that to happen so I'm gonna put it on a more feed too and I'm going just bronze with the skin and see how this reacts on the skin okay I'm so stoked because the glitter does not translate on the skin whatsoever thank God cuz I really didn't want that happened well the bronzer itself is actually really really really pretty oh my gosh like it's not super pigmented you definitely need to layer okay so far that is a win let's see how much it is let's see how much this little bitch costs so this bad boy retails for about $12.99 and you get four shades in here we have the two bronzers and kind of like two highlighters I'm gonna swatch this other shade right here right there we have this color we have this color they don't swatch very nice to be honest that one that one was rough this one I don't watch a lot nicer than the other ones let's do a little bit of contouring and see how that ax because that's going to tell me whether or not I want to give this a go or no so taking this on a morphe why nine best contouring brush ever it just so like mmm perfect I'm gonna go into a contouring with this bed by him what's a cooler tone color disc it is more so for people with a medium complexions I think that if you were to light this would be a little bit too like intense and kind of orange e on you so I feel that people with medium skin tones would benefit the most from this I think that I swatch is pretty bad but on the face it definitely definitely works there's no denying that it's working and it looks really nice for $12.99 I'm not mad I'm not mad at all so far this is the hit I'm liking that what's next let's go ahead and go with the new highlighter they just come out with and I have been seeing this all over the beauty world it's been taking it by storm we have the master chrome so I'm gonna go in with a morphe M 510 brush amazing just highlighting brush and I'm gonna take this bad boy let's watch what our fingers first oh my god it's it was literally so  creamy it just went on like oh my god I'm like shocked I did not expect that much pigment to come off holy and go in oh my god you guys that's what one layer one weight I'm actually really shook about this right now it's a little bit on the nose okay so now I'm gonna look up the price on this bad bitch on the ameba Lina Master chrome a metallic highlighter this is $9.99 aka $10 and I would 100% without a doubt highly recommend purchasing this this is absolutely amazing I think my she looks really nice it's very very glowy it's a very metallics and bright and like shockingly Wow like if I were you I would get there cuz holy holy Maybelline really did that go you guys cuz god damn that's  about I had no idea by probably they came out with new fit me blushes as well I do not have any of those blushes they were not in the package I had no I didn't even came out so I'm just gonna apply some blush really quickly so I can have a full face of makeup on there's a spot my face I will not take pigment at all so I tried to do this and like force the pigment to be in this area people are always like mani look so patchy and I'm like actually I don't I just can't tell you big mood there okay next product I want to try out is this new fit me loose finishing powder I believe is like a setting powder their fit me stuff is absolutely amazing so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna use the shade ten to cook underneath my contour and see how that ax cuz it is a loose finishing powder I should be able to cook with it right I should be able to bake with that okay I'm gonna take some of the powder I'm gonna use it to clean up Oh a few moments lay down okay let's dust it off let's just so stuff and try again oh yeah that work oh honey okay guys we are basically don't the face up this is all I have for the face products that Maybelline came out with so we're gonna move on to the eyes I have a new eyeliner they came out with and you brow product I came out with and some eye palettes that came out with so let's go and work on the brows really quickly I have this new brow drama deep brown a Maybelline shaping chalk powder no clue a lot of dancing a little shaker in here y'all hear that how do you use it big a little paddle fill with the flat side waste tip to define a tail I'm doing y'all in to see what we got so we are going to so this was real hardcore real quick guys um not twist the edge to make it more defined okay so this is definitely more of an on-the-go product because goddamn I'm gonna take a little brow spoolie and pray you can like really spoolie this bitch out okay you can't it's too much it's too much product okay definitely not my favorite product no my favorite what so ever I mean we're cleaning it it doesn't look still doesn't look good at all the brow product flaw for me don't really like it I think it puts down way too much product it's really hard to blend out and it looks does it look some mess it looks a minute okay I'm gonna fix my brows off of camera and I'll be right back okay guys so I try to save them as much as I possibly could you guys the real gag is that I still have to go to an event tonight so this makeup that I'm doing like I don't really have time to change it like it just kind of has to work out um but so now that we're done with the brows I'm gonna go ahead move on to the eyes now and we have about five pallets here so here we have graffiti pop we have a concrete runway we have urban jungle we have rooftop bronzes which is probably the one I'm gonna use and we have downtown sunrise oh that one's actually really pretty as well I think downtown contracts is like kind of calling my name it's not red code that really was calling to me I'm like stop I'm little focus what I think is weird about these little pellets is that okay comes with six shades right I think you can only create about one or two looks with this tops I don't think that they're super practical the only one I think is actually practical that people could use a lot is this guy right here this is the bronze one but let's swatch them see how they feel oh my god they feel so a creamy way so we're gonna take this guy right here this little shade just like a transition you show you put that into the crease with this morphing 27 it feels super smooth super nice it literally feels amazing on the I guys I'm really shook and I think I want to take this like raspberry gold shade picks up clearly wonderfully on a brush hold it it's only cheese we're gonna we're just gonna put that all over the lid on the eye it's not asked pigmented as I would like it to be great a little bit of fix+ on it and let's see how oh that's so much better just intensify it a little bit yeah oh for sure so that shade definitely takes a lot of building but I think that once we you get it there it's really really really pretty blend out those edges now we're gonna take this really really pretty pinky lilac e shade right here we're gonna put that on the inner corner to really brighten it up and it worked oh my god I let's put that into there too I kind of like how the whole look it looks really monochromatic peach so I'm gonna keep it that way I'm not gonna add too much dimension in my crease obviously continue to blend and keep the peachy tones there because I think they look really really pretty so these little city mini palettes are about $9.99 that's about what 125 a shadow um this is a tough call for me because I feel like ten dollars for six shades is what do you think of it like that way it's like wow that actually really really good but it doesn't seem there's a lot of product in here and the only pallets that are actually somewhat practical you can use on a day-to-day basis are these two only so these two I would say are more approved that other ones not so much quality of the shadows in here we're actually really really nice I'm very much blown away I did not expect them to be as nice and creamy and as smooth as the end of turning out to be I was like whoa well but you did definitely need to build up for example this like raspberry shade that I have on my lid and into my crease you got to build that up intensely to get the color payoff that you wanted other than that I'm really pleasantly surprised I'm really really pleasantly surprised with these guys so you just came out with a new master precise Inc metallic liners and I pulled out the gold cuz I think gold with this like peach eye would be really fun so we're gonna so I can see how it acts where to go what we're gonna do instead lean on top of the eyelids and ruining the makeup that we have we're gonna put a little bit of that on the lower lash line because it's almost like a watery consistency with a little bit of gold flecks in it so to put that down here ah oh uh I took on my concealer it's true oh my god it just removed all my concealer no nope urban decay I mean that cowboy heavy metal glitter I'm so annoyed that took all my can see like that Wow no no god no so these bad boys retail at $8.99 and so I'm gonna say for me personally that was a thousand oh-ho-ho that was a no glitter and literally took off my concealer bro that's a that's a no okay so we are done with the eye makeup now it's just a really cute just monochromatic peachy look I think it looks really really really pretty so now we're gonna go and finish off with the ellipse and we'll be completely done using the new Maybelline Up products we have super stay matte pink and we also have the vivid hot lacquer so I'm gonna just combine these two bad bitches and we'll be done so we're gonna keep it in the peachy Pham and I grabbed it this color right here loyalist in the shade 0-5 let's swatch on your hand or here looks very pigmented very promising okay let's go ahead put it on our lips it smells up very very pleasant okay goes on really thin but it feels really thick yeah I'm not too sure about this product guys it's pretty sticky I really enjoy that very much I just feels like feels very very heavy and goopy and you know I'm saying we're gonna apply the Velvets lip lacquer right on top of it to give it a glossy feel this feels amazing oh my god okay guys so now for a price a breakdown on these bad bitches right here we have the super state matte ink for about ten dollars and the lacquer for about eight dollars I think the hot liquor is absolutely amazing if you'll so creamy going on it's super super pigmented look like wow smells really nice too it goes on super super nice I was like kind of blown away with how beautiful I thought that one was and that is 100% man anyway approved however the matte and not that biggest fan I think they're a little bit too sticky and I think they would take a little bit too long to dry and they're so sticky in between the dry point that it's like intense like I really just don't want to have it on my lips it feels really really heavy and it's really just not what I want on my lips the matte ink not my favorite I would definitely not purchase that myself but the hot lacquers I would a hundred percent purchase this and that's it you guys that's it for today's entire video I hope you guys had fun watching there's a lot of products where I was like holy this is like a complete complete win for me I loved it I loved the chrome highlighter the lip lacquer oh my god those are absolutely amazing but there were definitely some misses for me like the matte ink and the brow powder not my favorite things ever but again I say this all the time that no brand is gonna have something that I will love 100% of the time that literally never freakin happens finding that for the price point drugstore products Maybelline is really really really kicking ass but yeah other than that I'm goose a night or day where you guys are and I'll catch you guys in my next video bye you guys we are learning oh wait is this scented coconut maybe he's born with it or maybe his face she got rope what is this man hey I love it but can you love him no so now if I were Brett oh my god it's still sticky even do the lacquer [Music] 
hey guys welcome back to my channel so it takes video is going to be a favorites video I have not filmed one of these in so long actually two favorites and disappointments video I have a couple of disappointments I've accumulated in the past couple months I really sat down and filmed a favourites and his appointments video in a minute and I think it's because I've been traveling so much recently I don't really ever gonna test out too many new different products when I am traveling and I kind of forget to film these videos so it's been about like two or three months since I fell my last one and I just love filming these so much I love sitting down and just chatting with you guys talking about my here products recently and talking about your guys's have your products recently and that is literally all I'm gonna be doing today I'm just sitting down this is the third video I'm filming today so excuse me if my energy is not at this right now I'm currently ranked right here but anyways you guys that's what today's video is going to be as always if you guys do not like this video if you guys do not like me please stop watching you know Joe with that but if you guys do like this video please subscribe to my channel if you're not already and if you're new what's up at Manny MUA and welcome to my channel I'll go and get into this favourites and disappointments of at the moment okay let's go and get started on today's video let's go and start with the favorites of the moment not the disappointments render the displacements so first things first gonna start off with this fragrance this is like kind of embarrassing but I don't really give that much of a this is the Shawna Mendez fragrance for men and women I bought this and the reason I bought it is because well one I want to  you guys this scent is just so nice oh it reminds me of Nikita like every I swear to God every fragrance amazing Nikita it's almost like it's a very sweet scent it's not like really musky and intense it's definitely much more of a perfume and than it is a cologne but this is what Sean smells like uh I don't know anything about clones and perfumes it's not my world at all but I love it and that is one favorite of the month the next favorite of the month you guys I've literally been wearing this the past week straight I haven't had it too long but I already know it's a favorite of mine this is the Fenty Beauty foundation of my Rihanna you I'm wearing the foundation on my skin right now honest you guys this foundation is just so stunning I want to scream it gives you such a beautiful amount of cover it's not full coverage it's not sheer coverage it's like a nice medium buildable coverage finish is like a soft matte it sets itself you do it on you set it with a powder I personally do because I need all the help I can get I'm a holy mess it really does look like a soft filter over your face I don't even honestly I have no problem with this foundation and I think it's like 34 bucks that is such a good price for a high-end foundation I've seen other foundations I go for like 65 bucks so I think that they absolutely killed it I don't know how it's going to look on someone with drier skin I really have no idea might be slightly patch here I don't know I would highly recommend it if you are oily or if you're more combination River normal and has 40 shades 40 shades oh they did that with that launch guys they did that I wear the shade 210 that's inclusive as I think that's really amazing one more thing from FNT beauty I wanted to shout out is their highlighters these are the kilowatt highlighters I think that's a cool name kilowatt so I wanted to talk about this color specifically this is in the shade hustle baby and mean money I'm not really a fan of this shade this one some I think this is much more of a natural like natural I don't know I don't know but this one bitch so on the right side my right we have the we have this one right here which is the brightest why don't we have like the more subtle one I just thing that they did a really great job with these highlighters as well I think they're  stunning I'm not really a huge fan of the one that says moon in the title of it which is funny because I'm a  banana I think that this one is beautiful I think that their trophy wife one is so beautiful it doesn't really work too well on my complexion because I am a really really really fair so just be cautious with that when it comes to the shade trophy wife but it is a beautiful shade Oh what I have to say the ultimate highlighter that I've been loving for the past couple months this is the shade Uranus this is me and Jeffries collaboration so one of the guys it's a very pretty pale gold so I'm gonna swatch Eleuthera here if i swatched uranus uranus is right here i'm actually wearing it on my cheeks today I'm only wearing Uranus on the cheeks this highlighter guys I've been wearing it non-stop you don't understand I literally wear it every single time I do a makeup it's such a beautiful pale gold if you are fair in complexion and if you're really really light and you have been looking for a gold highlighter that you're like that you've been wanting but all the shades I've been to gold I would check out Uranus I chose this shade in mind of different skin tones and different complexions and things like that so for me I am a fair complexion I really wanted to have a highlight that was gold and you can tell that it was gold but I wasn't going to look literally gold when I'm looking straight on it was gonna be a gold  streak on my face also it is gold so it's it looks so nice on different skin tones I absolutely love it I'm so proud of it you guys oh my god so in case you guys did not know Uranus is the part two of the collaboration that me and Geoffrey did I collaborated with jeffree star cosmetics and we came out with a highlighter named Eclipse and it was a really beautiful high intensity pink shade I wanted to make a gold equivalent to that exact shade and that's what we did I believe that it's still available in the bundle I think our individuals are already sold out but if you guys can check it out it's such a  stunning ass shade I love it I hope you guys love it as well blush I've been loving this is from dose of colors this is the blush like you mint it this is from their Mint collection I don't know if it's still in stock I hope it is please this blush is in the shade amazement you guys it's a blush I'm wearing right now it's literally the only blush I've been wearing for the past like two months which is it right here this is the bush it's like such a pretty soft apricot pink color right here it just gives you such a nice lifelike sheen it's not like shimmery but it's not matte either it's just a beautiful color I did an entire mint collection that was so sickening and I would definitely highly suggest getting this blush because it's stunning it's a Fitz burning it's we can't do any better and last but not least in be a favorite section I want to talk about this really quickly because I'm so obsessing this is the Too Faced Born This Way ethereal setting powder you guys I have been using this powder non-stop since I got actually since Laura told me to get it I try things that other Beauty youtubers talk about and say that they really really love because honestly there are so many new differ products that come help so often and it's a literally impossible for you to try things out over and over again and just continuously every single day it's impossible and I'm like okay cool she said that she loved it okay let me try let me try it I tried it and honestly I have not used my laura mercier or my coverfx powder since I tried the Too Faced ethereal powder it's the most beautiful like filtered ass powder I don't know what the is in there I don't know what kind of witchcraft is in there I don't know what kind of gooey is in there I don't know I don't know you know but all I know is that it's amazing it gives you a beautiful soft filtering effect you can bake with it it sets your makeup beautifully I feel like it makes my like smile lines they crease less when i'm using it the whole powder is just  great you get 17 grams of product in here I'm not kidding you if you guys are in the market for a new powder that you need for the face something that's going to set your makeup in place but not like be too heavy either because it's not a heavy powder by any means I don't know I don't really know okay guys and now we're gonna move on to the disappointments I don't like to be doing that so first disappointment that I have not really been loving I actually have three this time because it's been a while since I've actually felt one of these the first one I wanted to talk about that I'm not really obsessed with are the Fenty beauty of matchsticks honestly and the reason I don't really like them is because I feel like they're a little bit too hard to use I feel like they're much more of a like harsh intense consistency it's like you have to really drag them to get any product I'll gifts are really like and I feel like it takes off the foundation and I feel like that literally is defeating the purpose and you need to use a brush to apply it or a sponge or something like that I just feel like that's literally defeating the purpose of of it being easier to use same thing with the highlighting ones same with the shimmery ones I just don't think that they're the most practical and they're 25 bucks if they're like 15 bucks I'd be like yeah you know they're so great like you can still use it with a brush but the fact that they are 25 and you can really only use it with a brush or take off your foundation or like moves the product too much I'm just not a huge fan you know I'm just not really into it and trust me guys I'm a huge fan of Rihanna I think she's amazing and I love Kendall products I'm not trying to be a bitch and like talk by any means but I'm not gonna like sit here and be like I love these sick when I don't like them you know and I know I'm sure I'll get people like hating and something like I can't believe you don't like something from Rihanna or like you know like she has diehard fans I don't if you're watching this I apologize if you think that I'm coming for her but I'm not I'm just being honest I didn't work for me and hopefully they worked for you if you guys tried them awesome maybe I'm using them wrong let me know in the comments down below if you guys have them and if you love them how do you use it to use it with a sponge or with a brush or do you apply directly onto your skin like what did you do do you warm up on your hand first I just feel like there's a lot of steps or a lot of things that you have to do to make these work and I'm not into that I want to work right away that's what your next product I want talk about that was kind of disappointing to me is the Urban Decay troublemaker mascara this is the sex proof mascara actually did an entire video on it this just didn't work for me it just didn't I feel like it didn't make my lashes look pretty I feel like I made my curls sink my lashes lower like this like literally looking straight down it was rough I'll leave this video linked down below if you guys are interested in seeing it when I was like talking about like I did a full demo I literally run it up and down my stairs like 20 times trying to sweat so I can prove whether or not it's going to be sex proof like if you're sweating and you're doing the nasty and is it going to like water are your eyes gonna water you guys is it gonna run down your face and it totally did now so sound but yes it's not my favorite mascara it's is not one out reach for it which sucks because I think that the component of this is so beautiful I love the facets of it I love that it's like a holographic like sexiness I don't know I'm just bummed it didn't work it just like wasn't my cup of tea and I didn't like the way my lashes looked with it either so all in all what's not my favorite mascara and last but not least is this from Mac the Mac roller wheel liner y'all can you see the streakiness of this can you see the streaks in that do you see that you guys I tried I really tried I also did a separate video on this as well I really try it to make this work I really did but honestly I feel like it's very very hard to use it's not very user friendly when you're trying to drag from the wing coming back in it's so hard to use but it's crazy because they're not so many comments when people saying that they absolutely loved it and that I worked so easy on them and that they had on they have a hard time doing a regular liner with like a felt tip liner or hymn brush but this was really really easy for them so honestly if you guys are a beginner and maybe you guys don't really know how to do a winged liner as much when it comes to like using a felt tip liner or a brush maybe this will work out for you guys I personally did not think they worked very well just not the most user-friendly to me and I also think that the formula itself it's way too matte it's way too drying it literally was like cracking my  i off all I'm saying that that  was really rough and I would definitely not suggest it and that is it you guys that's it for the entire video that is it from all my hits and disappointments I apologize again for not being able to put these videos up as much when I travel because I just feel like for me if I'm not trying the product out enough and I just like like it like and I just use it once I just like that's not a favorite I'm sure other people do that like they'll try it one time and they loved it like oh it's a favorite of mine for the month I'm like yo that's like not even what's supposed to be when it comes to favorites videos I mean who knows maybe it is to them in their world that might be it but to me I need to use actually a couple times and like I need to really fall in love with the product to be able to put it in my favorites video I don't know man for me that's just like not my style I want to try something out a lot of times before I say it's a favorite of mine I apologize greatly for not being able to put these up as much travel man Travel is a killer I love it it's such a huge blessing being able to travel I absolutely love doing it it's so fun it is intense sometimes traveling when I have a lot of to do back home I'm gonna try to do one of these videos next month I'm not gonna be traveling as much so hopefully I can try more products out and we will see what you think if you guys are down let me know in the comments bar below if you guys like these kind of videos let me know I will definitely continue to do them or I'll try to do them much more often but other than that you guys that is it I'll leave all my favorites linked down below if you guys aren't interested in trying any of them but yeah it's time to I gotta go I gotta go to Nevada real quick I love you guys so much how great was that a night or day wherever you guys are and I will catch you guys in my next video bye guys I love you oh like movies or I can't do it okay I gotta go but anyways you guys as always if you guys do like this video if you guys why can I not do many intro it's my intro I've had it for ever oh now you come back to me now you come back to me huh now you're gonna come back to your father vamos going kendo y'all did dad you honey game go ahead swatch it like Ken me Uranus is right here you don't playing we really did that girl we  did that oh Zia Jesus and I also think that the formula itself it's way too matte it's way too drying it literally was like cracking my eye off I was like is that the San Andreas Fault but not bitch 
hey guys that welcome back to my channel so today's video is going to be a fun one I'm so excited to be doing this I've not done a one branch tutorial in so freakin long what makes this even more special on top of the one branch tutorial is it is the fact that I'm actually partnered with Beauty lish on in today's video Beauty lish is actually a brand I've worked with many many times probably making your third together and we're gonna be using all Charlotte Tilbury today I've not used at tons of Charlotte debris products I've used a couple staple products that are absolutely amazing and those like products that I use in my everyday routine that are freaking phenomenal but I have not used all the product I thought be really really fun to do a full face using Charlotte Tilbury products because we are going to be focusing specifically on the new instant look palette which is this beautiful powder here this is the instant look smoky palette oh these guys are all existing popular items for Charlotte Tilbury and they got put into a palette for everyone to try out so actually like this is a really really really cool thing for those who want to try out charlotte tilbury products but don't want to buy so many different products and you want to try like one thing I would definitely suggest doing it this but yeah you guys as always if you guys do not this video if you guys do not like me please don't thank you but if you guys do like this video please subscribe to my channel if you're not already and if you know what's up but many MUA and welcome to my channel thank you so much for being here also do not forget all month of October we were doing a giveaway on my channel every Sunday I'll be announcing on snapchat at nighttime who wanted the giveaway for that week either you're gonna be getting an iPad or a MacBook Pro all you need to be doing is subscribed to my channel to enter the giveaway that's literally it be subscribe to my channel and boom you are in the giveaway okay guys let's get started [Music] this is one thing I want talk about really really really quickly beauty lish is a brand it's an online retail brand that has this wonderful wonderful thing called flexible payments and this is like my favorite part about beuliss is that you don't have to pay the lump sum of your total right at one thing so they have two options now they have any orders over $100 you can make three payments interest-free over the next three months so you don't have to pay the lump sum right then they're like god I want this product but you can't buy it at that exact moment you can do flexible payments which i think is absolutely amazing and now there's a second payment option for any order over $50 you can make two payments those you who want to do flexible payment but don't have a sum total of a hundred bucks and I can go over 50 and you will have flexible payments okay guys so let's get started on today's video first things first I'm gonna prime the skin I'm gonna using the chart silver yet magic cream mmm you guys this smells rich we're going to prime the skin with this you guys this is such a beautiful soothing face cream it's really really hydrating this is like one of her most popular products I think there's actually one of the products that made like her line famous actually a just hydrates your skin beautifully and also Prime's the skin so today we're gonna try this foundation now I have not tried this yet this is the start so get Magic Foundation broad-spectrum SPF 15 and we have shaved 2.5 baths let's see this is oh she looks a little light but it's probably accurate that's really pretty I would say this gives me more of a satin dewy ish finish it's not really mattifying on the skin so far I'm applying it with a morphe M 439 it's like this will be the nicest way to apply it because it's I just feel like this foundation is a little bit more of a medium slash sheer coverage so I like to build it up a little bit with using a kabuki brush as gonna see you'll see some of my redness from my pimple right there so it's not like intensely full coverage or anything like that but I would say it's a nice like medium but it's nice it's like really really genuinely pretty on the skin and look I feel like it makes it look like your skin but prettier that's kind of the vibe I'm getting and I used two pumps maybe we'll take one more pump one water so now I'm just using a Beauty Blender to Pat out any streaks I could possibly have I always do this after I apply with a thick a foundation brush like a dense foundation brush I always use a little Beauty Blender after make sure I have no streaks in the foundation or anything like that possible the solid Asian smells like SPF it has an SPF 15 so it has a little bit of that SPF smell but it's not terrible whatsoever it's not like one that like is intense where you're like holy crap hey SPF like how you doing girl I think it looks really pretty it's much more unnatural skin moment for me I feel like this is much more of a natural foundation is something I can wear daily whereas I wouldn't wear it to like a drag convention you know I'm saying so that was a plus that's a win you know why I love working the Bueller skies I love them because they let me be myself when they let me be honest and they let me do what I do let me do what I do and I really really appreciate that it's very important for me to be able to still feel like I'm being me and not feeling like I am like some type of like sponsored ass like person whenever they work with me every single time they've always let me be myself and I really really cannot thank them enough for being like that really like you guys didn't thank you for working at me I actually get a lot of tweets from you guys letting me know how awesome it is too for flexible payment to be a thing like I didn't even realize that they had that until they told me and I was like wait that's literally genius why the hell does no one else do that so I just realized I do not have any Charlotte Tilbury concealer okay manual waiting to be a flop on a full face a Charlotte Tilbury tutorial so now we're going Sarah on dries really quickly you guys I know you guys know this about me this is like my favorite powder ever the airbrush flawless finish powder holy crap this is mine yeah you guys this is literally the prettiest setting powder ever I would not have hit pan if I didn't love it so much it honestly gives you an airbrushed finish it sets your makeup beautifully beautifully but it doesn't like make your skin look heavy and honestly you can keep applying this this is a powder oh you can keep applying over and over and over like more and more and more and more and more and it's not going to get cakey or heavy looking it's gonna stay the same and that's why I live for it so much it stays looking good guys it stays looking good do you guys recognize me I know this is not the shit I usually go foundation I usually am a lot darker okay guys so now we're gonna dip into the smoky eye instant look palette which is this guy right here we have our bronzer we have our blush of our highlight and of course there's some eyeshadows up here as well so this guy retails for $75 and as I said earlier it's a great value if you guys want to try charlotte tilbury products like you want to test out many versions of other products of hers like this is basically a mini spa like it has the other products of Charlotte in here other than the eye colors these already blushes that the line has a highlighter that the collection has any bronzer that the collection has so the shadows are the exclusive in this palette I freaking love her products they have beautiful frigging product so I'm gonna dip in to the bronzer this is the face bronze section right here charlotte brush oh my gosh just so luxe using this look at that I did Wow high pigment it how are you doing girl we should have really really really blend this out it's extremely pigmented Wow living so far live being personally nice to its that high-end price point honey we get those high-end product with those high-end price point chic you a why of all so now we're gonna take some blush or and take the cheek 5 and cheeks 6 we're gonna bounce them these guys as I'm dipping in it there's some fallout going on right here but they are powder so there's going to be fallout of course and as I said so many times I actually enjoy a little bit amount of fallout as long as there's like a good blend to it and these products do blend very nicely so I'm not mad at all oh my god this is a really pretty fuckin blush ok guys so far I'm really really really liking my base right now so I'm gonna take the highlight shade of this palette right here we're going to highlight the face so this guy is a beautiful soft gold highlight I mean it's soft if you want it to be soft I feel like it's buildable yep available she wants to be soft she can be soft she can be dainty she wants oh she want the bitch to be fuckin there I'm taking out of morphe r36 you guys I really enjoy overdoing it I really enjoy overdoing it on the highlight guys like I really live so I'm there for a fucking overdone highlight I'm there for let's distract them let's distract these bitches you know actual just really like this is glow because I feel like it's such a pretty light soft it's like subtle but it's there like does that make I don't make any sense and it doesn't really emphasize my texture a lot which is kind of cool of course you guys can see I do have texture there's nothing that will avoid that but I feel like this hilar does not emphasize it whatsoever I don't know why I'm feeling myself so hard right now ok guys so now we are I thought we don't the base like this base looks fucking nice like I'm really really happy with this I think it looks really really pretty I'm really happy with the combustion products we chose guys I love the foundation I think it's beautiful I really like the palette as well because I feel like it's a great deal and her products are pretty pricey it's a high-end brand too high in price point also of course you guys know this is vite outer this is the powder in all powders I'm sorry I said it I said it so now let's go ahead move on to the all heat those the eyes okay guys so we are going to try the Charlotte Tilbury brow lift three-way shape tool so we have a little brow it looks like that it looks like the UH Nastasia like teardrop shape that's the kind of shape that has here actually I think that Toby's brown head at first no shade observation I think we're using the shade Brooks so we're gonna use a shade Brooks it puts out a nice amount of product but it's not like too heavy okay so we were using the shade Brooks and I think now we're gonna use a shade Naomi which is a darker shade I think it's kind of sickening that this is named after Naomi Campbell I'm assuming it's named after Naomi Campbell I'm not of course positive but I feel like all of Charlotte's names for her products are named after like supermodels and famous actors and things like that I mean my chest the Kim Kate lipstick that everyone dies for including me I'll probably work today I think this color just suits my brow a little bit better what I like about this pencil is that it puts down a nice amount of product but not too much well you're kind of like overwhelmed and you're like oh shit I put too much down it's just enough Wow okay she's really an aggressive brow today whoo-chow okay cool we're gonna go for the Cara intense dickham brow I'm gonna do the other side real quick and I'll be right back damn who's this bushy brow girl okay guys so I went ahead and primed my eyes off the camera because I do not have a concealer that means I don't have an eye primer from her brand I don't think that she has an eye primer excited not see one so now we're gonna move on to the eyes now I'm gonna take the same palette guys this is a really universal palette I'm gonna take the bronze shade mixing it with the enhanced shade right here and Hance right there it took a nice contour shade and I'm gonna put that with a morphe and 504 fluffy brush and put that into the crease we're gonna do an easy everyday look I feel like a child tillery's Brian is literally that paid me of like enhancing your natural features and like being like of a pretty like a pretty look or who's no guy it's like I wanna do a smoky eye isn't terrible oh I do I really do no let me see I'm trying to stay away from smoky eyes all the time that's all I do the shadows are blending beautifully just how they were on the face I should have called this video freakin full faces in one palette that's what I did let's grab the morphe M three to six I'm taking the shade I brighten which is like the lightest I went to Brighton alright because that's what it says making you take a look at that I brighten again on my finger and we're gonna put that over absolutely a very soft lightweight wash of color like more of a glowy satin finish take a little bit of the highlight shape of the face right on top of that so I'm gonna take this shade I smoked on it this morphe e18 right here a little bit just on the outer corner just to deepen it ever so slightly okay guys before I continue I completely forgot I wanted to try this out too this is the legendary brow take a little brow gel and the cute little comb I love it the cute little brow gel just kind of sculpts the brows in place like black skies I like to really be sure that I take a small amount of product in the beginning and I build from there and I don't try to overdo it with black because I feel like I can go awry very quick very fucking good I'm just taking a and 4-3-3 for morphine just blending out those edges I think once like literally like smoke like it just feels like I'm still gonna say this is still pretty natural for me though can i I hope I can cuz I would take that face and enhance color guys I must smoke out the lower lash line no that's not smoking that's like a crazy we're going to just make you a little bit more coherent with the whole look so I'm gonna say I'm you just just doing a really really really warm toned look and this is not very warm tone to me so we do a nude in the waterline a black room Brown iconic liquid eye pencil rockin Kohl I cheat clever wasn't he then I guess I like that we're gonna be that in the waterline that is so smooth wait down so this is what I quality feels like okay don't know it's all using before but uh cardio so now I just call my lashes really quickly just give it a quick little moment a curl I'm gonna take V full fat lashes have not tried this mascara yet I've not tried this let's see how she oh she how does she act we'll see I really enjoy a dryer formula of mascara I don't like it to be too liquidy like it gets all over the place and it drops my curls so quickly Oh like that Rimmel one that I just tried in the other day now Ramone was so bad oh my gosh in the in the tutorial that I did like full face affordable products Rimal one was so bad I've never had a mascara that bad in my whole life so this one is a drier formula which I very much very much enjoy this is well oriented see that I wish my lashes want to go streak down i wouldnt have to wear falsies all the time it separates the lashes pretty nicely there's not up a lot that gets deposited on the actual brush itself which is good because you don't have to make an entire disaster of a mess with it yeah I'm not mad at this I'm not mad at this whatsoever hmm oh I see you different okay so this is the mascara right here this is what it looks like eyes closed looking down looking at I definitely know it's giving me a nice amount of volume and it definitely separates my lashes nicely I'm gonna go put on a pair of lashes really quickly and I'll be right back to finish off okay guys so we have some lashes on now I'm wearing Lily lashes at Miami right now now I'm going to move on to the lip and we will be done with the full face Charlotte Tilbury gonna lamb and I'm thinking I can't decide if I want to do Kim K twist or pillow top both are fucking so let's watch a few H as we can see ll talk right there it's done Kim K West which is literally like my one of my go-to news it's so beautiful right there we also have nude Kate which is an option I've never tried this one yet done this is what this one looks like right there it's like a peachy nude fuck people talk someone like I think I want a little bit of something you know let's see what it looks like if not we got me the pie Kim K Weiss on top it's all good I'm just dressed for this oh these lipsticks they're too good why does this look like my actual lip color like identically she's doing a little bit of a Kim Kim you know they don't that stuff is unnecessary but then there you have it Oh No and there we have it you guys this is the completed face look using all Charlotte Tilbury and products this is the most expensive full face part video I think I've ever done and it would've been a lot worse if I use even more of the products so it's kind of lessons here I honestly just have a lot of fun at doing the one Brant tutorials I think they're so fun to do and I think it's really fun to grab a product or grab a couple of products from a brand and do a full face using only net brand to see the products that you liked see the products it you didn't like as much I actually really enjoyed almost all the products here today actually I enjoyed them all yeah there's not one product that I'm like oh that's rough like there's literally nothing on my face that I do not like of how it looks I really like the foundation I love the palette I loved the eyeliner the mascara is really nice the brow products were fantastic the lipstick is stunning this is what I always hear about Charlotte Tilbury lipsticks

really appreciate be honest going into this 3 second brow eyebrow stamp [Music] okay so it comes in this big-ass box of course I don't have scissors me right now like why would I oh I've nail cutters it's get all bad and Waring's okay so let's quickly read up on this three-second eyebrow stamp let's see how much it is and what it does hmm these before and after Baker's though sure okay so the three-second brow eyebrow stamp is twenty dollars and it comes in two shades it comes with a dark and I like to medium and it comes with two set of stamps it comes with a arched brow any soft brow I'm more of an arched brow kinda bitch music you guys in to see what these brows look like and what the fan looks like get into this game okay steps we're reading the instruction hand you want kids my knees manual rub the step into the powder until the sponge is sufficiently coated with brow powder while looking in the mirror align no stamp with your brow and press firmly in the impression for three seconds use the included spoolie brush to grid of any excess powder around your brow is this me or here my brows are literally like too big for this so let's see how this works out so we're gonna using the darkest of the powder it's right here I have black hairs so so we're gonna do is we're gonna go ahead and get this damn and we're gonna Winkle it said wiggle sufficiently coated that bitch if that's not coated we're gonna go in huh ganya okay let's try I'm scared a little okay okay three seconds hmm let me try the brush hold on it's not unsavable so tied I'll decide first shits and giggles I feel like we should why don't we do the other shape on the other side yeah I'm not really 100% sold on it yet so let's see what we think on this side what am I even trying to do here cuz try it let's brush it out after you spoolie it out there's definitely some product in my brow but I don't know about this guy's I don't know about this I think that if you have less brow hair than I have it might be easier to do this and then fill in after just to have a base shape that's why I could see it working as honestly that's that's about it this is my brows done like this is then filled in with the product yeah I didn't do much huh let me just do one more stamp for health wealth and happiness and let's see if it gives me a shape like I want or not okay guys so I have my opinion that on the lid do I think that this is worth 20 bucks I think it's actually kind of fun I think it's fun to try out I think that if you have less brow hair than I have and you need a real good like stencil I think that's actually pretty practical if you guys want to try that hell I think that's not practical that only has two colors you see the black look / charcoal or I'm light/medium but I do think that if you have like no brow hair and you need a stencil that I think it could actually work I mean I definitely saw a product being put down I see a shape here like it definitely I'm sure I can do something like it's not completely  for me practically am I gonna use this ever again no I do think it's fun but I do not think it's the most practical product for me personally but if you have

I'm an Manny MUA and welcome to my channel. Thank you so much for being here Yeah, let's go ahead and get into this Kylie cosmetics Holiday Collection So I have nothing on my eyes right now because I wanted to do a look using the palette that I wanted to use I have no highlighter on so I wanted to try the wet set and I have no lipstick on  because I Want to swatch a couple of the lipsticks course, I'm gonna do with the majority on my arm. I ain't trying to swatch no fucking 11 lipsticks okay, so this is the set Holy Jesus do we see this god damn shit So what do we start with first? I think I'm gonna go in with the wet set first. I'm so excited This is the wet set this is the holiday wet set it looks like this actually has a really really cool Glittery ombre effect that goes down. I don't know if you guys can see it. I'm gonna try to catch it Ah right there. You see this all this like glitter Falling. So we have the Kylie cosmetics pressed powder palette each of these powders comes with 11 grams of product Which is a really really nice amount. We have sugar coated, frostbite, sweet dream and ginger bread Those are the shade names. This guy is made in the USA and it retails for.. I don't know let's look it up and see if they actually have It even um on the sites. Because I believe that the Kylie stuff it releases tomorrow Okay guys, so I can't actually find anywhere where the retail price of the Wet Set is gonna be. The last one I believe was like 60 something dollars so I'm assuming This is gonna be similar to that price. So let's go ahead and just open it I was really excited think the only one that they have shown so far Is the palette which are gonna retail for $44 so this is what the palette's packaging looks like It's like a really really intense glittery silver glitter intensity Craziness. Is its beautiful. Yes. It's cool Looks really cool, but this is the type of packaging  that has a glitter that comes off on you And I fucking hate that! I absolutely hate. This is a personal thing if you guys don't mind that great That's all good, but I personally to not like that I really get some my nerves. Okay I went ahead and turned down the brightness a little bit So maybe that would help to you guys and see what it will look like so this is the palette right here Let's go and describe these shades here, right we have sugar coated, frostbite, sweet dream, gingerbread We have sugar coated is a purple pink reflect We have frostbite which is a it's a white which has tons of shimmery flakes in it And it almost has like glittery chunks in it That's what it looks like so we have sweet dream, and this is more of a peach with a golden reflect And we have gingerbread which is like a bronzy shimmer That's we got here. So let's go and swatch the four of them. We have sugar coated ...ooo they feel just as good as the last one did. Frostbite oh this bitch is so wet. So weird, I love it. Got them right here guys. We have the four right there Ah beautiful, I'm gonna swatch them on my hand Right here guys. We got the four right there, boom Wet set highlighters right there. That is so nice. Okay guys, so I think I'm gonna to use sweet dream the shade 'cause that one is the prettiest one So I'm gonna use my finger a little bit, and I'm gonna also try to use a beauty blender to see what works best as a wet highlighter as you guys know It doesn't really go on well with a like highlighting brush. like a Morphe brush I usually go in with it's a fluffy brush like that doesn't really work with this as much so we have right here boom Which is beautiful its absolutely is stunning. I'm very happy with this. Oh, that's so. This is my favorite color of the group It's a peachy. Oh... oh my gosh. You guys it looks so nice with the finger I'm gonna put a little bit of sugar-coated at the top corner Just to give it a little bit more of a pop like right there. Oh my god I live a thousand lives right now for this one I loved the last wet set I thought was so so so good. And I thought it was so pretty the colours of this one I don't like as much as the last wet set but it is a holiday one  so if you guys do enjoy them and You guys want something that's limited edition I would definitely suggest getting this wet set because it is beautiful it looks beautiful on the skin it blends in so nicely you see Bitch guys. I'm like a really big fan of the Kpop group BTS right now like I'm living for them. I've been listening to the music non stop. And I wish I was as cool as them, but I don't think that's possible So now let's go into the palettes because I want to get my eye makeup done right now So we have two palettes here guys We have the naughty and we have the nice palette which I think is such a cute idea. This is like something I'm really really excited about I love the concept of using like a naughty and nice or like a Contrasting thing actually have an idea for my own brand I've had this idea for a while to do like a double palette kind of situation with a idea and It's definitely it's gonna happen like it's already like it's gonna happen like this is something that I've like been wanting to do not naughty And nice of course, but like my own spin on a dual palette So I really like that she did this because it's it's so fun to me like I love this contrasting idea We have the naughty palette here Which is this like felt like naughty is filled in with this felt thing going on we have the nice palette Which is nice with like the cute little bubbles With the felt as well first things first we have the nice palette which is this guy right here This guy's is the palette that I'm gasping for I think it's so Fucking beautiful, and it's 44 bucks That's a fair price point for 14 shades to me like that is really really Really fair and Kylie has some really really nice shadows so I'm like bitch. Yes. Go on. This is a nice palette Oh, this is nice. I love I live I live I live and we also have the naughty palette right here, which retails for 44, and is also 14 shades deep here Which I also think is a beautiful palette. This is not like my favorite of the two, but it is very very nice I don't know I think it's just because it's not the most cohesive palette ever I'm kind of looking at it, and I'm like the fuck am I gonna do with all this I don't know so this is like not my cup of tea as much But we're gonna swatch some of the shades you guys can see what they look like we'll do a couple of them We have snow ball Which is a white we're gonna swatch them on my arm Jingle, which is like some weird like glittery shade, that doesn't swatch as nice Jingle is not that great you have unwrap me, which is like a moon oh Go ahead and do emerald bitch. Oh, and it feels so good. Holy shit that feels nice Ho ho ho cuz you know I love a good hoe and let's do Snowflake, that's like a really pretty intense silver So these are a couple of the shades I swatched on my arm right here This is just finger swatch the maroon one right there swatches a little patchy and weird But I know I'm sure it'll blend nicely on the eye, and they swatch nicely though like they're not bad at all so I'm impressed I like I like. For me of the two I like the nice palette more, so now we have the nice palette which bitch. This is speaking to me. I'm sorry This is so fucking pretty honestly I'm like kind of screaming inside. I just think it's so nice I don't even know what color I want to go in with it because it's all so pretty if I can look at a palette And I'm like oh my god. I want to use it all. That's where I know I want a palette I'm going with a shade miracle miracles from heaven have you seen that movie and who's crying from it with me Into the crease. I'm taking this on a Morphe M511 it's a big fluffy brush like to go in with transition shades with the brush like this just to kind of get it everywhere And I go in with macaroon and Santa Baby, and they're picking up nicely on the brush. They're really nice I feel like Kylie cosmetics has really picked it up in the shadow realm I think that they're really really really pretty Formulas that they have been coming out with with the palettes recently have been really really nice I've been really enjoying the fucking palettes, dude like they've been stepping their fucking shit up I want to do like a pinky intent like a pinky crease I want to take blizzard on the lid because I haven't used a shade like that in a minute And it is speaking to me, just building up you guys it blends beautifully on the eyes like it looks absolutely beautiful I'm very very very happy with how it's looking so now I'm going with the shade wonderful and this is Like a really deep dark chocolate brown just to go on the outer corner. Just a deep in there Just a little bit more, beautiful It's beautiful except nicely pray that it blends nice thing as well, so let's go ahead and deposit it with the brush now I'm taking that on a morphe m433 great Just like fluffy packing brush, put that into the crease fuck that shit's real pigmented a little goes a long way I'm gonna take it all the way in to the inner portion of the eye as well right up into the inner crease Keeping it of course darkest on the outer corner But I'm gonna take it all the way in so this is what we got so far you guys we just have a nice really pretty pinky purple I... It looks fucking great. Okay guys, so now I go with the shade blizzard Which I'm so excited to go in with so I'm taking this shade blizzard on a morphe m167 which is a really packy brush You can see I've packed it on there. I'm gonna apply that with a wet brush. See how that applies My god, that's so beautiful. Oh my word. Oh my fucking neck. Me encanta. Fuck it, I'm gonna use my finger Oh my god its so pretty This is like a duo-chrome blue purple, if that makes any sense It's like a blue maroon duo-chrome and it's really pretty but it's actually a lot less pigmented than I thought it was going to be Like as if I should have probably had a base color underneath this Cuz I feel like a little bit of my skin is peeking through, it's still stunning Don't get me wrong, but I am just noticing that right now as I'm applying it I'm like I feel like I can see some of my skin peeking through doesn't matter Doesn't matter so just be careful with the fallout of the shade guys because there is some fallout that happens because it is more of a flakey Duochromey type shade, but it looks fucking beautiful, and I really really like it woah I'm gonna finish the top of the eye on the other side, and I'll be right back. Okay guys so here We have it the top of the eyes are done. With blizzard, if you guys do get this palette just be aware that it is a Flakier shade there's gonna be a lot of fallout That's going on and you definitely want to use the shadow wet or use a glitter glue I think that would be the easiest bet it's a little difficult to use but it the effect is there and it looks so great Now I'm gonna take a little bit of a same shade macaron and miracle, mix them I'm gonna do the lower lash line now, and it'll really tie up the whole the whole look. You know what I'm saying the whole goddamn look Taking that on a Morphe E17 it's a great little lower lash line blender just cuz it's like compact now. We're gonna Take a little bit of Wonderland and hot cider on a little Morphe E36 and I'm gonna put that closest to the lash line to give us some definition and depth because girl, We need to fucking, not look like we have some pink eye, you know what im saying mmm-hmm, and it's fine so I'll blend it out right now That's totally cool we are gonna put the color down we're gonna blend when we're dead bitch Up with that and I'll blend that out with that same little B17 I'm gonna do a warm-up brown eyeliner in the waterline, which is I'm taking Marc Jacobs real cocoa Which I absolutely love it's like my favorite ever This shit makes my green eyes look so Good or hazel I'm sorry I have hazel eyes, whatever Mmm So guys now, we're gonna. Take this shade Jack Frost on a little Morphe M210, which is like a packing brush I'm gonna put on the inner corner and the brow bone. We're gonna use this to highlight. It's a go white with golden reflect It's literally a white with gold reflect so That's so pretty oh my gosh I love that feeling jolly as fuck bitch come on fucking Santa Claus like it really opens up the inner corner look at that shit holy tits, oh this is real gold, holy Fuck hey guys, I'm gonna go do my eyeliner and do some mascara and lashes off of camera, and I'll be right back Okay guys, so we have the eyes completely done now and so what they look like I think it's so pretty This is a look. I love doing I love a really really warm smoky Eye that has like a really fun like pop of color on the lid uh its my favourite What do we think of the naughty and the nice palettes guys? What do we think I think the quality is fantastic I think that they really have stepped up the quality a lot in the shadows of Kylie cosmetics I mean, I think I always thought that they were pretty good like they're pretty okay Always, I feel like these palettes if they have been doing are so good so for me personally I would purchase the nice palette for $44. I think this is a great great great palette I would not purchase the naughty palette just because I don't like the color scheme as much if you do enjoy this color scheme of The naughty palette this guy right here go ahead purchase it I'm sure the quality would be absolutely just as amazing swatching them They swatched beautifully So I would suggest if you wanted to but for me personally I would go with the nice palette and not the naughty palette so now we're move on to the lips a little bit So we have a couple things for the lips actually we have the sugar lip set we have the spice lip set which is this one here Here here sugar spice ah such a cute fucking concept this whole entire collection I think is very cute, and then we have a velvet liquid lipstick and lip liner in the shade red velvet So these are the three lip items also let me just include this and show you guys it does come with a bag Kylie did release a green Bag for holiday this season so I think that what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna swatch the sugar liquid lipstick collection on my lips I'm gonna do the spice on my arm, and I'm also gonna do the red velvet on my arm as well So we're going to go right into the swatches. There's on what the glosses let's go in start with the glasses first These are the two glasses that it comes with we have the gloss butter, and we have the gloss sugar here We have the golden gloss and basically a white gloss like dessert That's just what it is like Kylie glasses a lot Well, we have a pink reflect. It's pink. It's extremely glittery as we can see we have sugar glass right here I think it's a little intense not gonna. I wouldn't just wear this by itself I'd have to wear it on top of something the color itself is very pretty it feels very comfortable on the lips so now we're Gonna go in with the gloss butter Which is a golden version of in that last one take an old gold I see here. We have butter right here I want to see it gives the exact same effect as the other one did this is a little bit more golden It's a little bit more warm toned than the last one But this is a butter feels exactly the same because what we have next we have a liquid lipstick in here And we have a matte lipstick in here, and we also have another velvet in here So we have two Velvets and one matte in this entire set we have savage angel and boy bye We'll do the Velvets first because it is easier to take off so I'm gonna go ahead and swatch savage on the lip right now Well, that's nice And here we have a savage savage. We have savage and this is the shade it's a beautiful fucking like warm It's basically just a warm pink okay next we're gonna do boy bye which is another velvet really quickly? It's like a cool toned very wearable pink has like a purple undertone to it though I think Yeah, cool toned for sure sure this shit is like pink and purple. I don't know fucking fuchsia, so here we have boy Bye, oh, that's not good on that side Bitch bah, huh, and here we have it you guys we have a boy. Bye This is it right here. I live and breathe and now we're gonna finish off with this lip kit And we are gonna finish it with Angel matte liquid lipstick, which again is another warmer pink. This is a very very cohesive Lip thing so I'm gonna try this one I've angel right here actually think that angel was a color that Kylie has done before in the past But I could be wrong. I don't know I do remember actually really love the shades so much. It's looking pretty I love it. I feel so pretty in it like it's just a pretty pink shade so angel right here It's a matte liquid lipstick what I enjoy about this set is that it has two Velvets - glosses and a matte I actually much more enjoy her glasses and her Velvets over her matte formula I think they're a little bit drying. That's just me personally. I'm sensitive to the over drying of liquid lipsticks sometimes I definitely think that one of these should have been taken out and had it a different color And it may be something more deep a little bit more wearable for a deeper complexions, but that's just my personal opinion Let's go ahead and swatch the spice kit on my arm really quick so here We have Halle Berry which is a matte liquid lipstick very very pigmented. No streaks at all. Holy shit I like this color a lot mulberry right there next we have a Juniper. Gloss right here right there This little one needs to be like played with first before you actually hit music it's kind of stiff It's basically like a clear gloss with red marune flakes in it like glitter particles, so that is the color right here? We have a Juniper right there next we have another gloss in the shade cinnamon because this right here oh That is beautiful Holy shit. This is like a beautiful like terra cotta Brown Gloss so this would look so so so good on a deeper complexions like this would be the perfect nude For if you're a little bit dark deeper and complexion It's so fucking nice so next we have the matte liquid lipstick in the shade clove, which is so Fucking beautiful, holy shit. I'm not gonna watch it This way guys by the way This clothes actually kind of hard to describe you guys it's actually very similar to the first shade the first one is a little bit More berry a little bit more pink and toned this one's a little bit more neutral so as you can see right there It's a little bit more of a brown undertone and the first one's a little bit more of a right undertone So it's stunning though I have fucking love that shade a little bit streaky, er than the other ones But it is beautiful and here we have the shade goals you guys this is it right here so very very very warm Red into pink some these days are so hard to describe now like shit. It's just getting fucking real Okay, this sheet reminds me kind of like a Kristen a little bit I think okay you guys and last But not least we have the velvet liquid lipstick and lip liner do right here in the shade red velvet which is basically right? I'm assuming I'm just gonna do a little bit on the hand so you guys can see exactly what it looks like we have that lipliner and Red velvet right here. Let's go ahead and see what this looks like right here. It's beautiful. Oh My goodness it's nice. It's like a fire engine red. This is one of those Reds. That's like fuck me in the fucking Alleyway red you know I'm sayin so then we have the liquid lipstick here Right there full pic stunning swatch, I mean, I swatched it so badly, but it made me get prettier I'm sorry we have red velvet right there, beautiful fiery Right red like stunning. Okay guys, so what do we think of the two sets? What do we think about this actually like the spice set better? I thought the colors were a little bit better, and I thought that they were a little bit more nothing that they're more cohesive But I think that was a more of a variety. I would say if you are lighter income I wanna see if you're lighter and complexion and enjoy like nude shades a little bit more How it go with the sugar set personally, I enjoyed the spice set more because I thought was a pretty arrangement I thought the arrangement was better than the Sugar one, so you guys can't go wrong with either of them It just depends on the color selection that you guys like okay guys and that is it for today's video and all in all what? Do I think of the entire collection? I think that Kylie did an amazing amazing job this collection? I really do I'm very very Very honest and brutal enough right when I think about how these collections just like how I am with Rihanna I love Rihanna, but it's something from fenty Beauty came up I didn't like I would say I didn't like it like that doesn't mean Because I like her doesn't mean I'm gonna say like something you know what I mean, so I think that this collection is great I really do I think that was such a great concept And I think Kylie cosmetics really really killed it so congrats to you guys you guys fucking slayed I would say is it worth the bundle I would get it. I don't see one I don't personally like the color of this bag by the way I Know, but that's just my personal aesthetic that is it for me you guys Hope you guys had fun watching it of course I will linked these items down below if they are available when this video goes up actually I've no idea if it's gonna sell our Whatever the fuck But hope you guys had fun watching as always have a great rest of the night or day wherever you guys are and I hope To see you guys in my next video bye guys.

hey guys welcome back to my channel Oh such a creep anyways you guys I've not filmed in literally two weeks it's been so long I've been traveling a lot recently and I know I'm always like telling you guys I've been traveling a lot recently I apologize but whenever I come back from traveling I'm always like like I just feel like refresh like I'm just ready to film and ready to get going and ready to just kind of work and do my thing here with you guys but I'm excited to be filming today especially I'm even more excited to be filming today because today's video is about the Laura Lee Los Angeles cat's pajamas palette so before we even get started on that this video before I even get started on talking about the review of doing that eyeshadows everything I just wanna talk about something really quickly because I'm sure I'm gonna be getting this a lot I know a lot of you guys are probably thinking like Manny you're not gonna be giving an honest review because Laura Lee's when you're best friends and I totally understand if I was you guys I'd be thinking the same thing however throughout this entire process of Glore creating her palettes I have been with her throughout the entire way literally the last year and a half that she's been working on it or at least the time that she's been showing me samples of it I've been swatching I've been playing with the shades I've been writing them I've been using them as much as I can to help her and give her insight um and my opinion on the shadows so when I talk about this palette in a positive way if there is one shade that I'm not like living for as much there's like one shade that thing is a little bit drier than the others but other than that I think they're amazing that is why I'm talking highly of them it's because I've actually been using them in playing with them for so long and I wouldn't leave Laura astray you know what I mean like I've been like working on my own brand and working on my own thing and I have collabed so many times and I know the things I like I know the shadow quality I like I know the kind of lipsticks I like the kind of everything that I like so I just have been helping Laura along the way throughout this whole entire experience and of course she's done it all on her own by herself literally no investors she's done it 100% on her own and I just think it's so commendable and honestly if I didn't like this palette I wouldn't be reviewing it right now I wouldn't be talking about it because I think it's really bad karma I think it's kind of  up when you talk badly of other youtubers collabs or their brands or something like that I always just feel like a little weird about it I just feel like it's bad karma it's bad juju I do not want that on me I would just rather not talk about it I know I'm on this like four-minute long tangent right now I'm literally looking at the viewfinder like god damn I'm on a tangent but I just wanted to say that because I really have been with her throughout this whole experience and I know how hard worked on it and I know she's lost sleep over it I know she's crying over this probably I know so many like back end things that she's dealt with coming out this and coming out with her own brand and doing this all on her own and her int I worked so hard and so tirelessly over this and I just wanted to reiterate how proud I am of her and just know that I've been using these shadows for a long time where I've been watching them for a long time I've been playing with them for a long time but I've given her my feedback and my opinion back to the end of the day these are her shadows these are her creations these are all on her and I'm just gonna be trying them out in today's video I'm going to using I'm gonna be swatching them as well so yeah you guys as always if you guys do know like this video if you guys do not like me please don't watch it you know the Jo with that you don't do anything but if you guys that do like this video please subscribe to my channel if you're not already and if you're new what's up a man Iike me way and thank you for being here on my channel and watching this video I really appreciate it yeah guys let's go and get into this review and demo on the new Laura Lee Los Angeles Pig I still the flash on this video I just wanted to say I would never be dishonest with you guys in a review I will never talk highly of a product that's not something I love I will never ever ever ever do that so basically the only options for me are no video goes up at all and I don't talk about it because that's the only honest thing for me I would never say a product is amazing when it's not so basically that's the only option that I give myself I just don't allow myself to talk about other youtubers products so I just end up not doing a video if I don't like it so this is the palette you guys this is the Laura Lee Los Angeles catch pajamas eyes shadow palette as you can see has like this really cool flowery deco on it with a embossed black logo with her logo and the cool paint splatter on the back which i think is really pretty cute touch so you guys can see the back of it right here this is what the palette looks like itself it's right here the lights are pretty bright I apologize and it's like one of those reflective cardboards so the unicorn itself is pretty reflective so you can see here it is also cruelty free and it's vegan which i think is absolutely amazing so this is the pal you guys this is so excited I'm sorry like I don't mean to be such a goober but I'm just really excited and proud of her I see all those comments on on trend moves page or on like other people's pages like those hating comments saying like they can't believe a youtuber is coming off that makeup line or they think it's annoying or it's up and all these youtubers come out with Bran's button in the day the youtubers are trying to make it to the trying to be entrepreneurs are trying to have their own life and they're trying to have their own dreams come true so I understand 100% if it's annoying to people but I understand of course because I am a youtuber I want to have I'm gonna have my own brand - I want to have my own experiences I want to have I want to be my own CEO and I want to have my own products out for other people to love and enjoy as well not just Estee Lauder's and Lori Elle's out there I want to be my own little india brand and i just think it's so cool that Laura's taking that first step and she's already come out with her own product and I'm talking for Laura in this part a little bit but I do feel like a big reason that we are starting with our own brands and we're kind of doing our own thing is because of Jeffrey you know seeing Jeffrey just be a boss ass bitch like me and Laura want that like we want to have our own brands they want to be able to do that for ourselves as well so that's why I feel like youtubers are coming out with our own brands and they want to have their own entity for themselves not just a YouTube channel you know what I mean so that's kind of why I want to talk about to then a lot of people be like I can't believe that youtubers coming oh if I can begin if that's what their dream is to have their home brand didn't let them have it you know so this is we have in the palette right here we have the Aloha the Los Angeles this is a really really pretty glitter it's sickening it's like the sickest beautiful nice intense glare this reminds me a lot of the Mac Moorea collection where it's like they had that really cool intense a glitter effect reminds me a lot of that so it's like that really cool glittery paper in this in the daylight it's stunning we have a cute little kitten like a little cat here running with his little paws where thing is a cute touch because Laura is a  cat lady and we have cats pajamas right here and we got this right here we got 10 shades and I have used this before as you guys can see this is not a first impressions this is a review I have used this I've worn this palette several times and this palette retails for $40 it is launching on October 13 I believe it will be on Laura Lee Los Angeles's website which is also her merch site so that's where you're able to find it anyway guys I'm going to be doing the swatches first okay so that's going to talk about each shade individually before I start on with a look my eyes are you putting by the way so we're just gonna do a fun the fall time look I mean this is a very very very fall palette first one we have the first shade is okey dokey this is a really pretty matte almost satin finish cream shade it's super pigmented lightweight and it's a great base color and it would work really nicely as a highlight for the phone or for the inner corner the next shade is scatterbrain which is a goal it's basically just a straight-up yellowy goal it's like a champagne gold shade you can use this as a highlight this is actually the one shade I will say is a little bit flaky and a little bit dry and I would definitely suggest spraying like fix+ on your brush when using this one but other than that I think it's a beautiful shade and you can definitely make it work but this one I did notice had a little bit of fallout in it the next day it is a bomb diggity oh my god I absolutely love this shade this is like one of those baby pukey shades that is like so pretty it's super pretty feel super creamy super nice the next shade is a cray cray which is a really a pretty intense ass warm very very very very warm almost like rusty warm orangey Brown it's so so beautiful I love it it's another matte shade next we have the shade redonkulous which is a golden a bronzy shade this is Sarah here in a swatch this I would say is much more of a coppery bronze it's not like one of those brown tone bronze or a rose gold bronze so it's gonna look really really nice on hazel and blue eyes next we have the shade at quirky which is a beautiful shimmering purple basically a straight up purple with some black undertone it's not as bright as the redonkulous is but it is super beautiful and it looks again really beautiful on hazel eyes I wore this shade looks so stunning the next is the shade cooky which is a really beautiful maroon shade just a super just warm maroon I love shades like this is like my favorite kind of shades it's a matte shade as well I absolutely love it oh so next we have this shade in one ear which is a metallic cranberry shade so this one is one of those shades were like if you feel it it feels almost wet it has a lot of oil in it so these kind of really really amoliant shades I would definitely suggest using an eye primer that's more like oil absorbing and keeps you guys do get oily on the lids do you guys get oily on the lids and you don't use one of those primers I think it will like crease a little bit on you so I would definitely suggest using a primer that is much more silicone base like the Mac 24-hour or the smashbox 24-hour one which I love those are my favorite ones and you will see no problems with these whatsoever this is just one of those shades that works literally so creamy and smooth and beautiful feeling like it feels wet like it's just such a stunning shade and it will look beautiful on the eyes this is probably I'm gonna use on the ice today because I'm like I can't I need to use it like I next we have this shade out the other which of course is a second continuing shade from in one year and help the other of course it's like a brown purple it's really kind of hard to explain and it's not shiny and it's not matte it's like a satin matte finish it's kinda hard to describe actually it's stunning though it's like literally like one of those shades it's like a very intriguing shade it's not a normal shade whatsoever it's not a shade that you see in palettes very often but it is stunning on the eyes and I love it it feels beautiful and of course last but not least we have oddball which is the black shade this is a really really really nice black like I'm shocked at how beautiful this buck is blacks are very hard to do I'm I know because I'm working on a black right now and it's so  hard and it is one of those shades where you're like what though buck if you have it too loose and not press hard enough too much comes out on a brush and it will ruin a look it will literally ruin your entire eyeshadow look and that is devastating like I hate that but if it's pressed down too hard you don't really get enough color payoff on a brush you have to find a happy medium with a black and I feel like Laura completely accomplished this with her black it's so so nice it doesn't feel as of course creamy or as smooth as the other shades do because blacks never really do it's a beautiful black and it works very very nice it actually has a little bit of like sparkle in it but the sparkle does not translate when you put it on your hand or on your eyes it just comes off completely matte I don't know how that works but that is that for all the shades okay guys so I went in I zoomed in now we're gonna do an eye look using this palette I'm so excited sorry I'm like such a little geek right now I'm like I mean look I just feel like such a proud little best friend you know so I think I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do a really fun cranberry I actually asked you guys on snapchat and on Twitter what shadows you wanted me to use the most with this palette and literally about 80% of you guys said the bottom four rows so basically you guys said that you wanted to see me using these four shades right here because you saw a lot of people using those cop shades and you guys wanted to see me using indie shades down here so I was thinking that I would use the shade cooky in one here those are the ones I asked I got asked the most to do so I'm take the shade cooky on a of course like a little fluffy blending brush is a morphe e27 great just a fluffy blending brush for the crease and we're going to go ahead and put that into the crease my eyes are primed by the way I want this look to just be really intensely cranberry and really we're taking a very very light hand of it so we can blend it just to be so like intensely cranberry that I like this shade of course you guys is blending wonderfully it's such a beautiful matte shade colors like this are trickier to blend you know they're tricky to make because it's really important to have a shadow that has like a cranberry purple undertone to blend really nicely and they're hard to accomplish are not easy to blend out by any means I think that Laura really accomplished a beautiful beautiful shade with Kuki for sure let that blend it's seamless Junie's ash okay so this is what we should have so far after just blending the bitch how it blends very very very easily without me even using like a transitioning shade that I always always always use that's literally just going in with cookie and not blending anything out so that's sickening so now I would take the shade in one ear which is that beautiful maroon like cranberry shade when I put that all over the eyelid I would definitely suggest using a finger with this kind of shade because it is much more of an oily emollient shade and I think that it picks up the nicest with a finger of course a brush will pick it up nicely as well but I personally think that with this you want to stick to a finger for sure so since I'm layering a lot of shades on my eye right now I see a little bit of fall out on my cheeks which of course is normal with really really hyper intensely pigmented shades go ahead and take a little bit more of that cookie shade and blend that into the crease with that beautiful in one ear shade as well do I want to continue on with this like do I want to add the purple quirky in the outer corner quirky let's just see it looks like a little bit on the outer corner it just it gives it a little bit of dimension it's not that noticeable though look you don't you guys definitely don't have to do this step for sure or just give it a cute little bit of dimension and definition because it is of course still extremely shimmery but it is darker doesn't give you that little like like added depth which i think is really really beautiful just blend that together look who's gonna you guys this look is gonna be so easy to accomplish oh my gosh like a little cranberry princess so guys now we're gonna take the shade out the other on the outer corner and this is going to of course deepen up everything just wing it out it just take it there I'm gonna wing it out and we're taking this on a more feet 36 this is a really good pencil brush I want to take this out here I take that same power 39 and blend out those edges so it doesn't look crazy this I just looks winged out and gnarly and they flamed up in it we're gonna add that depth and dimension I'm take a little bit of oddball which is of course the black and I'm going up but that close to the last thing on this bucket does not play do I see that you guys just see that little extra mm not that we're doing hey guys so now that we're looking sickening and it's starting to really come together and I'm really seeing the vision I'm gonna take the shade of quirky on the same a 36 pie that on the lower lash line so we can really combine all the elements at that bottom 5 row and really smoke it out and give us that really pretty purple pop look at that like I feel like it's really tying together okay guys so we are now done with the dark colors we have this sultry smoky intense blown out  sickening a on our eyes we're gonna go ahead and apply a little bit of scatterbrain on a morphe m32 6 which is a great inner corner and a brow bone highlighting shade a little bit of a goal to give it a little bit of a pop whoo you can see the difference of course majorly now we're gonna do a little bit on the brow bone as well okay Maisie I'm gonna go finish the other eye and apply some eyeliner off of camera and I'll be right back actually and apply some lashes off camera to class takes forever be right back and here we have it you guys this is the final look using the Laura Lee Los Angeles palette this is how it looks she cute as though huh using new bounce um Bombay lashes which are very similar to Lily lashes Miami and that's it you guys that's it for today's entire video so what do we think of Laura Lee Los Angeles is palette I think that it's a complete win I think the Lord did an absolutely amazing job as you guys know I think this palette is wonderful and I'm so proud of her and it's going to literally be the perfect fall palette it has everything you could possibly need for fall in here this is fall the cuff I could have used this bitches like I've been using this like down down Laura if you're watching this I'm so  proud of you babe and you really really really really really really killed it with this power I hope you enjoy the look I created with your palette if you guys want to buy this palette of course check out Laura's channels and her website and things like that comes out on October 13th as I said earlier and anyways that's it for taste video I say that the palette is a complete hit I absolutely love it and I'm so again proud of you Laura and I think that if you guys bought this palette you

year's resolutions and I'm being dead ass like real ones I wouldn't you tell me some real ones I want you to tell me some fucking like like some little ones like you're just like randomly making up right now I wanna hear you guys you're being serious are you doing any New Year's resolutions are you taking them seriously like what is gonna be your new year's resolution for 2018 like I literally like we are starting the new year off we're starting it strong we want to start a strong and I feel like it's gonna be a fantastic fucking year if you make it fantastic I want on this whole fucking snapchat rant about how I think that just because a new here is happening does not mean that the world owes you anything basically if you want things to change for yourself in a new year you have to make them fucking happen yeah make them come to life you know what I mean as soon as you start thinking that the world owes you something it's one's problems start to arise and I'm being dead ass serious on this like this is like something this is gonna be some like fucking life advice video ok we're gonna talk about some life burning a really fucking real I'm just kidding I get that real bit like hello like kind of real you know when you start um we start to think that the world owes you something is when shit go down heal and I mean it in the most like nicest way possible I just mean that in the way of like yo you need to work your ass off in this life to make the best life possible for yourself you know what I mean you can't just expect shit to fall in your lap because what you're pretty you've got a hard life etc etc etc okay you can't think that you need to take life by the fucking balls so for me this year is going to be a big year because one lunar Beauty is launching that's my biggest like holy fucking tits shit cocksucking like intensity you know that's my biggest thing I'll talk about that more later in case you guys don't know I announced on Christmas that I'm gonna be coming out with a brand this year and its name is lunar Beauty which is like so me which is favoring me and I'm just so excited that's that it's finally like announced and Alan about and finally I can just like say the name you know even just saying the name had given me so much anxiety for the past like year like being like just nervous you just never know with things like this you never know people gonna take it well you never know people are gonna see your vision but at the end of the day you need to be confident yourself and you need to make you fucking work I'm gonna be taking yours resolutions seriously this year like I never do by the way I never do I'm wanting to this year I really wanna I just really want to I want to make my life better yeah so for me first resolutions just go and talk about first ones I don't have a nicer body I really do I really want to focus more on working out on me I want to focus more on eating healthy mind you yes I had KFC today cuz freshly hasn't been delivering over the holidays okay let a bitch live I make my thanks huh everyone has of days I want to be healthier that's a definite definite definite goal of mine is to be healthier this year because who doesn't want to be healthy I wanna be able to take off my shirt in public I've never been comfortable that never not once in my entire life they comfortable that nice still not I'm not there yeah I'm not comfortable to y'all my shirt public I usually will not do it unless I'm in a very very very enclosed situation or it's like friends around me only friends and I trust I'm very particular about it I'm very against security easily about my body you know and are you more confident this year you know with my body and I actually have to do things what do you have things they want to change about your body that's something you need to actually go out and do like this that's something that you're like bitch get the fuck up off the fucking couch and off the bed you guys know I love to nap and get to the gym go do some cardio get some fucking weight lifting and like do something and it will make a huge difference here is gonna be different I'm going to be gonna be better that's one of my biggest goals of 2018 is just to be healthier you know be more confident myself try my hardest to be more out there that's going into my next one I want to be more bored I want to be really really forward in at 2018 you know I'm not have a single dude you know and it's it's cool it's whatever I don't like mind but I want to be like you can't just assume shits gonna fall into your life like for example you can't assume like you're gonna find a boyfriend to find love if you're just sitting there fuckin totalling your thumbs you know you have to actually like go out and try like you don't you have to try to make things happen for yourself and I'm not saying over here like I'm gonna go every fucking weekend and go to the fucking Club and mean like doing you know I'm not gonna do any I'm not gonna do any of that so I just think that putting yourself out there more you know just be more open to the possibilities that's like what I'm trying to say is I want to be more open to possibilities of finding someone I'm giving people a chance like go on dates more like say yes to dates more no Hale people I've hit on a couple people actually like recently and it's worked out me I mean then we're like work out and like my exact favor you know and just turned up into like a hookup which is fine I guess but in 2018 I want to focus more on like making more positive connections with men I mean of course I hook up is positive it's cool experience but like I thought what do you mean I wanted to be like a something meaningful that make sense so I'm gonna attempt to be a little bit more forward it doesn't he know try to be you know that bitch I see someone at the gym like that's fine as fuck why not just be like hey you're super handsome before I let you know like what is wrong with that you know I get so nervous too cakey so my head doing this shit and I'm like fuck I want to be able to say that kind of stuff like what why am I being sick when I get into my head and I'm like okay well I'm not executing them so obviously I'm not gonna like that it's not gonna go out in my favor like they're not gonna they're gonna be like what the fuck look like you know I'm saying like I feel like I get into my head like that I'm sure a lot of people would get do too and it's so easy to fall into like oh well they're just gonna like laugh at me and walk away you know but I'm like at the end of the day like people aren't rude like I mean hopefully you'd get you wouldn't say hi to someone they're like hey don't someone that was rude and if they were rude then at least you know then you aren't continuing on anything with them I want to get people the benefit of the doubt and last resolution that I have is leaving people that don't want to be in my life in 2017 if you don't want to be in my life if you don't want to fucking fuck with me if you don't want to be my friend if you don't want to be any of if you don't like hang out with me do any lots of that is totally fine but I'm tired of trying to be that bitch that always is the one that's trying you know what I mean like I'm tired of it and I'm gonna leave mani who's a people-pleaser or at least I'm gonna try as much as I can in 2017 is well I'm gonna try to be more confident and more confident in myself and not feel like I need to be friends with everyone growing up you guys that was what my biggest struggles was trying to make everyone like me it was so hard and so stressful I never want to go back to that you know now luckily I'm at a point where it's like does it still affect me sometimes yes it does I don't think that will ever leave me is wanting people like me always like me you know I live my life on social media too I always want to like feel like people are enjoying my company or enjoying my content and things like that you know I never want to be the bitch that's like come on give a fuck like not give a fuck ever but I definitely want to be the bitch that's not like consumed with getting people to like them that was my whole MO my whole fucking life was literally trying to get to people to like me and doing whatever it took to get to make it happen you know I need to think more highly of myself and be more confident within my own fucking ability and my friendship and myself as a person and not let people take advantage of me or if they're rude to me I thought you guys don't understand help many issues I've had out in events with different influencers who I used to be friends with or I used to be acquaintances with or whatever the fuck and they treated me like such a fucking dick at an event and honestly I would just weep it under the rug and just think like oh maybe they're having a bad day or maybe they just like didn't see me I was come up with so many fucking excuses for people's mean actions or rude actions towards me I'm not doing this again I'm not doing this again it doesn't 18 I'm sorry I'm not I'm fucking over it and if you want to be a fucking dick to me cool but now I'm not gonna I'm not gonna be the bigger person sounds terrible sounds really terrible I'm not gonna be the one that's going to be going off to people at events I mean like hi I'm trying I want to be stronger I'm tired of being treated like shit at certain events so certain people and like you know what I don't need to go up and say hi to you and I'm no longer going to I don't know maybe that's like the wrong my set to be in it could be honestly it really could be but I think I'm just tired of being let down I'm not changing when it comes to like who I am as a core person I'm just tired of being walked all over so that's kinda what I mean I want you guys thinking like oh my god man II didn't turn into a fucking big I need to take care of myself first and sometimes it's like hard to realize that and I've had realization so I'm like fuck man stop letting people worry because you want to be light taking a pause retained Kristin Lee an ex Urban Decay Kristin Leon is also another a beauty blogger vlogger on here on YouTube and she came out with the collection with freakin Urban Decay that is amazing so I want to take some of her

intense on the our faces because I like that anyway guys I'm on at end right now I apologize for being on such a gnarly ask engine but at the end of the day just be kind to people oh shit yes bitch I'm here for this absolutely here for this boom that's a win hard win congratulations Kristen lienen urban decay this is fucking stunning holy shit I lost my train of thought I don't know where we're at in the conversation right now okay love yourself first before anyone else you can't love yourself and how you can live with somebody else can I get name it in here RuPaul you are right you are fucking right these guys right here look at that it's like such a beautiful neutral palette and then we have the bold palette right next to it so we're gonna incorporate both of these let's go on with something we're just gonna do like a transition e mo mate and then I'll go on something more bold actor taking morphine five seven six day dream so you guys I haven't working on the W the past almost two years now and it has been a it's been a fucking ride but it's been like the best ride ever it's been so much fun stressful fuck stressful fuck I'm not gonna lie but it's been so much fun and I'm so excited for the first product and just to give you like a hint I'm not gonna be like actually like a really intense hint where you guys are not gonna know what it is but like a little hint about it is like this product means a lot to me because it basically is what jump-started my career so I'm gonna say I'm not gonna say anything too much about it it's a product that I love and I use all the fucking time when I do my video about the product you guys will totally understand so I'm just very very excited about it it's been a long time in the making I'm hoping to launch in May that's like my goal time because honestly with these with this kind of thing with labs and with distribution places and all that shit there's so much work that gets put into this that it's obscene almost it's almost obscene because just is okay you guys if I had it my way you know we would have launched assists in fucking December that was like the original goal year ago that was the goal didn't happen didn't have my way sadly but you know why it's all good because that means I get more time to focus on the product more time to focus on the packaging more time focus on everything else that's involved with creating your own brand you know with the website but everything with although I think you guys are gonna be really excited about it and I think you guys are gonna really love it I put so much hard work and soul into this and I would never release something that I didn't love and didn't like fully believe in it's just not my thing I don't believe in that I believe in working hard and creating something then the day I own the brand it's my brand I don't have an investor I've invested all my own money into this so I'm my own boss okay I get to decide the rules you know I get to decide and I want something to launch and when I want something to be out and things like that so I'm really really excited about that aspect of it because I feel like that's very very very important for me is being able to have full creative control and be able to control a lot of the aspects of having a brand you know I want it to be amazing I want you guys to have an amazing experience when you're buying it and when you're using it and things like that so I hope you do it's kind of ridiculous how nervous and you know it really is I feel like I shouldn't be as nervous as I am but I just am I can help it's like my little baby took another Ziya you know it's literally like another fucking Zia for me and I've had so much help along the way you know my dad works with me my mom works with me and they have been troopers to say the least about this whole experience so yeah I'm just really grateful I'm really really grateful and I cannot wait to watch my first product and hopefully mayor June I also would really like to ask you guys what you guys would like to see from me in 2018 would you guys like to see like from my brand you know what would you guys like to see going on like I already of course I have like the ideas that I have and the things that I'm doing them things I'm starting with and the things I'm gonna be launching with first of course it was there anything in specific that you guys would like to see from my brand or anything that you like to see from a brand in general like what is something you are like bitch you better be bringing this bitch out like what what is that product for you I feel like the cool thing about being able to have your own brand it's like you can be like a brand for the people you know I asked you guys advice all the time and I asked for you guys opinions all the time and I think that that's a such a cool part about being an influencer and getting millions of followers it's like you get so many different lavish opinions all the time some opinions you don't wanna hear some opinions to do want to hear but in the day it's an opinion everyone gets the right to one a bitch no but I'm not the type of bitch that's like fuck you all it's amazing I am really receptive you don't suppose because this is my brand you know I'm it's a brand for you guys and I'm really receptive to feedback and I'm not gonna be like that person that's like oh well you guys are all just fucking hey nerd I know you're not I know you guys have money fucking best interests at heart you know especially the people are like telling me things with love and so I had said I was like yo if you--if you come up with an emblem or logo that you really really like anything that embodies my brand more send it to me and we'll see how it goes I got sent an amazing and blum from Liz Liz I love you and I'm using it like I bought it from her and I'm obsessed with it and I'm really really excited about it I think that's gonna look beautiful and I love it too can L be a little star it's so fucking cute and I think it's very very sleek and nice so thank you guys for all the positive and constructive feedback I was kind of cool actually I love how it's like blended on the inner corner then sharp on the middle like we're going to finish up this look I just put on some black and I put on some brown eyeliner underneath my lash line it's go ahead and blend that out before he gets a little hairy or doesn't go with smokey on the lower lash line by the way guys just chill it out the top is the moment so we're gonna keep it smoky down here another thing I want to be doing in the new year is just being a little bit more fun and a little more creative with my makeup you know wanting to take it there a little bit more my first product coming out is really gonna help me push myself to be even more colorful and more outlandish than I already am but you guys already know like if you guys watched my channel you know that I love to do bold eyes incorporating color on my eye and do a neutral lip that's like my go-to thing I don't really think that's gonna change a lot in 2018 but I'm gonna try to make it more I'm gonna try to just be more out there a little bit of black - I'm already not really scared of color colors nothing me like freaks me out I don't mind doing color on the eyes I love incorporating a pop of color and things like that I just want to take my techniques a little bit farther this year like for example that makeup I have on right now this is like a what would you even call this this is like um halo cut crease and helical crease this thing that's like hey look recycling are you know usually I would never do something like this especially using blues I want to be a little bit more out there and I need you guys to keep me fucking

they're a little more bold 9000 it'll be going today but um we took it there I guess I'm going to do the lips real quick and I will be done once today's video you know I'm saying no it's fucking crazy

just feel like December so I'm not giving back so if I can get back to you guys I would love to do that and that's oh I'm trying to do as much as I can anyway let's go ahead and stop rambling and get into this video using Kylie Jenner's concealers [Music] you guys might have my beefs done we have just foundation we set foundation on this hair drives me wild you guys understand like this one here that likes to sit is it longer than the rest like before it goes down look how far it goes down anyway so I'm gonna talk about the concealer really quickly I just looked up the retail value of the concealer and it's only dusting only but it's 20 bucks I'm really happy about that price but I think 20 bucks is really fair I feel like there's a lot of concealers that are priced at like 25 to 30 so I feel like a twenty dollar concealer is it super fair this is what they look like right here they are in this kind of small shorter components very it's the same component as Jeffrey stars lega lipsticks as wet wilds liquid lipsticks as sugar pills liquid lipsticks I'm sure you guys recognize this little bottle right here I'm gonna take this shade of Gib summer ivory I don't know this is ivory ivory let's just see what we think so it comes with point 22 ounces at six point three grams of product that goes in here they have a flat paddle situation let's go ahead and try it oh my god her just going right in I guess I ever he's actually like really close to my own personal shade I think I'm gonna go I'm gonna mix a little bit of that give some shade with it just a little bit lighter okay guys the moment of truth we have to concede on it actually feels really nice on my skin I'm not gonna lie feels pretty good like I'm very happy with all this feels muscle got it up close wanna take our little Real Techniques sponge blend this concealer as I'm blending right now as I'm going in and blending this away it blends very very nicely honestly pretty effortlessly if I say so myself actually blends really nicely it has almost like a satin finish it's not it's like almost glow as you can see like right - that's when I can see the right can you guys see how this area right there is almost more glowy than the rest of my faces it's a concealer it has a very wet looking appearance the coverage looks almost full like I put a lot of it on so I think that you can definitely get to a full coverage I think I'm at a full coverage right now I don't see any of my like darkness peaking through I've never had a concealer that looked so do you want my skin before I've never had to do he concealer like this I'm kind of like whoa we have some are going set this guy and see what we think I'm gonna take my Charlotte Tilbury powder in the shade at number one this seems like a concealer you definitely would want to set because it is more of a dewy glowy finish this does have a bitch I feel like wouldn't move around on you you know I mean because it is not so mattifying so go ahead put that on we're gonna set that into this skin but honestly like this looks really pretty like I'm actually living so it makes me very happy taking the other side with a sponge setting the other side what do we think guys I think it looks bomb oh my gosh I'm like really really pleasantly pleased I think it looks really really really pretty okay guys so first impressions right away I think that the coverage was a nice medium to full coverage it's very buildable the finish of it is a dewy finish I'm actually really shocked about it it wasn't increasing to faster than my eyes either which I really really liked and now I have it set with powder I don't see any creasing going on it's like any my other favorite concealers there's no bad creasing nothing bad going on here so I'm really really happy about this I'm gonna go ahead and finish my makeup off of camera really quickly I'm gonna do my thing and I will come back when I'm about to leave and do a little final sign-off and we will see what our verdict of the concealer is and how it wears throughout the day but so far first impressions I think it's really really pretty ok guys so this is the final look I just want to do a quick black smokey eye I love that's very very sexy it's really fun and so sultry and I'm going out to a dinner tonight with some YouTube people and so I figure you know let me just go and go to kill let's go to slay one more thing you want a shitty thing about doing a black smokey eye on camera I never really looks at that blended in that like nice and I'm always kind of like but in person like this bitches blend into filth you know I'm saying like it just look it looks good I swear anyway guys the concealers still looks really nice there's no creasing on my face whatsoever everything is looking really pretty nose is snatched I'm gonna leave it now actually or leave in like an hour I guess and I'll be checking in along the way like in a vlogging style hopefully yeah we'll remember when I'm at this dinner to check in and show you guys what my consider my undereye in my whole center of my face is doing but other than that you guys I'm good I'm gonna go check out I'll see you guys very very soon and we will have a final verdict on what I think of this concealer after a wear test ok guys so I ended up making it over to Laura's house so I am testing the concealer from Kylie what do we think I think it looks so good does it but I tried it today and it reminds me so much at heart shape tape honestly your eyes heart shape sharp shape to see everybody's chart t-shaped ooh no but honesty really did I put a lot on it so it did give me a nice full coverage and it looked it still looks really pretty anyways guys I'm gonna try check-in it I don't know if I can make it I really don't cuz I really want to get his makeup so yes so do a check-in at the end I know I know now you understand why I'm wearing it so so it's been about seven hours since I have had the concealer on and so what do we think also before I even finish off my black shadow that crease is going on it's actually really funny cuz any blue or black eyeshadow that I wear this happens to me every single time I do it so what happens is like I have my eyes open and I'm talking abut I'm doing this the black from my lid transfers on to my hooded lid deciding you know so that's why it kind of looks like that it's literally so annoying but I there's nothing I can do about it happens to me every single time if I'm wearing makeup like a black eye shadow look or dark blue eye shadow or dark purple this opportunity every single time it's unavoidable for me and it pisses me off because of this hooded lead final thoughts on the concealer I'm gonna go to bed some tired so what do I think about the Kylie cosmetics concealers honest to god I really like them I'm very very very happy about them i 100% will say that this is a hit I would purchase them myself and honestly I'm gonna continue to use it so I feel like that's when I know product I really do enjoy because I'm like I want to continue I want to use it see what I think about it more today of course was more of a first impressions but I'm looking in the mirror right now like there's no creases everything looks so pretty still of course I am a greasy greasy greasy nasty mess because of me not blotting my face one time in seven hours but honestly the concealer the amount I put on gave me full coverage it felt really nice and creamy and luxurious something without feeling too cakey without being too heavy it blended out very easily I have no qualms with it I'm so happy that I like turned out to be amazing and I'm so happy with how they turned out how easy to supply like that it has like that Urban Decay Naked weightless like like flat paddle application I really like that I like that for concealers the most I feel like you get the most application for your buck or for an application in general so all in all Kylie cosmetics you all killed it with the concealers I'm so happy and honestly I think the price point is also very very fair I think 20 bucks for a concealer is really really great like I think that's a really really fair price point specially for a concealer works very nicely it's beautiful I'm gonna continue to wear it after the brush debacle with price point I'm really happy to see that kite house makes these can see there's 20 bucks yeah you guys already know I'm gonna always keep it real whether I like something right don't it is what it is I'm gonna say whether I like it or whether I don't and does I matter the brand does not matter the celebrity behind the brand doesn't matter at all at the end of the day I have the consumers back and that's what matters to me I don't give a if I make the brand angry at me or if they want to stop sending me PR and this is going to any brand not kinda Cosmetics specifically or anything like that but I just want to say that because this is a review video just because I get something sent to me for free does not mean that I'm gonna act nice about it you know what I mean it doesn't mean anything to me it just means that hey I got it early I was like I do this for a full-time living but that also does not mean I'm gonna be fake as and like say something is amazing when it's not I've never been like that I'm never gonna be like that it doesn't matter if the brand doesn't matter the patron doesn't matter what kind of coin they're offering me that is what it is because honestly my word is more important and I feel like I've built my manniac community and my YouTube off of my word I would never want to betray that never never never at first I was kind of shocked cuz it went on almost like a Dewey fit like a dewy glowy finish but after you said it it just looks really beautiful and it's stayed looking beautiful for the last 7 hours like I'm like really happy and stop creasing doesn't look ugly like it looks really pretty yeah guys that's it for today's video do not forget to enter my giveaway I will leave the rules at down below but yeah how great for the night or day wherever you guys are and I will catch you guys in my next video bye you guys I love you laughs look in the hair okay I get it come on Luke and Sam we get it we get it tired carpet look this what I was like the mayonnaise thing I've ever done honestly like I'm really happy with this so far that's this guy saying get that like okay I want to watch prisoners but it's too late right now not getting hooli I cannot even speak this early or not oh my gosh oh my gosh [Music] [Music] 
hey guys welcome back to my channel so it today's video I'm so excited to be filming because it's kind of a random-ass video for me I've never done anything like this I'm going to be reacting to my first ever YouTube video I have not seen my first youtube video in a very very long time so I'm really excited to do this I just think it's gonna be fun to see where I was almost three years ago I started my channel in July of 2014 so it's been almost three years now in a couple months it'll be three years and interested I just think it's gonna be fun to see where I was at that point in my life as always if you guys like this video if you guys do not like me please don't fucking watch it you know that Jill with day no I just do that but you guys do like this video please subscribe to my channel if you weren't already and if you're new what's up a man anyway and welcome to my channel thank you so much for being here I really appreciate it so it's going to get into this video of me reacting to my first ever YouTube video shit look I look at the video right here I'm gonna pull it up on my laptop and I can do like a screen share type situation my first ever video was the everyday foundation routine by Maggie anyway let's do it okay let's click it two years ago an ad oh my god I was making money even back then okay skip bad bitch come on okay oh my god you said okay and he said okay let's look at the little description box because I do those all the time click HD for the high quality ish okay well apparently I thought my little tiny noise high quality bactine what the fuck am I even saying okay YouTube children basically this is my everyday foundation routine for y'all I kind of cost a lot I'm trying to get that shit under control I'll learn to bleep things out I swear but not yet oh my gosh and I keep looking into the viewfinder and not the lens I'll get better at that too by the way my room looks like a mess because we're moving soon and it's a wasteland in there urn here this will not be permanent forever and then I list all the products that I used and I apparently I say insta Jeezy instead of Instagram who did I think I was full screen mode look at me I look fucking angry what the fuck and skinniest bug - what the fuck oh I love myself coherently by the way I'm wearing this shirt because this is like one my first trips I ever wore on YouTube it's like maybe like three or four videos and I'm wearing this exact shirt and so the longest I've ever owned a shirt is this one so I thought it'd be fun to throw this back as well let's go and start this everyday foundation routine with mani MUA from almost three years ago oh shit so this video I'm about 22 or 23 years old and I look like I'm an infant for some reason I don't know but I look little young here I'm in my bedroom I didn't have anything I had two soft boxes and my little Canon camera and a dream basically I don't really know anything about backgrounds or lighting or literally anything like that were about buzzing I think sure I have buzzing noise in the back of this video and let's start this motherfucker [Applause] did you know apparently I was getting a lot of questions on Instagram back then but it's actually funny to see me like being so skinny and my teeth be a little more fucked up and more yellow and having a tongue ring Jesus criminy do call my fucking tits with the cursing okay moisturizer uh-hum pet the shit in like you pat your weave oh okay I'm such a little cocksucker oh my god all those rings oh my god you guys I was a ring fanatic I loved loved loved wearing rings till these rings or my mom's two of them were my own that I bought like randomly at school and at the fair and I was a ring fanatic since they fucking one man and I'm probably my face right now it's just so funny to see like me doing these weird themed definitely funny got it I know that dealing with house made me sweaty look at my little teeth when I work in Safari was already working on Mac attacks really funny cuz when I was working at Sephora if you guys are familiar with workers at Sephora if you work at Sephora or any I'm sure the tons of stores like this you guys get gratis aka you get free things that just come out for the first time I guess like you get new releases and you get them for free to try them out so you can sell them potentially you know I'm saying so I remember when I was leaving Sephora it was just one thing where it's like I was doing training and I did the whole entire training and get to do the train to get the gratis and it was like the best gratis we were ever gonna be getting and I did have any money I'm just a fucking Sephora I was getting $12 an hour like it was I had no money no anything and I really was trying to excel in my makeup career you know I mean are trying to just practice and do my thing and I remember this is the best price we were ever gonna get and it was so amazing but I was gonna be leaving work soon you know I was gonna be working at Mac and a week prior I had put in my two-weeks and so I had the whole week left and I was with me getting my gratis and my manager like put a stop my gratis because she's like no you're gonna be leaving anyway like you don't deserve the gratis and I went off on her like a mother fucker actually I'd really go off on her personally I went off on that person that was above her and I was like you know what I think this is so fucked and I went through that training and I deserve this and I'm still here for a week selling your shit for a week so I deserve this gratis and my ass got it and she was so pissed but I got the gratis and I was like oh la so I remember this foundation being a fucking full ass coverage hey hey hey what I say wait wait wait stop stop stop well um now covergirl does to cover boy shoutout to james and so does Maybelline like they're really bad it's funny cuz it watching this - I'm talking so much like angel baby I used to do this like little chole that character thing that I loved doing on my channel for so long I would do it on my Instagram and I loved angel baby aka Danny Noriega okay adore Delano and I absolutely loved her and I would do this little cholita boys that I was inspired by her to do so um yeah that's what I'm talking like the way I'm talking feel like I was more ghetto back then a little bit okay oh I'm ratchet I'm fuckin ratchet tell em nothing's changed Cody airspun since day one all the drag queens would use this I remember I can't believe I use this three years ago drag queens would live for Cody s one and I would too Clem your tits calm your fucking tits man II really I love how like I was living for the highway back then like living for the Anasazi aglow like that little like highlighting thing which was not very glowy at all and back then I was like oh I knew like I was living for living my fucking gig okay guys so back then I didn't have a lot of money of course I was using elf brushes Real Techniques brushes mostly and the more expensive things that I do have the mark dig up stuff and the uh Nastasia palette was from work and that's kind of why I had it mmm oh it looks it looks a little muddy though uh but okay I need to stop talking like a fucking cholita clearly I was living for my chili today's when I was a baby sleepy in the past you guys are a maniac since day one baby sleepy you guys know she's in there she's in here actually hmm come on masculine mani with that fucking one of those fuck do your lips manager your lips come on show it show it living for the nude since day one flush pot the lash pot bitch okay look a little bit its woman damn nude lid that was my Mac look with the low glasses everything and the blind the black studs in my ear not the white ones that the black studs in my guys okay you guys and that is it for my entire first ever youtube video it's just really cool to see where I started you know I see my personality back then I feel like I am very very similar to I was back then however I was just a little bit more reserved and shy back then and I was doing that cholita fuckin the way I was talking to kind of compensate to make me feel a bit more comfortable you know kind of throwing that out there so people wouldn't see my real personality as much now I feel like I'm showing that a lot more and like I just show Who I am online now but back then I was a little bit more like can just be someone else really quickly and so I would play that character uh for a while because I was still a little bit uncomfortable with in my shoes you know what I mean you know back then I was a little bit more shy I was a little more reserved I was a little bitchy ER to be quite honest I wasn't really as willing to put up with people shit back then I guess in a different way though it's in a different way like back then out be more defensive I was a lot more defensive back then and I was kind of throwing out this character and just being like I'm a badass fucking bitch like try me kind of thing because I think it was my defense mechanism just starting YouTube you know I knew was gonna be hard and I knew people were gonna try to hate me and I knew all these things and I think I was doing this little fucking character to make up for the fact that I wasn't really asked comfortable with people judging me in the beginning and I feel like now I don't really give a fuck I'm just who I am Who I am that was me three years ago you know what I mean and now I'm 26 years old I'm twenty five six five six but I am so much more sure and aware of Who I am today I don't say thank you guys so much for the continued love and support you guys show me every fucking day of my life and I can't even thank you guys enough you know seeing me back then I never would have thought in a million years I could be where I am today and that's why I feel like I've changed and a lot of people try to clock me nowadays and being like you've changed so much since the beginning you were so much more humble and so much more real and blah blah blah like say whatever the fuck they want to say it's fine but it's actually funny cuz back then I was a lot more sheltered and not real and I was putting on a facade for so long because I was scared of showing who I really was and now I'm not well sorry so it just it's cool to see um my journey and see where I came the embarrassing watching in first video guys that's just embarrassing I don't think I did too bad for my first ever video on YouTube and I was a little scared I was a little shy but I was still cracking some fucking stupid ass jokes bitch got jokes is there one I cannot wait to see what we have in store for the next three years and to see what YouTube and what any other social media platform takes us I always tell you guys it's not just my journey it's our journey and you guys allowed me to do what I love and I know I say it all the time and I'm cheesie's fuck like I get it but I chose a thank you and I just feel like sometimes thank you isn't enough it's not a strong enough word before I go though I just wanna say one thing always believe in yourself do not let anyone else's opinions deter you from the journey you want to take you know what I mean I was gonna be a plastic surgeon that was the glue I wanted to be I went to college you know I got my Bachelors of Science degree in health science and I was in the process of going to med school and applying to med schools when I was working at Sephora and iMac you know but that wasn't the dream I wanted to do I loved it I thought I thought I did you know but when I fell into makeup that was my real passion and what I really wanted to follow so I wanna let you guys know that anything is really possible you know I never thought it was gonna happen to me are you fucking kidding me like my life now what our never knew two million years I didn't start it for that I started it because this is my passion and I thought it would be fun to share my creativity online with other people and I would have never known it Katie got this far so thank you and I want you guys to remember to follow your fucking dreams because it's important and your dreams are important and they're valid buck man I want people to follow what they want to do stop listening to other people stop listen to your siblings stop listen to your parents stop listen to your friends don't let the peer pressure you into doing things you don't want to do you don't fucking have to you know what I mean do what you want to do and

hey guys welcome back to my channel so today's video is going to be a fun just chit chat get ready with me I've not done these just sat down got ready for an event and so long I thought would be really fun to bring in so many new products that have just come out in this past month of June so Mikey cool let's do a get ready with me and first impressions video I'm actually heading out to the season finale taping of RuPaul's Drag Race later on today so my base products like my foundation will be the same but a lot of other products will be new and I was thinking like dude man you're already gonna be glamming might as well just film it so I thought it'd be really fun to film this video so that's what today's video is going to be as always if you guys don't like this video if you guys do not like me please don't watch it you know the drill with that mmm-hmm what do you guys do likes video please subscribe to my channel if you're not already and if you knew what's up am an emu a and welcome to my channel thank you so much for being here I honestly really appreciate it so much um let's go and get into this first impressions get ready with me because bitch needs to get ready and like leave down my two hours so so I'm actually really really excited because I am actually partnering in this video today with dr. jart which is a skincare brand inside Sephora and I don't really ever get to do a lot of sponsorships or a lot of partnering with brands on videos because ones the brands that I really really like and wanna partner with they think I'm a little too outlandish and they don't ever wanna sponsor me and the ones that do I don't ever like their products so not trying to be shady to the brands that one it's not to me no shade whatsoever I'm just not going to be dishonest to my audience about liking something so I'm dr. John hit me up like Haley would love to do video with you I was like yes so many products to see if I like them and they sent me them and I absolutely freaking love them we have the new water fuse line by dr. jar and this is inside Sephora this month they launched in June we have the hydro soothe i jo and we have the dr. jart water fuse ultimate hydro gel for the face and I'm going to be using this on the face today to moisturize my skin it's like hella light blue so you guys can't really tell by view so much of this I don't you guys didn't see that the lighting is a little rough but I'm gonna take a little bit on the finger what I like about this moisturizer is that it's so lightweight but still so freakin hydrating like it literally feels like water on the skin it doesn't feel tacky oh I love it's very like cooling like refreshing should I be using it all month long because I'm never gonna do a sponsorship or like partner with a brand if I don't try the products a lot so it feels so good oh and of course the eye cream it's just a really nice hydrating deep puffing eye cream like a great for the daytime like these guys I use every single morning because well one I'm a psycho about my skin being hydrated and I need it to be hydrated doesn't look like water like it just it's so at I love it and both textures are so lightweight and just cooling and just refreshing and that's why I like them so much thank you guys over at dr. jart for partnering with me I really really really enjoyed your guys's products and if you guys want a nice just everyday beautiful hydrating moisturizer and under eye balm try these because I am they good okay cool so let's go and just continue on with the normal face routine I'm gonna be taking the benefit professional of course okay so my mom and dad are up here this weekend and that means Emmie and Sophie are up here this weekend and it's so so  funny because Xia loves love's Emmie like she loves to play with her shield monster like around with her a lot but I mean literally wants nothing to do with her so it's kind of like Xia she don't wanna with you the base guys the base of my face I'm gonna keep pretty chill and normal just like my normal routine just cuz I really want to make sure that it lasts ooh wait let me so last year I actually attended the RuPaul's Drag Race finale viewing and it was so much fun but it was so long I had no idea we got there at 3 o'clock we delete oh I think 11 p.m. it's such a long process like filming the show cuz it's how it works so all three winners are crowned as like winners because they don't want to get out who actually wins so basically gonna kind of fake it like they like all three win so it's like oh my god this person won yay oh my god this person won yeah this was someone and so it's like during the actual finale is when they reveal on TV who actually won that's why I'm it takes so long to get to like go through all three winners and to go through so much stuff and I'm like so I'm going to that with Laura today so I'm so excited so I'm just gonna do my normal everyday foundation routine that I need for like longevity and last ability let's go ahead and do the rest of the base I'm took the hourglass vanish stick of course classic go-to for the coverage for the full coverage kunti I cannot find my door I flash to save my life I make a de la mer soft fluid liquid takes on morphe m43 nine I'm just gonna buff this into the skin can't find my y6 right now but this brush is amazing I love the way that our glass lugs on my guards with the lemare fluid gosh so much again you can see that I have not really I tried it one time but I really know much about it this is the NARS soft back concealer in the shade of vanilla I'm hoping this is my shirt please please I'm taking on a little morphe y11 oh that is stun that is stun I mean honestly I'm going to a drag queen finale so might as well really go in okay I'm living like I'm literally living for this concealer and it's not creasing super heavily on me or anything it's super full coverage why not really giving this a chance hmm I'm sorry NARS goddamn let me set the under eyes real quick because mommy creases like a let's must have something Helen you this is the Urban Decay Naked skin shapeshifter I have not yet tried this out please work please so it's like half our powders and the other half are creams so we're just gonna go white-handed our first to go over that cream okay cool it's light nothing crazy for me I'm very much into a really soft cream contour because I'm honestly just using it as a base for my powders and everything so this for me I'm actually really really enjoying it okay we're going to use this Babich a little morphe quinine now to take this little a desert shade it looks really cool toned which I wanted to go for obviously more cool tone oh I didn't realize how big we could be work today oh my god this Tarte palette is so crazy pigment in me careful so you guys get oily in certain places you can definitely use an excessive amount of powder and just kind of bake it into the skin I get excessively oily in the t-zone specifically color take the cover FX I loose a setting powder and really set that in place / literally everything what do we have here Coco collection - teen honestly released wanted to try this blush out that look so pretty be pigmented I don't like live breathing die for her blushes or anything like that but it's definitely a pretty color and it pops up on my skin nicely now for the highlight taking the Marc Jacobs do you do drops I've never actually tried this for I just want to taste a little bit of it nervous oh that is so beautiful very softly just pressing it in with my little sponge I don't really have any new highlighters backing use the Kylie one I can use this bad boy how's this one going to show up well yeah hmm Shawn I think that was some tender loving care the kylieqq highlighters can look really really pretty like definitely okay we have the base on looking ready I'm gonna go do my brows on camera because I'm have any new brow products and I'll be right back okay cool so we have the brows on and their little thick today little thicker than normal but I was just kind of playing around messing about the brow shape so not sisters definitely not twins maybe not even cousins but uh I got a new pad I wanted playing clean this is the Urban Decay Naked heat palette this has been so like raved about intensely on social media and it's been like a little bit of controversy or revolving it saying that the swatches weren't that good or whatever so I wanted to play with it right now and see what I think about it I'm gonna use on the top of my eye and do something more colorful on the bottom on the lash line so I'm gonna take a little bit the shade chaser and sawest I'm gonna put that into the crease which is like an icicle Oh warm pigmented s I honestly really think the naked palettes are really pretty like I have always been a fan my favorite Naked palette before this color scheme was in Naked 3 I loved the pink undertones of it and I thought was so pretty so Bridal and very like stunning guys guys the brushes I'm using are morphe brushes most of them it's just a funny because I've been like caught up in morphe drama like recently and it's so I don't even know it's just like okay you guys want to hear the  tea guess when you're the  truth taking a low blow so me and Laura we're going to the movie store because we need to grab more of our at morphe PHA is just the ones that we use constantly like the ones that we beat up because we use it so much and travel with them and lose them and things like that so I was like Laura let's go to the morphe store and let's freakin get some brushes because I need some feels like dude I'm so down I need some too so meal or I get there and we are both looking around and we're getting we're seeing the brushes that we want to buy and things like that because we got there and our intent was to buy the brushes because I didn't warn morphe that was coming over me Lord didn't say anything we're just going over to replenish and that was it because usually with PR guys how PR usually works like you don't a brain will send you something and if you go through that thing like that's it you don't get more of it usually you have to go and buy your own products like that's kind of how PR works usually a bridal center for the first time to give it to you as an example like hey this is an you probably came out with here you go if you go through it then I can send you another one unless you ask but I've never asked for replenishments before so I'm like I don't know if that works so we got there like we cool it's like by our brushes like let's do it so so were shot being we're in the middle of getting our brushes and we're like chatting or taking photos with people at the morphe store and shot to all the followers are at the Marquee store that data I was super fun to see you guys so I texted Linda the owner of morphia to see if she's there and my girl I'm here at the morphe store are you here I would love to see you love to chitchat and just kind of Kiki and hang out so Linda is there and were chit-chatting or talking on my cake girl what's up how are you we're just coming here to buy some brushes you know you're like no you guys don't buy anything here's more filly it's like no and we're like okay like we're not gonna I'm not gonna say no to receiving free brushes I'm not gonna say no to getting a free brushes well who the would you say no to that no I'm no I'm good no actually that's awesome because I do promote your brand so I really appreciate you guys getting more brushes for free so that's what happened so then I was like yeah of course take some brushes and take some palette to take some makeup if you guys want to for a giveaway if you guys are planning a giveaway soon take some pallets take whatever you guys want to take I mean they were like so me Laura was super stoked because we were good able to get pallets and other things like that for a giveaway so we're like dude hell yes thank you so much to learn from more fees so at the end Laura posted her receipt was like yes but we went in and we did we did go and we have like literally half the store in our freaking bags after Linda comped us we never said afterwards like oh we just bought all this stuff we never said that at the beginning when I first got there and my snaps I was like yeah I'm gonna buy some stuff because that's was the plan was that's why you guys in here so at the end being like oh my god we just bought so many things we went in we said we went in but we and said we bought them because that's a lie so I don't know I feel like you'll just like a weird big misconception and I'm like dude if they're soon some drama can't be like something that's like actually worth it like it just felt so dumb and trivial I'm like okay cool this is really like what we're doing got it so this is what we're doing right now with our free time this is this is a drama quote-unquote drama that we have two guys left like I don't see the whole thing I wish I was more juice to it but there really wasn't that's all it was I honestly I'm really liking this palette guys like by the way like I think it's looking so pretty and the colors are really really nice and they blend great and they're really pigmented so I have nothing bad to say so far about this palette the colors I've tried which are chaser sauce low blow ashes so far so freaking good so I'm liking it I grabbed the morphe 35o when I was at the store because I wanted some bold colors we're just gonna have fun today guys we're going to a drag show toss some perps in there I saw this Pat McGrath lab like a shadow astral white pigment thing that I really wanted to try out and put in my inner corner and my lower lash line or swatches intent so I'm hoping well that's so so pretty oh my gosh I love it I freaking love it okay go I'm gonna go do my eyeliner off of camera real quick and I'll be right back okay grace I went ahead I do my liner and lashes off of camera and I'm using the kim tae lion-hearted lashes because i freakin love them and like the most drag paradigm they're not for the faint of heart though they're for the line art haha see what I did there so I'm think I want to do a really nice pop of purple in the waterline I'm gonna take this a Marc Jacobs hi liner in the shade grapevine oh that's so pretty okay great so now I'm gonna do the lips and we'll be done so I have here the collaboration with color pop and Karen Aki left Sarah E and I really really really wanted to use a lip gloss lipstick from this collection because I'm so so happy for Karen I think Karen is seriously one of the nicest sweetest people ever in like the whole Beauty community she's so great and wonderful she's so kind to everyone she's like a mean girl and she's not like a bitch to anyone and it's so nice to see because there's a lot of people are like that that are mean is  and she's not like that and it makes me really happy so I really cannot wait to try this collection out come into the gloss because it looks so so pretty okay I'm gonna take the lip liner in the shade curvy curvy I love about lip pencils so this color is so

hey guys welcome back to my channel so today's video is going to be a review video I'm actually really really excited to be doing this because I haven't actually filmed a one I've not done the video in a while it's actually been like two weeks since I filmed the video oh my god my teeth really different if you guys watched my last video and you watch this video this is the first video I'm filming with my new veneers on my teeth but I tell you guys is going to be testing out overhyped makeup I've seen a bunch of makeup on Instagram on YouTube just different types of brands and products that have been hyped so intensely that I'm like okay are these actually worth the hype like are these overhyped for a reason like are they fucking bum and amazing and like actually worth the hype or are they kind of shitty and not really work and not worth the hype at all so I thought I would do a whole entire video dedicated to testing out overhyped makeup in the beauty industry because there's tons I got like for example I got the unicorn tears liquid latex I have the Forrest's Ollie jelly beam highlighter iconic London highlighter drops without huda beauty foundation all these products have been so hyped all over Twitter all over Facebook so that sometimes video is going to be you guys as always if you guys do not like this video if you guys do not like me please don't fucking watch it you know the drill with that but if you guys do like this video please subscribe to my channel if you're not already and if you're new what's up a man MUA and welcome to my channel thank you for being here I really really really appreciate it but yeah guys let's all get started on today's video we're gonna go in guys first product we're gonna go in with the foundation we're gonna be using the faux filter huda beauty foundation I bought this guy at Sephora today actually cuz I really wanted to try it out as the first impressions this high coverage cream foundation effortless application camouflages in perfections so let's go and see I grabbed the shade cashew it's like a lighter golden undertone shade I wasn't like the biggest hand of the shade arrangement because I was like swatch it on the back of my hand I think the back of my arm like right here and I wasn't like seeing a good variety of shades to me my opinion and like the shades very much and it wasn't that wasn't a good variety cuz there was a lot of shades I was undertones of the shades I just like weren't vibing with me personally like I just undertone wasn't that great so I'm like yeah whatever so this guy retails for $40 and it has about 3 and 3/4 so star full coverage it says skin type 4 combination or normal dry oily for all skin types has a satin matte radiant and natural finish that's right I'm just going to I'm gonna go in I grabbed the shade of course like I said earlier cashew 140g sorry randoms I know it comes with a pump I like that kind of fade into the bottle I like that this is a plastic component for 40 bucks the components pretty cheap actually let's see how the foundation inside the back so that's honestly what really matters it's not really the packaging that matters it's the foundation look how light this is I don't even know if it's gonna match me holy shit and usually like you guys know I'm actually like really pale but like that pale bitch this is what I'm saying like cashew is like one shade 140 it might be too late they come on okay we're playing with the Real Techniques Beauty Blender sponge I mean it matches my neck whatever fuck it I can't believe I'm actually this light like isn't that so sad look I'm actually this pale not that it's like bad to be pale there's so many fucking beautiful people that are pale it's just me a personal thing for me like I like to be a little bit more can you know okay the fragrance of this holy shit whew that is strong is a strong scent guys Wow it's just perfumed it's not like an actual like specific scent it's just like perfumed smell okay I think this is the actually even too light for me and I am a light bitch I'm a light bitch man and I think this is actually too light will bronze up what bronze up okay this is fucking white is my shirt not as pale like that is a fucking ghost you know what other than the shade let's not talk about the shade let's go ahead and talk about the finish and the product and how it feels on the skin yes I did pry my skin with my normal priming routine like the benefit Porefessional and the Smashbox primer water okay definitely you have to really get into the pores because it will stay on top of the pores make sure you're really blending in on the sides the lighting might be a little bit too much but I don't you guys can see there's little dots all over my pores right here like it's not going into the pores it's actually sitting on top of it only on the nose which is kind of odd other than the fact I think I got the wrong shade I do think that the coverage is really pretty I think the finish is actually really pretty it's not a matte finish it's more of a satin finish the coverage is a nice of medium to full it's buildable I can tell already it did go on very very nice I will say that I went on very very very nice like obviously I'm kind of living other than the fact is the pores on the side that's a weird fuck so far I like this one oh boy it looks really pretty on the skin I really do I get that's the shitty part is that I actually liked it and I dawn my shade let me go ahead and finish up some more of the routine and we'll go on to the next product I'll so just turn my brightness down a little bit hopefully you guys can see a little bit more clear on the skin I feel like it was a little bit too bright those are the skin right now honestly guys this the foundation looks so fucking pretty like I'm really happy with how the foundation is looking I think it's so so beautiful and now I need to go back to supporting it my fucking right shade like this is too light like I just don't like how it looks I know a lot of guys would be like mani romantic you great I don't like a looks so I'm a darker one now I'm gonna go ahead and go in with the highlighters that have been like so hyped like crazy one the farce oli jelly bean this is the first jelly highlighter ever and the shade glazed like literally if you open it like this shit is literally yeah it reminds me of flubber this retails for $40 so let's see if it's worth the hype man cuz that shit is high I'm also gonna be using another product I wanted to use in today's work the hype video these are the Sailor Moon brushes say the moon guys hold a special place in my heart it's actually like what I've revolved my entire brand and entity off of is Sailor Moon like the moon I was inspired so much by her cartoon in the past so when they came out with like brushes let's see the moon did it it was like a random brand that did this I was so disappointed when I got them in the mail because it is so poorly made I just wanted to talk about it in that YouTube video I don't even see but like literally this thing is like unhinged I don't know what's keeping us honest literally if this is like a little like just one random press here can hear that jiggling yeah it's not good at all I don't know I just wanted to try to test it out and apply the jelly beam with it on the right side of my face I'm sure like it was still applying makeup but it's just like these are bad like I really like if you wanted to have them as a collector's item cuz they're cute and honestly they really are they're the cutest brushes I've ever seen but for practicality and usage they don't work so let's go ahead and play holy shit jelly bean is not playing around why is that literally so stunned wait now we're gonna blend it in we can't play with our finger you guys this is so beautiful you need a very tiny amount like this is like already too much you need like that's such a tiny amount of this bitch I am gooped I am GAD and I am shook how pretty and actually blends out what the finger remind you letting out into the powdered skin which has already have been powdered really really nicely like it doesn't look so harsh and intense like it's like a hard line between the highlight and the blush it's B to fall keep applying it and it builds beautifully it doesn't build like super heavy looking you guys jelly beam I love you well I like about this one too a lot is that you can blend it out where it doesn't look too intense but you can like keep it not as blended and it looks fucking blinding like bitch this brush sucks jelly beam is a win-win-win-win-win I love that so then I also wanted to try it on this side I want to try the iconic London drops these are also all over Instagram dude these are literally everywhere this is the iconic London illuminator these have 13.5 milliliters and these are $43 holy fuck that's expensive we're gonna do the same thing we're actually into on the finger this time I'm gonna play it with the finger oh my guy's randomly shade this is in the shade original sweet Dee sweet Dee a don't know the shade I will put it down below but take the middle shade oh my god this is so pretty this one is less intense iconic London drops is a little bit less in like when you apply it it's intense right but when you blend it out one it blends out so effortlessly you don't see that like it blends out beautifully like it really really does feels very nice not as blinding as the jellybean one for me like noticing it like on my skin it doesn't look as blending but it is beautiful nonetheless there's nothing harsh about it it just looks beautifully blended out I feel like it makes my skin look a little bit wet like I don't know if like the color actually matches me that well you can see some of highlighter right there but honestly this is another win like this is a win for me Oh jelly bean I like jelly be more though I would go with jelly beam I just like this one a little bit more excited dries down like into almost a powder finish does that make sense it's not like a powder powder but it dries down where it's not doesn't feel like a jelly on your skin like it's really really nice forty bucks though that's a lot of coin but I would personally buy it myself because I really like it that's a win that's over eye product that's worth the hype so far the only thing that's like not worth the hype right now are the Sailor Moon brushes okay she needs it fucking made look how bad they are why are these made so poorly like I literally don't understand okay guys so I think I just have one a product left and we are done with this video this overhype video so we have a Sailor Moon brushes honestly I would use more of them I really would like I would love to but I promise you when I say they're not well made like the only one that is even like decent is this one cuz it's a brow spoolie it's a possibly like how hard can it possibly be this is gonna easily just pop like you don't okay you don't understand so someone just decided that one drop of hot glue would be enough for this it wasn't you stupid bitch those look she feels like not too bad and reapply somehow they don't come to me it's a little bit of Uranus by me and jeffree star cosmetics just a little that's a fan brush it's a fucking fan brush like it's not I don't think they're too hard to fuck up you know I mean it's not a good fan brush it's not a high quality final brush by any means but the fan brush like it will work like I found brush will so that I guess was a go so you guys as a whole the Sailor Moon brushes as a whole or a flop do not buy them I think they're terrible and I so sad saying that because I'm such a huge fan of Sailor Moon everything else so far the foundation the two highlighters have been great so now let's go and dry on the lip product that I grabbed that I really wanted to try out and see if this worked hi this is the Too Faced unicorn tears melted latex lipstick so this is like super hyped up it looks like this it's actually beautiful like this is a beautiful component I think it looks stunning so the liquid latex are like a liquefied liquid lipsticks that do not dry down matte so these are more of a high shine lipstick this is it looks like a blue a blue purple let's go and see holy shit holy shit okay guys so I'm applying right now formula itself is a little sticky like it's definitely something you can feel this is not one of those lightweight formula it's like I came as I'm talking like it sticks my lip stick together the shine is sickening like it looks fucking cool definitely it makes my teeth look a little yellow though which is kind of annoying classic got purple undertone with that white reflect so it's gonna make your teeth look a little bit yellow white and purple already make your teeth look pretty bad so then combine like this I'm not like a great fan and I have fucking veneers on the top and they don't look very good if you guys like high shine liquid lipsticks that are really intense on the mouth that look crazy great I think you'll love this so this guy retails for 21 dollars and has three and a half stars on Sephora's website honestly I'm just not a fan of a color and the formula is a little bit too sticky as well like this for me is not a go like I would never wear this again like honestly unless it was like for Halloween or an event like that's like for something like this that's like more of a holographic purple lip unless it's for something like that like this is not being worn and good if you are a huge fan of holographic liquid lipsticks then I think you'd fucking love it thank you and live and gag and breathe and die for it I'm just personally not that's a no-go don't really like it and I think that 21 bucks is a little bit expensive for this for what the what I got you know and that's it you guys that's it for the entire video of these products that are in the beauty industry that are very very very overhyped to see if they are actually worth the price or not I do think three of them here are worth the hype we have the huda beauty foundation I think it looks beautiful on the skin really I do I can't wait to like try it out more and actually go get my right shade and then of course I really really really really like the two highlighters as well they're beautiful the things that work flat for me are the Sailor Moon brushes and the liquid latex unicorn tears I just don't like the color I think it's too sticky and that's it for me so that's kind of like not my cup of tea okay guys that's it for today's video I hope you guys enjoyed watching it of course I leave everything I talked about in today's video linked it down below if you guys are interested in checking them out wherever I find it I will leave them linked down below yeah and I'm gonna go film another video and be protecting a little bitch today I love you guys so much and I'll catch you guys in my next video bye guys I love you black I love you I love you you know I even love you not love because that is too strong but la hey guys it's only get in start Ziya you fucking jingles man not the cake and bake I'm gonna go ahead and so for app no shut the fuck up bitch I'm scared it's like a little ocean blinding ass bitch right now like it makes me truly upset that someone could do this to say their fucking move just sarena move to something off I get one more come on [Music] 
hey guys that welcome back to my channel so today's video is going to be a fun testing of a product video this is going to be a review and the product we are going to be reviewing is the vamp stamp vamp stamp basically what it is it's a tool to help you do perfect winged liner I say I do the air quotes because you never know what these kind of shits it could be Chandi and come being good so this guy went viral on Twitter I got so many requests from you guys to test it out see what I think about the vamp stamp it is $25 retail and you can get at the vamp stamp website so it's not a cheap item by any means you can buy a eyeliner brush for like five dollars so this is definitely not a cheap item but it's supposed to make applying eyeliner so much easier than the traditional way of actually applying liner so let's go ahead and see how this bad bitch turns out for us as always if you guys don't like this video if you guys do not like me please don't fucking watch you know Joe with that what if you guys do like this video please subscribe to my channel if you're not already any free new what's up at Manny anyway and welcome to my channel thank you so much for being here I really appreciate it so yeah that's gonna get into this review of this vamp stamp eyeliner stamp fucking so we have the vamp stamp create magic makeup for immediate release what the vamp stamp create magic makeup for immediate release vamp stamp create magic make up for immediate release that sounds fucking dirty for a mere release oh so they have three different types of wings they have a kitten wing the medium wing and they have the large wing I have the large wing pack with me and it also comes with a little one no doesn't come with this what so we have the pink in vortex which is a long wear cushion ink pad for the wing part and then we have the Vava voom which is the actual applicator so I think that this comes separately I did not know that you get the bottom stamp which is 25 bucks and then you get the ink eyeliner and angle brush for 20 so I think total this whole product scheme is 45 bucks which is definitely a high price point it's not cheap by any fucking means so I'm really hoping this is gonna work because you are paying a pretty penny for this product ignore my makeup I'm on right now I did a review on to be honest I see a subculture palette I'm not sure if this is going up before that but that's why my makeup is looking like this and I wanted to double purpose and film another video after because I'm not driving another one tomorrow so I'm gonna take the above of them large because you guys know I'm a bitch when it comes to wings a good wing so we're gonna take the this is for the right ah oh my god it's like a little star mm-hmm okay okay so we're gonna take this there's a little seal over it which is cool things that can preserve the product it looks like a little ink pad it's literally as if you were to get a stamp so I'm gonna take be right goes out like this okay wanna take the right right now we're gonna dunk it in wait it's not saturated for you okay I would definitely suggest instead of doing this going side to side cuz that fully saturates the actual um thing it's going oh my god my fucking nervous guys should go right here where's there okay oh my god it's really annoying it's not as pretty sick I was gonna be okay let me just finish off this eyeliner really quick look how far this wing goes out I've never had a wing like this okay we're gonna try the smaller medium one because that was not cute I'm sorry it wasn't good at all oh my god and I live for a fucking bald wing with that's too much oh my god I just ruined my makeup Manny Winehouse is in the building so guys final verdict what do we think about this we think we hey I'm not the biggest fan I think that this looks so fucked like truly like from the bottom of my heart fucked ah just like a casual like a Hilux fuck it's like a true bottom of my heart fucking gust oh fuck you know what I'm saying like this is a real fucked situation all-in-all guys I do not think this is worth the money I think that you guys should definitely save your coin by a five-dollar brush by Maybelline eyeliner that's like ten dollars and yes it's a little bit harder to use and yes it's a little bit more of a work challenge but this trying to fix this is gonna be a lot harder it's gonna be a lot harder than going in with your original liner so um I definitely say this is a complete miss for me complete flop No thank you no gracias and God yeah you guys thank you guys so much for watching I will leave this a link down below if you guys do want to check it out just in case as always our use of the night or day wherever you guys are and I'll catch you guys in my next video bye you guys they uh stop tickling my toes but yeah telling each other you know y'all there's one good to this review of guys on exploited okay what you see I got a new bit on my channel so mommy you're eating off my lipstick hey hey okay right here I'm trying you just fucking silver-fox already and I'm 26 [Music] 
hey guys that welcome back to my channel so today's video is going to be a highly requested video actually so I posted a photo recently this dude right here and I had so much positive feedback I had so many people asking me to create a tutorial to teach you guys how to do this look especially because I was using jacqueline hill and morphe palette so I decided to ask you guys on Twitter and snapchat if you guys really did want to see it and I got so much positive feedback like dude film this look or you will get castrated and I was like I'd rather keep my balls you know so Apple takes me I was going to be I'm going to be doing a whole cranberry princess smokey eye I thought would be really really fun the look is not too hard to do actually don't really remember the steps I just have my photo and I'm just gonna reference it because I don't when you're doing makeup and you're not doing it tutorial you just kind of going in and you're playing you're just kind of playing around you're just doing your own things so that's kind of what I did and I had no idea I was going to be filming it so now that I'm feeling it I'm like okay let's really let's really try to recreate this bad bitch so wish me luck I don't have any highlighter on right now because I'm going to film a highlighter review after this video so this is video number one out of three let's get this bitch started I want a standard I always do that I don't know why I always do that as always if you guys don't like this video if you guys do not like me please don't watch it you know the drill with thang but you guys do like this video please subscribe to my channel if you're not already and if you're new what's up and mani MUA and welcome to my channel thank you so much for being here I really appreciate it guys it's going into this cranberry princess smokey eye tutorial so before I get started the palette is coming back on Tuesday the 18th of July at 8 a.m. Pacific Standard Time aka 11 a.m. Eastern Standard Time and if you guys don't know exactly what time that is in your time zone go ahead and google it I'm not really sure on the other time zones actually and I'm not so excited for it to come back because I have used and abused my Jacquelyn palette I think it's so absolutely amazing and I'm so proud of them for creating such a great palette and of course you guys can use my code Mandy MUA and all caps in store online if you guys want to buy the palette or by any kind of morphe products I highly recommend them I think they're fantastic as you guys I'm sure know if you follow me you know what was a bucket bitch from work okay let's start this bad bitch out actually don't know exactly where I put the little paper that comes with it saying the shade names so I'm just going to be dunking in with shadows and I'm going to leave exactly what shadows I'm going to be dunking in on the screen with like a little moon like I usually do with eye tutorials so you guys will know the reference I want to take a more feet 27 and I'm gonna blend this really pretty a transition shade in it to the crease but we're just gonna go willy-nilly I don't know exactly what I did for that tutorial I just know what the color I use for the lid the crease everything else I have no idea I just played I'm gonna mix a little bit of this red end shade in with this like really pretty brown I want to put that into the crease on a morphe r39 amazing do for them back to 17 that's gonna go in the outer corner and we're gonna press it on and that's gonna go all the way in right up into the inner corner of our crease when looking for the crease I just tilt my head up guys and I just literally feel where the brush fit into the socket of your high that is usually the crease okay okay and once you deposited the actual color take that you 27 again and blend out that transition I'm gonna take a little bit this other really warm brown as well and just add on some more colors and more depth a corner blend it into the crease a bit so I just decided that I'm gonna do one eye on camera and just finish the whole entire eye here and now I'll just do the other one off of camera so I'm not wasting our time to just like keep going back and forth hopefully I remember the steps morphe r41 i want to take this really pretty chocolatey dark brown that's gonna go on the outer just packed on out here and into the crease as well and that didn't go so much lower than the other shades I'm just going to deepen the outer corner and this is what's gonna make a little bit more smokey eye can see boom dark smoky and sexy I was gonna blend out that color and mesh it in with the other shades that we have with that same r39 I see this all time guys with makeup has no rules if you feel like oh my god I'm stressed like you're not gonna get it right dude just play just practice practice makes perfect when it comes to makeup and try not to take it too seriously at the end of the day it's makeup it washes off and it's fun and it's creative and it's your expression so try not to worry about it too much if you feel like you're not getting the steps exactly right don't worry about it too much because you will eventually I promise so now for the star of the show I'm gonna be taking this beautiful intense cranberry shade it's so stunning it's like oh damn I'm gonna spray a little bit of fix+ on it Oh y'all see that I know y'all dude I wanna take that all the way in to the inner corner there's gonna press it on and this is on a morphe M 210 it's just a really good packing brush great for eyeshadow specifically taking a little more of that maroon shade on that 139 I'm gonna blend that into the crease to marry that really shimmery intense shade to make it not look so cut crease like so I'm not really trying to cut the crease I'm just really trying to blend it out and make it look like a cranberry smokey eye as you guys can see it just looks more like it's blending out diffusing into the other shades not just like so harsh like mmm so I'm gonna take the first shade in the palette it's like a very intense shimmering bright the nylon e-type shade and I'll take that on a morphe m3 2:6 Graper packing on the inner corner and on the brow bone specifically because it is so small precise I'm gonna take that on the brow bone Oh as such Wow okay I forgot I wonder y'all want him to do twirl good that she looks looking mom I'm sorry just blending a little bit that you 27 just a light little flurry nothing intense just a little okay guys so this is what we should have on the top of the ice so far I'm gonna do the top of the eye on the other side and I will be right back okay we completed at both sides Psalm 110 symmetrical but it's okay because life isn't symmetrical I think when I did the look either took a black eyeliner or a dark brown eyeliner is what I'm gonna do today thumbs like the monster brown eyeliner by ardency in one of my favorite gel liners ever at the shade dark brown I'm gonna run that in my lower lash line very very liberally so I'm gonna take it more fat you 36 blend that out okay cool now that we're looking cool we're going to take that same morphe r41 and we're going to dunk in that same really warm chocolatey Brown that we used on the crease on the outer corner or I going to smoke out and set the brown eyeliner and guys this is a smoky eye you guys can make it real smoky if you want to if you don't that's cool too and just start transitioning out that color as well now when doing an intense a smoky eye like this I always suggest doing winged liner I think winged liner complements smoky eyes so much so I'm gonna go do some winged eyeliner off of camera and apply some lashes and I'll be right back with the final level okay guys so we are basically done with the entire look this is what it looks like I'm wearing Lily lashes in the style of Mykonos last my a little video I said shade yeah some people some people clock me for that for sure I'm almost done with the tutorial about what I did to give it a little more pop of something something I added the Urban Decay Midnight Cowboy glitter on the inner part of my eye right

hey guys welcome back to my channel so today's video I have not seen I've not been tagged more than I have ever to do a review on something that I have for today's video these are the infamous Kylie cosmetics 360 dollar brushes holy shit that price point you guys when I first saw the price point on Twitter because people are like tweeting it like holy fuck what the fuck what you thinking like what the fuck what's going on because it was 16 brushes for three hundred and sixty dollars I was taken aback I'm not gonna lie how I saw that and I was like oh baby like I was truly shook from the bottom of my fucking heart the thing is I guess for me because it's like I'm so close with morphe I've been working with more three for the last three years and I was their third ever affiliate so it's like for me I'm like I'm just so accustomed to the brushes that are not as expensive that worked great like I can get a brush set like this from morphe for 150 bucks you know rather than and you can use a discount code on that whereas getting this brush set for 360 I'm like what the fuck I was shook so so many of you guys reached out to me and asked me to do a review on this and see if they're worth the hype if it's worth the money or not what do I think about the brushes themselves so today's gonna be a full demo using the brushes I'm into my entire face using all these brushes I'm not gonna use any other brushes but these and we'll see what we actually think of the brushes whether they're worth the 360 I am skeptical I truly am I'm like I don't know if anything's worth 360 PS I'm doing a whole entire giveaway month in December in today's video I will be doing the giveaway the giveaway prize is this right here I will leave it on the screen all you need to do is subscribe to

video if you guys do not like me please don't fucking watch it you know the drill with that but if you guys do like this video please go ahead and subscribe to my channel if you're not already and if you're new what's up a man um you a and welcome to my channel thank you so much for being here yeah let's get into this I apologize for using the same background you know I'm just like really living for the Christmas spirit you know let me live for the fucking Grinch like fucking tree over here and the little howleen I don't I don't really know any that said it is anyway let's get into the video so before we start on today's meal let's go and talk a little bit about the brushes themselves so you get 16 brushes for the entire kit and it comes with this silver brush holder the brush holder itself is actually very cheap looking like it actually is very very cheap looking at the quality of it it's just like any other brush case like it's nice quality like everything is fine the stitching is well done all that stuff is good but look like the way it looks everything about it just looks very cheap to me that's just my personal aesthetic and my style I'm like I just looks like not expensive and it doesn't feel luxurious doesn't feel expensive it doesn't feel like it would be worth three hundred sixty dollars coming with the brushes you know you're getting nya faced ones and I believe you get 7i ones and on Kylie's website you guys can actually see she lists every single brush individually sold and how much it's gonna cost individually and she posted how much it's gonna be for the bundle so for the bundle it's 360 and individually the prices range from 48 dollars to be in the most expensive the big powder brush to 18 dollars being the least expensive so that already I'm like like I'm stuck like truly I'm shook I think the thing to is like the reason a lot of people are upset about this situation not only is it like the price point is ridiculous it is it totally is I'm like what the fuck but she tweeted saying that she was trying her hardest to make everything as inexpensive but high quality as possible and honestly I'm creating a brand I know about markup I know how much things cost to me I'm not stupid I know about this thing I know all about all the backend of that stuff and I know for a fact that she could have gone cheaper with these brushes there's no way in hell like from the bottom of my heart I know she could have gone cheaper and I just it is what it is like she wants a higher markup and that's okay that's her brand that's fine and she was also comparing her brand to Mac and Kevin a Quan and it's like people were so pissed cuz Kevin Kwan is a legend and Mac is Ana legendary brand and it's like you can't really compare me don't compete at this point like they've been in it for years and years and years and years and Kylie has been doing this for a couple years now and she's of course made her mark in the beauty industry but she is not a high-end brand like those brands are she's not sold in Nordstrom she's an e-commerce brand she has like her pop-up shops and Topshop and things like that but like a spades of spades it is what it is so that's why I think people are so upset just wanting to talk about that really back-end really quickly so I'm gonna go ahead and do my gnome routine I'm gonna try using these brushes I'm very very intrigued by them I see this little flat kabuki I mean they feel very soft there's no denying they they feel fucking good nice they feel very nice and me see okay I'm confused because she tweets I developed for you guys the most amazing luxury brochures ever I am very excited real brushes don't compare to synthetic brushes different performance quality everything I am 100% down to do an entire synthetic line in the future which will ultimately be cheaper so I'm assuming these are real brushes or natural hair I think that's what she's trying to say even though I personally think they're synthetic brushes that have been absolutely amazing anyway there's nothing else to say besides that I think we're good okay let's go ahead and we're gonna go right in we're gonna go in with the number six brush this is a foundation looking brush it looks like a one of those kabuki brushes so we're shouldn't go in we're gonna see how it if she perform I'm taking my Laura Mercier flawless foundation follows fusion foundation which actually matches me pretty good so on the face the brushes feel nice like it does feel good there's no denying that it feels good let's see how it looks up close and see like it's even leaked see this shedding I just found like two bristles on my face Oh shedding which isn't like the end of the world of course brushes shed that's like a normal part of brushes okay so so far everything is looking pretty good I'm not upset I'm not mad at it though the brush looks like it looks fucking dirty I wish the bristles weren't that white like I wish they weren't like this pure white cuz it just shows how easily dirty everything gets its leaving streaks on my face but where do we just write that one let's go ahead and use the number two brush this looks like one of those duo fiber brushes maybe this will apply the foundation better maybe this is supposed to be the foundation brush who knows see for this stuff like for you using like liquid foundation and some I like synthetic brushes more I just feel like real brushes they just soak up so much liquid product whenever using a product that's liquid I like to use synthetic brushes I don't like natural hair brushes for liquid real natural hair absorbs product so much more than something that's synthetic but hair fibers themselves have like divots and then they have holes and they absorb and they take away products so whenever I'm using a natural hair brush for foundation I'm always like so the foundation everything looks fine like everything's on and it looks good it just took me a good like five minutes to get this to the way I wanted it to be and that's already too long like I need it to be quick I want to be fast so this one I would suggest I don't like it I didn't like this one either more than this one not the biggest fan of this don't even know what the fuck to use I should for like I literally have no idea I'm using I guess bronzer and other things but no but do you know what the brush itself works the foundation ends up looking good so if you technically bought this brush it would work you would get the like you would get the look that you're going for it just took a little bit too long and I feel like this isn't me a bitch to clean because of how far I went in and seeped in because it absorbs so much product well we got the base done so now it's some concealer time go ahead and apply so our target tape in the shade light let's just switch between NARS and tart so I feel like this brush is gonna be the concealer brush this is and this is brush number seven it just looks like a reminds you so much of the Mac one like that Mac duo fiber brush let me see if he doesn't see this alone like it has I could do o to it right at the tip not a duo fiber but like they are duo fiber in a way but it's the same bristles I don't really know it just shaped like a duo fiber brush whatever I'm gonna go ahead and press this underneath the eye and blend out feels a little scratch so just feel like this one just feels a little bit pokey like I would never use this for underneath my eye because it is kind of poking meat but those are almost too like sharp but the product looks really nice underneath I like it definitely made it look very pretty look the face looks fucking beat but it did take off a lot of product so now we're gonna take brush number eight to go and set underneath the eye and that one feels so much nicer just say like it doesn't feel hard and intense for me brushes I have natural hair work great for powder powder products that work really really really nicely this one feels great at playing with powder it feels really really really nice actually so I'm very happy about that we got a good one guys you got a good one I'm Shea number eight her brush number eight I fuck with you Anna Maria fuck with you you know one of the three they fuck with one of the four actually now I'm gonna take this Big Mama brush this is number one we're gonna go and put that all over and set entire thing with my two-faced ethereal powder this brush it feels very smooth this one feels very very nice I definitely definitely like this one it's so of course a little bit like pokey and a little bit bristly because I am like doing this on it the thing is though this is 48 dollars by itself 48 dollars for just this one brush as you can see my foundation picks up on it because to natural hair anyway you guys I just don't it's not worth $48 it's just not man like the brushes fall apart easily if you just like kind of move them to the side they fucking fall off the morphe e to for example the morphe e to is fuck incredible its synthetic and that's like 20 bucks and it looks exactly like this and I honestly like what I want you guys to spend money on something that I do think that you can get at a cheaper price I'm not over here hating coyote cosmetics I feel like Kylie has done such amazing things and I think that her brand has done so well and she's done so well for herself and she's an amazing businesswoman but that doesn't mean that I'm gonna say something doesn't work because it's it's fucking it works but it's not worth that coin now that we're powered we're just gonna keep on powering through anyway we're gonna go and take the Marc Jacobs tantric now we're gonna take a brush number four this is like a chisel e bronzy contouring brush see this this is where the realm is this is where I'm gonna I feel and enjoy the brushes more because I like natural hair brushes for powders I think powders are great when it comes to these kind of bristles so we're gonna just go ahead and go on in right here and that picks up powder beautifully deposits it really nicely and it feels really great this one doesn't feel like scratches other ones do either actually feels so so much nicer Wow and it blended it very very well I enjoy this special I would definitely use this one again okay let's see how much number four is this guy retails for $26 again I still feel like that's way too much money there's plenty of morphe brushes that are comparable to this brush like this brush works great it definitely does there's no denying any nice and it deposits the powder nicely and it blends everything really nicely so that's good like that's great I'm very happy about that maybe I'm just a cheap ass and I like since I've been using morphe for years and years and years like I think I'm kind of skewed when it comes to makeup right now like I just am like I know I am like whenever I'm buying something like I'll be like oh I can get it somewhere else cheaper morphine colour-pop and brands like that that's all things are really inexpensive I've skewed my vision when it comes to makeup and it's just it is what it is friends like that have a lower price point have skewed my buying because it makes me want to I want to save money and I want like a better incentive and I want better products for a lower price I just do this brush worked great so far these two are good these are wins for me the other ones I'm like okay guys so now we're going through some blush we're take a new brush we're gonna take this brush number five oh and take our little wheel of fortune here from Tarte my favorite fucking thing of holiday 2017 we're gonna go and put that ooh yeah I really like this for blush holy shit when you're applying powders with a natural hair brush it's so funny how like you can just notice a difference between using a synthetic brush that's something I will definitely say percent like this one feels really nice it goes on very nice lens very nice so I'm living for this brush tool this is working don't get me wrong but it's end of it we're gonna talk about the price point at the end of the day is it worth three hundred and sixty dollars yeah the brushes are gonna work like of course they're gonna work hope I mean I'm hoping is she worth the money though or not rush number nine a little highlighting brush go ahead a highlight with this been a bitch we're gonna take miss old for nikkietutorials yes mama her beautiful glow goes glow goes I've been using this bitch forever see that's the highlight that's the highway it's not really necessarily the best course the fan brush works it's depositing it very nicely oh my word I put too much hunk it his hand brushes applying the highlight very nicely it's just a classic fan brush Dan brush 20 absolutely not in this bitch I pay like five bucks for pretty sure more if he has one for five bucks I was just like I'm sorry there's just no way there's just not a way in hell did it work yes totally it totally worked what is it worth it okay it's gonna move on to the browser which is a brows and imma do the eyes real quick and then we'll be done and I'm gonna talk about the final verdict okay cool so we have the rest of the face on the little nose contour did my brows off the camera and I actually use the brush number 14 to line my brows and prime my eyes with a paper from Mac now I have to say about it is that I worked very nicely as you can see like one of those just flat detailed concealer brushes that's really good at packing anyway brush number fourteen really did work very nicely just wanted to point that out there because I didn't do on camera she lined the brows prime the eyes is go ahead and do the eyes and now officially and we're gonna be taking the nice palette from Kylie Jenner's brand because I love this palette and that would be fitting to use her palettes with her brushes you know I'm saying where I hate the shade below Laboy we're gonna be taking brush number 15 very fluffy shader brush okay putting it into the crease everything feels normal it's a little bit rough not gonna lie I mean so like synthetic brushes in the eye - but it's blending out everything beautifully and like I said earlier when you're using natural hair brushes to put down powder everything always I'm just looking so good looks very beautiful looks very blended it's very well done so there's a couple of the little bristles falling off of this brush but I am going a little bit more like intensely I'm not like being so soft with this because it is an eye brush and I tend to like be a little bit more rough I'm doing my amigo cuz it's just like quicker this is we have so far everything looks great it looks blended everything was blended out very nicely now we're gonna take the brush and number 12 take a shorter version of the Mac 217 it's like a fluffy shader brush and we're gonna take a little bit of Wonderland the brush is acting a little weird you see what's happening here like actually happening my thing the problem with this brush is that it's so fat and so far apart that it's really easy to put product on here but it some part will transfer above I don't know I'm not really liking this brush I feel like it's not doing it what I wanted to do like I feel like it's not connecting everything nicely and seamlessly and I know it's not the palette itself because I used as probably many times now and it's so good so I just leads me to believe that it could only be the brush because that's the only part that's changed so there's a separation between this area right there that's I'm trying to take away it's a little annoying to be really honest it really is I'm gonna do like a floating cut crease a halo cut crease it's like that cute little pencil brush brush number 16 we had a little bit of hot cider which is like a D dark chocolate cocoa brown that's gonna go in the outer corners everything better for us - yeah this one's way better this brush is so much better it's actually like not being stupid basically feels great this one blends are really great like this is a win okay now we're gonna put a little bit of this gold shade slay it's right in the center and just fuckin fuck it up okay perfect so now we're gonna go and finish the other high off camera and we'll be right back and I'm gonna play eyeliner and mascara and lashes so we don't waste our time okay guys so she is on she is done the face is fully beat to the fucking ground this is the final look this is how everything turned out things really pretty it wasn't like whole point of this video is obviously not my makeup what I'm wearing right now but if you guys are curious I'm wearing a sepia anasazi liquid lipstick and I'm wearing a Lily lashes at Miami on the eyes these are like my go-to lash right now oh yeah so we're done with the video I use basically every single brush other than these two these are the two I didn't really use this when I did a little bit just a blender Neath my lower lash line a very small amount it wasn't anything too crazy I would say I didn't really use this and I did not use this one either this is the number three Russia oh no I use 14 of the brushes so I think I do have a good grasp on the brushes and what I think of them okay guys so final verdict what do I think of the brush set is it worth three hundred and sixty dollars or not my thoughts are this brush is not worth $360 does the brush set work yes it totally does it's a natural hair bristle they are very very nice they feel nice on the face they definitely blend make up very nicely like I could not deny that the products work well that is for sure that it's going without saying but 16 brushes for $360 less shipping and plus tax holy shit like that comes out to like 400 bucks for a brush set could you fucking fathom spending 400 ours on reverse it I really cannot I cannot imagine it and it's frustrating because high Cosmetics like obviously Kylie cosmetics is popular because of Kylie Jenner and she puts her face on her name on these products and that's why they sell so well so it's frustrating for me as a consumer and as someone that does reviews and things like that online that's like because it's her name kids and people are gonna want to buy this $360 brush set and I just feel like it's not fair and I feel like it's a little bit too expensive and right a little bit I mean it's way too fucking expensive I can literally go online right now we can go to morphe brushes website right now okay let's go and go to their one of their brush sets like a high-end nice one for example they have Jacqueline Hills favorite brushes Jacqueline awe has an entire brush collection that's like her favorite and that's 23 brushes for 155 plus you get to you the discount code on it so I believe you receivable an extra 15 20 bucks so that's already nuts the entire morphia gilded collection the gilded set 159 bucks all of these brushes and they're so high-quality they're also they're synthetic but they're very very very high quality brushes I feel like because I'm a beauty influencer I do know a lot about some products and I feel like I do have a good head on my shoulders and I feel like I have to have good opinions on certain things and do these products work yes they do but is it worth the range of 60 dollars no it's not I would suggest going if you guys really wanted a good brush set if the Jacqueline Hill favorites for more if we get the gilded collection from morphe I just think it's too much money 360 dollars the brushes should fucking sing to me and feed me grapes yeah guys I love you so much thank you so much for watching don't forget to enter my

Mario I'm sorry I will tell them how to get a bang you belong to me that is your long mmm-hmm no that's copyright don't play that okay guys so as always if you guys don't like this video - guys don't like us please don't fucking watch it don't be mean war-machines you know the Jo with that don't be mean watching see snobby don't freaking say nice know okay first question is how do I ask the dial on the date you like this huh first first of all you do not ask the guy on a date you tell him to go on a date with you okay so you're a more forceful yes you don't you weren't going on a date with me you are my BAE you are my boyfriend done deal yes do not accent don't say excuse me would you like to go on a date let me star cuz then that gives an opportunity to say no way Jose and then hides from you and then he deletes you from Facebook and Twitter and Instagram and then we are number and then he tries to get a restraining order against you and they try to arrest you because you keep going to his house when he's not there and crying through the window and you're hiding under the bed or in the closet all these things and you always find you so you don't X you just tell there you got it do we have sex on the first date do you have once sex are you I'm just curious like do we do that or do we wait legally I'm not supposed to do any nasty until you are married and also doing the nasty is only for having babies so mostly I kind of ate with the boys you can try it with me you're right in hello adopt chin so since you can't make a boy pregnant yet it's only 2017 it could happen next year but if since you can't make a boy pregnant yet you that means you don't have to do the nasty hmm the Lord knows the gains try how long do i wait till I text him back when he texted to me Hans I wait immediate you immediately immediately you don't have to wonder where you are what you're doing so when he says hey you go hi I'm right on time and then you're already there we text you so how did you get outside how do we get outside you've been waiting there you wait what do we know where he lives why would you not know where you're being Lance why would you not know where the person lives that you want to be stalking and being with oh I think I know where Twitter lives find out everything about him go to his house wait there so the second he texts you can text by oh me like I'm Ronald hobby like that makes more sense yes I should have flowers ready no don't give him flowers that's disgusting what I give them give them like yourself do we use protection you always use protection when you are stalking someone you need to be wearing a bulletproof vest you need to be wearing long sleeves dark clothes they cannot see you so that you cannot get her I'm getting trouble or camouflage is

if you do that look how much bigger your lip skin funny you big about to get smaller no Punk law no tiny bigger see that's better so and then right when you get really really close like this you'll tug went straight yes that is the case but that is only for marriages or engagements which we are so that is you don't have to touch lips you don't have to get your little you just do tongue in and

[Music] hey guys welcome back to my channel so today's video is going to be the first like tutorial or like first type of fall look that I'm gonna be doing this season I'm so excited I love fall time so much it's my favorite time of the year I just figured it'd be really fun to film a tutorial recently I uploaded a video and I was actually with Laura in in Laura and I were testing Instagram makeup are things that were really really popular on Instagram things that you saw all over Instagram like the Too Faced collection and things like that me and her we're talking and it just kind of being candid and just kind of talking one on one and nowadays it feels like tutorials are kind of going away and we're really into like this review stage of YouTube right now cuz when you upload a tutorial on YouTube it people don't get as many views as you do when I can you're doing a review on something weird or doing some random-ass video and it's just something I've noticed I don't know exactly what it is but I figured you know what Bucky I saw so many comments of you guys saying please do a tutorial soon and I figured why the not and I just got the huda beauty palette recently said the desert desk palette looks like this it's stunning holy it's beautiful and I thought it'd be really really really fun to film a grungy smoky very fall type look oh yeah guys that's what I was going to be were gonna film a tutorial I have not tried who the beauty's palette yet I've heard mixed reviews I'm not really exactly sure what I'm getting myself into right now but I'm excited to film it as always if you guys like this video if you guys do not like me please don't  watch it you know like your thing but if you guys do you like this video please subscribe to my channel if you're not already and if you're new what's up I'm an emu a and welcome to my channel thank you as so much for being here I really appreciate it but yeah let's go and get into this a grungy small I don't know what the we're gonna I'm just gonna pull out the palette and just [Music] I was kind of walking around with the pallet earlier and I was watching when they swatched really really really nicely the mats felt creamy the shimmers felt intense there's one shade right here this is in the shade Cosmo and this is straight-up a pressed glitter I didn't really like it only touched it it felt very like gritty and intense and I was like yeah so we're not gonna use that but we're gonna use other shades I kind of want to go in with some Purple's in oranges and reds and do something really fall and desert dusky if you know I'm singing so we're gonna take the shade desert sand but they're very powdery so far as I've noticed I'm as I'm like going into it but they're not crazy powdery where your overwhelms or anything like that they're just powdery and then I'm taking this on a morphe 27 it's a really nice fluffy brush great for like throwing in transition shades and things like that so I'm just going to be doing this and putting this into the crease it's just a nice easy transition something neutral to put down first to blend out this is fun I haven't actually done like a full like talk-through tutorial or like something like this in a while and I have missed it a lot I definitely definitely have but watch this video like not get that many views just because we're like not in a tutorial world right now and I think it's because so many people have seen tutorials done like you can only use so many color combinations you can only do so many different types of things before people just get bored you know at least when you're doing a review it's like a new type of thing it's like something weird and new and I think that's the aspect that people are enjoy and they're liking to see like something different and unique what do you guys think I'm really like this is genuinely a curious thing for me because I'm just like kind of talking right now and just opening up like how it is on my side of youtube links seeing how things go yeah I would love to hear your guys's thoughts on this I don't know maybe I'm tripping maybe I'm I don't know what I'm singing but let me know what you guys think so now I'm gonna take the shade amethyst and saffron and mix the shades together it's like a purpley purple and red combined and we're gonna put that with a morphe art 39 it gets like a dense packing a fluffy brush if that makes sense like a white haired brush so we're gonna put that on the outer corner don't do something more fun today it's like I'm actually later on I'm going to Universal Studios to do this Access Hollywood thing with Laura we're doing like a maze thing through that this scary maze and they're like gonna film it and I'm like so scared okay I don't so I'm like praying that it's not that scary you guys so as I'm going in and blending right now I feel like the shadows are blending fine like I'm not like really having too much problem when it comes to the blend but I do think that there's a lot kickback when it comes to these shadows the lighter ones had more like right now these guys don't have as much I mean honestly for me like whenever a shadow has a lot of kickback as long as it blends and like I can use it and it's okay like I'm fine like I don't care if they're like some fallout actually I think I spoke too soon because I feel like this part here it's not blending very easily but I know when it comes to like purples and reds those shades are so hard to like blend out once they go down like trust me I know I know about those shades and they are very very very hard to blend out once they are down okay so far so good and everything is blended out as much as we can when it comes to these kind of colors do a little bit more of a harder concentration of that amethyst color on that same r39 I feel very like Sarah Jessica Parker in  hocus-pocus she's like the purple one it's actually so funny even saying that because last year me Patrick and Chris P all did a hocus pocus video and it was so much fun we did a collaboration and all of us like were the Sanderson sisters and I was actually served disco Parker why should we take next the shade Twilight is speaking to me this is what it looks like we're hearing that is speaking to me what about the shade Turkish Delight okay I'm gonna do both it I'm doing both I mean we'll see if it turns out I'm lay just kind of around I'm gonna take the shade Turkish Delight all right put that all over the center of the lid give us of that little that warm pop that we're getting I feel like with these shadows these are definitely ones that you need to apply with your finger because they're just like really almost like wet feeling I don't know it's kind of weird so now I'm gonna go over it with that Twilight chain right over the top of it whoo it's literally so intense the camera cannot even pick it up how gnarly this looks in person whoo this look sickening I have some follow on my face just the heads out careful with oh wow okay I'm gonna do the other eye off of camera and I'll be right back okay so so far this is what we got you guys this is how it looks I think it's looking sickening I'm really really liking all this is turning out actually so um that makes me quite happy look at that you guys and honestly because this is a grungy ER tutorial you guys don't need to be like so intense about getting it like perfectly right it's all good I just wanted it to be like kind of blown out and intense looking so I'm gonna take the shade out oh you d out on a morphe 35n cyl brush will work great for this but I'm going to just put that on the outer corner I really start to define the corner a little bit more because it is a little bit like looking I'd only see a lot of color coming up with this one that's weird okay I see it like I mean I see it's not like intense and they'll take a little bit of black too okay I can definitely see it now that there is definitely some there's definitely a darker Brown shout him down okay cool I can see it now and then just taking that 827 is blending out the edges a little bit more you can never blend too much girl you know just blend toadstools okay so now for the bottom of the lash line I just want to really again smoke it out make it just like grungy and intense I'm gonna take the Marc Jacobs high liner in the shade at rokoko Ohio  love the shade rokoko and I blend that into a waterline well this makes my eyes look so intense and so pretty if you're looking for a really good eyeliner for the waterline for hazel eyes or for blue eyes try rokoko by Marc Jacobs because luckily the highliners are pretty creamy I don't set too fast mm-hmm okay now what she should be going with next we take the shade royal like a satin purple finish so what it looks like on the skin right there sui down on the lower lash line I feel like it'll tie the look together really nicely to make it a lot more purple intense so we're gonna take the shade royal are gonna blend out that rokoko shade right down here like that yeah yes honey one grungy I just love like looks like this I try my best not to grab any oranges because you guys know I love with an orange and I love a really warm smoky eye yeah I'm just gonna take that r39 that we use to blend everything out earlier and just blend out that lower lash line a little bit just to give us a little bit of a better blend I'm taking a little bit of the shade angelic on my fingertip and put that whoa on the inner corner I was not expecting to look that intense we're really going for that grungy look I guess this is so intense  but I live for it okay guys I'm gonna go curl my lashes and put some eyeliner on off of camera and I'll be right back okay guys so this is what we should have so far so off of camera what I did to make this Center pop a little bit more I took the Stila Magnificent metals and glitter and glow liquid shadow in the shade see siren it's like a duochrome purple blue shade you do not have to do that of course at all I just wanted to add a little bit more of a pop because I am going out later on tonight and I thought would look really really really cool with it as a shade was so to the lid shade and I think it looks  sickening I took the same r39 brush took out my shadow underneath here and just blended it out just and just kept it going okay guys for the lip I think I'm gonna take the show you - steela note a and ot te I've never tried to shake it but it looks really pretty and I think it would go really cool with this well that's so much darker than I thought it was cool Wow oh wow hmm application on this kind of color is so scary cushy though oh let it dry because I just got a little bit patchiness because I didn't like dragon time this color stunning though Wow and that is it you guys and that's it for today's grungy tutorial I just wanted to do something fun and different you know I don't really ever do too many colors like this I don't ever do lip colors like this I don't really do eye looks as much like this actually do I looks like this was like kind of like my thing I love doing smoked out really intense on the eyelid really grungy looking eyes but it's just like what I like to do and it's fun but the lip definitely not no not at all but the color is really beautiful you have to be careful though when it's drying because it will become patchy on you if you try to do that I think it's pretty good on the coverage right now it looks pretty good there's definitely some spots of like right there there patchiness but I think that you can definitely get by with the lipstick for sure and I think the look turned out really sickening I hope you guys enjoy today's video I had a lot of fun and just sitting down and chatting with you guys and just doing a fun tutorial I haven't done one of these of course like I said earlier in a  minute and I'm just so ready for fall I'm ready for Halloween I'm

hey guys that welcome back to my channel so today's video I'm actually really really excited to be filming this video so I asked you guys a lot of questions on snapchat and Twitter to gauge with you guys what you guys would like to see me doing and I asked you guys on Twitter who like me to see using the new Kylie cosmetics blue honey collet so I'm actually going to an event right now and I got this in the mail today and I was really intrigued by it so it's already gonna film a look with it why not show what I do with the palette also I really wanted to do a little side by side comparison and swatches and things like that of the dream street collaboration with Kathleen and color pop versus and be Kylie cosmetics blue honey palette because a lot of people were saying that they are really really really similar in color scheme and I was like oh my god they kind of are similar in color schemes I'm actually really excited about this color scheme and think it's beautiful I've not been excited about Kylie palette like this sends like the nice palette and back in like December which is like not far away anyway I think that she has really great palettes I think that the quality has really really been stepped up in her shadow realm which I'm so excited about because you see the prices of her shadow palettes are about like 40-something bucks as always if you guys don't like this video you guys do not like me please don't fucking watch it you know the Jo with that torrents but you guys do like this video go ahead subscribe to my channel if you're not already and if you knew what's up am anyway and welcome to my channel thank you so much for being here but yeah it's going get into this review on the caddy Cosmetics blue honey palette I'm just gonna be using it as well it's gonna be like a review and more like Tryon also I'm gonna try to use the dream Street one as well and seeing if like I can do the same look on both eyes I don't really know that's impossible we'll see [Music] the blue honey palette launches on one 23:18 which is coming up really really soon doctor you don't even know this videos going up before or after 123 take my word for a grain of salt I don't know for a fact that they are the same price as the other nine shadow palettes because I can't find the price point on her Instagram this is the color scheme right here let me show you guys there is no mirror in this I wish there was but this is the color scheme I think it's beautiful I'm really into this like I'm just really really into it so now let's go ahead and take a look at dream Street which is this palette right here this is the color schema for this palette again also very fucking similar in color scheme to the Kylee palette this one retails for $16 and comes with 12 shades of course these are much smaller in pan than the Kylie cosmetics one as you can see right here the pan sizes are quite different so basically all we have to know is that the Kylie cosmetics shadows are basically double the size of these guys and it comes with nine and the June Street comes with 12 so I'm going to go ahead and swatch the clothes that I would say are a little bit similar we have this shade right here swatching it feels amazing feels quality is fun that one to me looks really similar to this one I mean just look so similar like Jesus Christ but like this one feels great it feels actually like very much the same I'll swatch them and then I'll show you guys after hang because honestly it is so I'm gonna swatch the lightest shade here and the Shea that's in Kathleen's pout that's closest to that one which is a dis Carrie here one's a matte and one's a satin shimmer so who's gonna be fuckin different okay when you're watching oh yeah now we're gonna go ahead and swatch this one oh that's a pretty fuckin shade miss Kylie Jen so looking at Kathleen's powders not a shade that would be comparable to that one that one is its own little field I guess I'll do one that's as close it's gonna be which is gonna be the top right one right here it's much more orange much more warm but this is now we're gonna swatch the Kylie gold Oh Kylie's really doing the thing with this palette I'm kind of moving let's just see the first round of swatches real quick I want to show you guys come in our arms basically all tatted up from swatches so we have all the ones on the left are kylie palettes and all the ones on the right are color pop so this is what they look like right here we have the one that Sagamore mustardy orange shade right there we have like a nudie color right here we have like this shimmery satin taupe shade right here which is not similar to this one at all this one is Kylee this is color pop the gold one not the same these guys are actually more different than I thought they were gonna be this is Kylie this is more of a seafoam green shape this one's like a deep dark blue fucking depth of the ocean and then we have Kylie right here which is a really cool green gold reflect and then we have this one here from colour-pop which is a black with a blue reflect in it as i'm swatching the Kylie shades and those watching the Claire pop shades they're both beautiful like I'm actually really happy with the quality of both of them a swatch pretty similarly to be honest they're not with that different in swatch of course there's some different finishes but it's pretty like pretty similar so we have the final three complete this is what they look like on the arm Kylie Kylie Kylie clip pop color pop color pop to let you guys see for yourselves what they look like in comparison this is the deepest shade from colour-pop this is the deepest shade for Kylie the two shimmers these are like more copper orangie shimmers this one's much much much more pink and red than this one's more of a true copper and then we have okay guys I'll take with that as you will I honestly do think that there are a lot of similarities to these two palettes as i'm swatching the kylie one i know that the quality is great so if you did want to buy the Cutty one that's great - you're gonna get a great palette so I'm actually really happy with both of them but if you do have dream Street with by Kathleen and Claire pop I would honestly just skip out on the kylie one that's just my personal opinion they're similar enough where you can get by but I was thinking I'm like I'm gonna be able to do a full look like side-by-side and you guys aren't gonna know what's Kylie and which one is color pop but I'm like you know what no cuz I really wanted to do like a look that's cohesive and like good you know I'm saying like I want to do like a nice ass look so I'm not gonna do that because I'm also going out after so I'm like bitch I'm not gonna fuckin do to their eye looks right now I'm not doing that right now so I'm just really bad at reading like the back thing come into comparison to what this is I just wish that these fucking pallets had the goddamn name on the thing maybe this is just like the stock component and they add the little things depending on what colors are in and she's has like a million of these sitting around and that's why they have a little sticker on the back that would swear my daughter's and that's why they probably don't have the names on them because there's stock component but anyway these two are obviously like calling my name like so hard just fucking do it in like honestly though we're gonna go and just take the pallet guys we're just gonna play we're gonna have fun this is basically gonna be a get ready I already swatched them I think they swatch beautifully I think the quality is really really nice just like I do with the Kathleen palette and I've already actually done a hole into our video on Kathleen's collection with color pops you guys want to see that I'll leave that link down below that's why I'm not talking about this one as much because I've already done an entire video on it I do want to just show the comparison swatches between the Kylie palette and in the color pop one so you guys could have a reference I want to do it go gracias say hey look if you guys don't know Rocio sara is you should she's amazing and she's just really talented and she's so sweet if I talked to her before and snapchat and she's like the sweetest thing but she's also very iconic with her looks I think that they're very very unique I'd unless you deserve some recognition so I'll leave her handle to her Instagram right here so you guys can check it out so I'm gonna try to look like hers not something colorful but her style if it doesn't turn out it's all good at the end of the day Rocio you're fucking sickening and if you see this let me shit so I'm gonna go ahead and go in with a more feet m5o for some things she's raw and sweet like honey oh my god your name is she draw that is nasty I'm just kidding no be safe kids out there if you're having sex you shouldn't you should be abstinent you know especially if you're younger be fucking abstinent please it was actually really crazy random sight now and I didn't really think I was ever talked about this I might have a little bit but not like really on my channel actually just started taking the prep which is basically like a drug that prevents HIV exposure to the body and as you guys I'm sure know HIV is like a very prevalent seeing in the gay community of course it is also in these straight communities as well the heterosexual community it's very prevalent there as well there's this stigma of gays getting HIV and AIDS in it's just it really sucks but that's I mean it is what it is that's the stigma behind it and I wanted to just talk about the fact that I do take prep myself because if you're sexually active I'm not saying I'm sexually active all the time like Jesus but I am sexually active enough where I would want to take it and be as safe as possible because basically it's a drug that you take and I'm not pushing drugs bitch I'm not pushing drugs on you whatsoever I'm a sudden you guys know this is something I do take I just feel more responsible taking it so this is like I guess it's just kind of like my way of saying that I'm being safe and protecting myself in the ways that I know I can also it's about using condoms and being dumb obviously I'm not being stupid and I'm just like Willy you're fucking doing having unprotected sex all the time or anything like that you know as long as you're being safe as long as you guys are being careful out there if you guys are sexually active be safe please I'm taking a morphe r39 and I'm taking this shadow right here which is called honeymoon I believe and I'm taking out a Murphy r39 a really good dense packing slash blending brush a lot of you guys know I have like a medical background like I wanted to go to med school so anything like this like talking about like things body-wise that are important like st eyes and you know things like that i just think it's like important to bring up even though it's kind of uncomfortable it's like something that you like don't really want to talk about you know I've been lucky enough to have never gotten STD or STI my own hole into our life and I've been blessed along the way because I've been like safe and being smart about different things even if you did get one it's like don't be too like hard on yourself you know things happen mistakes are made and do better next time and you hopefully learned from that mishap you know I'm saying I feel like if you didn't know me and if we just sort of watch me like if you just watching my video right now for the first time you would never think that I'm like over here have like Bachelors of Science degree and I was like literally in the process of going to med school or like applying for medical schools for like programs to go into programs for medical school like watching me now you would be like the bug you were yeah I was fucking weird thinking about like that's like that was a whole new life it literally feels like an in completely different life to me it's like the most bizarre thing okay let's go ahead and take some concealer we're gonna carve some bitches out I'm actually on take a little bit of a Kiley concealer I feel like the reason I like this concealer to like kind of carve out like a crease or do anything like that is because I feel like it's very very liquidy I don't really mind it you know I'm gonna dry so nicely and I'm taking this on a Smashbox lip brush actually I'm doing that go full like cut crease moment with it you can make your cut crease go anywhere you want and literally like it this is like something that like doesn't have any rules you know I'm going above my crease I just kinda wanted to put it in here as I want it to be don't really vet that for now the cool thing about what we're Osio does just like this cool thing where she leaves like the middle a bit kind of like a floating country situation I'm not too good at it's not something I've ever like really practiced I've done it like one time burn try doing today do it's really cool to him is to see how many amazing up-and-coming beauty bloggers and vloggers there are Beauty vloggers I'm not even talking about bloggers to be honest but it's so amazing to see these people come into the beauty space and just fucking start killing it and do their thing and then there's and they're just like cool and they're fuckin cool people like honestly like for example talking about Rocio who I think is just actually an amazing sweet person Rob Beauty Christy's another one who I just left so much and she's like the sweetest thing Alissa ashley is another person who I literally gag for like y'all understand I want to fucking collab with Alissa to be honest like I need to get that shit fucking rolling because I think she's the sweetest thing I'm not saying you get burnt at all by the same people all the time but it does get quite repetitive when you're seeing the same people over and over again at different events and things like that and I'm gonna think it's bad don't get me wrong like I live for seeing the people I see and I love like having the friends that I have and I'm so lucky to have the people I've met in the community and like everyone's been I mean a lot of people have been great to me but it's nice to get some fresh faces and fresh looks and fresh outlooks on different things and getting different perspectives you know I really hope that those people I just mentioned along with so many others I can't even think about right now really continue to just to grow and kill it and do their thing and I hope that they continue on and just keep fucking impressive you bet you choose fucking hard you know it's hard game it's a hard fucking bitch and people can be really rough and really vicious and really just downright mean there's a lot of shitty people in the community so it's nice to be able to meet people that are coming into the space that are just good I mean after the whole tart foundation Fiasco I feel like we really need to focus and get these brands to realize that it wasn't 18 like we're not just we're not taking anyone shit we're just not this is not the year for shit taking like we did that in 2017 we've got our moment with our shit moment you know and we're not gonna do that this year is deal with bullshit from brands that are well-known and now I'm gonna do the lid moment rocío if you're watching this I'm sorry if I'm like doing you dirty like this is not something I do normally I take this shade right here this was in the shade buzz off there's like that really pretty topi stunning shade I'm gonna put that on the center all I'm saying is I'm very excited to see what the future in the beauty world holds I think it's gonna be really really great here you know something it's something like this it's um along these lines she doesn't more cunt than me of course but uh I'm gonna do the other eye off of camera I just finished up my makeup look a little bit and we will be back very soon okay so we have both of the tops of the eyes that done right now this is the moment we have going because I'm gonna do the bottom of the lashes as well I'm gonna do the bottom lash line I really do want to incorporate the blue like blue Maji type shades as well so I'm going to use those I'm gonna take a little bit of the middle one which is the blue honey and I'm gonna take that underneath my lash line on the outer corner right now here its own little moment and I'm gonna mix the shimmery shade with it bumble or royal jelly I'm gonna mix that one in on the inner part of the eye a little bit of a sheen as well I guess we're really taking either tonight you guys am I going to the Sony event where Kelly is performing and I guess we're doing a whole moment tonight I want to see a little bit of a gradient effect it's a little bit lighter and doesn't machine to it and then we have to look down bitch I'm just gonna highlight the brow bone - it's like Nicki we're in taking miss good ole nikkietutorials glow goals cuz that shit is blinding AF the she is wild like this is wild okay hmm I'm playing this with a more p.m. to 10 brush you guys knows like when my favorite brushes of all time now we are done with I officially I'm gonna go ahead and do some eyeliner and lashes off of camera now be right back and we'll finally talk about the verdict of this palette whether or not I think this is you guys so this is the final look I have everything on right now I added a little bit of Mac reflex pearl on the center of the lid just to give it a little bit more of a pop and a little bit of Midnight Cowboy by Urban Decay on the inner corner just for a little bit more of a glittery moment and Anasazi honey on the lips stunning looking fuckin pretty the eyes are done Oh Lily lashes Miami on the eyes and yet guys so I finally have the verdict we are done with this entire video what do I think of B Kylie cosmetics blue honey palette honestly guys this is a total hit for me I think it's really really nice I think the quality is great the shimmers are really nice the mats are really nice and I really like that they did five mats for shimmers it's actually funny because you look at it the four edges like north east south west are all shimmer and the five other ones that going in like a diagonal like an X are all matte I think that's kind of cute I don't know I think that right now they blended very nicely they look really really pretty on the eyes I think they look turnout fucking sickening but is the Kathleen lights palette with color pop a do for this palette honestly I would say it is if you guys are interested in the Kylie palette which is a great quality and you guys want to buy it because it's a Kylie's brand and you love her shadows amazing please go out and buy it if you guys want to but if you guys do have the dream Street collab by Kathleen has color pop and you guys have these shades already you can definitely achieve a look very similar to this with the Dream Street palette so all in all the Kylie panel is great the color palette is really great I just wanted to do a little side-by-side comparison if you have the color pop one you don't really need the Kylie win and yeah I'm gonna go ahead out to my event right now I bitch spray this anyway I'm gonna go ahead out to my event I need to get dressed and get going as always have a great tonight or day wherever you guys are and I will catch you guys in my next video bye guys I love you come on star second video of the day feeling my fucking swirly intro commences you're not fuckin fat oh my god I need a ype eat my ass like it's fine let's just do the damn thing [Music] okay guys so this is the final look on the eye on the mouth on the face on the taint mmm she's feeling her oh honey 
hey guys welcome back to my channel so let's say this video I am so excited as you can see I'm kind of smiley and kind of giddy and just excited in general for this video because it is going to be a review first impressions demo on the new jaclyn hill eggs morphe collaboration palette this is what it looks like right here i swatched a couple shades not gonna lie i swatched a couple because they were so fucking pretty and they just looked like they were calling my name's i swatch like a couple i don't really know how to enact on my eyes yet if I have swatched a couple of shades and I'm very very much impressed so far so I'm really excited I'm just so proud of Jaclyn for creating this palette it is 35 custom shades it's not anything that morphe already has acting it's really cool that morphe let Jacqueline take the reins on this palette she'd been working on this for years and Moorefield just like it's okay we're gonna we're gonna it's gonna be worth it when it comes out because Jacqueline is a perfectionist and she is a hyper person works like yo if we're doing this we're gonna do it right that's one of the things I love about Jacqueline's actually worked so hard and worked so meticulously at creating products that she thinks you guys are going to love or that her followers are going to love and I love that I think that's really really important I'm the same exact way I think it's so important to feel like if you collaborate on something trying to make it the best thing that you can possibly possibly make it because people are buying it people are trusting your opinion people are trusting your name that's something that you're gonna fuckin love so I think that it's amazing that Jacqueline really put her heart and soul into this palette and so did morphe too much crazy just popped into my head right now is that Jacqueline a couple years back created that palette with morphe it was a favorite palette and it was just her favorite shades that morphe had and they put into a palette right so I remember years ago I reviewed that me and Jacqueline were not friends me I reviewed that on my channel and I thought it was a great palette that was wonderfully done I love the color scheme of that palette as well and that was the video that turned chocolate onto me and we became friends after that video because she saw it and she just thought how it was a really I guess sweet guy or something I don't know I'm I don't know so just funny that now jacket has a custom palette with more few years later and I'm doing another review on it and it's just like I just kind of came full circle to me like whoa Jacqueline went from like her favorite does her favorite shadows to like creating this custom palette with morphe it's just really cool it's just really really really cool to see so again congrats to morphe and jacqueline for this palette I'm very excited for you guys I think it's going to do so well I think it's gonna sell out so fucking quick so if you guys want to get your hands on it get it on the day launches please because I think it's going to move like a fuckin water you know water moves so yeah you guys that's what a speedo is going to be it's a full demo review first impressions it's going to be all of it combined using the new Jaclyn hill and morphe palette so as always if you guys like this video if you guys do not like me please don't fucking watching electro with that Koopa do but if you guys do like this video please subscribe to my channel if you're not already any for you new what's up a man um you a and welcome to my channel thank you so much for being here I really from the bottom my heart appreciate you guys watching my videos allowing me to do what I love every single day so um yeah let's go again to this review and demo of the new at Jaclyn hill x morphe collaboration palette okay so let's go that you talked about a little bit about the palette first before we starts watching before I start playing with it on our right so this is the pot right here 35 custom shades tons of maths tons of metallics tons of shimmers just a sickening as looking palette like I'm ready to play so there are 35 shades in here all of them are custom shades and it's going to retail for $38 so that's basically like a little bit over a dollar per shadow and you can use affiliates codes on this palette you can use Jacqueline's code you can use my code Manny MUA and stores are online and you play that you guys like and that you trust user code why the fuck not user code and it launches next week on Wednesday I believe it's the 21st of June and after the palette comes out so if you guys noticed here the palette does not have any names of the shadows on it it is a cardboard palette and not like they're morphe plastic ones that they usually have but it came with this really really cute little thing which actually shows the shade names I mean I can tell because the lighting is pretty bright but it shows the shade names of each color on it so while I would love to have had the palette have the names on the actual palette to see what I'm going in with and know the color name usually there's not enough space on these kind of paths because they're so compact with colors and there's just not enough room for names so I think that's really genius that they created this little paper to show the shade name so I thought that was one fucking Jean yeah so I have no makeup on my eyes stay because I want to do a full fucking tutorial first I wanted to swatch them the colors I just kind of spoke to me if you guys want to see a full in-depth swatch like crazy madness of swatches go watch Jack on this video I will leave it linked down below if you guys want to hear it more about the backstory of this palette I'll leave a link down below and you guys wanna see more like arm swatches and things like that so we're going to swatch marry here it feels wonderful whoa like that feels amazing let's watch this one ridiculous let's watch this one let's I could do up this like a dual chrome shade right there as you can see right there let's watch this gold I really want to use that gold right there I really want to use this color Oh let's watch this pretty burnt burgundy swatch swatch swatch oh my god Wow a swatch and swatch holy fuck they swatch hella bomb um hi so we have the shins right we have five sheets right there let's watch the purple fuels amaze let's watch the blue kind of bouncing have it I now in the dark blue let's do this really pretty mint and let's swatch this really pretty taupe right next to it it feels great so we have these five here's the topi one here's other for the swatch I'm right above this wow yeah and we have a couple more swatched right here this is the five shades underneath honestly truly I am very much blown away with how beautiful the pigmentation is and how smooth the shadows feel the mattes holy fuck the matte transition shade felt amazing oh so soft so buttery okay so we are now primed and ready to go it's not as far as I can zoom in by the waist a lot people do ask me to zoom in farther in what I'm doing I looks and guys this is as far as I can zoom in my camera is a cross on the table and I don't have a different lens um maybe one day when I get like a person that can help me film and edit my videos I can get to a level where I can do fucking close-ups of this alright now I don't know how to blow down I'm not not gonna it just yeah so this is as far as I can go in for you guys I can try to lean in as much as I can but um for clarity and like for being as clear as I can with the lighting this is as far as I can go in just letting you guys know so you guys let's go and get into this video I decided I really want to do a fun like golden eye with a really warm burgundy in the crease just something really fun and pretty and very fall even though weren't summer because recently I've been using a lot of balloons and a lot of like really pretty cool tones so right now I want to use a little bit more of the warm tones because warm is my favorite color I'm gonna go in with a morphe 27 any blending brush a fluffy one will work fantastically for this I just love this one personally because it's so soft it picks up product beautifully and blends beautifully as you can see very pretty fluffy brush I'm gonna take the color silk cream on a brush right here it's already packed it on put this into the Christian see how it works okay honestly it's fucking stunning so first impressions right now I'm never seen at these shadows are blending so seamlessly like truly so now I'm gonna go in oh my god taste there's so many fucking shades it's like crazy it's awesome okay now I'm gonna go in with the shade butter this is what it picks up like right here take a much warmer version of SIL cream set into the crease we're going to pile it in and see how it blends with the other shin dude this is why I love that for suppressions is that like literally I'm using the product and it's blending seamlessly and you can see it on the camera that it's blending so nicely there's like no way to lie in this so for all those bitches are gonna be like oh my god you're fucking only saying that because it's chocolate and she's your friend and your morphe affiliate like no actually uh the product just applies beautifully and you can literally see it on my eye and see how pretty applies so for those people are gonna come for me being like oh my god you're biased because you're her friend indebted I'm like honestly if I got the palette was gonna be bad I wouldn't film with it I'm a Thai person works like I do will not talk shit about a collaboration like I will not talk bad about a cloud I think it's really bad karma and I just can't because I've collab and I know how much how much hard work and how much heart and soul goes into it I would be really devastated if someone was like online a big youtuber with online talking shit about my club I'll just be like wow man like I thought it was gonna be good you know so I never talked bad about collabs I just won't show them if I don't like them because they're having clouds I've been that have came out that I've been sent to me that I just did not like at all I just never talked about them I just told myself like no I'm not gonna talk about this because I'm not gonna ruin their day I like talking shit about collaborations is like taboo in the beauty world like I will not do it nope and say what you will about that I really literally don't give a flying fuck but I will not talk about collaboration if I do like it so the reason I'm even filming this is cuz I thought I was going to like it and honestly so far I'm so pleased like truly I like these so far I'm honestly really liking this more than like normal morphe shadows like these are better so far like they blend so nicely there if they feel like butter on the skin like truly they're fucking sweet now I'm gonna take a little bit of Roxanne and Jax which are both matte shades as well they're very very very warm I'm gonna put that into the crease a little bit lower do you see that fucking big me hey do you see that shit like honestly with all the way into that increase because I'm going to be doing a gold lid anyway so is what we have so far easy as fuck to blend I'm taking a little bit of chip where's like a deep chocolatey super super super deep chocolatey Brown sounds like a plumage Brown it's pretty deep I'm going to Pat that in the outer corner right now the corner right out here just really deepen everything out a little bit I'm going for more of a smoky sultry look so far I'm honestly so impressed because I've only used the mats and the mats have been absolutely amazing very impressed so far stoked about that so now I'm gonna take a morphe emic - 10 inches to go really easy flat just packing brush for shadow and I'm gonna really pack on the shade Queen which is the gold shade I've been really wanting to put this on my lid so bad I'm going to Y a little bit of it for intense extra Ness because we all know mommy's a little extra the goal has a little bit of Fallout but hey those hyper pigmented shades they always have fallout so uh don't mind that at all look at that lid oh my god that is so fucking pretty okay next night and this is what we have so far on the top of the lid and honestly I'm blown away I'm so happy that it turned out to be like what I wanted to be I wanted it to be sickening I wanted it to be amazing and truly I am so happy that it is it's turning out to be exactly what I was hoping it to be which is sick nasty so now let's do the lower lash line I'm going to do is very similar to the top of the lash line and take that same silk cream and butter and run that underneath the lashes and I'm using on that same morphe r39 brush because I join into a quick easy blend and then I'll focus it with smaller brushes after I'm done with this transition shade you can see I love the rose gold collection from morphe they're absolutely amazing this r39 brush is so good if you need like a good dupe or I got Mac 217 this is the bitch to do it with it's like tapered white haired picks up product really nice and it deposits very very nicely so I'm gonna take a little bit of more of a Jack's on a morphe 35o win because I want to do a different color there and now with that same brush I used to pack on everything I'm gonna take a be shade cran-apple which is a really pretty intense foiled cranberry shade I'm gonna put that right here against that Jacks shade and I brighten everything up a little bit more and now for the inner corner we are going to take in light which seems like a very pretty highlight e-type shade on a morphe m32 six perfect for packing on the inner corner and a brow bone highlight I'm going to highlight the inner corner with this just give you a night ooh that is just bright we're gonna really just lightly pop that bad bitch in look at the difference come on and light and lighten my ass calm down I'm gonna take a smidge a smidge onto the brow bone taking Marc Jacobs eyeliner in the shade rokoko right waterline okay guys so we have the eyes completely done and I am absolutely in love with this look this is like if I can do this every single day I would but I'm trying to be different for YouTube you know try to do like different looks so I'm gonna go apply my lashes and eyeliner off of camera and I'll be right back so I went ahead I applied some lashes and liner on for camera and I put on a lip stick as well this is a new summer collection from Kylie in the shade and naked it's very very pretty shade I love this fucking nude into a good nude man like you know I love a good Newt and of course I'm wearing the Kim tie lion-hearted lashes because these are maybe really looking long this is the final look you guys [Music] and that's at you guys that's it for the entire video abuse had fun watching so what is my final verdict on the palette do I think it's worth it or not is a hit or miss is it worth the price for the palette and my honest true opinion is that I do think that it's worth it I think that the price point is fantastic especially when you can use an affiliates discount code to get you another four dollars off basically the palette for 35 custom branding shades for 34 bucks I think that is unearthly I think it's fantastic and I can't really tell the difference between this palette and a normal morphe palette I love normal morphe palettes I really truly do I think that they work fantastically but this one I like even more the textures are even better and I was like wow they really really fucking stepped their shit up like they were not kidding when they said they were really stepping it up for this palette and I completely completely agree I think the eye turned out to be so freakin pretty and honestly you guys if you guys have the money how definitely check it out you guys want it buy it I think it's gonna sell pretty quickly because this palette is fire as always I'll leave everything I use in tanks video basically just the brushes linked down below and yeah I think that's it for me I'm gonna head out to my event right now I gotta go to a dinner really quickly as always have a great use of the night or day wherever you guys are

hey guys welcome back to my channel so today's video is going to be a continuation on from the first video I just uploaded a couple days ago unboxing a bunch of PR makeup we're going to continue on with the second part of this video but yeah you guys let's get into this a full tutorial excited to try this thing we have a lot of new goodies I want to try out today so I'm very very excited about that if you guys have not seen the video prior to this one I will leave it linked down below of course as always if you guys like this video if you guys do not like me please don't  watch it you know the Jo with that you don't have to watch me if you don't like what you guys do like this video please subscribe to my channel if you're not already and if you're new what's up a mani MUA and welcome to my channel thank you so much for being here I really genuinely appreciate it from the bottom of my heart thank you for allowing me to do what I love to do every single day of my life so yeah you guys let's going into this full face of using PR makeup so of course when you're doing an unboxing you don't really know where you're going to get so the things that I do not have I'll be using things I already have in my collection to compensate for like for example I didn't box any brow products so I'll be using like my own brow products I want to use so just get you guys taking weight that's not new I didn't unlock something new in that category so that's why I'm using it ok so let's lay this makeup let's make this bitch last all day um you guys want do anything about your pores going to use a little pore filler in the t-zone so I'm gonna do I'm gonna take a little bit of the benefit Porefessional in the t-zone real quick I'm keeping the facial hair going strong right now guys I don't know why I just feel like why not my skin feels real good right now okay so let's go ahead and start off with the foundation that we unbox in the last video this is the Smashbox Studios skin that's shaping a foundation so we're gonna take the shade 1.1 I don't know it's my shade we'll see honestly guys I'm pretty I'm pretty sure this is my shade you guys know I like to usually go a little more tan you all know me mommy likes to be real next it's very pigmented on the ski it feels very very lightweight does it feel intense whatsoever so we're gonna use a little kicking big sponge and we're going to press that into skin you can see how this looks this definitely does not give a lot of coverage which is really weird beside darkness mm give me a lot more coverage how weird okay so I actually um don't like this foundation so far I don't think that it looks really pretty on my skin I think it actually really besides my texture a lot and I'm not not very happy with the look of this so we're going to apply some Dewar air flash on top just really try to help the situation that we're in right now crazy I'll just a little layer of dirt flash makes such a difference uh-huh can always trust you or to really come do for me morphe and 4:39 and do our flash coming in clutch as they always have for me don't have a new concealer so we're gonna do is I'm gonna take a little bit of my current obsession conceal this is the NARS soft matte I don't put that underneath the eyes I love this come see the right now so much conceal don't feel don't let oh no okay so I get to hand with the conceited because we do want to use the Kim Kardashian contour so it's sealed in this little time stick packaging and we got these little plastic e to me they feel really cheap and very lightweight not really a huge fan of how they feel the brush again also feels very cheap and lightweight I like the brush end this one is a little rough feeling for me so we'll see how this works out just because I like Kim Kardashian and I was invite to her event and I got these products for free does not mean that she's exempt from me being real and honest that's just how I've always been to me I think that these feel kind of cheap and I feel like they feel lightweight and I think they could have done a lot better with them and this is all the products that you get in it honestly I'm kind of shocked I just feel like for that mounts out these were I believe it was like $42 or something along those lines or like 40 something dollars I just feel like there should be more product in you there's my this is my personal opinion well let's go and try it out and see how it actually acts on the face and see hey maybe it works really nice me never I don't know I've never tried it so I'm gonna go in swipe this bad boy on okay so it's a nice cool toned color it's pigmented definitely let's try this sign I know a lot of people have uploaded videos on this and I haven't watched any of them because I don't want to be biased by the way this decide one so let's do the nose I really get into that ring I use too much oh no we'll see we zoom y'all in a little more so we can see hello I'm close okay so we're going to use this guy and so for this one I just feel like for me I like to buff with these kind of brushes so let's see how this reacts buff and press in buffing for us in nice I feel like the product totally blended out like nothing like really easily for me which is awesome great let's keep going with the brush side it's definitely blending there's no denying it and with this guys I am blending an upwards motion with the Kabuki brush I'm just lightly patting on rather than swiping I think swiping will give it a more streaky appearance this Park isn't pigmented enough to like where you can swipe it and it'd be there you definitely need to really concentrate on keeping the product down highlight numero uno so we're gonna go ahead and use this to highlight the center right here so now let's go ahead and blend it with this little blunt end right here and press this ya know so the sponge side is a complete flop for me guys are not gonna like this one side I'm telling ya I am telling y'all but the cool thing about it is that it really does give a brightening effect it definitely works I definitely feel like it's brightening up my skin I'm also noticing that the highlighting shade is actually a lot harder to blend out then the contouring shade and this will be a guys this is what we have with the highlight and contour stick you can guys can definitely tell that I am contoured I am highlighted here I think you really need to work in finagle the product to actually work on you know T no shade at all I still love Kim Kardashian I still think she's an amazing amazing businesswoman who's gonna set my face guys really quickly with our cement powder I just like for me personally it's not the most practical product to use and it's kind of hard to use and there's not enough product in it and I think it's a little bit too expensive so that's just my personal opinion so now we're taking another little new guy we're gonna take a morphe eetu and the makeup geek bronzer in the shade light fair fair skin bronzer so I'm gonna put that on the temples right over the contour that I went in with oh that's a beautiful color oh honey just see that home before our just like just sun-kissed oh girl I like that that's so pretty it's a little more warm that I thought I was going to translate on the skin but I'm not mad it's so pretty you guys let's take some blues let's take some blues I'm gonna take this shade right here in V Becca and Chrissy Teigen collection I don't wanna form is gonna lightly press that over the apples of the cheeks just give me a little flesh that's a really pretty color Becca has some really really nice blushes honestly like you cannot knock their blushes now it's going with some highlighter oh the cheeks were looking snacks guys I'm really really enjoying this cheek we're joined this cheeky Miss I'm gonna take the Bobbi Brown sunkissed glow highlighting powders awesome take I'm gonna go right in the center right here on a morphe r-36 we're gonna do a nice little coat okay guys and the base is done this is what we have so far I think I'll live it turned out to be really really really nice I think the only thing I didn't really enjoyed that much was the Smashbox stick foundation I just thing that I didn't work on my skin type specifically but everything else worked really nicely I love the highlighter I love the blush palette I loved the setting spray of course gonna Navy had one for you girl okay guys I'm gonna go ahead do my brows off of camera because I have no new brow products and I will be right back so like I said earlier in the last video I wanted to try they make a favor aqua XL color paint as a base this is in the shade 150 and I'm gonna use it as an eye primer I said I mean it's waterproof it says it's a primer and I'm prime my eyelids with it and then see how my Prime's wanting it a real bright base up in this pitch aren't we yeah okay so I just noticed I got to work kind of quickly with this one because it dries pretty fast so work quickly okay guys so I have to do it I have to go home with this palette because it's just so pretty and I want to use one of those like new English a doe so I'm gonna go in with OH I'm gonna go on with the shade buffed on a morphe 27 of course I'm just gonna use a shade a buffed and buff that all over the crease wave ones really I mean this is blending really nicely over this aqua color now I'm take a little bit of the shade at tanlines which is this more cool toned brown on the e22 nothing to go a little bit lower cool tone oh girl she's really going in I think for the crease we'll keep that this so far we'll see we'll see how we feel this is a very just kind of going with the motion tutorial it's very just kind of go with the flow we'll see what we like to see we want my would you like to come and get appearance Erin yeah I'm regretting which one do you like more come on which one do you think is best come on you literally have the beat this is what it looks like you have to beat it on the same and like interference I just put a hand out guys I'm not my brother pick which one he thinks is cool to go to for the top of the lid on my purple is the one that's calling to me the most what do you think you agree purple it is we're going to be taking the shade 17 shade 17 huh gosh like a cut crease with day why not these are going on so smooth nothing butter we'll see how these act will see if they crease on me or not but so far I think it looks so good they feel a little sticky on the eye though umm like they feel sticky I don't know I feel like they're gonna crease how do you like that little bit right there is creasing so um you see that yeah the skin okay but it is drying cuz it's not coming up that much on my finger so that's a good sign so let's just really make sure that dries down so let me take a little bit of in the spotlight on a more feet M 4 to 1 and we're put that on the inner corner to brighten everything up and give it almost like a pinky hue and if you're scared of creasing like me go ahead and just kind of take up that in the spotlight a little bit farther on areas that might crease just to set it a little bit better let's take a little bit of that Brown aqua XL liner it's a very beautiful warm brown and now taking that same tan line shade I'm gonna go ahead and put that on the lower lash line this is very cool tone for me but I don't hate you need I'm actually really enjoying this Peter so we have Safari I think I want to do like a white liner I don't know I'm feeling festive aqua excel in the shade white okay let's try this little white liner let's try this and see if this actually works let's see if this will work see yes pretty pigmented so so we have so far guys the white liner totally worked it totally went on just fine by our dollies are just not trying to go over a liner because it does dry matte so it's kind of it'll pick up a little funny if you try to do it so that's what it looks like so far I'm gonna finish the other eye off of camera I'll be right back I'm so sorry so what I ended up doing is I added a little bit of a black liner underneath it just to give it more definition because I just feel like sometimes with white liner it's really easy to lose the appearance of a winged liner to it so I always just add a little touch of black to it always and I'm wearing the lashes from flutter lashes in the shade intoxicating and they are every thing so I won't go and do the lips and we'll be done and I'm thinking a new lip is definitely what we're gonna do Jeffrey star and I think the shade Perkins suede will be amazing look at this freakin chrome package in God's brownie we think of that so this is really really nude on me god damn that's nude bro I'm gonna take a little bit of Mac spice to go around the lip just for a little bit of definition around the lips you can actually see my lip [Music] and this is the look with a little bit of spice added to the Birkin suede you guys already know I'm like that bitch when it comes to nude lips I love a good new lipstick it's my favorite I had to keep the focus on the eyes and a nice neutral lip and this is what we have and that's it you guys it that's it for the entire video hope you guys had fun watching VI you guys that's it for the entire makeup tutorial using

from colour-pop things from morphe things from the drugstore and so that so today's video is going to be I have a couple new items here that I would love to also incorporate into this video but first oh my god I'm so I'm so excited but first I want to talk about something really quickly I'm doing in the month of October so at the end of the week of every week of October I'm going to be doing a giveaway and I'm so excited because okay guys and the reason I'm doing this is because I'm not the biggest like Halloween tutorial person I'm not really good at doing that kind of stuff I never really learned how to do any nut stuff a lot of you guys do know that I am like YouTube taught like in the beginning I didn't really know how to do makeup for a long time I didn't even start playing with makeup till I was like 21 22 so I don't really know tons of things about like Halloween makeup or special effects or face painting and none of that stuff so I always feel kind of bad in the October time because I feel like I'm not like giving you guys what you guys want and I always feel guilty I don't know why it's just a good personal thing I'm always like man I'm not like good at that stuff so I get a little down on myself so what I decided to do in the month October is do this giveaway I'm going to be giving away an iPad or a MacBook Air so these two guys are gonna be in giveaway so I bought two iPads I bought two MacBook Airs so on Sunday the 8th I'll be announcing who wins the I pad Pro and you guys this is the easiest giveaway ever all you have to do is we subscribe to my

right here floating in the air this is my snapchat handle follow it and we will but okay guys that is enough of babbling going on for two days video I'm gonna go get started let's go ahead and do this fall tutorial using all budget-friendly so let's go and get started on two days of video first thing source we're going to prime our skin I don't really have a drugstore or budget-friendly equivalent for a primer you guys know a primer that you guys love from the drugstore or just one that's a little bit more budget-friendly let me know in the comments bar below but for now I'm going to be using the morphe prep and set setting spray this is a prepping and setting spray so I'm gonna prep the skin this is back in stock so I'm like bitch I'm gonna use it love love love this setting spray I love that it's such a fine mist I also love the fact that it keeps my makeup on a lot longer when I am using it and of course when I'm using it to prep as well and you guys know of course I am an affiliate with more if you can use my code man emu and all caps in store online if you guys want to save some coin on some more free stuff I do have a couple more few items into these videos so I wanna let you guys know I'm gonna Philly with them I try not to push too hard about it but I do like to let you guys know that I am a morphe affiliate it's not like I'm putting my code on a hoodie so I grabbed these are the two like cost-efficient foundations that are probably my favorite these are the Maybelline matte and poreless fit me and I have the Milani conceal and perfect two-in-one foundation okay this is in the shade too natural like literally one of the lightest shades and it's a little bit too dark for me and it's so annoying that's the I like the finish of this one more than I like to finish up this one I feel like I'm gonna look really yellow with this but let's just try it bitch okay a little bit of that because we're gonna do the Maybelline we're gonna do Maybelline matte and poreless in the shade 130 and I'm taking on a more feet why is 6 this undertone is a lot more neutral I feel actually really really really like this one it's super pretty I'd like the coverage of the Milani one a little bit more I like to go ahead and apply this kind of foundation too with a dense kabuki brush cuz it really builds up the coverage a really nice lean spot this is still like too dark for me or whatever y'all bitches NoHo I'm ok with using darker from Nisha it just it is annoying though because I feel like it's really hard to match at the drugstore like that's when I have a problem matching my foundation so I don't like ever really like to open it we're gonna take this down the neck - we have to because look at that difference Jesus I will make it a point to go out and buy more foundation shades from the drugstore how's it feel like Maybelline has such a great range of shades in their fitting collection you'll have to do the matte and poreless you just do the normal fit me and it's not as mattify as this one is not saying this is super mattifying cuz I still look like I look pretty skinny he's gonna like so now a for affordable concealer we have the Maybelline master conceal you guys this is my favorite drugstore concealer that I have found so far other than the Maybelline fit me that one's pretty cute too but this one is more coverage so I'll just take a little dollop this is in the shade of light by the way and I'll take my little what is that drop running down that is disgusting okay we're just gonna apply some concealer over that because I really feel disgusted right now you guys if you guys not have tried a foundation or concealer or use something in a little bit of a while don't forget to shake it it could be separated in the tube or in the bottle yeah yes you guys hate that okay you guys what I like what the concealer is that gives you such a nice amount of coverage it's more of a medium to full coverage Mabley and I just feel also does really good concealers they have that other one that has like that little puff ball at the end of it I don't like that one personally it's not my kind of concealer that I like I'm more of a fit me and the studio kind of girl a lot of people love that cute little like better lord I don't know what the - it's called honestly I'm taking this on my little Real Techniques Beauty sponge you can find this in the drugstore as well it's such a great alternative to the Beauty Blender just as soft and just as squishy and literally one-fourth the price so okay now that we're concealed and looking like you're looking kunti so now we're gonna do is we're gonna go and take the wet and wild contouring palette contour Dusen legit that's what it's called it's Lulu civilian chick I want to take this highlighting shade and we're going to go and really saturate our brush and set underneath the eyes because I don't really have a loose setting powder that I want to use from the drugstore or more of a cost-efficient alternative not really big we're just gonna set we're just setting right now I used to actually really not like this powder at all I use like not the biggest fan I was like why is everyone living for it I give it another try and I actually really really really like it I think with makeup in general like you guys really need to continue to give things a try like I tried this the second time and I liked it a lot more than I liked it the first time so maybe if you guys try something you don't love it the first time just give it a second go this is a expensive brush we're not gonna talk about this we have an alternative this is the Wayne Goss 0-2 brush this is super super super super expensive but we have the morphe alternative which is the e 48 very very very similar the Wayne Goss one is just a little bit fluffier literally the exact same thing as the Wayne Goss one I just had the wing cause one in my hand so because of the matte and poreless foundation kind of sets itself it is a mattifying foundation I'm just gonna take whatever is left on the little I'm just gonna run it over some spots with the face this is like so we can avoid having to using a whole entire different setting powder when we're on a budget sometimes you just don't have an excess powder to Hugh's you know I'm saying but guys very very little amount of it because you don't use too much because it will like highlight your entire face and that's not what year we're going for it I'm gonna take that same dupes elaichi and I'm gonna take that contouring shade I want to take the morphe y9 favorite contouring brush ever put that into the hollows of the cheeks to really give us that nice contour look but not being too intense just a little like some some take a little bit on the temples as well there's a really make sure it all looks really cohesive and nice and if you guys want to bronze I just did a little bit of contouring right now if you want a bronze you guys totally can I'm gonna take the Physicians Formula butter bronzer which is my favorite bronzer from the drugstore I absolutely love it on a more feet eetu is great for bronzing it's great for powder any kind of powder application this is fantastic I'm going to little quick little one too you know everything just make sure everything is blended seamlessly between the bronzer and the contour shade if you guys do not want to do this up it's totally fine you can keep it at just the contour but I do like how the Physicians Formula bronzer does give me a little bit more of a warmth to my face a little cheating trick take that a little bit of that under-eye powder that we use from wet and wild just cleans it up a little bit underneath that contour okey nothing crazy it just gives a little bit more of an enhanced look so now we're going with some blush we're gonna take the Milani Luminoso blush I haven't used it so  long holy on a morphe for it's just a beautiful pretty peachy pink blush has a little bit of Sheen to it nothing too crazy though it's not something where you're like overwhelmed like highlight all over and I feel like this blush blends so nicely as well I also just wanted to do a dab of this I've not tried this yet I just kind of want to show you guys on camera what it looked like this is the color pop pressed powder cheek in the shade take a little dab but I wanna see what this looks like on the skin just a little bit just oh she paid with you oh okay well I will figure out what the name of this is don't worry and I will leave it linked down below I trying to get my cheek a little bit more of a pinky pop this is colored pop this is $4 it's such a huge amount there's six grams of product in here I think that's really really great just the way it goes on the skin I bet it will wear really really really nice so now we're gonna go and highlight the skin and I've been this so excited this is the Maybelline master chrome highlighter I've used this once on my channel before I think it's amazing I've used it many time iving in tub I've dipped into this bitch so many times that they have just talked about it once it's so beautiful I'm like Maybelline really it's like y'all bitches wonder if I can really comfortably so we're taking this on a morphe m 510 which is done really really really nice it'll highlight new brushes really great really compact like I'm sorry but for the drugstore bitch like come on from the waist uh bitch whatever I get like so hyped about makeup I get so like Kirsty I apologize for that it gets me so hyped like I get like I want to just scream mmm are you kidding like I'm sorry but this truly to me is like the prettiest drugstore highlighter that I've ever used other than the Wet n Wild highlighters which I love so much too we are using the budget-friendly items but we are going to look snatched to the  ground and we are not gonna look budget that's we're sure I guaran-fucking-tee we ain't gonna look like we own a budget can we contour my nose a little bit I'm not scared though cuz I use a specific color for my nose contour always and take this and use it to control my nose man and we're taking that on a morphe brush I don't know exactly what brush this is I just really like it for nose contouring because it's tapered but it's really fluffy I think it's part of the rose gold collection I'll figure it out and I'll put a link down below that's pretty good if I say so myself taking that same morphe setting spray gonna do another one too so we just finished off with the khadiyah and I think it looks super super snatch I think that we did a really really great job at picking budget-friendly items to do the complexion I think it looks beautiful it literally looks like I'm wearing high-end foundation high-end everything other than this blush I've worn everything else on my face and I think it looks beautiful and I know alas and I see on the skin so let's go ahead move on to the brows and the eyes now we would go ahead and continue on with this tutorial this is what the face looks like up close you guys this is what she looks like she's feeling her  oats now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go on and move on to the brows and I'm gonna do one brow on camera or at least like more of a sped up like version of my brow on camera and I really want to talk about this product really quickly because I have uses for and I actually really really like it this is the new morphe micro brow pencil it is $5 I've never found a cheaper alternative to a brow product than this one for five bucks and it actually works really nicely I will say that the Anasazi brow Wiz is a little bit better I do like it a little bit for sure I think that for someone on a budget five bucks for a brow pencil that's so fair but I will notice that these do dry out a little bit faster than the other brow pencils that I have do so make sure that you do keep the cap and cap it because they will dry out a little bit quicker I'm going to start to coat the brow I'm taking the shade mocha by the way there's a couple shades for it product is going down really nicely consistency wise it does remind me more of the Anastasia brow is like it's not too creamy but it's not too dry either and how I like to do my brows I like to start at the bottom base of my brow and then build from there of a major sparse area right there I like to fill that in I could definitely go dark with the rub pencil but I kind of like that it's lighter I have to go like multiple cloves in my brows I'll do like a dark brows sometimes where I'll go lighter with the brow like right now I feel like I'm going really light with the brow and then the spoolie here is great just gonna go ahead and spoil you that oh there you go we have one brow on another brow I'll be right back I'm gonna finish the other brow off of so now we're going start on with the eyes I'm gonna be taking that same master conceal concealer and we take a little bit and that's gonna go on our eyelids as our eye primer and we on a budget bitch we don't ain't got no time for I price we're gonna run that all over the eye up to the brow bone to finish off with the brow I went ahead and I use that same concealer and I line at the bottom of my brow with some concealer just to make it look a little bit more sharp we're gonna take that same wet-and-wild highlighting shade we're going to press that on to the lid just set the concealer in place a little bit of concealer guys goes a long way okay guys so let's go ahead and start on the eyes now I'm actually really really excited to be doing this because I'm going to be using the new morphe 35o 2 palette so morphe acquired investors and so now everything is kind of I just feel like everything's vamping the presentation of everything is ramping up they just changed their logo out now it's this so we're gonna try the morphe 35o 2 and i just grabbed 35 out just to compare for you guys just to see cuz I know a lot of you guys are asking me to use the 35 oh so if I vote - it's  beautiful we have the 3500 right here which of course is also beautiful to see we're gonna both in the frame you can definitely tell that they are sisters they're not twins but they're definitely definitely sisters the 3502 is a lot more warm than 35 oh so if you're into really warm intense shadows that are just like a lot more like Bava Bomi which I am then I think you will really really like 3502 so and I believe it to be the same price 35 shadows for $22 and I think that for this video when we're doing something that's a little bit more cost efficient and a little bit more budget-friendly I think that more fee pellets are fantastic and I really really really appreciate that about the brand that's why they're one of my favorite brands to be affiliated with so recently I have been doing fall looks the last too far looks I have done have been very like red and grungy and purple and using that goes intense fall color so Forte's we do I do something more orange II a little bit just different this shade here is just speaking to me bitch so first things first I'm gonna go in with this cute little transition right here on the top left corner on a more for a 20-7 really great blending brush I'm gonna put that into the crease or it's gonna go in guys we're just gonna go the in it's just one of those shades that's gonna be really good for a transition nothing too heavy just gonna make everything blend a little bit easier to like sense after Jacqueline's palette everything's been stepped up a lot like it really really has this feels more like Jacqueline's palette than any other palette I've ever tried from them but if I know of course is wonderful when I use that one so often but I already feel like this one's a little bit better like I really do mind you I'm only into one shade so I don't really know technically but that's just kind of like as I'm talking I'm just kind of talking out loud and sharing my opinion so far with you so I'm gonna going with this like little it's almost like a baby pukey shade I can describe it as really have no idea on a morphe r39 which is a great condensed blending brush it reminds me a lot of that like that Mac 217 style brush we're gonna do into the outer corner that is so pretty what's gonna run that all the way into the inner corner and then guys so when I'm on the outer corner of my eye because I do have this hooded lid action going on over here I tried to take it up a little bit higher and like fake the crease a little bit higher towards the end of my eye just so it looks like it's all like jus you know it means it's all like a long gated out here and I won't blend that out again with that you 27 just to give it a little bit more of a seamless blend so now we're gonna do guys we're gonna take this really pretty deep ass like maple red Brown this one was a little bit more fall out a little bit more powdery kickback than the other shades did so far just an observation that I did notice is on a morphic r39 its continuing on with that I don't put that a little bit lower than that original pukey shade right there the eye it blends and it looks just as nice as the other she did so are you mad at it if it's nice on the eye and it blends nicely he's gonna give a about fall out a little bit fall out nah so i'm swatching right now some colours for the lid to the floor I've been like gagging for it now these shades are here this one I feel that one makes me want to scream so now I'm gonna take that really pretty golden e-type shade and I'm gonna run that on the lid this one right here runs down the lid so this shade guys as I'm putting it on I notice that this one's a little bit more flaky then the other shimmery shades are I just notice it like right now but it's very very pretty on the actual eye yeah this is like one of those things that's like really flaky and that kind of stays on your finger I can't really explain it it's like hard to explain that kind of shape you're better off packing on then swiping but it looks sick on the eye mmm go ahead and wipe out the fallout I'm gonna try wetting the brush applying that same lit Jade a little bit over cuz I feel like some of it blended away I'm gonna see what it looks like when you do it wet yeah I feel like this shitty needs to be wet when you're applying it for sure okay so so far so good we have everything on the eye looks  beautiful on the high I'm so happy now we're gonna mix a couple of these shades guys we're gonna mix a like these two right here this guy over here we're gonna blend that underneath the lash line is part I feel like you don't need to be too like meticulous with on the morphe r41 or running it underneath the lash line more so on the outer corner and then blending a little bit in to the inner corners I do want to put that really pretty copper on the inner part of my eye you guys honestly I definitely see myself using this palette more I'm really really really excited about it that it just came out I believe that this bad boy launches on the 12th of October so it's actually coming up super super soon okay so now we're gonna take that same bronzy shade that I wanted to use we're gonna put that on the inner corner of the eye oh my god mm-hmm I'm banana morphe m2 ten now taking that same dark plumbing shade on the lower lash line that I took in the crease to make it deeper to give us some dips now I'm gonna teeth a little bit of that black I'm gonna put that on the outer corner holy okay we're taking out now more if you are 36 amazing pencil brush my favorite pencil but actually take a little bit into the crease really low though guys we're just really key to keeping it concentrated on the outer corner this gives a little bit of darkness on the outer corner but not make it look - like Gnarls Barkley you know I'm saying I'm genuinely very happy without looking right now I love how it looks taking a little bit more of that gold I have all my lid on the inner corner I'm gonna take that same black eyeshadow from the morphe 35o - palette on this morphe 43 great precision like lining brush I'm gonna take that and I'm gonna bring that along my top lash line in it to make it give me like a faux eyeliner look just give me a little bit of definition I'm doing like little pressing motions to really make sure the pigment gets down okay much better much better go and curl the lashes so I grabbed this little guy from Rimmel this is the shaky first clump free of Volume Mascara and you literally shake in the  bitch like shake weight to pull it out this is what the one looks like actually I'm not trying this if I really wanted to try this one this is one of those things we're trying on camera for the first time you guys indefinitely used your favorite drugstore mascara whatever works great for you amazing it says clump free of volume and I see literally no volume what I see club free I agree with the clump free claim oh she rub oh this is rough okay so the formula itself is a very very very liquidy if you blink too fast you will get it everywhere okay these my lashes have literally never looked worse I don't think I hated my Fuhrer I hate it that's a flop now ain't it we're taking Maybelline big shot because honestly I mean it's already from the first one but hopefully we'll give it a little bit of something sure just stuck with picture on the beginning now it's time for the lashes and I'm actually not going to be using a nice pair of lashes today usually when I'm doing drugstore videos I always use like a pair of like mink lashes from a brand that's like hi today I really wanted to keep it to doing something that's a little bit more affordable so I'm gonna be taking the faux mink ardell lashes from ardell these scheme will be found at the drugstore and I'm gonna stack two pairs because I need something I need some volume I need something I'm sorry so I'm just like to 811 I'm gonna stack the 812 together okay guys so I just literally try to put on those two pairs of Ardo wispies they were literally so animal and really really mad I didn't want to subject you guys to that so what I decided to do is grab the biggest ney aisle or luxe collection bronze Beauty lashes I'm gonna go and just take this pair of lashes instead and apply it because he looks so much these looks so much better okay and here we have the actual lashes on they're not like my favorite pair of lashes ever I'm really into really bold intense lashes like something that's a little more crazier than this but of course these are pretty and I think they're gonna look really really really nice on a lot of different eyes and a lot of different eye shapes so I think for the lip I'm gonna do something really really very and intense this is the new colour-pop ultra satin lip in the shade stud and this is from their new Holiday Collection coming up so I want to do this shade on the lip and see what we hang that's beautiful okay we're gonna do that I love their ultra satin lips oh oh she's filling her  oh it's bitch and that is it you guys that's it for today's entire fall to toriel using things that aren't as expensive as other options and I hope you guys enjoyed today's video this is the look is how it turned out to be if I can do anything and change anything it would be the lashes I would get a little bit more of an intense pair of lashes but other than that I think that the look turned out absolutely amazing and I think we did a great great job and I hope I did you guys some justice on it today's look if you guys want to see me using the morphe 35o two again or anything here in today's video again if you guys want to see another drugstore video let me know for fall and I would definitely make it happen do not forget to enter my giveaway that I'm doing all month of October all you need to do is you subscribe to my channel and follow me on snapchat to see who the winner is every single

Hey, guys. Welcome back to my channel.  So, today's video is going to be a tutorial on
this eye look I have going on right now. It's a really fun, pretty, dramatic,
halo eye, I would say. It's cute, it's fucking festive.
This is a fun look I came up with. I actually did a look like this very similar
maybe like three years ago on Instagram, and I was scrolling through my Instagram feed
a while back and I was like, 'Dude, this look is so pretty, I want to recreate it.'
So, I did a little bit of a recreation of it slash, like my own twist on it, with how I do make up now.
And I just think it's so pretty, it's so easy to do, honestly. I use like one palette for the whole like colour scheme.
I'm all about wearing bold colours on the eyes. That's actually my thing, like I love doing bold colours
on the eyes, and doing a really neutral, soft lip. I love that, and I know a lot of people always try to give
me slack for doing, like, the bronzy, smoky eye, that whole, like bronzy thing, which I love.
That's like my go-to when I go to events. Like that's like the prettiest to be photographed in,
and the prettiest for carpet and stuff like that. That's why I do it,
because it looks so pretty,  but I love to do things like this too, and I love
to experiment with colour and just do fun things and that's why I wanted to create
this video for you guys because I know a lot of you guys are into
colour and glitter, and dramatic, and glam, and that makes me so happy because that is a bitch
after my own heart. You know what I mean. As always, if you guys don't like
this video, if you don't like me, please don't fucking watch it.
You know the drill with that. But if you guys do like this video, please subscribe
to my channel if you are not already, and if you are new, what’s up, I’m Manny MUA, and welcome
to my channel. Thank you so much for being here. I don't know what that was. Let's get into
this beautiful mermaidy, halo smoky. What's up guys.  So, let's go and
get started on today’s eye video. I actually have no idea
what I want to do today. It's basically just going to be a get
ready with me on the eye look. I'm actually doing a first impressions on
a foundation that I'm wearing right now. Holy crap, Josea just jumped up here. I'm actually currently doing a foundation review right now,
which is why I have my base already on, so I'm just going to do the eyes in today’s video
and I wanted to do more of a bold eye look today, so usually those take a little bit longer for me
to accomplish. So, I'm already primed. I've been doing so many halo eyes recently and
a lot of people have been requesting me to film my halo eye tutorial, because I haven't
filmed one in, I don't know, like over a year, it's been a long, long time.
So, I'm going to do a fun halo eye today. We're just going to start right into it.
 I'm going to take a Morphe M505 and this is just a little fluffy brush.
Take this little palette by Smashbox,  it's a really fun colourful palette
which I thought was really pretty. Man, this is a cute ass palette,
and I like that it has all the brights in there.  And I believe they're pretty pigmented.
A little while ago, not a little while ago, this was like a couple of months ago, a lot of people
were doing sponsorships with Smashbox. A lot of them were using these Smashbox palettes,
and sponsorship posts, which is great, I mean, hell, yeah dude, get that fucking coin. 
So I’m gonna take the purple,  dude, pigmented, and I'm going to
put that into the crease. Mainly in just the crease portion, all the way
to the inner part of the eye as well. Holy shit, this is actually really pigmented.
 Aah, you look pretty. Okay. Honestly, I'm really impressed with pigmentation, so far.
Come on, little Smashbox pot, you're the bomb. I want this halo highlight to be
a little more on the colourful side, so that purple in the crease
would be fantastic. Ok, we've got the purple in the crease,
and now it's time to put in another colour. So now I'm going to go with that mint colour,
it's like that really pretty minty shade right here, on this little pencil brush.
Dang, ‘hella’ pigmented again. On a Morphe M574.  I'm just going
to go on my actual lid, in the corner. This is where we're going to at least starting
to do our halo into the crease a little bit. I'm like actually praying that this turns out somewhat cute,
because if it doesn't, I'm not putting this up. On a real note guys, I'm living for this colour.
This mint is so pretty, go a little bit into the crease as well, just to have it
there to mix in with that purple a little bit. Yeah. Leaving the centre completely
open, as you guys can see. Ah, that's pretty. Now I'm going to take a little
clean brush, and this is a Wayne Goss, 05. You don't need to use this brush.
 This is a very expensive brush, but I just have it because
it's a really small tapered brush, and I'm going to blend between that purple and that
mint shade, just so that's there a nice easy transition. They blend actually really
nicely together, which is great. Look guys, this is what you should have so far.
 Nice purple crease, mint on the lid, oh my God, that's so pretty.
 Fuck, who did that? So, I'm going to go ahead and continue on... I'm going
to take that same little brush that we were using, that little pencil brush.  I'm going to dip a little
bit into the darker blue, the bluer shade, and I'm going to add that on the most outer,
outer corner and inner corner of my halo eye. So, you can see right here,
where the mint meets the purple. I'm honestly, I'm only doing this to add
a little bit more depth to the halo eye, just make it a little bit darker. And on the inner
corner as well. Lightly, lightly. Okay guys, so I think I really like how the crease
and the eye is turning out so far. It looks very pretty. Very cute.  So now I'm going to take the
make-up geek pigment in the shade 'telepathic', which is a really pretty, golden-pink reflect. It's stunning,
and I'm going to put that on the centre of the lid. I'm just going to use my finger with the pigment,
because it's way easier that way for me And then I'm going to put it
in the center of the lid. I'm just going to blend with my brush, between.
And if you guys thought that was it, you thought wrong. I'm going to take these Stila magnificent metal
glitter shadow in the shade of 'diamond dust'. It's a really beautiful silver, but it has
a lot of pink and like golden reflect to it, so I'm like, that's going
on the center of my lid. Okay. In the centre of the center actually.
Like right there. To give it that extra, extra ‘ooomph’.
 Oh, that looks wet. Now taking that purple underneath the lash line,
I'm going to smoke it on the outer corner, right here. I'm actually going to take it all the way in. It's so pretty.
Dude, I'm a colourful little vixen tonight huh. Okay guys, now for the water line. I'm going to be
taking the colour pop pencil in the shade 'get paid' which is a really pretty rose, copper.
Wow, don't get too excited there, pencil. So, I'm going to put that into the waterline.
As you can see, it's a beautiful rose copper. Looking at the purple on the bottom lash line,
it's cute, I like it, I do.  But I don't love it. Grabbing a little bit more of the blue. So, I actually wanted to lighten
the water line a little bit, so I'm taking the tart nude pencil and lining
the water line to make it a little bit lighter. I think the lighter look is cute. Okay guys,
so for the final step of the actual look. This is what it looks like so far. I think it's turned out
so pretty, it's so cute, just like a fun look. I just love purple in the crease.
It just makes me geek, you know. I'm going to add a little bit of a gem down
here on my lower lashes, like right there. It's like a really cute trend going on right now,
adding a little gems on the lower lash line. I think it's adorable, so I'm going
to grab a little bit of lash glue and I'm literally just going to dot on lash
glue where I want the little gem to go. In the center of my eye, so right there, right there.
You do not even need to do this step. This is so excessive, but I'm filling my oats
right now, so whatever, a little gem. Cute as fuck though. Ok guys, so now I'm going to go ahead and apply
some lashes, some mascara, and I'll be right back. Ok you guys, and this is how the look turned out.
This is with liner, and with some lashes on. I wanted the lashes to be pretty bold, but not like crazy
bold where you couldn't see the actual eye make-up, because that's kind of what the point of
this look is and the little gems. I'm wearing the style ‘Bombay’ by Nubounsom
You can use the code ‘MannyMua’ if you guys want to. All good, you guys get to save 20% off
the lashes and they're absolutely beautiful. They're like a really intense flairy, wispy pair,
but there's a lot of separation in them, which is great for a look like this. There's a lot of lifting,
and it just looks really, really, really pretty. I'm not liking this foundation by the way.
The one I'm reviewing, I'm not liking it. Look how oily I am. Great.  Also on my lip, I'm wearing the
'nude potion' shade by ‘Nikkie tutorials’, and ‘Ofra’. Congratulations to Nikkie and to Ofra
for collaborating. That's so cool. They did an entire bundle of three
liquid lipsticks and a highlighter, and I've collaborated with Ofra before,
so I know how amazing the team is over there. Ofra, you guys are so sweet.
Congrats to Nikkie on this collaboration. This isn't the shade 'nude potion'. This is the shade
I'm wearing right now. This nude is so, nude, so if you guys are darker in complexion than
I am, you need to use a darker lipliner because this is really nude, like I'm talking like,
it's almost like white, with a touch of pink tossed in.  But it feels great, it's Ofra, so congratulations
again to you guys. That's so, so awesome. This is what the eyes look like up close,
a little bit closer. Let me put them in focus. Hey guys, that's it for the entire video.
I hope you guys had fun watching. I do have so much fun in creating these
halo eye looks. I think they're so pretty, and they're actually really
easy to accomplish, if you guys just kind of get the right motions
down and the right placement down, they're really easy.  Honestly,
they're easier than doing smoky eyes. And I hope you guys can recreate this look
if you guys want to, and if you guys do, please tweet me them,
and tag me in them. I love going on Twitter and seeing your guys’ recreations
of some looks and I love retweeting you guys, and you guys know that I'm so active on Twitter and
responding to you guys, and you guys are just the sweetest, and you guys make the craziest fucking weirdest memes
of me ever, and I love it and the gifts you guys make, you guys crack me the fuck up and I love it. So, thank you
guys for always being there for me and actually, like, sending me tweets, and liking my photos
and everything.  I talk about this all the time. I just do really genuinely appreciate it, so thank you
guys so much. I cannot thank you guys enough for it. It's the sweetest, you guys are the sweetest. Alright guys, everything I use and take

it's fucking stunning let's go and get this bad bitch like I just want to jump on in like like a big bump right here yeah literally jumped up at my face and clocked me on the nose if it looks a little broken right now I apologize and we're gonna dip into this palette right here we're gonna go into the shade right here which is called so I believe that this shade is twinkle and Stardust or is it magical instituting star or no it's opposite shooting star magical and taking the goddamn fucking orange Etan one okay I'm taking this I'm topping into the palette right here and you can see there is actually some fallout that comes out right here but I don't mind a lot of fallout like I've already told you guys before as long as it like the blend is there I don't mind fallout really yeah like I just think it's part of beauty it's a fucking powder so I'm gonna take that on a more feet r37 I'm gonna put that into the crease this is like a very like mustardy warm transition shade shades are blending literally so fucking well like they're amazing I mean colour-pop has their own single shadows of course and they are such high quality I love the single shadows as well like they really just kill it so far so good I think it looks beautiful it cannot wait to continue want to news have you guys seen the sinner I took a show on USA and it's with Jessica Biel you guys that show put me through it like truly I went through it with that show and I finished like all the episodes super fast zone like eight episodes I think and literally it's so fucking good I mean honestly you guys should watch it I'm just saying this is like a random side note like while I'm getting ready cuz getting ready like by yourself when you have no music playing is kind of boring so I'm just gonna chitchat with you guys so should I do mermaid boy on the lid this is this is the mermaid boys when I've been like looking at and I'm like mmm but I feel like I've been doing like a lot of that recently like that kind of shade on the lid I mean look at my Instagram and see what the fuck I've been doing let me go look because if I haven't that I'm gonna do it Oh see I just did something like that with the morphe palette on the 7th of November look at that see that shit hey Justin down on this 7 she's annoying I was gonna blow it out underneath my lash line but I just did something like that recently too but what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make it really really warm so I'm gonna take this really pretty Coco a shade which is I think called potion such a pretty really really really warm orange II read into Brown oh my gosh it's so pretty I'm taking this on a more if you are 39 brush by the way and we are gonna take this up into the crease I'm gonna take it all the way in because I'm gonna kind of make this little smokier pull this bitch out give me some fucking length oh this shade is much more powdery than the other shade was just send you guys know be careful because there is more kickback on this one as long as you guys are aware and you guys know what's gonna go on it sound good don't forget to like like this the blend is amazing they work so pretty on the eyes I'm so happy with this so far like truly I really really really am woah look at that crease the fuck so we have so far on the eyes really pretty crease shade down super warm super cont you guys I don't know what lynching to use is really in front of me this one do these four were here it looks stunning they feel stunning everything about it's stunning is it worth that right here hmm or watch I say fucking just going with murmuring point so beautiful I'm gonna have to I'm gonna fucking have to first off I love color second of all it's stunning on the finger I just like these kind of shades with you it's so beautiful like actually stunning there's so many IV lenses going on right now because there's so many fires happening it's so it's so devastating it's terrifying actually there's a little bit of fog so make sure you're using a packing brush for this bad boy or your finger like I said earlier looks good huh damn she looked good now I'm actually gonna take this really really chocolaty warm brown right here I'm gonna put that on to the outer corner just a deep and everything on to help connect duochrome shade with the transitions just it just helps like when you're adding a darker shade right here to merge the transition and that intense foiled shade it's hard to get that blend easy and seamless but I like to do is I added a really darker color between them so as you can see like the blend just gets a little easier okay so we got this down so far he goes do the bottom lash line really quickly I won't be good don't want to put blue underneath the lower lash line that cuz there's like that really beautiful like this guy right there under the lash line and just smoke that out I think I tau taking mix ardency in brown eyeliner really saturate that bitch go ahead and blend out that so that it doesn't set too quickly because we wanted to be a seamless blend so we're blending out that Brown and now it's going to take some of that blue really pretty like blueish sure looks like a peacock whoa is so much more pigmented I thought was gonna be holy shit we're gonna go ahead and set the brown with that blue be careful with this a crisis because it is so pigmented it gets like it gets like really that can get dirty real quick so just be careful damn and this is our eye so far you guys I'm gonna go in apply some eyeliner and finish off of this eye off of care I'll be right back okay guys so here we have the I we are completely done I just added some lashes and some eyeliner I'm wearing Lily lashes at Miami I applied a little bit of highlight right here in the inner corner and on my brow bone and that's all I've done off of camera so now let's go ahead and get into the why even do lips actually I'm gonna go ahead and swatch the shades that I did not use on my eyes today I should I can show you guys so we have this really pretty cool toned Brown over here is what she looks like right here I'm gonna go and swatch it on my arm so you guys can see and I'm just gonna literally do a full like arm swatch I didn't use this bronzy copper this guy didn't use and here you have the other shades that I did not use in the palette you guys right here I did not use one two three four five six seven shades from the palette these are them right here this one's like a really like like a soft satiny shimmer it's hard to see on camera this one was actually I

hey guys welcome back to my channel so today 0 is going to be another review video I am currently pre filming right now because I'm going to be going out of town for a while like 2 weeks basically so I'm presuming doing a lot of random ass things so today as you can see from the title I'm going to be reviewing these little mermaid tail brushes these are going viral online a lot of you guys have been asking me to review them I'm assuming these are like more like for contouring brushes cuz they're so thin and tiny and they're literally shaped like a little fishtail or a mermaid tail whatever you want to say so I just thought I would try them out for you guys you guys my notice to have a little a little tan going on right now because I just did a photo shoot recently would benefit and I was really really really really really bronzy actually I'll be matching my face to my neck for reals today oh she's exciting like really intense and sharp and we'll see if they actually work or not or is it just a gimmick who knows well find out but yeah guys as always if you guys don't like this video if you guys don't like me please don't watch it you know the drill with that I say it everything the video if you guys don't like me please don't watch this video but if you like this video please go ahead and subscribe to my channel if you aren't already and if you're new what's up my name you a and welcome to my channel thank you so much for being here I really appreciate it yeah let's go ahead and get into this review on these mermaid tail brushes and whether or not they were okay so I went ahead I did my base off of camera just the foundation and concealer part and I set underneath my eyes I want to use this with some cream contouring or basically liquid contouring basically anything to do with contouring that's what I kind of figured in my mind what this brush would be used for is contouring because it gives you that like the intense sleekness let me tell you exactly where I got this up though let's just really quickly I got this from flawless lighting calm and this is the mermaid foundation brush oh it's a foundation brush I had no idea this was a foundation brush and this is $14 that is what the price of these these I would never use this kind of brush as foundation though which is kind of funny I don't know what hey this isn't sat on my for idea so I'm making use a little bit let's just try it let's just try it this isn't set on my forehead yet oh yeah I mean it's definitely adding some coverage that means because the bristles are actually pretty calm and dense and it's allowing me to really set everything in place that totally worked holy I'm okay so now many is it for the contour which is what I was really a planning on using it for anyway I'm he's the same exact little brush on the point to end I'm gonna take this ultra HD concealer from makeup forever this is the y49 shade I don't know if his all this is look so dark I'm take a little might take a little hair I'll take a little hair except about an event later on today and I really can't  up although this is so dark I really should not risk the hats I really sit and do this my hula stick is broken okay guys okay so I found something that can definitely definitely use this is the Tarte TARDIS pro glow and they have a cream contour in this so I'm totally gonna use it with that I'm gonna taking a little bit the shade shade clever I'm just gonna literally just press it in so let's try this little mermaid mother freaking Hecker some parents gonna blend upwards hmm hey this is not blending for him take this brush I'm gonna take the morphe y6 and just press that over the actual contour and blend that out for real okay so we have some color down I was a little that was a little rough okay that's right on this side not dipping back in we're just go straight into the okay that should don't blend for nothing actually don't blend for nothing oh that will not blend with that brush by itself no we're gonna do a smidgen down the nose and do I think this is a good idea no I don't because honestly I shouldn't actually and I really shouldn't be doing this I don't know what the I'm thinking I'm gonna take a little bit down the center of the nose to contour my nose and they don't have a final product after that okay so actually I mean it puts down the product it does but it also just like swipes it away I know this my nose is so okay guys so I think I'm actually done uh I think I have my verdict on the brushes and whether or not I think they are worth the money whether I would think they're worth fifteen bucks or not I personally think that this product is much more of a gimmicky product a little area of foundation that you get for it it just it's just not enough you know what I mean like you're gonna be hitting your head on the actual metal part like it's just funky like it's just weird I don't know I guess just to me it just feels really uncomfortable I might not even hold this thing like do I do it like this like a flipper when applying the foundation did it work yes it did it did apply the coverage yes it did do I think it's worth the 14 or 15 bucks that it's priced at no I don't I think it's fun I don't think it's a cool little collector's item for sure and if you want to get it for that reason  yeah but you guys want to get it to actually like really like use it for your foundation and be like sick nasty and looking sick and beat to the ground I just don't think it's that practical I'm much much much rather use like this brush this flat top kabuki brush to blend out my foundation or do something with that over this technically I just think it's much more of a gimmicky product and I don't really think that's worth the money but it's fun it's definitely a fun little collector's item to have it's your your money you spend it the way you want to I'm just kind of giving my two cents in my review on what I think of it personally and my personal dots I'm just not the biggest biggest fan I was a little confused using it and I feel like my face looks a little  and actually have to go in an event after this so I really need to actually get my together because I need to go but yeah guys thank you guys so much for watching hope you guys enjoyed this video I'll leave where I got this down below of course if you guys are interested in it I thought it's a really fun idea and the concept is really fun as well so thank you to everyone that sent me this product to try out I personally not a fan but who gives a  I just want an opinion out of mini okay so if you want to get it do your thing and get it if not I'll get two bad guys I love you guys so much who gave you the night or day where you guys are and I'll catch you guys in my next video bye you guys okay you guys I went ahead and I did my bum bum Duty bum tip that's right that is what I picture this is what's gonna be used for uh-huh against me hey hey okay guys I went

hey guys welcome back to my channel so it says video is going to be a review and demo on the new Urban Decay troublemaker super fat super long sex proof mascara holy shit I was dying as soon as I saw this I was in Bora Bora and I saw this launch and I was screaming I got so many freaking tweets asking you guys to review the mascara like it just in general I just think it's genius and I live for the fact that they're like super long super fat I'm like bitch you're talking about a fucking it is what it is by the way my lashes are curled and right now in case you guys are wondering like why they look a little more open in a way I curled them coz they need a fucking real curl that's we're gonna be doing today we're going to review it the better than sex mascara so I just downloaded a grinder and if I can hit up within the next five minutes to do a hookup maybe I'll go hook up with a mascara hon we shall see okay I don't think I could really do that but I think I'm gonna do in order to test the sex proof Ness of it I'm gonna go like for a run I'm gonna go up and down my backyard which has like a trillion fucking steps I'm gonna start sweating and I'm basically gonna do like a cardio workout and see how the mascara holds up and I'll of course I'll take my phone out there with me and kind of vlog I thought it'd be kind of fun to do so because right now I currently cannot really hook up with anyone I don't have a boyfriend but I can definitely that's fine girl I can fucking do it myself as always if you guys want this video if you guys do not like me please don't fuckin watch it you know the Joey thing but you guys do you like this video please subscribe to my channel if you're not already and if you're new what's up I'm Manning anyway and welcome to my channel thank ya guys it's going into this view on this Urban Decay troublemaker I'm going to read off what this this mascara is so good it should be illegal troublemaker mascara delivers thirteen point seven times the lash volume and a sexy fluttery intensely at black fringe ok volumizes and lengthens as it separates so this guy is going to be at $24 and it launches in September and will be available Sephora Ulta select Macy's it's for calm and I'm gonna Kate of course this is what we go right here super fat super long sex proof mascara if that's not fuckin talking about some fucking cock play I don't know what I I really don't ok that guy you guys the back of the box ciao maker lashes are super fat super long and sex proof holds up in hot and heavy situations we tested it ourselves it literally says we tested it ourselves yaar nasty and everything gay that's team our wouldn't mind joining honestly so we're going to test this mascara out and see what we think I absolutely love this I love the duochrome to this I love the fact that it like the plastic itself is kind of divided and it's like a different type of plastic it's not smooth all the way around you guys see that has like little divots and I like to dip into that you guys when we're doing mascara you don't want to pump you don't want to do this we don't want to do mm no no no we just go in swirl pull it out it is what it is pull it out oh my god this videos full of sexual tension we're going to test out the mascara and see what we think we're gonna do from the bottom [Music] okay I got half of it right there half of the code have to lashes code right there okay let's do the rest so how gonna lie it's kind of scary using this because some of the bristles are extremely extremely long and some are shorter but the long length I'm like super scared of poking myself in the eye way so did you cautious and careful with that so we have one lash on can you see so this is what it looks like right there sadly it's kind of dropping my curl a little bit I think them formula must be a little bit heavy but we'll see how it acts when it's on our eyes for a little while I'm gonna be fucking we're gonna add it's on for a minute just let me know just letting on though this really really really does separate your lashes it does not make them look clumpy whatsoever this is definitely type of brush that separates them hardcore look at the shit separates them very nicely oh my god I'm living it's a little bit harder to do on the bottom because of how long the bristles on the brush are kind of hard to use okay we have one layer of mascara on right now this is what it looks like one layers on I can definitely let my lashes look a lot longer they're coated and they are nicely separated they're not clumpy whatsoever to me at least so let's go ahead and apply second layer and we are gonna test this mascara so far I actually really really like it I think the brush is a little bit hard to use I think it's a little like intense but other than that I think that they make my lashes look pretty good I will say though I feel like my lashes are dropping the formula must be a little bit heavier my lashes are starting to like go downwards again like you can see I'm looking straight into the camera and my lashes are basically straight and not curled whatsoever even though they were fucking curl this shit okay we're gonna do one more coat with this Venus flytrap of a fucking applicator and we're going to see what it looks like with one more coat so as I'm applying the second layer it's definitely getting clumpy err of course because it is a second layer getting a little clumpy err okay so we have two coats on right now and I definitely agree with the claims of it is super fat and they are super long I definitely agree I think that they definitely mean my lashes look so so much longer holy fuck but for me I just like this not giving me any lift and volume I need them to stay curled honestly though I wear falsies all the fucking time like literally I don't like normally just wear mascara and call it a day I wear falsies all the time but it's really affecting me too much and I actually like how it looks it's very very long and they're very very intense but he does have a person that really want to have a nice curl keep it curled like all day I don't really think this is gonna be the mascara for you I'm gonna go do a little bit of cardio right now and we'll be back soon to see how the mascara held that what is up you guys it's Manny anyway back at it again no just kidding uh this is so so right now we're gonna go outside and we're gonna hang out outside we're gonna fucking sweat we're gonna do some fucking cardio and we're going to see if this mascara is sexy time to prove you're not you know like sexy Titan so we're out here we out here and we're gonna be doing these guys this was a doing right there we're gonna be doing that many times until I start sweating in here we're starting with number one come on Zia let's go up the stairs okay we're gonna do it and I'm wearing sandals right now because it's like fuck it I already went to the gym earlier today I don't know why I'm doing this day was the wrong day already when to the gym party did cardio fuck it's sunny I'll be back soon okay I'm sweaty officially we're sweating right now I made it happen bucks Wes Louie I want are dripping in my eye okay guys we are back and I am so wedding and can you guys tell I'm sweating this is not highlighter this is actual real sweat I just did my little stairs for like like 20 times up and down here's mascara it's on do that you see that hmm I don't know it depends I guess it depends on house what do you get when you're having sex I'm full I'm full sweat look at my chest I'm full fucking sweating and so maybe if you don't sweat that much during sex it won't affect you but I feel like that right there is a sign that it's not as like it's not as waterproof as I thought it was gonna be I thought there's gonna be much more of a waterproof mascara even though it doesn't claim waterproof on here who knows man maybe I need to really have sex to try it out usually when I'm having sex I do get sweaty so this is like a good toast see if I do this okay okay guys so sorry excuse the sweatiness excuse a mess that I am right now I'm gonna take another fucking shower already showered today but it's another one so what I think I think that is definitely lengthening I think it definitely separates your lashes very well I do not think that holds a curl very nicely my lashes were definitely tilted down the great now there tilting downwards right now my lashes they're not like up and fluffy looking as soon as I blinked with sweat around my eyes I definitely lost some mascara on to my face and I will like this and I white and boom it was mascara so I don't really know I guess it just depends if you're super super sweaty person what I suggest this no I wouldn't or if you're really really oily I wouldn't suggest it but it was a nice mascara nonetheless you know when the eggplants so good that you're just like so excited that you're like choking it's so exciting and your dick tears are coming down your face I'm not really sure if it's going to be good for that part you know what I mean so I don't know guys this is one of those products ad this is all this is on you what do you guys think technically will I wear this again probably not actually I have other mascaras I like a lot more it gave me a lot more of a curl but I am a curl mascara kind of person personally it's more of a Miss but I think that oh this will be a hit for a lot of people for sure so definitely that Urban Decay did a really cool mascara and I love the packaging I love the fucking marketing of it being sex proof I think it's hilarious and yeah you guys that's ever taste a video hope you guys enjoyed it hope you guys enjoyed this uh debauchery you guys like the little vlog section that I put in kind of to kind of like a vlog section I guess if you guys like that kind of thing where I'm like testing the product throughout the day let me know and I can definitely make that happen more like if I'm testing a foundation if you guys want to see me doing like a late night check-in things like that let me know and I will definitely make that happen yeah that's it you guys I'm gonna go take a shower I feel this guy's thing huggers a night or day wherever you guys are and I'll catch you guys in my next video bye you guys [Music] my ring it's rough to the club's so what happens when you can't get a fucking fuck buddy harmony look you Nick you fucking scare me [Music] okay we gotta go [Music] 
hey guys welcome back to my channel today's video is going to be a fun one I'm so excited to be filming this this is a review and demo and using the entire brand new Patrick Starr ex Mac collaboration they came out with an entire collection I'll go more into it after this part so recently a Mac and Patrick Starr came out with this entire collection during the holidays it's like this really pretty white and silver accented collection and I got it recently and I really really really wanted to review it and see how the collection was I know there are a couple products that are existing Mac items and they're couple products that are new that Patrick curated with Mac and so I thought it would be really fun to review this I have not reviewed a Mac collection and so long this collection is such a hyped thing because Patrick is a social-media influencer and he's on social media a lot and it's just cool to see Mac and Trust a social media influence with our entire own collection and I believe there's gonna be five collections to come through the next year this is actually their second influencer collaboration because I had the question about Laura Lee and Gabriel Zamora who collaborated with Mac and they did a lipstick each which I still have which I fucking love both of them but this is way different though because Patrick gets his own entire collection and he's coming out with different collections throughout the entire next year truly from the bottom of my heart I feel like Mac could not have picked a better person than Patrick took cub with them for Mac as a lot of you guys know Patrick has his Cinderella story up on his YouTube channel and Mac was such a big influence in his life I thought Patrick is who he is today because of Mac and his experiences at Mac and his motto is a makeup is a one size fits all and Mac's motto is all ages all races all sexes and I just like to go hand in hand to me this screams of makeup has no rules I'm just very very very excited about this collaboration so yeah I'm gonna stop rambling on I'm gonna go ahead and start on it this review I have no makeup on because there is a powder in the collection I really wanted to try out so I'm gonna be putting on my base and then putting on the powder to see what we think of the powder before I start I wanted to say there is going to be a giveaway in today's video this is the giveaway

subscribe to my channel if you're not already and if renew what's up a many anyway and what it's my channel and thank you so much for being here I really appreciate it yeah it's gonna get started on this review of the entire collection from Patrick Starr and MAC Cosmetics okay so before we go ahead and dive in on the product that's go ahead and talk about what the products are and what actually comes in the entire collection so this is the pr package this is it right here it's a very pretty holographic very glittery and very glitz very glam very P fresh for sure so this is the collection here guys it comes with two palettes a powder three glasses three lipsticks and three lip liners I love this silver fabric I think it's beautiful and then we have a little notes here from Patrick as well just really really really exciting you guys can go ahead and pause it and read that if you guys would like I'm gonna be swatching everything guys by the way I'm not gonna like just do a look and like that's it I'm gonna do all this watching them do the whole fucking thing so the pure package comes with this entire pamphlet and I believe it's basically information about the entire collection and how and like what entails the pricing things like that so just go and talk about pricing really quick ly so lipstick we have mama star which is a reddish-brown satin finish Patrick Wow deep yellow red matte we have a she better work soft pink matte and those are going to be 1750 u.s. and $21 Canadian so we have the three lipsticks we have three lip classes that retail for 17 dollars all named after the three lipsticks lip pencils out of 1750 brick mahogany and edge to edge to eyeshadow quads we have the glamorous luck quad and we have the gold getter quad and those are $32 each 237 Canadian and then we have the set powder which is a colorless powder and that's $34 it's the Patrick's powder and 38 Canadian and also this thing down here it just says available in North America December 14th and all Mac locations and internationally February 2018 and select Mac locations fucking cool man and this is cool so I'm looking at the Mac website right now and I believe that everything is priced at the same Mac value so for example like the retro matte lipsticks are 1750 and Patricks lipstick - or 1750 same thing goes for the lip liners I believe let's see 1750 just like the other ones are it's just weird because when I worked at Mac I worked at Mac a couple years back and I remember everything being like $15 so now there's 1715 that's crazy like how the price has increased as the years have gone over and I'm like holy shit fucking pricing has gone up so now let's just go ahead and dive in I'm gonna go ahead to my base really quickly I'm just gonna put on some foundation and some concealer real quick and once we're gonna start setting the makeup I will come back and we will use setting powder okay base is on we have not said anything just yet so let's go ahead and go in with the Patrick Starr Patrick's powder set powder this is a colorless powder it says on the thing colorless ultrafine with a matte finish powder here so Patrick is known for his baking abilities and I mean that with powder of course I just popped off the lid so we can actually see the color of the powder the color of the powder is a pinky peach I believe it's gonna be translucent of course but it the colour there is a colour to it as like a soft peachy undertone there's no way the fucking camera's not mean I should have come on it's like too bright so let's go ahead and go in with a Beauty Blender and let's see how she sets the under-eye this looks like that's any one of those power that's real brightening real fucking brightening because it's not pinky undertone okay so we're gonna put this all over the face first impressions is that it is a beautiful beautiful powder it does give you a soft matte finish it sets everything very nicely I'm gonna just set the entire face with it as you can see the areas that the powder has right there it's completely matte and you get like a shimmer around the skin so I bet this is gonna be great for people that a little bit more on the oily side but it is so finely milled I bet that would be really great for people that are a little more on the dry side as well it's nuts a Patrick collab with Mac like that's crazy I mean factor go fucking way back like me that bitch goes so far back like shit prehistoric days man like it's so cool to see him doing his thing and excelling and you know doing what he loves and doing what he wants to do with his life and its really awesome okay the powder looks beautiful it's fucking stunning and I'm just gonna go ahead and press into the rest of the powder so we're gonna put the powder underneath the eyes and we're gonna have it cook there I just want to see how bright Ning like this powder can get us so we're gonna put a good hearty a good hearty amount on the under eye it's a very very very finely milled powder guys like it really is truly when they say like finely milled Jesus anyway I'm gonna go finish the rest of the face really quickly and we'll come back with the eyes and the lips okay so we have the base completely on I decided just to highlight my nose today and not Holly my cheeks I don't know I just felt it that's what I was feeling to day so now we're gonna go ahead and go in with the two eyeshadow quads this is what they look like right here beautiful colors very just like classic Mac shades so we have the glam as fuck I shot a quad which comes with Bruhl oh my gawd saddle and embark and we have a go-getter quad which comes with soft brown amber lights Swiss chocolate and I'm into it so both of these quads have three shades that are already existing from Mac and one new shade I believe because I don't recognize oh my god and I'm into it as mac eyeshadow shades so I'm gonna go and just swatch the quad on my hand really quickly I'm going to the glam is fuc one so feelin the shadows right now they just feel like a classic eyeshadow they feel very like old-school Mac so here we have the glam as fuck quad right here these are the four shades and this is the gold get a quad right there so these are the two quads so I first saw that Patrick was coming out with the quads I thought was so fun and I was so cool I'm like oh my god he gets to come out with his own eye shadow crime at first when I saw that they were shades that were already part of Mac I was kind of disappointed and I was like fuck I wish she was able to create his own quads until I saw the shades that he used in the quads and I literally like it like literally was like a fucking flashback like that's or even like very very that because of the shades he chose for the quads like literally I would use soft brown swiss chocolate brown script embark and all that glitters that was like my go-to Mac look and out of course always use saddle and Brule and like I'll just like oh my god like these are my classic Mac shades so it's just like really crazy to see like it really brought me back to him like my old Mac days I was like fuck dude like these are the shades I would always wear too it's just like the weirdest thing so I was like you know what it's totally fine maybe he didn't get to create all of the shades but the shades that were chosen for it are fucking incredible the shades for me that are so amazing for Mac and I feel like every Mac employee like uses these shades because they're so fucking good we're gonna go in take a little bit of soft brown and Brule just mix them together these are in different palettes I'm just missing them two together to make like a custom like little transition shade I'm gonna put that into the crease on a morphe 27 to see how these work and how these blend it's crazy because I feel like Mac for years and years and years and years set the industry standard for makeup in cosmetics in general so it's really really cool to see them do this collaboration and I just like I'm going back to my roots with Mac right now using these products because Mac shadows of course they work well they're not bad shadows whatsoever like they're not my favorite shadows anymore I've found other shots from different brands I like a little bit more but they work so well and like there's there's no denying that Mac has a great assortment of color and they're good like they're good products now I want to go in with some Swiss chocolate holy fuck I'm not used with chocolate and so LA on a morphe r39 good good like packing like very Mac 217 style brush coming back to these days man pack Swiss chocolate on the outer corner I love this color arrangement I just feel like it's so just so good like it's so like just warm and pretty and just like classic combination like I really just love it so I'm gonna take Swiss chocolate blend that out and wing it out a little bit we're gonna do something more Maki just like this is very old-school Mac like bringing all the darkness out here making that shit winged out like it's so Mac so we have this going on on the eyes everything's blending very well everything's blending very very nicely I'm gonna take a little bit of embark on this morphe r41 it's a good little pencil brush gonna put that on the outer corner whew yep we're going back to the Mac rooms guys are getting back to the roots I feel like I learned how to blend working on Mac like that was like I mean I already like had an affinity for makeup when I first started but I feel like when I was working on Mac I just like really honed in on my skills of course Sephora taught me what I needed to know about a lot of stuff and of course I learned the basics from makeup from Sephora but when you're working at Mac it's just different like you just learn different skill sets you learn different techniques and I feel like the reason I am the way I am like the reason I do my makeup a certain way is because of my old-school Mac days too so I feel like once you're a Mac person like - you don't fucking leave you you know ooh ooh that is so good embarq is one my favorite Mac show something called time it's so fucking good like it's scary okay so this is we have so far now I like it so now I'm gonna go on the lid we're gonna take this shade oh my god which is a frost it's the shade right here feeling it it feels great I would say honestly it's more like a taupe it's like a pinky taupe shade and it's a frosty finish a pinky frost sheet and that's oh my god so that's something I believe Patrick period himself so we're gonna put that one to the lid see it last like a really pretty soft frosty tone to it this is one of those much more terrible shades I wish was metallic and crazy cuz that's my personal style but I think that people would really really really really like this because it's so subdued and subtle but it's still a nice lid cuz he's got really pretty pinky topi reflection oh that's nice so you can see oh my god on this eye nothing on that I think see there's a little bit of a sheen it just a little bit of color right there I was gonna go in with the gold one I think I've been doing gold a lot now taking soft brown again on that same more feet r41 I'm gonna go ahead and blend that underneath the lash it and the wing of that out to connect with my outer corner out here we're basically just gonna do the exact uni that we did up here as we are doing down here picking a little bit of a shade I'm into it and I'm putting that right here close to the outer corner taking a little bit of an bark again just really deepening the outer corner boom very magic okay cool I'm gonna go and finish the other eye off-camera and I put some liner and lashes on and it'll be right back to talk about the final version of what I think of the palettes okay we are officially done I have the I look on this is what we have so far that the Mac wing going where your fucking goes out into a little cute tiny point so now we have the eyes done we use the pallets what do I think about feet pallets I think they're actually really great I truly love the colors that were selected for each palette I think there's such Cormack items and I'm sure Patrick uses these all the time for me it's like you know what if he isn't able to puree all the shades himself at least II was able to choose like the best of the shades that he used from Mac so I think that that's really really awesome anyway so now we're gonna move on to the lips I'm gonna use all the lipsticks and lipglosses and the lipliner so let's go in start off with the lightest we have edge to edge which is like a deeper darker pink shade so I'm pretty sure that edge to edge goes with she better work it cuz it's like a pink and a pink I'm pretty sure that's what it is this is part of Mac's collection already in my car D has edge to edge let me go in just a quick lip line I'm not gonna talk too much about the lip liners because this is already from Mac and Mac is known to have amazing lip liners for sure so we have edge to edge and now I'm gonna put on she better work which is a matte lipstick this is like a nude pink feels super comfortable very very very nice on the lip and here we have she it's so pretty it looks so my it's very pretty just like Barbie pink shade to me it's gonna come a lot of different skin tones and let's go ahead and apply a little bit of the she better work gloss on top of this and this is a she but I'll work these are the lip glasses not too sticky really loved one on the lip so I'm very happy about that so this is the first lip I think it's stunning now to go ahead and use a mahogany lip pencil with the lipstick mama stone so that is the shade that's named after his mother who is like the sweetest woman so we have mahogany lip pencil on I'm like I look so funny back and now we have miss mama star which is a satin finish so here we have a mama star with mahogany and now let's go put some gloss on show exactly what it looks like with some cloth this is very very very dark on me it's really pretty it like really really really is here we have it mama star lipstick and lip gloss and with mahogany lip pencil heart this is a heart color to describe it's like a brown mob with the pink undertone in it that's what that sheet is right there so she had on earlier took a very literally like a Barbie pink and Patrick woo this guy right here these are three shades okay now and last but not least we have brick lip pencil which is really pretty just like red now we have Patrick woo - they ride with a yellow undertone subtly this is supposed to be similar to Ruby woo but this is a lot more comfortable I can already tell it's so much more comfortable then Ruby Louise and here we have a patch of glue and rock up at the gloss on because like the red lipstick by itself looks so pretty but I will put it on top over the red lipstick I swatch so this is a warm and I'll put it on the side too so you can see what it looks like we have the red gloss on top of Patrick woo we have Patrick blue gloss by itself it's a very pigmented and feels exactly the same as other ones they're all the lip glasses I believe so that is the entire collection we're done at reviewing this entire thing anyway so that is it for today's entire video so what do we think of the entire Patrick's rock collection collaboration with MAC Cosmetics I think that it was a great collaboration I think it was so well thought out really well done I can't wait to see his next collaborations with Mac the next collections to come and to follow this one I feel like it's gonna be hard one to top because these are all so well done like it's very well thought out I love the packaging I love white and silver accents to everything love the holographic feel to it obviously I'm like holographic bitch so I think honestly all in all the collaboration is amazing I think it's great the shades for me like the lipsticks the one I'll wear the most is this one I think magic glue for me like matches me the best I don't think that other to match my skin tone as nicely as this one does I feel like this one like a red I really love it right on me but the shades thing that's a personal preference for me the quality was amazing and that's what I'm here to tell you guys like is that the quality was so there so if you guys buy it and you guys love the shades and you buy it and you're like I'm gonna have the quality's good you're gonna get amazing quality because the quality of Mac is just good like Mac has good ass shit so all in all I loved it the powder I fucking loved I think the way my skin looks is really really pretty the quads I loved all in all the collection was mmm it was an a-plus for me for sure and congratulations to Patrick and Mac again and I'm sure it's gonna do amazingly and I hope it kills it and I hope this it just shows that like the beauty world online medium filters it's such a strong thing and we're stronger together the whole beauty world wins I'm so proud and I'm so grateful that Patrick did this you know him being a boy and makeup as well you know he's opened a lot of doors for a lot of young kids and for people in general you know and so I just think that's really awesome yeah that's it that's all I have to say I think the collection is great I think that you guys got any to hide him from the collections you would love it I really do think that from the bottom of my heart other than that that's it I'm done the video is good I haven't amazing time doing that here's the night or day wherever you guys are and I'll catch you guys in my next video bye you guys Wow hey guys that welcome back to my channel oh yeah I know I

hey guys that welcome back to my channel so today's video is going to be a fun review of a this weird-ass product at least couple products I wanted to try how I have been getting tagged to do a video on this on these actually the silicone brushes is what they look like before literally like months I've been getting tagged and has to do this and I finally bought them on Amazon I've just been putting it off I have no idea why and I finally bought them and I'm Leo gives me fucking review these they look very I'm very intrigued by them they are silicone brushes I don't know it like the whole thing just seems very weird very gimmicky and I'm kind of like I don't think I'm gonna like it but I don't want to speculate I don't want to think that I like it I'm gonna go in open-minded yeah that's a zero is going to be I'm going to be reviewing at least silicone brushes today which is so awkward there's one just drop it right into it I'm gonna film a couple videos today and decider as always if you guys do not like this video if you guys do not like me please don't fucking watch it you know the joy back but if you guys do like this video please go ahead and subscribe to my channel if you're not already and if you're new what's up a man um you a and welcome to my channel I really appreciate you being here anyway yeah let's go ahead and get into this review on these silicone brushes I'm so excited it's like there's six of them [Music] okay cool all righty then let's go ahead and fucking go right in with these silicone rings I'm gonna be going in with the natural radiant long wear foundation from NARS I've been really really really liking this foundation nah we're just talking about these really quick fees the little package came with six of them and they retailed for I think it was like 15 to 20 bucks on Amazon not including shipping or tax so technically like altogether it wasn't too expensive it really I mean like that's not too too pricey three four six brushes you know I mean these probably know what the thing I really don't so I'm gonna go in right away to pubs on the little paddle or Guarini it feels like hard like when you're applying it it feels like mean something plastic like this it feels hella weird okay and it feels kind of Tuggy but when you go like this like when you spank it in there's no Street but when you're like moving it like a normal brush you would there's hella streaks usually when I'm applying it with a brush or with a Beauty Blender the facial hair doesn't like matter like it doesn't like fuck with my facial hair at all but going in with this where it doesn't like finesse the product into my skin my facial hair definitely looks cakey and gross and it never looks like that so in this area right here it's beautiful it's fucking beautiful and I didn't even like I literally use like one two pumps let's see we can do so I don't know if it's the foundation that's looking beautiful or it's the application I already know the foundations stunning what I will say about this that a little bit goes a very long way like this bitch carries I did one pump the whole forehead was caught her honey and for me that's like a big deal because I have a big ass fucking man thing is like a big fucking man gotta eat that so it makes a difference okay looking close up at my skin the problem is that it's not like blending into anything okay on the nose I can't do it okay pat pat pat spanking like you would an ass you know like a good ass just like so on the areas that are flat I like have no texture no hair no nothing if you're patting it in like this it looks pretty nice actually like I feel like the coverage was really nice like the finish is really nice ball around the nose you see or on that fucking nose a lot of character and so when you try to put it in there it makes the streaks on the side over here and it's like go back see this let's read it let's give it a rating on a scale of one to ten ten being on my thigh and one being not am i selling I would say this is a whopping three it is okay now let's go ahead and go with some concealer because it's a little product was a long way I'm taking a little bit of the Tarte shape tape like a little and we're gonna go ahead and use this brush which is like a weirdly hoot it's a weird I'm saying well it looks like it's like goes like that it has it go weird for Oh like pokes me it's hard I mean the coverage is there because this doesn't take away any coverage it like keeps everything in place but literally it's so hard he honestly that another thing till I noticed even when I'm patting it drags my skin so intensely like what is a premature wrinkles you know what I mean like hardcore like it's so draggy on the look at that and that's just me like softly like doing this it's like almost sticky I mean the under eye looks nice I'm not gonna lie down really needs to be really real the look like underneath the eye is there like it looks fucking kunti what are gonna make this hold on I would say a three again another three that's the whole wha none of these things I would apply with powder to be really real we're gonna set my under eye really quickly okay you have all these other types of brushes I kind of wanted to use two let's use this one this looks like it would be a light contour it's shaped like a blush contour brush would so like a little contour a platoon let me get a cream contour product Oh how's like fucking got guy let's see I mean it cuts it it sure does it's actually not as bad as I thought it was gonna be to be really real like I thought I was gonna be so much worse that's going this so she goes didn't see little bit more clear like we really like this shit cuts take some mini like this definitely takes much much much longer than using a beauty blender or brush like way too long oh you blend it on the other side just fine and you want to be a bitch on this side okay it's fine no it's cool okay this brush I would give it a 4 a little bit better than other ones but still floppy my face so he grabs - I see dipbrow already going with the silicon this brush which looks like a little angled brush I'm gonna use just right brow cuz I feel like it's thick as fuck I'm not gonna use it as an eyeliner and it came with an eyeliner brush came with this guy so I feel like that would be for eyeliner specifically you know go in people why I'm I'm not hitting it for the brow oh hold on the bottom part of the brow it's a little more rough not calling because we have a brow on this is using in the dark brunette dip brow - Nasia because of the fact that this does not absorb any product you pick up so much product like I know for a fact like you don't understand how much dip brow is in my brow right now like it is flooded with dip brow it's ridiculous like this is the most intense eyebrow I've had enough fucking minute also you can't really finesse it into the hair this is like bitches going down and that's what it is it's not like gonna be blended into anything well at the end of its like the look is there and it puts down product really nicely so I would say this one out of 10 I'll give it a 5 it's better than the 3 and the 4 let's go in with Vance wine so I'm gonna take my Paint Pot from Mac and ply it on my eyeball my linh played pretty good little streaky shit is so hard to pick up any product on like it's so hard so applying an eyeshadow base with this no no no I want to use this again I'm gonna flip it over and I'm gonna use a glitter eyeshadow and see how the glitter eyeshadow reiax don't take the Stila glimmer and glow shadow and see how he applies a liquid or cream shadow I'm just very curious because I mean like this is what it would be used for his applying creams but I didn't like the way applied my primer so I'm like okay let's know what applies this okay yeah see this is like so much nicer for a cream shadow okay so does it apply it nicely it does and it leaves like no streaks and it does go on nice but the problem still is the tugging and there's so much tugging going on with this silicone brush that it literally drives me fucking crazy like it tugs my entire I ain't but it looks beautiful I'm not gonna light looks like in the sickening and it did apply on the lid very nicely so maybe like this one would work really good for like a spotlight like a little like DVD or like if you want it instead of wanting to use your finger it might work well for that but it's so Tuggy it makes me want to scream looks good okay guys rating I will have to say though it applied that shadow beautifully it looks so good no streaks went on full coverage I brought how to use any product looks really nice I want to give this one a 6 hour most highest rated brush good job 6 in a world of success beer 10 so now I'm ready I'm gonna take the dipbrow and I'm gonna use it as my eyeliner because the dark brown so I'm gonna take my little silicone eyeliner brush I'm gonna do eyeliner over oh this is so win let's see let's see [Music] okay I get it tugs but it's fine honestly it's going on pretty good what the issue is here with this one is because it doesn't have a brush or just have a bristle to make the top line you see the line right here usually like people like to have that like be very very crisp and sharp and clean with this is actually very hard to get that to be crisp and clean because you basically mean like the tip of the brush to do that not the side of it so you have to like really make sure you finesse that doesn't look bad at all I'm actually kind of shook because that does not look bad at all I think looks actually pretty nice I'm not going to I do a wing with it this is what we're getting floppy this is what we're getting okay eyeliner is on I cannot do a fine point with this due to the fact that it is a silicon tip it does not go into a fine little tiny line so I have to keep it like this but it totally worked it did it's kind of it was kind of floppy in the beginning it's not like my favorite or anything that I probably want to either forever use it again that's that's the team would we rate this I'll write this guy a seven actually this is probably my highest rated one because it totally worked and like made my line smooth you had to really finesse it in but you can do it you can make this work okay okay you know and no I can give it to seven I'm gonna give it a six I'm gonna give her a six because I'm trying to rego over it and it's like tugging too much and it's picking up the product underneath it's not the business it's not we're gonna have to go with the six I'm sorry had to demote you baby you got to go from a C to Adi you're officially failing my class sorry guys I think I my verdict I didn't want to do a full face using this because I mean technically already did I just wanted to use these brushes to put in the spots like I would think that you would use it for okay guys so what do we think of these brushes collectively what do we think as a total I think they were a yeah they were a total fail for me like they did not work very well I think that my turn out like okay the brow is honestly I didn't live and I really wanted to live but I didn't live a thousand lines no collectively I would say save your money do not buy silicone brushes I don't think that they worked very very well the one that will say that like I feel is the most practical are these two right here but I know I'm not gonna ever use them I might use this one actually this one I might use to apply like glitter or something like that cuz it's a good packing situation but if you see like the face ones don't buy any of the face ones if you want to buy it I want just to try it out as I can pack go right ahead that won't I wouldn't say he's like terrible or anything he died so give it a 6 out of 10 the face is just so bad like Wow so yeah you guys I'm kind of shook about this I will leave these link down below if you guys are interested in checking them out I would say for me they are a flop I would say not to buy them they are pretty look at I like the other teal like they're adorable but they just didn't work anyway you guys that is it for today's video I love you guys so much okay so the night or day wherever you guys are and I will catch you guys in my next video hey guys are we recording can you hear me can you hear me hey guys I would a oh I'm sorry but geez I need a haircut fuck I do okay oh my gosh okay so with this okay next brush will be with next five right here she gets the fucking fine she gets the fucking fuck it's so Tuggy it makes me want to scream like actually you like fucking George in the jungle fucking hmm scream my life that you can clean these off so easily but I'm not gonna use we can't stop like my mind's rationalizing for me you like for these so the King bad oh I'm an idiot mmm-hmm love it I love being a fucking idiot it's so fun 
hey guys welcome back to my channel so today's video as you can see from the title is going to be a review and demo of the new the brand-new Kylie cosmetics and Kim kardashian-west huh thank you crazy the Kylie cosmetics and Kim kardashian-west collection when I first saw this I was actually so freaking excited about it's actually love Kim Kardashian I think she's so smart I think she's so business savvy and I think that she's a really hard-working woman and I just really appreciate that you can think whatever you wanna think about her that's totally fine I know that they are a controversial family I say I guess I would say you can say whatever hell you want to say about them that's fine but my personal opinion is I like the Kardashians I like Kim i like Kylie I think that they were very very very hard-working and I think that they really really made a great life for themselves opinions are like assholes everyone hath one but not always pretty that's so yeah guys that's what eyes video is going to be I'm going to be trying them on watching them reviewing them the whole nine yards so you guys want to see that to keep on watching as always if you guys like this video if you guys

first I wanted to talk about the note that this came with it came with it it says hey guys I hope you loved that kickin w Kim kardashian-west Kylie collab I'm so excited for you to try my four fave nudes I have a surprise coming soon xoxo Kim kardashian-west by the way guys this was sent to me by Kylie cosmetics is PR team I had no idea Kylie even knows who I am at all but her cosmetic team does send me PR so thank you guys so much to the PR team for sending me this I have been sent a lot of Kylie cosmetics PR some things I loved some things I have not loved I'm always gonna keep it real and 100 with you guys just because a brain sends me something does not mean I'm going to change my opinion and make it like better because they sent it to me a really that's not what it is ever that's never how I've been and that's I'm never going to be like that so don't worry you guys definitely trust my opinion I have been very very very real and brutally honest about certain products and the beauty and some things have been from Heidi cosmetics so toward disclaim that just in case people are like you're sponsored in case I do like these out if I'm like them but just in case I'm like bitch don't even try it don't try it this is that like enjoy it you know so this is the packaging this sorta comes it comes like this beautiful little matte soft pink packaging these are the four guys right here is what they look like adding their acted this is what they look like right here I personally think that this matte pink packaging is so fucking nice like I honestly love it I do I don't know why I there's something about this that just really speaks to me the newness of this makes me want to take off my clothes and get fucking nude the shades are Kimberly Kim keke and Kimmy and I think I mean they all represent Kim's names or nicknames or whatnot these launched on April 25th at 3 p.m. Pacific Standard Time and the four lipsticks are going to be retailed for $45 another thing this is a brand new formula from Kylie cosmetics this is the creme liquid lipsticks I tried her like the lipsticks I tried to lip liners on her glasses I've tried all of her stuff and this is a brand new formula which I'm really excited to try out as well this has 11 ounces a product in it just like her liquid lipsticks do in case you guys wanted to know that I'm just playing it so I know you guys are probably like mani it's okay we get it get the fuck on with it let's try on the liquid lipsticks I'm gonna go from left to right the most nude on and I'm gonna try on the lik lipsticks right now on camera so the first one we're gonna try it is Kimberly which is actually the shade I'm the most excited for let's put out let's see what it looks like it looks like this it smells like nothing oh my god I smells like nothing oh it makes me so happy I think Kylie cosmetics is liquid lipstick formula scent is a little too strong for me personally I don't really like it so this one's like nothing which I really like let's just go ahead and swatch and see what we think on bare lips or on bare lips right now one swipe okay that's what one dip we're gonna dip back in because it's not the coverage I wanted to be specifically okay guys and this is the shade Kimberly it is on my lips this is two layers of it on my lips and honestly its pigmented and it's fucking beautiful I honestly love this color I really really do I feels extremely comfortable it went on very very creamy and just like the liquid states like a creamy creme creme creme ish finish non sticky whatsoever there's a little bit of build up in the center but I think this could be except have too much on wipes away pretty easily thing on I'm not even dramatically I actually live for this shit first one yes first one to go also that came off so easily which could be a good thing it can be a bad thing next we're gonna try the shade Kim looks a bit Coral the last shade by the way guys Kimberly that was like a very just true nude color to me I had like a nice really pretty pinky beige undertone and that's just what it was it was a nice just neutral nude shade this one in the bottle to me looks a little bit more Coralie let's go ahead and try this on and see what Kim looks like once light okay so this one is a little bit more pastel and this is also a little bit more streaky than the other one was I think it's streaky because it's a creamy formula it's glossy so it's just gonna look that way do one more layer just like I did with the other one gotta give it a fair shot you know Myrtle have to give it a fair shot and this is what Kim it looks like on the lips okay honestly I'm kind of shocked because in this it looked a lot more coral and I was like I'm about to make a coral nude honestly it's not even Coral at all it's like a peachy nude took a really pretty peachy pink nude God this color is fucking nice too god I don't like that budget up here that kinda is getting on my nerve that you have to keep doing that it went on similar to the last one except it was slightly more streaky but the effect after adding two layers is the exact same feels very comfortable okay guys next we have the shade Kiki in the bottle it looks like like a much more pinky toned nude so let's go ahead and try this one home let's do this Kiki I had nothing on it okay start from the back there we go this won't really he's really one layer it's more pigmented than the other ones are it has more coverage mm not that has more coverage it's just a darker color I'm still gonna add another layer though I would say in the beginning when you're first applying these liquid lipsticks that they're a medium coverage but if you build it and you do two layers you can build it to full coverage and you get full opacity I can't see I have like a freckle over here on my lip and I can't see it because it lipsticks there so I think that's a good thing so I would say that Kiki is just a babydoll pink nude reminds me of the backdrop that I'm using right now like it's just a baby doll pretty pink nude this is the color that I will probably not ever really wear it's not my thing I think that's a little bit too pink for me personally but uh it's a beautiful color and I'm sure a lot of people would absolutely live and breathe and die for this color so again it feels the exact same as other two and last but not least we have a Kimmie which is the darkest of the four colors this one looks like a I don't know in the bottle honestly at this point I don't fucking know I'm just gonna swatch okay okay use the back of applicator for more how weird is it that the back picks up more than the front of the applicator odd whatever and here we have the shade Kimmie which is another beautiful gorgeous nude shade two layers of this on so pretty I think this color is stunning oh my god I would say this is much more of a rosy undertoned nude it's darker and deeper it's a good rosy terracotta nude that's what I would describe this color as it's a rosy terracotta nude feels the same smells the same looks the same on the lips beautiful glossy creamy finish and yeah I think I have my verdict guys okay guys I finished watching all four colors I'm currently right now wearing on my lips Kimberly and Kim also one more thing that I wanted to point out is skin tones when it comes to this collection I do not think that this range of colors is the most suitable for darker complexions I just don't that's just my personal opinion I think that these colors are really really light even the lightest one Kimberly was looking a little light on me and I was like I'm freaking pretty light in complexion I just feel like if you want to get this collection in your doctor and complexion make sure that you I rhymed make sure you have a darker lip liner so really compliment it or just put it on top of a lip liner but all-in-all I am done with the swatches and I finally have formulated my opinion and what I think personally about this collection with Kim Kardashian and Kylie cosmetics are the mani MUA approved is it a hit or miss for me and honestly they're a hit I'm pleasantly surprised I am pleasantly surprised I think that if you're lighter in complexion this is a great freaking bundle I think it's awesome when anything is fantastic personally for lipsticks for 45 I think that's really really fair it's like 11 bucks of lipstick but if you are darker complexion I do not think this is worth it and I the only one of the shades is gonna be able to work on you and so I just really think you need to be cautious about that by the way these are not long wear liquid lipstick these are a lipstick a cream lipstick and a liquid formula that's basically what this is this is not gonna be lasting six hours I mean I could already tell that they're feigning and this maybe lasts like an hour on me you know I mean you have to reapply which is really fine if you want if you're the type of person that will reapply throughout the day that's cool I'm that kind of person I like to have a beautiful lip effect and apply throughout the day rather than drying cracky and last me 12 hours like that's just not that's just not what I go for personally all in all I think it's a hit I think that Kylie and Kim did a great job on this collection and I really am excited to see what they come out with with the future stuff what the I have a surprise coming I'm like very excited about that I'm like okay what do you got come in I want to see a whole I want to see a whole range I want a family I want highlighters I want the whole thing honey so yeah guys I hope you guys enjoyed this review and you found it helpful if you guys want to buy it or not I think we covered everything I think we're pretty

hey guys that welcome back to my channel so it has been a minute since I have films how have you guys been I hope you guys have been doing fantastic I just got home from Utah was in Utah with Urban Decay for a little bit it took us on a trip to learn how to ski and snowboard and that was so much fun and I just got home and I saw this package sitting here for me at the house and it is the Cutty cosmetics weather collection hear that thunder oh so busy I thought we really fun it to just go ahead and do a review and demo of this collection actually tweeted I was really really excited about the collection because I thought was super cute I thought was really cute that I was inspired by stormy who is her daughter of course Kylie has a daughter now named stormy I love a good theme you know I love a good theme I love when a product has like a story behind the park in this whole entire collection is based off of the weather and stormy and like very lightning he and I really really like that because it tells an entire story no for me and my friend I'm gonna be having like products that come out that revolve around one concept or one story behind it and that's gonna how I see my brand going so when I see brands do like a cool like collection or something behind there or something a strong focal point behind the collection I get really really excited because to me just shows a lot of thought and a lot of energy going into a collection or a product you guys know I've always been so so so honest and forthcoming about my Kylie collection reviews I'm always very brutally honest about them whether I think they're great whether or not whether they're worth the price or they're nothing worth the price this collection is not any different in any way just heard I like the collection idea does not mean that I'm going to be biased anyway or just because I always send the product does not mean I'm going to like make it seem like it's amazing when in actuality it could not be amazing I'm honest about that with every fucking product on my entire channel I feel a lot of you guys hide me for that because I'm very very honest and forthcoming without being like a dick and that's how I feel I am I've always been like that so today's video is no different wanted to say that before the video even started there's a lot of products in here I really only wanted to try it them out and test them out so I left a lot of the areas of my face blink because I wanted to have some highlighters the eyeshadows the lip products and the eyeliner as well so we're gonna go right in as always we guys don't like this video if you guys do not like me please don't fucking watching you know the drill with that I say in every single video if you do not like me if you like my vibe if you don't like my videos it's all good you don't need to watch me there's no point leaving hate comments down below just click off and that's all good I'm not everyone's cup of tea at all but I could be yours if you guys do like this video please go ahead and click like and subscribe to my channel if you're not already and you're you what is up I'm an emu and welcome to my channel they're just drunk on my lap and she wanted to make an appearance let's go and get right into this Kylie cosmetics weather collection and review and demo we're gonna try a bunch of shit out there's a ton of products in this collection which is super super cool I love when I see a big old collection some people fucking frickin conviction so let's go and start off with via highlighter project I have no highlighter on my face we have a loose powder highlighter and we actually have a new pressed powder highlighter one side the faces and get one those hats don't get another let's open the loose cover I also love the packaging on this so this is a grey packaging has like that really cool like holographic lightning bolt attached to it which i think is stunning I personally really like I like that every single part of the collection has different elements where I'm so like this is supposed to be like a water droplet I'm assuming like a little water droplet effect lightning bolts lightning bolts a little cloud we're gonna take the shade lightning but we're trying to look at it and see what kind of color it is I'm intrigued these have been really nice every single one of these I've used from Kylie has been very very very nice so I'm pretty sure this is gonna be the same if it's the same formula there's gonna be no qualms with this like that's another low little lightning packaging so I just watched her in here guys this is a lightning bolt loose powder it's a very very golden highlighter so basic it's like a white with gold flecks in it I feel like it might be a little too yellow actually it's more of a yellow gold for my complexion so we're not gonna actually use that one we're gonna take the face palette which I was actually more more intrigued about but if you do like a golden yellow a golden highlight you guys will really really enjoy this I think personally I'm not really into yellow highlighters on my face it's just not my thing so we're gonna go ahead and not use that I'm gonna take the ladies this is what I was excited for it dude does my skin look so nice right now like the skin is looking really like good let me read the prices let me read the prices we're gonna go over the prices back up you guys so the ultra glow retails for $14 I'm assuming this one's but this is a kind of general loose ultra glow next we go in we have the highlighter palette oh my god this is actually so fucking cute like it has like the reflective clouds and it has a velvety cloud like actually feels velvety oh this is fucking cute and then we have right here boom a ladder right there this guy retails for $44 so this one is definitely more of a pricier item not gonna lie it's kind of priced high to me let's go ahead and swatch it missing we think they feel pretty fucking great goddamn I just watched Stratus and let's watch off for actually Stratus is like the one that looks like the prettiest in the pan it's this one right here as the most like intense like reflection oh my god so these are the four right here these are the four highlighters right there okay we have the four highlighters right here every shade is beautiful in its own way these are more of a foiled finish these two are here they dream and Stratus much more foil D and they're swatch they have much more of a reflection to them the two on the sides cloud line and Golden Hour those ones are a little bit more of a powdery finished or not as amoliant as the other two they're not as reflective to me the middle two of the most reflective so anyway let's go in try it on the skin you guys probably took me fucking babblers I fucking have the gums are running I'm sorry we're gonna go and take a morphe r-36 brush to apply the highlight which oh I love this fucking brush and the morphine r36 don't sleep on this what can brush it's so good okay we're gonna go in with the shade daydream have come for blood honestly this is so this is gnarly shades like this to have like that really intense emollient feel usually give off that intense reflection so this is definitely no different this is gnarly oh my god well so far so good holy titties we're gonna go ahead and swatch this right here as well these are dude these are really nice like this is really nice for me so far that this is a win oh my god it's like so it's literally like so bright where I'm like shook so what I'm looking is straight into the camera like this I can see that there's a little bit of a white cast on the highlighted planes it's almost like the color is a little bit too light for me it's giving me like a little bit of a cast when looking straight into the camera but usually highlighters are like this at a really bright will give eye cast like no matter what like it's kind of like an happen and the smiles and shit like you're gonna get a cast like I'm actually kind of floored I'm not gonna like this is really pretty when it's Estes its own weight oh my gosh they're so beautiful Mike are you counting hi this is really good it's fucking nice god damn that is $44 for that palette and it comes with point 11 ounces per shade so basically four times 3.1 grams which basically it goes out to about twelve point four grams of product in this entire thing it's gonna run a product I can't tell you whether or not it's justifiable to spend forty four dollars on it that's something that's on you guys if you guys want to spend the money awesome if you don't awesome as well but I will say that this worked very very nicely knowing that it works so well now I would personally buy this for sure now let's go and move on to the habits we have the calm before the storm this cover here here and then we have the I see I just like how it's so clever here we have the two pounds right here she is she that cuteness she right there so it's going up and up we have the gray one which comes with ten eyeshadows that's this one right here and then we have oh my god this is fucking pastel shit and then we have this guy which also comes with ten shades right here let's go ahead and see how much these cost so the eyeshadow palettes retail for $40 for ten shades that retails about $4 per shade however each shadows only point zero three ounces this guy I will definitely admit I think is the price a little bit too high I would spend maybe like thirty five bucks on this at the most I think forty is a little bit kind of expensive for me personally but then again her pilots usually retail for forty five for nine shades and this one is 40 for 10 but they're smaller so it's one of those things you gotta fuckin you gotta think so these are the two pallets right here these are from the stormy collection I think that both pallets are really unique this one is definitely more of a pastel moment for sure and then we have more of a dark stormy collection right there so I don't know what you going with you for meme this isn't really giving me the transitions that I personally mean and want this color right here in the middle it's like calling me this mint the mattes feel great the mat feels oh my god the mat is wonderful shit that's fucking pretty I'm not necessarily little living for the shimmers though I think they're a little bit chunky what i'm swatching these guys so i swatched this one swatch this one to like this is more chunkier situation going on you know for me I'm just not into like the chunkier intense shades the mats are beautiful the chunkier ones I'm not a huge fan of they're a little bit too powdery for me in the yellow palette so I'm thinking I'm gonna go and take that silver is ooh I'm sick it's beautiful we're gonna take this over that's what we're gonna do is we're gonna take that fucking silver key little hybrid said you guys you know I'm just coming back to filming it's a full moon right now I'm feeling my oats I've done the waterbending vibes right now if you are like what the fuck is wrong with you what did you eat I love how all these are like names something's so cute we have like low names like electric moon in back whirlwind Stargate cyclone really really cute names so we're gonna take this shit right here which is like more of a shade again I do get annoyed that this is I have a mirror I'm like God I wish that this had a mirror my eyes are fine by the way and go on and that's too light no we're gonna take the darker grayer one the purpley thing okay so this is we have an eye so far it's like this is like really weird this color is actually so much lighter than I thought in the pan tell me in the pan that clerk right there that darker gray right there it does not look dark it's going on to me literally like so light like a pastel light greyish purple that kind of shocked me I'm knocking oh hi by the way guys that transition shade I went in with a morphe m535i mazing for a transition a very very very perfect very fluffy it's just a really really really nice blending brush it's extremely soft I love this brush and I wanna take a morphe r39 and that really nice deep plum shade and go ahead and put that on the outer corner I mean this is a stormy collection I feel like I need to be a little more smoky today this is a very cool tone for me I just want you guys all to know that I'm uncomfortable okay we have this grace we have basically have a gray smokey eye and honestly the colors in here I not expect these colors to turn into this I really did it for some reason they're translating a lot lighter on my skin and that usually does not happen for me literally ever so the glitter eyes retailed for $40 for each pair which i thought was a little bit right see and by load I mean it's fucking expensive I was like wait for real thank you that ass or no okay so when I first saw it I was like bitch that's expensive I was kind of like oh but then I remember that the Magnificent metals glitters from Stila are twenty four bucks and those have point 15 ounces these guys have point twenty two ounces so it has more and technically it's a better deal because you're getting two for forty basically one for twenty bucks and the steel ones are twenty four bucks so to me I was like okay you know what that's more justifiable I still got a little bit pricey I was a little like whoa whoa Nelly that's crazy but looking at it in that way I'm like okay you know what it's more justifiable the Magnificent metal glitters are 24 bucks from Stila and those are like the like industry standard to me for glittery beautiful shadows so we're gonna go and take one of these guys I just wanna see how it looks hey guys I just watched one in my hand but so this is one of them ring your swatch and it's beautiful it is a beautiful shade it's a really cool unique like purple gray as like a purple shift to it I don't you guys didn't see on camera but it does this is in the shade superstar so I went in just swatch both of them so right here this is what they look like it doesn't really read glare to me it reads as more of a really pretty electric eye shadow more so than a glitter I'm gonna swatch the Stila one next to it and this to me is much more of a glitter okay guys so here we have we're here this is the Stila one this is a glitter EULA and it was in middle shows when you look at like that it looks like glitter these are more of a pigmented ass-fuck cream shadow this is more of a glitter so to me you guys these aren't really glitters they are more so really beautiful green shadows but they're definitely not what they claim to be they're not glitter eyeshadows like the Stila ones are so that's just what I think personally if you guys think that's glittery by all means awesome go you but to me that's not a glitter that's a cream shadow it doesn't have like micro find and glitter sparkles Oracle's not that so I thought I really wanted to put that on the lid but honestly I don't I rather just keep it on the Shadow Realm so I'm gonna go in with that same silver shadow cuz it is quite beautiful and we're gonna go and put that on the lid and see that's metal oh my goodness is just stunning look at that that is actually stunning Oh mother how she create a formula because I want to know how did you do this definitely it is more of an intense shade it definitely has some fallout that's still with using it with my finger the effect is quite beautiful in them chuckle Wow she's kicking she's kicking huh okay guys so I kinda wanna take it there let's just do it you guys we're having fun we're doing a fucking review why not play with some color so we're gonna take the eyeliner which is $14 and this guy is a bright yellow eyeliner I believe we're just gonna try this out y'all I don't know how it's gonna go I really don't mmm okay so I don't know if it the part itself isn't as pigment as they want it to be or it's the actually no it's pretty pigmented look it's pretty fucking pigmented I think it's more so the fact that I'm using such a bright eyeliner on such a dark eye it's not translating as bright yellow as I wanted to we're gonna have to just build and get it there you don't so far it's really really creamy glides very nicely now is this the most bright yellow eyeliner I've ever worn no it is not but it doesn't gets the job done but it's not my favorite eyeliner ever anyway it's fine I'm just going to finish the other eyeliner off of camera and a little bit maybe I'll do a little bit of yellow in the waterline to I don't know uh see let's see hold on okay bitch we made it fucking work I ended up using the highlighter the loose one on the inner corner to give me a yellow pop there and on the brow bone to give me still a little bit of yellow pop obviously as you guys can see the whole vibe here is yellow and grays and medals and just very like fucking tell me like you will not rule the world with this fucking look at honestly crazy fucking well we are down to the last product and we have three lipsticks right here oh very cute if there's our classic lipstick so let's go and try these out and see what we think I'm gonna swatch all three of them this is a gloss gloss who knew we have the three lipsticks right here each of them are beautiful m-i throat and like this really cool metallized component we have the first shade Nova right here which is in a blue OH oh my gosh do we see the cute lightning bolt in the bullet I can love a little detail so we have right here Nova which is a really deep more so terra cotta pink and this is nova right here as we see it's a very very deep pink we have next okay okay we have nightfall right here holy fuck that's pigmented is fuck look for a black lipstick that's really really nice and now last but not least we have cosmic which is a more Brown tone nude which i think is probably one i'm gonna go to with much more of a cool tone right there we have a cosmic very very pretty so lipsticks you guys retail for $18 which is like a classic lipstick Blin if I get the Mac ones I think are skate een as well so I just feel like that's a classic lipstick and then we have flash gloss right here I want to swatch that do I hate about Patties gloss ones when you first started out it gives you like it's like a little crunch it gives you like a little crunchy I don't know why it I just fucking give it so this is the gloss that gloss is fucking crazy beautiful as like a really beautiful golden purple pink reflection it's all of its like cosmic as fuck it's very flashy gloss you guys retails for $16 that's a very fair price for a glass 16 bucks so let's go ahead and put on we're gonna take this shade see they're very pigmented how don't they say the formula is more of a satin formula it's not more it's not really creamy because there's more pigment than that but it's not I'm not by any means so it doesn't say it's more of a satin finish feels really comfortable on the lips okay we add a little bit just maybe a little bit of flash just like a hair oh I can actually see the pinkness in oh my god I can see it sickening I can see the pinkness in it okay that's what the gloss and this is the face y'all this is the whole face using miss Kylie Jenner weather collection and I feel like I really took the weather the storm the Lightning by the balls you know I was inspired by then I was inspired by name okay so that is it for the entire Tryon portion of today's video that is it for today's mo we did the entire thing I showed you guys swatches I said you guys the makeup on the skin I showed you guys what it look like I'm the fucking daddy and so now we're gonna decide whether or not the collection was worth day what do we think of the collection let's go and break it down because as a whole I think that as a whole the collection is really really pretty I think that it's very very cohesive but there's always some things I would change about the collection personally so let's go and just dive right into that so a loose eyeliner you guys I thought this was really really pretty it's in my inner corner right now it's on my brow bone as well so we gonna give you a really really pretty golden sheen to the skin as you can see it's a golden finish on both of them I'm personally not a huge fan of yellowy highlighter served for me this I would not purchase it myself because I'm not a fan of golden yellow highlighters it wasn't really a hit for me but of course the product itself is very pretty it looks really nice on the skin it's just a personal preference next we have the pressed powder highlighting palette this was an absolute win this is actually probably my favorite product of the entire collection I think it's beautiful it looks beautiful on the skin I think it looks so radiant and so blinding but so like built at the same time it's just stunning now let's go and move on to the palette so you guys saw these palettes honestly him the more I played with them the more I wasn't like the biggest fan to be honest and for me both these palettes were not really a win do the mattes work really nicely yes of course they blend in really pretty they look really nice on the eyes once you get it there but for me it's the color story it's the color scheme I just didn't like the color scheme for these personally you know like this one like this pastel one I didn't really like these shimmery shades I thought they were all kind of too chunky and a little bit too flaky that's like the right where it's too flaky the mats were beautiful but the color scheme I didn't really enjoy for that one and same for this one I didn't really really enjoy this color scheme either I thought was kind of hard to use and it would only be like a cool tone palette I'm not into cool tones personally this look I did of course it's more of a cool tone look it's not my favorite look I've ever done I think it's turned out sickening and I live for it now but I really have like finesse and get there with a butt different shades from this palette for me it's just not a huge win color story-wise next we have the three lipsticks and let's do the same time the eyeliner is not the best eyeliner gonna come see yellow I definitely have tried brighter yellows I think even the color pop one is a little bit brighter than this yellow and is a much cheaper the Inglot light yellow liner is a lot brighter than this a little bit more expensive as well but if you guys are looking for a yellow eyeliner that's gonna work really wide it's gonna stay on your eyes and this one honestly feels really good it's not too heavy does it feel too intense then hey great you guys found a great yellow liner and it is really really cute I love the little lightning bolt on it I personally wouldn't buy it to look at I know of other yellow eyeliners I like a little bit more the lipsticks were a complete win to me I thought they were all so beautiful I love that lightning bolt in the press on the lipsticks I think that's really really well thought-out I think that it's really beautiful and I think it really goes well with the entire color story as well as the three colors it's a blue yellow and gray color story that's the entire color story of the entire collection every lipstick was very pigmented very beautiful the lipsticks were a complete win to me and I thought these were fantastic and last but not least honey we have the gloss we have the fuckin Galatz right here and honestly the gloss grew on me I'm not gonna lie the glass grew on me it just ate every day gloss for me absolutely not this is really intense it's very very vibrant and crazy and it's very electric definitely definitely an electric glass I would not wear this every day but it is very very very cool it's a really cool addition to my collection I don't actually have a gloss color like this at all though it's very very unique to me and that's why I enjoy it so much but is it the most wearable color not really I think it's kind of a harder color to wear when it comes to the gloss spectrum and I like it over top a lipstick maybe not by itself because I think it would be too intense but over a lipstick it's quite stunning so that is it you guys that's it for my entire collection review demo swatches of everything here I hope you guys enjoyed today's video I actually really really love doing more reviews on full collections and things like that I think they're so much fun to review let me know if there are other things you guys would like me to review and try and demo and we can definitely make that happen before I head out of town again but anyway congrats to Kylie cosmetics I think that collection is beautifully done some things were great some things were not so good for me but that's kind of how it is for every collection with any brand that comes out with anything I'm a little bit more hypercritical I am a beauty person on YouTube and so I'm very very very like hyper aware of things and I really like to dive into products and just really go in and hone in on products whether I think they're worth the money or not so that is what I like to do and if some people don't like that I'm sorry and if brands don't like that I'm sorry but that's just kind of what it is that's how my channel will always stay and it's always gonna be like that I'm always gonna be 100% honest with you guys and that's the most important thing to me you know I'm building my own brand in the future and I want to I want you guys to know that I'm gonna try my best to make the products as amazing as possible I want you guys to always know that and I know that I'm never gonna like try to sell you buy something or try to push something that I don't believe in 100% yeah that's never save you guys I myself am bling I time filled in so long I'm just kind of like thank you for the love and support you guys have been so wonderful past couple weeks I know snapchats been such a bitch because it's like change the algorithm and the whole thing changed and I feel kind of disconnected from you guys sometimes because of that change but I know you guys are there and I know you guys are watching him I sort of thank you guys for commenting on videos and tweeting me and Instagram commenting me and damning me on Instagram and just all these different ways you guys get ahold of me because I really do feel the love from you guys and even though a platform might be taken away like snap shower like word stock doesn't feel the same I still feel the love from you guys and I really wanted to say thank you guys for that because it means a lot to me and then I love you guys have a great night or day

out I'm fucking out guys so okay I'm gonna tell you a story of when I was a waiter and this is like my most like embarrassing I can't believe this happened to me but not like not embarrassing at all it was just kind of like I can't believe 70 it's like literally was like a porno so crazy and I worked in a place in Hillcrest in San Diego and that's like the gay area of San Diego so I was like 21 22 thinking I'm hot shit being a waiter and I'm like meeting all these cute boys and I'm just like thinking I'm so fucking cute like a little tween so I had his table and it was a guy in the girl and it was a gay guy and a girl and I knew he was checking me out like the whole time the whole time I was waiting he was checking and I thought he was so fucking fine so I'm like cool every time I would pass by his table oh look at him and he'll look at me and you know that kind of smile and I was kind of smile back just kind of being quirky and cute and like whatever the fuck so the none of the guy gets to their table I serve him a drink to my table would you like and I gave him a little drink a little alcohol wherever the fuck you want it so I'm like okay I have to pee so I go to the bathroom so the restaurant I worked at they did not have a bathroom before the employees and the bathroom for the public right they had all they just had one bathroom and right when I was going into the

just want to try them out they look really really nice two components a beautiful it's a very very heavy I think it looks very classy very chic so we're gonna go ahead and bronze up look at me since I've gotten a little bit dinner my fat here is going down a little which is cool let me see the brush feels very soft very nice quality actually feels very very nice I like this brush a lot more than the last one with the creams I'm gonna take the bronze you shaded a lot of powder comes off which is nice this is the light kit looks very very very orange why you nervous but we'll see how it looks okay everything's blending and very smooth it's not overly pigment oom I'm actually shocked I thought I was gonna be a lot more pigmented cuz I'll block came off on the brush I think it definitely is a little orange not gonna lie it's definitely a little fucking orange but um the brush feels really nice I'm really happy about this Wow so far so good guys I'm really really living okay it feels really good it's not too rough on the face it feels pretty soft and the color pion is great the blend ability is great you can definitely tell a difference you can definitely tell that more bronzy in certain areas which is cool as fuck so when I just grab the door real quick answered the door I'm and where I'm so sorry - the postman Kim K bronzer is really pretty and I'm really fuckin living for it so far so hell yes smells go in contour a little bit we have the cool tone contour shade right there taking this out of morphia y9 great contour brush my should make it under pressure again and blends very very nicely I like that it's more cool tone kind of dials down at the oranjee warmness of the bronzer what do you think now it's go and highlight with one of the shades does one take the lightest shade right here on the same brush I'm not really used to brush this big for a highlight definitely the highlights definitely definitely there it's a very very intense very blinding nice picks up a lot of texture though so this is one of those highlights that will pick up on your texture so just be cautious and be aware of that but the color itself is really pretty not as blinding as I'm used to but it definitely builds very very nicely why should it actually looks really nice down the side of the nose though oh I'll not really do like the Kim contour kids teens are really pretty I think that looks really nice on my skin tones I don't think that the more bronzy shade is a little bit too warm it's a little bit too orange for me I don't think you can make it work for sure so it's not the end of the world but I means also $52.00 of things so you guys have the money for it great awesome fuck yeah if not just pass man there's not something it's all good taking a little bit of some blush this is one wild pearlescent pink oh good I'm still gag at the fact I told you guys about that story about me about my sluttier days I don't know why would I know so I'm adding the shade Uranus on top of my highlight god damn this is the collaboration with me and Geoffrey this is the second round but I'm using this on the top of the cheekbones giving it a little bit of a gold twist this shade guys it's like a beautiful nail gold so it looks like it took a really really pretty paly gold whoo fucking blinding Brit no honestly this is sickening I love it so much I'm so happy we did a second highlighter basically this is the golden sister of Eclipse I wanted to have a pink and a bold I think that B complement skin tones so nicely and I love it the way Uranus looks on the skin it's so blinding and so intense and those are coming at September at 9th in the bundle box so I'm not really sure exactly when this video is going up but we have Uranus in Mianus this King and that's the reason the packaging is a little bit different so we both thought would be really fun to include more of a planetary logo when it comes to the shade Uranus I'm like you know what it applies so nicely let's make it happen and we totally didn't they fucking killed it I love it whole thing I fucking love it I want to mean I wanna die alone so basically this is the face I want to keep it like this I'm gonna do my brows off of camera real quick and I'll be right back okay guys we are back and you and I look I think I want to do something more fun more bold today and a run and this nice neutral transitioning do the grease you guys it's been the craziest fucking month honestly first of all when you talk about the fact that I'm in Sephora representing hoola bronzer that is literally so wild to me on the Q guys understand well it was the first bronzer I ever owned when I worked at Sephora start working in Sephora a couple years back and before that I didn't really know what the fuck I was doing the makeup I had no idea so when I start working in Sephora they gave us hoola bronzer like it was like one of the gratis items so now like looking back and just kind of seeing how crazy it's been like now I'm in the face of it you know in Sephora it's like it's just the craziest thing I cannot benefit and for allowing me to be part of this campaign I talked about it already on snapchat and Twitter and on Instagram everything that that this is basically a campaign that benefits doing with a couple other influencers it's me Geoffrey Laura Nicole and Caryn and Katie I love sunny and it's just a really fun just different campaign you know these are products that we all love that we all use and benefit was like yo the reason we were chosen is because these products are staples for us I don't like people are asking like why other influencers weren't chosen for this but it's like hey we love benefit and we use benefit all the time it's so fucking cool and it's just so rewarding to be able to see that you know I I was told to delete my Instagram for my parents when they saw it really first found me for the first time and it was the most devastating thing that ever happened to me because one of the first times I ever had a real panic attack my parents found out I had a different Instagram when I had a manic MUA Instagram I was devastated full-on like had a panic attack was breathing into a plastic bag I almost went to the hospital because I was so shook I had no idea like they were gonna find it you know I blocked them from it I blocked through everyone's ears names I booked every member of my family I blocked them so going from that point in my life where I was bawling and crying in my room because my parents wanted me to delete my Instagram that had a good amount of followers on and not that many he had a couple thousand it was something also passionate about something I loved doing - going from that point to here where I'm the fucking face of hoola and my parents work for me now or work with me full-time it's just like so beyond bizarre to me guys it's the craziest thing I don't know I feel like good things happen to good people and I feel like I'm a good person so maybe my hate me that many people that shit about me of course I think this is one of those things words like I know in my heart I'm a good person I think good things have happened to me because I think I'm a good person you know to accomplish the things I wanted to accomplish it I want I was any plastic surgeon I was on a very different path than the path I'm on now so you don't need to listen to everyone when it comes to your dreams you know we just follow the dreams that you want to follow like march to the beat of your own drum things will fall into place when you work hard and are passionate about something the passion you have will resonate within others and you will become successful do whatever makes you happy for your future and for your long word and I promise you you'll be a happier person for it if I were to have listened to my parents those several years ago and deleted my Instagram I would not be Who I am today I would have been a completely different person I would have followed a completely different path I just wanted to kind of say that come on here and just talk to you guys about that you know I just feel like it's important to follow your dreams do what you want to do and not always listen to the opinions of others so we are back my camera died so I was kinda like myself to go to out of anti South they fucking clam those that I look is turning out just a fun different just pop of color so lets going to our lashes put some mascara on call it a day you do some lower waterline action real quick just set a little white moment this one wants to make an appearance Lucy hi yeah I miss you so much okay we're almost done guys we're gonna power through do you guys have pets because honestly as soon as I got Zia my life changed for the better I never knew I could love something more than myself for my family like I do with her and it's different because I have selfie and Emmy of course back home in San Diego but honestly I think it's just a little bit different having a family pet and having your own pet like Zia is my actual pet like know if you live with me and Nick was my brother it's a different attachment than I feel then I felt with I mean in Sophie and I don't know why that is I just feel like she's like my personal child you I thought I'm kind of not like do you guys understand one fan and I worry about her every fucking day I can't even let her go outside by herself because I'm scared a hawk is gonna get her like I just can't like I'm just a petrified little parent and I can't imagine having children let's get some lashes on this face on this look good eat that and we'll be right back okay guys so let's go ahead and finish off with the lip and we will be officially done

Hey guys! Welcome back to my channel! So todays video, is gonna be a review video! I love doing random review videos for you guys, you guys always send me random ass things to try out. I get a lot of tweets from you guys saying try random products out. And you guys will tweet me little products and links and things like that. And i will totally go out and i will totally go out and buy them and try them out for you guys And i get SO many tweets about this little sponge and i was like "its a little sponge like why is there a lot of tweets on this??" So that was super super random. But I went out and brought it at Sephora. This is the little 'cake and bake' sponge. This is from Veramona? Where did i buy you from? Yeah! This is from Veramona. This is the 'cake and bake' sponge, i brought this on Sephora's website. So i saw this and i'm like 'a square beauty blender?' This is actually really This is like... ... this is like a really weird shape. What shape is this? Trapazoid? or some type of shit. I was really bad at Geometry, so if you guys know what kinda urrm shape this is let me know in the comments below. Is it like a Rhombus or a Trapazoid of some type or a urrm I know it's not an octagon. So, i decided i wanted to review the sponge. And i was hearing so many different thing about it so i just decided like the 'best' beauty blender type sponge dupe. So i'm like 'Is this really the worlds 'best' beauty sponge of all time?' We will see, we'll check it out right now. This is the size of it, when i opened it right out the box. So as always, if you dont like this video, if you guys dont like me. PLEASE dont fucking watch it! You know know the drill with that. But if you guys do like this video please subscribe to my channel, if you are not already. And if you know whats up, i'm Manny MUA and welcome to my channel thank you SO MUCH for being here And yeah! lets go and get into this review on this quote on quote 'best beauty sponge ever?" We'll see! *introduction* Well guys, first things first we're gonna go ahead ahead and soak this in water. Actually, lets see what it says. Maybe we dont even need to. How to use: Wet 'cake and bake' with water until completely saturated, squeezing out excess liquid and pick up liquid or powder makeup products with a top and bottom flat edge and apply to conceal and or bake. *laughs* Okay, im gonna soak it. I'll be right back! So, i went and i soaked the bad bitch up and i squeezed out all the excess water and this is what it looks like now. It actually really took in so much. Why does this remind me of a fucking cock? mhm I dont know why Thing definitely got a lot bigger, it looks holy shit it got so much bigger. So, what we're gonna do is. We're gonna go ahead and try this bad bitch out and see if it works like a beauty blender or not. Or if its even better than the beauty blender, who knows? We'll see! So we're gonna do our normal routine though guys we're gonna do primer. Benefit Porefessional. We're gonna do it all in the same routine as the usual. So im gonna go in with the 'Wet 'n' Wild photo focus' foundation. I actually brought a new color because all the other colors was a little bit too dark for me, this is in the shade 'shell ivory' again, not the best color selection. This is like the one that was closest possibly to me. So i dont know if it's gonna work out or not, we'll see. I just really like this foundation, i've been wanting to give it more tries but i thought the other ones ahh this looks so white FuUuck *squeaky* fUUCKKK Oh my God, this is so white! Oh my God Okay Mr. Cake 'n' Bake sponge. It says to use the tip. Just the tip. Pick up the liquid or powder makeup products with the top or bottom flat edge and apply, conceal or bake. So I'm going to be using the flat edge, this part here, where it says to use. and I'm just gonna press it in. It's blending in really, really, nicely actually.... Holy fuck. I'm sorry but this can't be my color, I will not fucking allow it. So this is what my face looks like so far with just using foundation. This is what the sponge looks like. I will say that it did apply my foundation pretty fucking nice, like it didn't take away any of my coverage. It's looking pretty fucking snatched. I'm actually really impressed so far and I do like the fact that you can hold it like this. Like, I don't know if this makes sense but I can kinda like grasp it with my finger and press exactly where I want it to be. It's definitely more dense than a beauty blender though. Because there's like a thicker sponge, for sure. Its definitely thicker and more intense but it is very, very soft when it's soaked and i'm not mad at this whatsoever. Let's do some concealer. Now I'm gonna use my classic Tarte Shape Tape. A little bit. I'm running out of concealer as you can see... Go underneath. To be honest, I thought the under eye concealer part was gonna be the worst because of the way this is shaped I'm like, there's no way it's gonna get underneath there. But it's actually going underneath there quite nicely. Like it's going up right to my bottom lash line, and the coverage is still there, it's snatched as FUCK, it's blending out perfectly. Oh my god! It's a little hard to get into the inner, inner corner, right here. This part, I feel, is a little tough to get into. Also another thing I really like about this is that because it is slanted on the edges, you can go like this, and like kinda really go up there and clean up the contour on the nose. If you guys like kinda wanna highlight the sides of the nose a little bit as well. That's really fucking cool! I will definitely say that. Okay so far I am pleasantly surprised. I'm not gonna lie. I feel like I am usually pretty hard on products when I do full reviews on them. This is actually really impressing me so... Go Veramona! So now I'm going to take the other side and put the powder on it. And I'm going to go ahead and cook, or I'm just going to go ahead and apply powder and see how the powder applies with the sponge. It applied beautifully, oh my god! Oh mah god. It goes right up to the lash line, which means it goes right up to the wrinkled creases which is really, really nice. Then I'm taking my face powder and I am gonna put it everywhere else that I used the RCMA underneath the eyes. Then I am taking the Cover FX for the rest of the face. And this is my face completely set and bitch that shit is fucking set to the ground, I'm sorry. I could run out into the rain and be good 
I feel bad hey guys welcome back to my channel so as you can see I'm like a little different we have the amazing the astounding the talented the beautiful lipstick Nick you're like yeah we be going so

do it this year I haven't done one of these in like five years yeah their favorite thing to do they're so fun because you get to shade and it's like poppy but yeah cartoony and like kind of my favorite thing in the world we're going with the teal color scheme yes I love it use the wolf brothers paints these are water activated water activated right it's literally like kids face paints it's good for adults really and it's not as it's like really come you know genic like would clog all my pores no it's water-based so it just should just wash right off it's not like anything harsh it's gonna be like stuck in there okay the first thing I'm gonna do is take a gray mm-hmm and I'm gonna use this no kind of make my outline you guys McCoy's literally the cream of like fun things oh my god it's so late cuz I don't want to do anything dark like if I use a black right now yeah you'll be fun no yeah cuz then they'll all start to mix with the black it's a grey ZZ ZZ whoa cool nose rather when you're doing these kind of shapes you want to keep them really organic looking so I'm not gonna just make them perfect it's okay if your brush kind of like wiggles and wobbles cuz supposed to look like torn flesh okay got it got it so that's it's like it's like an easy it's like a more easy yeah so it's not like when people like I can't do that I'm like actually probably good okay I'm gonna kind of cut into your lip a little bit oh it's so pretty that color ah morphe s3 use cutting man anyway mmm-hmm oh my gosh we're hey we're painting oh my goodness and never did anything this is so exciting [Music] it's not yeah usually I mean like I apply like foundation like it literally is not ever an issue for me sometimes these paints just they won't look as vibrant yeah but this color actually no matter what it's good yeah so if I like where this out for example like and I sweat it would come up yeah this is not like the type it's not like a rave makeup or like yeah okay we got our base going it's looking good looking snatched looking like pussy yeah like that dead whoo we're using that pink paint how cute you want to like use your lightest colors first yeah so doesn't like mix and yeah [Music] this is so fucking unique like I'm like I'm dying already already already it already see it good it's already coming to light it might be a good model you're being a great model ooh there's gonna be super pink closest to the teeth but I'm leaving a little space around the teeth for my black outline because you always make a pox yeah to me a pop so little pink and is not to be perfect and then I'm gonna feed this into a red and that's not good yeah well I'm like shocked that they're just these are just paint brushes that I'm using from you different Hobby Lobby okay cute it's a mud brush just like a little pointy blender this will help me to kind of blend the two together yeah just like you would eyeshadows these come together do you want to try try what yeah yeah no me too your tuna yeah and then just kind of underneath okay making a little break [Laughter] on teeth with black [Music] mmm that closure let me take that little blending brush I'm just buff out the black to you before it dries so you want to do is kind of fast before the block dries yeah it's just one tooth yeah that's like a bottom row yeah I think I you know I shouldn't dig your brows no yeah there's like sparse supernatural just a hint you do live so fast like it's ridiculous for the blood I just got really excited mmm yeah oh my god so 10 tea so now we're outlining who's knowing I'll let

more definition yep okay so what I just did - was on the inside of these little tears I just shaded it a little bit over the teeth so you can see it kind of looks like more three-dimensional mm-hmm looks good yeah like you what's that wrong yeah see that on all of them so the brains I mean it's just what's to look like gooey little screen yeah so it's like just little squiggles got it and

Hey Guys, welcome back to my channel. See I laughed that time,
because the last one I didn't I'm gonna be filming my March
favourites today. You guys know I love doing favourites video. They're my favourites to film. Zeya just jumped
on my lap, I’m gonna pick her up. So, today I’m really filming my March
favourites and my misses or my disses or my hates
or disappointments. Any of those descriptions works just fine. But I have two disappointments in today's video
and I have a couple of favourites of course. So, if you guys wanna see what made
the favourites and the disappointments. Continue to keep on watching. As always, if you guys don't like this video,
if you guys don't like me Please don't fucking watch it,
you know the drill. But if you guys do like this video, please subscribe
to my channel if you aren't already. And if you’re new, what’s up! I'm Manny MUA
and welcome to my channel. Thank you so much for being here,
I really appreciate it. But yeah, let's go ahead and get into this March
favourites and disappointments video. Okay guys. So, first things first,
we're gon.na go into our favourites. I actually wanna say one thing real quick. My first favourite is my hair, a lot of you guys
know recently that I got hair surgery. And my hair has not grown in all the way of course,
it's been only a couple months. But, you can see the little hairs here, that are
just really cute and starting growing. I also have Toppiks in my hair,
because it's kinda patchy still. So, I have some Toppik spray in my hair, but it's like
actually starting to come in and this is so crazy. I'm so excited. This is like a life-changing
thing for me. Also because I care about my hair
bad my hairline before and now I’m actually starting to have a hairline
that is not so far back like I was having. This is the first time I’m filing and feeling
comfortable without wearing a hat. So, this is like a pretty big deal. This is a pretty
big deal to me right now. So, Yeah, my hair is actually starting to come in
finally and I cannot be more excited. So, the first favourite of the month I have
to say, is this bad bitch right here. This is the Anastasia x Nicole Guerriero Glow Kit. I've actually used every single colour, but mostly
I use Kitty Kat and Forever Lit. Those are the ones that work on my skin
tone the most, I'm actually wearing Kitty Kat and Forever Lit on
my cheeks right now. I've been wearing this glow
kit guys so frequently. I just think it's absolutely beautiful
and honestly the colours are so bright, so vibrant,
so intense and so reflective. And you can apply a little bit to get a small shine
and if you want to apply a lot more, you can get a really intense,
beaming from outer space. You can get that if you guys wanted to,
that's why I really like it so much. And honestly, huge shout to Nicole
Guerriero for creating this. I love Nicole Guerriero,
she's absolutely a bomb. I've seen her at a couple events recently, and it's just
been so cool because she's so down to earth. So laid back, so cool and I can easily
see myself hanging out with her on the regular basis if she lived in California. So, I just like her a lot and I think it's so amazing that
she came out with such an amazing product. The colours are fantastic; the colour
scheme right here is fantastic. So, congratulations again to Nicole and Anastasia
for creating an amazing palette. The next product is a bit of an expensive one. So, this is La Mer Soft Fluid Foundation. This foundation, I’ve been wearing every single time
I’ve been doing foundation other then today, because I filmed this look
already with a purpose. This is gonna be going up soon. This foundation gives you a beautiful
lightweight to medium coverage finish. Beautiful on the skin, it just gives you this crazy
glowy, almost mannequin-like finish. I don't even understand it,
it's absolutely beautiful. Whenever I’m wearing it, I’m like "Wow, dude, wow!
This is absolutely amazing on my skin". I get so many compliments when
I’m wearing this foundation as well. But, I have to go in with a fuller
coverage foundation underneath it. Just to cover up my more rough patches
(my rough patches are there). For example, I’ll take like the hourglass
vanish and put it on my cheeks a little bit on my forehead, on my T-zone. And then I’ll go in with the soft fluid over it,
and it just looks so freaking beautiful. It's so expensive though,
it's like a hundred bucks. Get a sample of it at Nordstrom, I think Nordstrom
does samples I’m not really sure. I think they have La Mer there as well,
but if you guys can just try a sample out. Have them pump like two puffs into a foundation
sample and try it out, it works on my skin. Even though I am more combo oily,
and it works really, really nicely. I'm like "Honestly, that foundation
is expensive, but it's good". Next, I have a drug store item which
actually really I’ve been liking. This is the Milani Make It Last Setting Spray. This is the prime correct and set setting spray. I just really like this because I do notice
a major difference when it comes to longevity of my foundation
and keeping my face on longer. I was like "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...",
when I first sprayed this and I tried it on. I did notice that my face was set and didn't get as oily
as fast as the usual setting sprays do on me. And I was like "Whoa, Milani". This does have a lot of alcohol in it though,
it's like the second ingredient is alcohol. But, alcohol make things last on the skin,
that's just what it is. Alcohol is a lasting ingredient. On liquid lipstick, alcohol is a major ingredient because it has to dry it down and stay on your
lips for longer periods of time usually. So, it's just one of those things that's like
you have to give and take. Yes, alcohol is drying on the skin. But, if you want your make up to last long
it needs to be in a setting spray. And if you guys are looking for a good drugstore
setting spray that work really nicely, I’d suggest the Milani Make It Last Setting Spray. Because it's fucking bomb. Next item I want to talk about
is this product by Benefit. This is the Hoola Quickie Contour Stick Okay guys. There is actually a funny
story behind this product. I personally, the first time I tried it,
I didn’t like it. I was like... It just wasn't that great to me. I was like.... "You know it's nice, it gives like a soft light-weight
amount of colour I suppose". But it wasn't like that howling. I did like a couple dots like I usually do,
like I would do a cream contour. I did like one, two, three. one, two, three... And I blended it, and it blended away
completely. And I was like... And then I was telling my other friends
in the beauty industry about it, and I’m like "Have you guys tried this, does it work,
does it work nicely on you guys?" And they were like "Yeah, we love it...". And I was like "Well, how are you using it?". And they were like "You have to use it a little bit more
product than you would think" and I’m like "Okay". So then I tried it, and I did like a swipe
and this colour is so beautiful. It blended out beautifully
as I knew it would, because it blended out to nothing
the first time I tried it. And it just left that beautiful
amount of colour. I'm gonna show you guys what
the colour looks like right here. It's literally Hoola in a cream form. Hoola bronzer by Benefit which is
such a popular bronzer. And as you can see, it blends so easily.
It's like shockingly so. I wouldn't say this is a contour, I would definitely say
this is more of a bronzing natural type thing. I just like to use it underneath my contour, because it would make it last so much longer
I’d have a darker base underneath. And this really does work so nicely. And you guys already know I love Hoola.
I've loved Hoola for as long as I can remember. Since I’ve started using makeup,
I loved Hoola bronzer. The box of powder from Benefit and when they
came out with the quickie contour stick, I was like "Please let me love it". Didn't at first, but now I’m like obsessed,
I’ve used it so many times. Just got a couple more favourites I promise, just a couple more. I wanted to talk about this lip mask that
I’ve used since I worked at Sephora. I've talked about it before, I think once. But I’ve used it so often that I just forget
that it's part of my routine. Oh my God, I should like talk about this. This is the BITE Agave Lip Mask, this has
been out for so long, like for years. I would put this on at night,
every single night. And I would wake up and I still
have some product on. Like, it literally leaves my lips feeling
so supple, so moisturized. Made in Canada. Good shit's in Canada. This is very, very heavy by the way. This is not a soft chap stick;
this is like a heavy lip mask. It's very viscous, it's like very--as you
can see, it's very, very intense. It's a full mask treatment. I won't really wear this
during the day, because it's so heavy. But, if you guys want something
that's really hydrating and would actually work and really
hydrate your lips at night. So when you wake up with your
lips feeling so plump and moist. Check out the Agave Lip Mask by BITE. You will not regret it. So, this is actually like an oldie but goodie. And actually, it's newbie to me because I never
used this before this last month and half. And everyone talked about it
all the time, but I never used it. But, I love it. This is MAC Painterly Paint Pot I'm not really gonna talk about it, because it's like Manny really "everyone
knows MAC Painterly Paint Pot". It's such an amazing eye base.
This one is great for using on glitter. This is not really a silicone eye primer, this is like a base just to adhere
your make up on a little bit longer. And it's great for glitter, especially the stiller
glitters that I wear all the time Like the Stila Magnificent Metal Glitter. I wear those all the time and this is the only
primer that really, really keeps it on without flaking off. If I’m using my silicone one, it's so flaky
and it comes off because, I guess the silicone and the glitter
does not mingle well. So, I started using MAC Painterly
Paint Pot and honestly, I love it. It's so easy to use, I just dip my finger in and
just pat it all over my lid and its cake. I never used this when I worked at MAC,
I only ever used concealer to prime. So, now that I’m using it I’m like,
"I should've used it more". And last but not least, is actually
the lipstick I’m wearing right now. This is my number one lipstick right now;
you guys have no idea. This is the Tarte Color Splash Lipstick
in Beach Bum. This is like the new line of lipstick that
they came out with. This is like a, very pretty satin finish lipstick.
It's very creamy, but so pigmented. It's not like one of those creamy ones that are
like kinda pigmented, this is really pigmented. Super, super, super pigmented. Very hydrating on the lips and it lasts
a good amount of time as well. I just think Tarte did a really great job
with these lipsticks in general I forgot what the line is called,
I’ll leave it linked down below. It's like the--I don't remember, maybe
it's like the Oceanic or Aquatic or something like that, because it's like
marbled blue, it looks like the ocean. Beach babe is so, so beautiful on the lips. And if you guys can, check this out. This has been my go-to colour and you guys
know I love colours like this. But this one, I’m like the way it feels on the lips,
it's so hydrating, so full coverage. I'm like... ”me encanta”. And now, for the monthly disappointments. They happened, I can’t help it So, first disappointment I have for the month
of March is this from Too faced I'm sure you guys were guessing
that this was going to be in... The is the Love Light Prismatic Highlighter
in shade You Light up My Life. Honestly, I don't like any of the three, but this is just the gold one cos i grabbed it,
it's the closest to me. I was disappointed in these because they weren't
as pigmented as I wanted them to be. It took me about four to five layers to get
to the opacity that I wanted them to be. They swatch nicely, I think
they swatch very pretty and I’m like “Oh my God, they look so nice
on the skin and they look pretty". But, on the face they don't react the same way,
and I’m like "I don't understand this". Why is it that they are not blinding
and pretty on the face, but on the hand or on the swatch
in the finger, they look great? It's just not registering,
and they're I think thirty bucks. So, it's like for the price
it's not worth it. I think the packaging is fantastic and I think
the press inside of it so cute. There's things about it that I think
are amazing and I’m like "Oh my God, this is the cutest
packaging ever". But, for the price, I was just really
disappointed with the amount of pigmentation you get from this and the amount
of glow you get from them. You have to really, really build on them. And I don't wanna build, I ain't bob the builder,
I don't wanna build. And for the next disappointment. This is the Estee Addict; this is the Fluid Metal
eyeshadow in the shade Don't Be Afraid. Girl, I’m afraid. My friend actually told me about his one, I don't wanna call her out because
I don't wanna be a shady bitch. Bur, she told me told me about this shadow
and she was like "Dude, this is so terrible". And I’m like "Really?". Tried it out and I was like... I then realized the gag was real. The reason I didn't like it is because
of how sheer and just terrible they are. Looking at it in the actual tube, I’m like "Oh my God, this is
a beautiful colour, this is great". And the outer stick be a really
pretty purple glittery shade, it's actually black and
purple glitter in it. The gag is real when it completely
sheers to nothing. maybe this is formulated weird, but of you move
the wand too much it will really break apart everything. I think the only way to make this
work is to like pat it on your lid and do different things
to try to make it work. But, it honestly not worth it,
it's not worth this. Look at this, this is just swatch. If you guys have had any luck with them, let me know
in the comments bar below and any luck with this. I like when you guys tell
me that a product that I didn't like worked for you and why it did,
and how it did. So, if you guys like either of these products,
let me know in the comments bar below. Maybe I’m just using them wrong. And yeah guys, that's it for the entire video. I hope you guys had fun watching my March
favourites and disappointments of 2017. I cannot believe that we're already
getting into April. My birthday is April 4th, it's literally
coming up in like five days. My birthday is in five days. I'm not a big birthday person by the way,
I'm not a big birthday celebrator. I'm not like I wanna party and do
a huge thing, I’m not that person. I'm just more of like a let's just chill, lay back,
like go to a small dinner with my friends. I do not like to party whatsoever. This year is gonna be different because of my collaboration
launch party with Jeffree on the 4th. So, it just so happens to fall

I can't speak right now, I’m so sorry. So, if you guys want to see what
my ma... what I’m made... Hey you, honestly. Stop. 
hey guys welcome back to my channel so today's video I am so excited to be doing oh my god I actually have not filmed a video in quite a minute I was actually in Hawaii the last week and I've just kind of been on vacation and kind of thing in January was just such a fun month like it was such a vacation month for me February is not the case I'm actually traveling so much if everywhere I'm going to Vegas went to New York I'm going to San Diego I'm going to Utah potentially there's gonna be a big month in February so I thought I would pre film and do a couple other things and get some shit going anyway you guys so I actually filmed a video a while back talking about original verses ripped off makeup products I will leave that link down below if you guys don't know what I'm talking about basically it was me reviewing products like the original product versus they ripped off a dupe of the product and I thought it would be really fun to do a part two of that video I actually got such a great positive feedback from the first one so I'm like you know what let's fuckin do it again I'm actually really excited I got a couple items here that I really wanted to test out and try out just so like at least like swatch or something to see the comparison between the two all the Dukes items I got from the hush app there's an app called hush and there's like a lot of products on there there's a lot of makeup products that are basically like dupes for higher end brands I'm not gonna get into it I think about it just yeah I'll talk about a little bit later but that is what today's video is going to be we're going to be talking about these dupes these ripoffs versus the original makeup item and we will see what do we think of the items I've not tried any of these products out just yet wants to try them on camera for the first time but yeah let me stop rambling going into this shit I feel like I haven't filmed in so long so I just wanna do like a lot of hand motions a lot of one of these one of these or one of these as always you guys do like this video because there's not like me please don't fucking watch it you know the drill with that but you guys that do like this video please go ahead subscribe to my channel if you're not already and if you know what's up a many MUA and welcome to my channel but yeah it's gonna get into today's video [Music] PS my spray tan I got spray tan and it's like obviously getting fucked up because I've had it for on for like over a week now and it's like I'm in scrub I will get I will deal with that later so I have four items here that are the items I'm going to be talking about I got these items from the hush app so before I get into I just want to talk about it really really quickly it isn't half that you can get like makeup and whatnot that a cheaper price I don't think anything I bought was over $10 and honestly I am here for the discount I'm so here for I think it's amazing I think that if you're able to sell makeup at a discounted rate like if your example if you have like a really great connection in China and they make your makeup and they make your packaging they make everything and you can't afford to make a product for ten dollars to sell it for $10 that is incredible and I would absolutely do that too if I had that ability and I had these connections and China that I don't have them yet I will for my brand in the future if I had them I would absolutely utilize it however my big issue with this is I do think that they're ripoffs I think that it's really kind of fucked up that hey Brian is stealing the concept of a product or a pout or something and putting it into their own and making it a lot cheaper I don't think it's very fair because a brand works hard at creating this one specific concept I get it I work hard on my concept I'm sure I'll get copied in the future or whatever with things that I've done but I just want you guys to know it does really suck for the brand I think it's unfair for them and even though I do get the fact that it's like oh my god was cheaper I don't have a lot of money to spend on the original and whatnot I get that dude I get that I've been there I've been that bitch I have been that fucking bitch but the end of the day come up with your original palette your original ideas and produce those you don't need to copy a complete other palette it's just not fair to me so that's just my opinion on it personally before I even get into this video that's what I wanted to say if you don't agree with me that's totally fine that is an opinion that's the beauty of an opinion anyway so let's go and talk about the first one I have to highlighting pallets that I wanted to talk about first and I have two eyeshadow palettes that when it's not going on so the first things first is the I'm Nastasia and Nicole Guerrero palette this palette mmm this is literally one of my favorite palettes non-saucy has ever done like it's literally just godly and the cool Guerrero they fucking just killed it it's so good and the hush one that I picked up is this one the Rose a highlighting collection so these are the two palettes and obviously they don't look that similar when you're looking like this is like oh they're both pink great it's when you open up the palette that you're like like you like you almost want to gag so then you look at this do you think wow wow wow so when looking at the two pallets collectively together they are not in the exact same order which is why I think they get away with it but they have the exact same colors in it where I'm like bitch you can buy this for like ten dollars I'm gonna go and try them out I'm really really curious about it they're not called the same things which is great I'm like thank you God if they wear we're gonna go in and apply these on the face and see which is a better one we're gonna swatch a couple so we're gonna take the rip-off one first and we're gonna swatch it when to swatch all day Cheers oh my god that feels fucking good okay but I'm honestly truly from the bottom of my heart I'm a little gagged I'm not I'm not kidding you I did not expect for it to be as smooth and creamy and pigmented as they are of course honest Asus they feel absolutely amazing I'm gonna swatch the exact same for it's actually crazy that the anasazi ones don't even feel as smooth or as creamy as the other one that's really fuckin rude but they're just as blinding and just as stunning actually I think a little bit more blending so these are the four from the UH Nastasia kit so we're gonna match them up if these four versus these four oh my god yes oh my goddess both stunning of both blinding shockingly similar as we can see of course the hush app1 is obviously a complete ripoff of the Anasazi one there's no denying it there's no denying it you rip the bitch off I mean the quality I'm truly shocked at how nice it was so anyway I'm gonna go and apply one on one side one on the other side I'm gonna apply kitty cat that was my favorite one I'll be honest I said once I'm taking the anasazi one I'm applying kitty cat right here on the cheeks and I'm taking a more feet r31 I just been really liking this kind of brush for highlighter recently I've also been using it to like apply a blank shadow to my lid after I'm done priming I just like I don't know bitch this color is actually everything and then take a little bit of glow getter on top now or take the other side of my going with the same thing we're gonna take all day which is that quip okay picked up a lot more it's more pigmented than the anastasi one but that's not always a good thing it's definitely not image means there's a lot more power that comes up so let's see how it actually applies and see if it applies nicely does it not play nicely who fucking knows fuck that's good bitch I'm sorry but the bitch is unclocked able like it just is one take a little bit of bubbly there's that we did on the other one playing top also this brush is great for Denethor on occasion you take down the side both blinding both stunning they look honestly on this skin bitch they looked exactly the same okay so the Rose a highlighting palette retails $10 and I'm just really shocked at how nice and as a mirror and it's fucking like sturdy so fucking it's a heavy bitch like this is a big fucking whore so far one-for-one I would say this is actually a really really really really good dupe for the Nastasia Nicole Guerrero and honestly I didn't want to like it I really didn't because I thought I think it's not fair that they copied it but the end of the day this is I mean I'm youtubers I'm going to do full time I'm gonna be honest and honestly it works very well next pal I want to talk about is another highlighting palette that I got from the hush app so we have paradise highlighting kid versus hooter 3d pad I think it in golden sands are y'all Steven what I've seen are y'all seeing what I'm seeing obviously this one's in a circle form this is in a square form as a mirror that we're gonna go ahead and swatch a couple of these guys and see what we can we take the hush one first we're gonna see what oh my god it's a fucking it's a fucking could I meet that is a cream just like the fucking hooter one it's a cream okay well that's so fuck that okay go ahead we're gonna swipe the cream first cream down we got the cream me it's a little too pigmented where it's like goddamn like it like this chunks up fuck me dude fuck me dude okay here the four swatched right here so I think okay now we're gonna swatch the hood i'm swatching the Fiji Fiji is the cream this one's actually a different color which is great that's a fucking ugly color no shade no shade it's just ugly let's go and swatch Seychelles oh these feel amazing Seychelles Tahiti we have hush right here we have CUDA right there I can see they're a little bit different they're not crazy different but they're definitely different enough where it's like oh when swatching knows as well they spelt amazing just like the UH Nastasia tube that they did as well so hmm the website I don't like ten minute it's another way in Finnish okay bitch okay I'm also putting a little bit of oh my god putting a little bit of the UM rosy X under stuff to highlighter on my mate bitch if y'all don't get this I swear to god you are missing out or not always thinking they gave me that go away it's like right at the brink of too much but then okay guys so now that we are done with the highlighters we finished off with the highlighting pellets both of them were actually worked very well and I'm shocked that they worked so well I am shocked because it's like oh we have two eyeshadow pots I really really wanted to compare really quickly so first ones first we have the hardest Pro palette and we have the Amazonian clay palette see this is dark right here this is where we get a little fucked because obviously tart is known for their Amazonian clay it's literally called Amazonian clay palette the tardis pro palette and this is the on Amazonian clay palette $29 palette so then you open up the tar one and you're gonna be a little gags cuz you look at the tar one and you're like oh my word spending this is actually a beautiful palette I love this one I was on the trip in Bora Bora when they launched this palette and it was everything so this is the dupe 2 palette and this is the Tarte one bitch are you fucking kidding me you're that girl I knew you were so it's going to swatch a couple of the Tarte real shades I'm gonna swatch the exact same colors from the fake one we're gonna take it trendy which is a beautiful fuckin shade oh my word so here we have four eyeshadows from the Tarte palette this is them right here they're honestly they're so beautiful I absolutely loved this Tarte palette so much when it came out I was losing it all the time so let's go ahead and swatch oh my god oh this is even this isn't even worse the shades on here ethereal glam minx trendy ethereal glam minx trendy even that's when you know we're starting to get a little Christ thing we're not wearing let's watch them let's see so now we're gonna go in and show the comparison swatches right here so this is the other side this is the duped side this is the original site actually I hope you guys can see what the original is so much more rich in color and pigment this side is literally just like that like ugly stepsister of the other one and this one I would actually say is there's really really shitty Dube it's not like the other two highlighting palettes where is actually good dupe where I was like oh bitch like I'm like show this one is like pretty bad actually this one is not very very good this one actually feels very cheap it alone feels like nothing like there's learning nothing in here you're gonna fucking frisbee the bitch out to like space the shadows are not nearly as pretty they don't feel nearly as good they don't give as much color payoff as the Tarte one I'm glad to say that with this one this comparison the Tarte one bitch the Tarte one slays cool we got one that's so cool there's another gag we have the UH Nastasia subculture palette which as we know was kind of a mess it's actually Lauren shielding borrow it as we can see this is a mess this is the original subculture not one of the newer ones this is an original subculture I'm talking oh gee powdery as fuck like goddamn but then we have the retro love obviously it's arranged differently we know this it's arranged differently really one swatch a couple of these as well and we're just gonna sing we're gonna swatch : we're gonna put on right hand and see how it compares with V it's like shocking me so I forget every time I swatch it I'm like oh my god okay so now let's go and swatch the other ones what's the flower oh okay I'm digging into the retro love one and feeling it you guys holy shit it feels like butter more buttery than modest awesome I'm nuts for short it literally feels like a cream like I don't even know if I can explain are you joking me right now like are you actually joking me no we got the swatches on you guys so we have original we have uh Nastasia right there this is the Anasazi one right here four shades are here five shades are here and we have the doomed one right here which is actually scarily accurate with the dupe actually the dupe one this side the shimmers are better than these two phenomena see one what the fuck I'm a little shocked Kirra you guys I went in and I zoomed in for this part random sign oh I completely forgot to mention this basically all of these three that I pulled earlier are from the brand bad habit they are not from hush technically hush is like a online retailer I like completely forgot to mention this I kept singing it like basically thinking of it as like hush was the one else producing this that's not the case bad habit is the brand that's actually creating these dupes bad habit but haven't hush actually just carries them they sell a ton of different brands on their app the tart dupe is from the brand o : that was a flop don't fuck with that one anyway you guys so I just wanna talk about this really quickly the retro Left palette the a subculture dupe is also from the brand bad habit the bad habit ones honestly quality is very very very very good the packaging is very good so it's very like so anyway I'm just gonna do a quick I I want to do a comparison between both sides like I want to do like a boom of the right of subculture and a boom of the left of the subculture just kind of things like that to see how different they actually end up looking so we're gonna go right on in we're gonna take the shader Roxy from the UH Nastasia palette and that's gonna go I'm gonna do it on the right I would follow you guys it's fucking real I'm sorry it's really real we're gonna just take that I'm gonna do like a really fun just peachy easy kind of thing you know it's quick easy it's so wildly pigmented this shade so we did Roxy and put that in the crease this is what it looks like it's very pigmented I literally did one dip now we're gonna take flower power also oh my god Oh miss mama absolutely not just as fallout II as the UH Nastasia one holy shit they said let's we really really really want to come from an associate let's be just as powdering in just a small huh you were not playing with this do for you so far I'm not having any problems like it's literally like I almost look a little bit darker like it's blending like as you can see this one is not pigmented as the Anasazi one it's more like a a like wash of color rather than like an actual intensely pigmented treat like that one okay I'm gonna go back in the shade and really try to over saturate the brush and really trying to get a color down okay guys so as we're going in with the shade so this one actually the one from the retro love I actually like it more because it blends a little bit easier as you see like when you're putting it down it's harsh line when you put it down it doesn't blend out as easily but the one from bad habit actually did now let's go in with a deeper color okay we're gonna take the shade rock and roll from the retro left palette we're gonna put that down but honest okay this is not working out for me this is a hard note for me right now I don't like how this looks it's like doesn't it doesn't blend as easily it's too much honestly there's a such thing as too much pigment there is definitely such a thing so far that bitch is going out oh my god let's take all-star from the Anastacio palette all-stars more pigmented than fuck another one and that one was already able to his funk again this is another too pigmented moment right now you guys as you guys can see as I'm doing the makeup you can see what the honest Stassi want is so much more rich in color which is great because it's like bitch that's right the fucking original has more color now just going with one final look we're just you like a shimmery one we'll take the one from the retro love and put a little in that's really pretty it's actually funny because the shimmers of this palette are so much nicer okay so let's go and take adorn on the right side there's no while like much of a blatant copy this is it like is weird that's all we need to do we don't need to do any more okay we've gotten our fucking verdict on that one okay bad habit sign right there not nearly as pigmented and we have the UH Nastasia side which is so fucking crazy pigmented from the mattes at least I will admit though honestly the retro love the mattes yes they aren't nearly as pigmented as the UH Nastasia ones are but they do blend quite nicely I have to admit like they blend it out pretty well not like amazing we're like oh my god this is a shot I've ever used but it definitely buns out well enough where you're like oh so I will say honestly that the retro love is another dupe for the necessities of culture it's not gonna be nearly as pigmented it's not gonna be as intense but it's 10 bucks Donna saucy ones 42 you really just can't really mean it and yet you guys that's it for today's video I tested out these products here that I was very fuckin curious about and I will admit the stuff from bad habit shook me to the core I'm shocked at how nice their quality was and how cheap and affordable it was again this is a personal thing I do think that it's kind of fucked for them to even do this in the first place and copy other brands as work yes I get that it's cheaper I fucking get it but it's still you can be original and be cheaper today if you guys do want any of these products like the highlighters and things like that I mean you will get nice quality you really fucking will and it's shocking but it really really did work out and honestly hush they delivered my stuff when I ordered it they delivered it he was in like three days it was a really really quick shipping and it was just it was all wrapped in bubble wrap it was actually really really well done so congrats to the hush app they are really really great and they do sell a lot of reputable brand stuff as well on there if you guys are interested checking them out this is not sponsored by hush in any way but I just wanted to say that to you guys yeah anyways that's it for today's video please have fun watching as always have a great sudden night or day wherever you guys are and I will catch you guys in my next video bye guys I love you look how fucked up my spray tan is you guys see how fucked up my spray tan is right now like are you seeing this I don't know that's a too by the way so I have this tattoo here I want one right here should I got it love meat on this body there's a lot of fucking me are you kidding I just started it I keep doing this other way that's the beauty of an opinion everyone has one they're like assholes everyone's got one so not always that pretty so when you look at this palette they're not in the exact same order which is the why I feel like they can't avoid I just want to dive in the water take what it would take it as you want are you fucking gay who said let me not only do Boop let's make it a little bit better I'm quite curious about this oh we're just gonna dip on and we're gonna dive on and we're gonna jump on in we're gonna hop on in we're gonna hop scotch me and you guys that's it that's it for today's video that's all I have to do this 
Hey guys that welcome back to my channel so today's video is been woo It has been a highly anticipated video I have been actually. I tweeted the other day, and I asked you guys if you guys wanted to see me do a worst of 2017 makeup video and actually did one of these last year and I completely forgot that I did it and I went and I watched it. I was like oh my god. I totally did this last year. I completely forgot. I thought it would be really, really fun to do another one. I fucked up in not, in doing this year's video because the things that I hated I didn't put them in like a big basket or a big pile or Something where I could actually go back and find them I was such an idiot. I did not even think of that. I've had people that do these videos like they're smart and they see something that they don't like and they put it in a little pile for this end of the Year video and I Completely did not do that so I'm missing some of the items I'm gonna be talking about but I will be inserting a photo in the video so you know what I'm talking about and I do have like some replacements here that can just show you like so you can get The idea of what I'm talking about it's not confusing I just confused myself But anyway today's video is going to be my least favorite products of 2017 and I just wanted to Disclaim in today's video just because these products are in this video It doesn't mean they hate the brand these are just things that didn't work out for me personally Because it does not work for me does not mean It's not gonna work for you, or if you have it doesn't mean you need to stop using it or anything like that I just want to talk about that really quickly because I feel like a lot of people will get like "I like that though" you know what I mean? So, I'm like My god you guys like my little glitter ombre? It's like a little silver glitter into a black glitter. *moans* anyway guys That's what today's video is going to be as always if you guys do not like this video if you guys do not like me Please don't fucking watch it. You know the drill with that, but if you guys do like this video Please go ahead and subscribe to my channel if you're not already and if you're new what's up,  I'm Manny MUA And welcome to my channel. Thank you so much for  being here. I really appreciate it Yeah, it's going to get into 2017's most disappointing, worst of makeup products Okay, let's talk about this first and foremost, this was like the biggest brush fail of the entire year These are the Kylie cosmetics brushes And the reason I'm putting them in the worst of pile. I mean technically it's not a makeup Item, but it is in the makeup world, It's a brush set and the reason this is going in to my disappointment Video is because of the price point technically the brushes technically did work. I cannot say that they did not work They definitely definitely did but the price point was so high and just wasn't cool You know I mean like I was kind of annoyed by it And it actually cracks me up Because there was people that were talking shit about youtubers doing the videos on the Kylie cosmetics brushes saying that we are like Just doing it for attention and that the brushes were so good and blah blah blah We're just having an ulterior motives promoting our own thing. At the end of the day for me. I mean I can't speak for anyone else for me I'm going to be honest no matter what it doesn't matter who's behind the brand. It doesn't matter if someone thinks I'm negative it doesn't matter to me at all actually. I don't give a flying fuck I'd want to say that this was a flop for me because of the price point the brushes did work But I just think the price point was really really unfair and at the end of the day, I have your guys's back I had the consumers back, and you guys love with these brushes I'm so happy you guys did because you guys spent your hard-earned money on them okay cool so next item that I was not loving in 2017 Was this guy right here, this is the Too Faced peach mist mattifying setting spray. Okay, honestly the entire Peaches-and-Cream Collection wasn't like the biggest hit for me I also really didn't like the highlighters like the little putty highlighters that had a peach on them I did like the peach palette thought that was really pretty and it smells great I felt when I sprayed this on my face my face looked like it was going to crack off and the fine lines were so Intense like the whole thing was just really really bad, and I was like why does my face look so fucking fucked? And I think it's because of how mattifying this spray was like I get a mattifying spray don't get me wrong. I'm oily I'll spray some mattifying spray on for sure But this was like to a whole other level where I was like can I have some of my oils back please? Like it was really rough for me, and it's sucks because it smells so good Fuck me And I was so bummed because actually really really like the way the smelt and the way it applied the mist Beautiful mist, look at that fucking mist. Ah! It just did not work for my skin and, I don't know who's skin it would work for to be really honest. This was by far like, the worst product 2017 for me like, I couldn't even Believe, this is a concealer. This is by Simply Me Beauty which is the 7/11 makeup, oh, if you all saw the fucking video, if you fucking saw that fucking video oh my word I will leave a link down below This shit burned my skin gave you no coverage Burn the fuck of my skin it turned orange mustard on me like the whole entire thing Was completely a flop like I could not even believe that they were selling this I'm not kidding when I put it down on my skin it burned it fucking burned and I was like, hm It literally felt like I had fucking,fire asshole You know like when you have too many hot cheetos And you have to shit and it like turns out like, really a bad situation in the bathroom That's how It felt my fucking under eyes, so it was like not a good look I did not like this concealer what so ever and I would highly not recommend that. Next I wanna talk about two pallets I did not like in 2017, so I don't have the subculture palette with me. I'm Using this as a subculture. This is a subculture in my mind, you know So technically the first Palette is the honest Anastasia Subculture palette. To me that palette was just a flop because of the fact that the colors were not blendable. Yes, they were powdery as fuck. Yes. The color scheme was a little...unique That's like all fine and dandy right But the fact that the colors would not blend or they would blend into like a muddy looking mess or they would just wouldn't blend at all That's why I feel like I'll have people have problems with this. That's actually what I had the biggest problem with and I was like bitch I cannot even get like literally anything done like it was just not cute whatsoever, actually I used the prism palette This is the prism palette and this is definitely not in my disappointment video because this one actually did blend really nicely And they weren't nearly as powdery so are those like a good fucking plus after the subculture you really need to do this where I go and buy a subculture like that's out and produced right now and see the comparison between that subculture and my subculture Fuck but I don't know where my subculture is! If I have a product I fucking hate and I never use it I don't mind if it gets lost like I don't look for things So as I get more and more makeup in and things get lost there's like no way I can find things so I didn't give A fuck if I lost the subculture because I never use it. So I can't find it in my room I've no idea where it could be yeah, subculture was the first pallet miss and then the second one for me I just really do not like this palette. This is the Bobbi Brown nude drama palette, this is what it looks like right here These are the shades, honestly just looking at it. I just hate it,  like I just hate it Like I just don't like the color scheme. I think the color selection is super weird I think that the product like the actual shadows themselves are super, just bad like they're really flaky and chunky and powdery they're not terrible but they're not good like they're definitely doesn't not good so that palette is actually pretty expensive things like about 50 or 60 bucks and I feel like this is like one of the worst parts of the entire year because honestly I can't even I don't even want to Do look with this I don't even like the way this looks, the whole scheme It just doesn't make me happy actually makes me violently upset so I would say new drama pass on that one I don't know man. It was my cup of tea unless you like those colors, for me It was just an hard no so next little guy I have right here is not a eyeshadow palette It is a face palette and this is from L'Oreal. These are the true Match Lumi glow nudes Okay, so I actually just got this last month and truly it deserves to be in the worst of 2017 because you know why okay literally the most powdery Chalky mess I've ever experienced in my existence every single shade is powdery And terrible it has no shine and it's so disappointing because honestly I had such high hopes for this I saw this and I was like oh my god They have a whole fucking Palatte And I was so excited and I feel like Maybelline killed it with highlighters this year like they came up with such amazing highlighters, and there's such beautiful glowing products And I was like okay, L'Oreal. It's like your turn to step your fucking pussy up! Yeah, but They came out with this and I was like So this for me was just a big flop because it was so powdery I didn't go off on the skin nicely It's very very chunky. The glow wasn't even there I really just didn't understand this product whatsoever I didn't like it at all they came out with the lumi shimmeristas and these are So much nicer If you guys were to choose if you guys wanted to get something from the drugstore like a glowy item of L'oreals I would definitely Suggest getting this over the palette cuz he's actually really really pretty and they give a beautiful glow And I was like hard win ,everything else, I was like the fucking palette Oh, my fuckin eye is pulsing because it's fucking so bad like Next for a mascara that was literally was the flop of the year for me like actually like Flop flop a fucking fish. This is the Rimmel shake it fresh clump free volume. Do you hear this? Do hear this harsh ass fucking shake weight? This mascara is the worst mascara I tried of the whole entire year so when you're putting it on you know when I put on Mascara, you just like applying it whatever I was putting this on, hon And I was blinking and it's so watery and so liquidy that when I blinked it literally splat on my fucking cheeks On my motherfucking eyelid like I literally was like, huh, like I would like this like very normal, a normal blink was anything like hyper crazy like I Wasn't doing any of that this was like a normal ass blink. It got everywhere and I was like wait You've got to be kidding me And it did nothing and literally made my lashes look straight and go down even more cuz it's so heavy with how Watery, it was I'm like bitch Not only is this so liquidy and so terrible at like giving me anything it literally dropped my curl, my eyelashes already grow like this Right there like this, the curl came like this. I'm like okay. They're really trying and the fucking mascara Went like this next product that I didn't really love or understand in 2017 was this from Make Up For Ever These are these starlet liquids I truly just don't understand the concept of this product, so it's basically like a nail polish right it looks like a nail polish But it's not a nail polish It's like for the face or something like it's like a paint on glitter situation And it looks pretty on the camera, don't get me wrong But it's so Fucking chunky and hard to use And it doesn't look nice on the eyes at all because it's so chunky and thick and intense you have to like shake this bitch like Gnarly because if we're letting it sit, for example, if you let it sit like this the entire thing separates all the glitter falls to the bottom And it's liquid, so literally looks like a duo fucking two-toned ass thing I think that this would work if you put it all over your body or you mixed it with some lotion or you did something With it but for me It just didn't work because they had came out with the the loose pigments the starlet pigments which were fucking Phenomenal and they came out with these at the same time and I was honestly so shook up about the powders and the pigments that I was like, ugh, like living for them so hard then when I tried these I was like oh, I don't like these like I like those so for me I didn't really understand this product if you guys have this product and like it and use it Let me know what you use it for it because I think on the cheeks or anything like that It just looks chunky and heavy if you wanted to use as a highlight It's just too heavy and gross looking and on the eyes it creases and it cracks, and I'm like *spanish* and we have our last product We are down to the last product of the year that I just really did not fly with very well This is the Urban Decay vice liquid lipsticks. I wanted to love them I really did and I tried them out, and I just felt like they were to Streaky, one they were two streaky and two they were two drying, and I just left you with like I'm not pretty Lip you know what you just didn't look good like I'm just gonna go and swatch. This is in the shade 1993 which actually one of the better ones But I'm gonna swatch it so as you can see it's like the thinnest formula And I don't know to me like that's just not what I want to liquid lipstick to be and this is from when they first Launched earlier this year. I don't know if they changed up the formula I don't know if they've gotten better or anything like that But when I have tried the liquid lipsticks from Urban Decay the Vice ones I didn't like any of them that I tried they were All streaky they're all too drying they all just felt really nasty on the lip And they just didn't look pretty, so I'm hoping that they had changed up with the formula a little bit But I don't know because it is from the first round I never went out and purchased more, so that's my last one. This is a liquid lipstick that I really wouldn't recommend I love Urban Decay so much It's like one my favorite brand ever But this formula just for me and for my lips and for what I like usually, just didn't work out for me in The best way possible. And that is that you guys that is it for the entire 2017 worst of Beauty 2017 products that disappointed me. I know what the fuck I'm gonna call this I have no idea like technically cuz these things are not the worst products in the world if you have them all I'm sure you Could use them, and it would work for you just fine But for me because I literally like I wear makeup for a fucking living like I use makeup all the time So I'm a little hyper critical when it comes to makeup and now that I'm like, creating my own line too I'm even more critical of Everything you know what I mean, so it's like *high voice* Uhhh you could've done better with that one So yeah you guys, honestly to me. This is all in like good fun I hope you guys don't take it too seriously. These are just products I didn't like very much, so at the end of the day I hope you guys do not get offended by this I know some people will get offended by it or some people will be upset about It some people will say this isn't for this and I'm just kind of like I Bitch I don't give a fuck because honestly the reason I do these videos is for you guys, and I do it for myself You know I do YouTube for me if I didn't like doing it. I would never do it so for me It's really really important to stay true and say honest to who I am and to always be honest about the products that I love or I don't love and I'm sorry if a brand or a person gets offended by that I have your guys's back at the end of the day you guys are the people that I care about and you guys are the Ones that support me and follow me and look to me for an opinion or honesty And that's what I will always give you I will never give you something That's not honest and something that's not forward all I know is I want to stay honest and stay true to you Because you guys were the ones to support me since the beginning. Hopefully this video didn't come off too harsh sometimes Sometimes you can just can't help it when you're on a tangent, you know. Especially like, when I'm talking to guys I just feel like I'm talking to friends so it's like But yeah you guys. That's it for today's video. I love you guys so much Have a great rest of the night or day wherever you guys are and I will catch you guys in my next video Let me know in the comments part below by the way if you want me to do a best 2017 because I can definitely make one of those as well And I think it'll be really fun to do a best of products so, um, thank you guys for watching And I'll see you guys very soon.

Ok, okokok Okay, let's get this bitch fucking started, am I being too harsh fuck. I don't want to be to harsh, I feel bad 
hey guys welcome back to my channel so today's video is going to be a fun summer glam this is my go-to summer look that I literally do every single year cuz it's so easy so simple and it's just so pretty and I have not done a summer look in so long well Larry since last  summer so that's uh in a minute I have so much new stuff in PR that I really wanted to try out but still doing the same exact techniques that I was doing a before so that's all we're gonna be doing today is a brand new using new makeup summer pretty look I love doing like a bright lip with a really bronzy smokey eye and I think it's so pretty it's so summer it's so just glam I think it works with so many different skin tones so yeah guys that's a sales video is going to be as always if you guys don't like this view if you guys do not like me please don't watch it you know the drill with that but you guys do like this video please subscribe to my channel if you're not already and if renew what's up at man um you a and welcome to my channel thank you so much for being here I really appreciate it oh yeah let's go and get into this summer bronzy glow a skin tutorial okay guys so first things first I am very oily you guys know this so I'm gonna be using a smoothing primer one has silicone in it to really help absorb the oils on my skin I'm gonna be glowy today but I don't want I want to be glowing in the areas that I want to be glowy so we're gonna take a little bit of the make up forevers smoothing primer we're just gonna put that all over the skin mostly in the t-zone just to cover up the poorest areas mommy's a man so she has some more so because it's summer doesn't mean I don't like to add some coverage a lot people are like oh my god I want you like a natural glowy skin look and I've seen so many of those floating around don't get me wrong I think it's a beautiful but I'm not the queen to do the like no don't makeup me go huh like no I need  I want we're gonna of course focus it on the areas I need more coverage like the t-zone and the cheeks and then I'm actually gonna mix it to give it more of a glowy finish them take Vela Mara soft liquid fluid you do not have to use this as an expensive ass on they shouldn't use any other foundation that you have that's more of a glowy skin like finish on a morphe m-43 nine and i'm just going to lightly press that over this and start to blend the foundation as you can see the coverage is still high but the finish is starting to look a little bit more natural and a lot more pretty rather than being just full coverage and matte I feel like for summer and it's so so nice you guys are going with at arc-shaped tape concealer any kind of full coverage concealer works fantastically I want to keep the coverage same like I was saying earlier in the t-zone specifically and we're gonna blend that out best sponge guys by the way I'm so accessed Hollywood's actually here right now and hope everyone watching me and I feel like I'm a lab rat I was giddy so now we have the base at where we want it to be I'm going to set areas that I want to specifically set I'm gonna take a little bit the RCM ain't no color powder and set underneath my eyes because I don't want anything to move right here so we're gonna go and set it into strategic places like underneath eye is for me I just set on to these smile lines above my lip click it holy there a little bit on the sides of the nose and a touch on the tip of it my chin in my forehead center my foreheads specifically with the RCM a powder because it is a setting powder but it's not a heavy setting powder so we're sunset in those areas specifically now I'm gonna take the medium golden mac mineralize skinfinish and this is a really pretty skin like powder but it is a little bit darker than my own complexion so I want to kind of use that and cheat the system and set the rest of my face using a skin like powder and it's a little bit darker so it doesn't give me a nice just glowy glowy look as you can see it's like slightly darker than my own complexion but it's not like crazy or it looks like bitch or orange you know I'm sayin so we're gonna go ahead and just put that into the perimeters of the face areas I did not set with the RC me powder pull those of my cheeks to bronze up the skin I would say the Marc Jacobs tan tastic bronzer on that same morphe - I'm gonna run that a little bit over that mineralized skinfinish to give me more of a intense bronzy look okay so now I'm gonna take the apricot in the middle blush by wet-and-wild a lot of people have been telling me to try out the other Wet n Wild blushes and I'm like okay great because I love pearlescent pink you guys know I'm obsessed on a morphe for I was gonna run a little bit of that or the bronzer you check areas because I don't want to be too pink since this look is more of a summary bronzy glow a look I want to keep it really like peachy and really like bronzy essentially this blush is really pretty because it has like a slight subtle sheen so now guys of course the important part of a summer glowy look is going to be the glow obviously so I'm gonna be taking these Stila heavens hue highlighter and honestly Laura raves about this so much I've never really tried it so I'm like okay I'm gonna try it out see how it looks I want to kind of pile it on top of other ones so this is a cream highlighter it's like a putty highlighter she have to did a video in this and I'm gonna take this on a morphe white 10 Laura have to okay so you're dead to me that's actually freaking stunning alright then so this one you guys we're going to put this on the high points of the face of course and then we're gonna go over top of this with an actual powder highlighter if you guys want to if you guys don't have to if you don't want to but because I'm extra I'm right down the center of the nose is blinding I'm going to take a little bit of the jeffree star cosmetics Siberian gold highlighter and dust a little bit of that on top of this just to set everything slightly I'm talking like a very very subtle amount just have a powder over top a great way to look super glowy and intense is piling on creams and powders as you can see that she is blinding so now we're done with the face I'm not gonna contour my nose I'm not gonna contour my face or any like that this is a much more of a natural natural as well covers can be look for summer and I'm going to spray my face with a pen set make sure everything really melts into the skin and then I'm gonna grab the same sponge I was using earlier and press that over this because it really ensures that the makeup will last a long time and it takes away any powdery appearance it's actually really Lord showed me this trick and after she'd showed me I was like oh okay well you think you're  good huh I've been doing it a lot recently and that's it for these skin guys glowy still pretty natural look even though it's full coverage as hell like I just think that the skin looks really really pretty and life like so now I'm gonna go do my brows off of camera because that takes so long and I'll be right back okay guys we have the brows on it now and this is what they look like but I'm gonna go ahead and start on the eyes are gonna be really really easy today actually so the main thing is using a premie eyeliner and I'm gonna put that all over the lid and blend that out because this is going to be more of a like shimmery smokey bronzed look we're gonna take this Marc Jacobs eyeliner in the shade ro Koko okay so now I'm gonna take that I'm gonna put that all over actually we're drip it down on the lash line first like really close to the lash line guys right there as you can see it took a really pretty deep bronzy brown about halfway up to the crease like that and we're gonna blend that out really really lightly it's just a really easy way to make a smoky eye happen without trying like way too hard now anything more feat 25b palette this is a really pretty bronzy palette I'm gonna get really pretty shimmery copper right there as you can see was that right over this see that put that a little bit farther up then the base shade and now we're going and we're actually gonna start blending out the entire thing so we're gonna take any transitioning shades that you guys might like to use in the crease either way any of them work I'm just not putting them into the crease so we can blend out this bronzy look and this is just really you guys this is really not a look that's like so polished and so pretty this is just kind of like a fun quick bronzy eye it's super easy take a couple colors bring it out slightly and like call it a day it's super super easy so not take a larger fluffy brush don't take these light shades right here we're gonna blend out that darker shade so it blends out into a nice easy seamless transition just for some fun I'm gonna add a little bit of this shimmery taupe B shade right on top in the center still looks smoky and intense the brightens it up just to give you a little bit more dimension as you can see right there now I'm take the same eyeliner blend that in the waterline one that with the same bronzer color okay guys so this is that final I look what you should have super easy super pretty just nice metallicky bronze look I'm gonna do some eyelashes off of camera I'll click and I'll be right back okay guys so this is what the final I it looks like it's just a really easy really pretty just natural Naturals all right where does it it's very very wearable it's smoky and kind of like um and gives you that like pop but it's not like crazy black smokey eye so I think it's a really really fun way to integrate something sultry or something that's not as intense so that's kind of we did I added a pair of Lily lashes at Miami you can use code mani anyway if you guys want to to save some money on it but I absolutely love this pair of lashes cuz they really open up the eye a lot so now we're going onto with the lip and then we'll be done so I'm gonna take the UH Nastasia Beverly Hills strawberry liquid lipstick I love doing a really really bold intense lip during the summertime it's like why not why not really go there this is like the time to do it I'm not wearing this yet so uh yeah stunning and yet guys this is the final look this is what it turned out to be I think the lip looks so pretty with this really bold intense eye I just think the whole thing is really really fun it's very summer this is like a really fun a summer night out kind of look it's gonna really make your colored eyes pop if you do have colored eyes and I think it turned out great I absolutely love it the lip is also a very very nice medium toned I don't know how to describe this color honesty it's like a bright coral it's a little drying I'm not gonna lie it feels a little dry on the lips for sure I wish you were a little more moisturizing butter than that I think the color is fantastic yeah you guys that's advertising video of course I will leave everything linked down below as I always do it because have fun and have an amazing amazing summer I love you so much no greater than I or day wherever you guys are and I will catch you guys in my next video bye you guys nah I just think it works for so many different 10-10-10 makeup artists yeah it's literally more

okay hmm hmm okay so what I'm trying to like go across like I normally do with like a brush it doesn't wanna up fucking and move with me bro I want to just go straight in it doesn't like one another thing there we go okay so we got the one wing on I'm not the biggest fan to be quite really real I think this is actually really really hard we're gonna quit while we're ahead even though we're behind you guys see that shit like see that right there Wow oh that's fucking hard you guys the thing is I pride myself on being able to do a wing like I think it's one of the things I can do in this industry cuz usually I fuck up with a lot of things but doing a wing I'm pretty okay yeah fuck me it's rough and the actual formula itself is really really really dry like I can barely move my fucking eyeball [Music] the hardest part is doing this right here and I get that the connection between a wing and actual liner that is so hard with this I don't know why it does not want to connect yeah okay I think I'm done I'm good I'm good we have a fucking verdict okay I think we're good okay you guys so what do we think of the pizza cutter liner what do we think I mean the wing is whatever it's not like the worst thing I've ever ever done but it's one of the worst things I've ever done actually it's definitely one of the worst you cannot make a sharp edge with it it's not something you can easily just kind of like flick out and be sharp it like blunts out how come it's all skinny on this one on mine mm-hmm honestly I just feel like it's a little bit too flimsy the product itself the actual formula is so dry like I feel like it's gonna flake off my eyes any second like any weird movie it's going to flake off like I don't know it just feels really really drawing on me it's very very very matte uh I don't know guys I just think that's for me this is more of a flop maybe I'm just not skilled in the realm of a wheel liner I'm sure you can make it work I feel like it's not like terrible terrible where you're like oh my god I'm fucked for years I think they can definitely make it work if you guys really really try and practice practice practice with this kind of winged liner but for me personally it's just it's not practical so I have to say for me this is more of a Miss I would say just pass up on this guys go with a regular felt tip liner or a brush tip liner or a brush like actual brush because I think this is gonna be kind of hard to use it's not the most user-friendly as I said yeah you guys hope you guys enjoyed today's that really you know oh you are you like yeah I'm currently in the process of pre filming right now because I'm going to Bora Bora very soon so I'm pre filming all these random asks for views and just videos and things like that and that is

we are Gucci we are lily we are fitting we are product we are Chanel we are wise we are 
hey guys that welcome back to my channel so it tastes video I am so fucking excited to be filming with this because I have been looking for this fucking product for so long actually ever since I saw it on vogue Korea's Instagram I was like a viral video of this guy this is the really brow extensions like gel ting of gel brow extension I've been looking for it non-stop and finally finally by the grace of all that is good and holy in the second world I found it on this one website that sells like Korean makeup and things like that so I will link that website down below if you guys aren't interested in trying it out for yourselves I think I bought it for $25 u.s. but my shipping was like $25 as well so I was like oh fuck a brow jelly that's an eyebrow extension to have little hairs in it which is fucking weird I don't really have the thinnest eyebrows don't get me wrong I do not have thin eyebrows but they're definitely there's definitely sparseness I like this weird things on my brows were like the edges right here like there's like a weird divot weird divot I don't know like why it's like that like I said earlier there was a viral clip going around Oliver Twitter I had so many people asking me on Twitter and on Instagram to try out the brow extension brow gel it was a bitch to find it really truly truly was but I'm like you know what fuck it I found it I'm very excited to try it out I'm gonna step one step two and literally laying and Cantigny I can't read that but anyway let's go ahead and get into today's video as always if you guys do not like this video because do not like me please don't fucking watch it you know under what bank but if you guys that do like this video please subscribe to my channel if you're not already and if you're new what's up I'm an emu a and welcome to my channel thank you so much for being here I really really appreciate it um but anyway let's go and get in to this testing this jelly eyebrow extension jelly it's so fucking weird I'm very excited about this how many guys understand I'm here [Music] we 3d fiber I browse okay so I'm assuming it's actually made out of fiber I would love to read the instructions to you guys or like what it's about like the details on this but there's nowhere in here that says anything in English so hey use at your own discretion all it says is easy to wash off with warm water long lasting water was easy wash off with warm water right next to it water resistant so this is a package right here guys this is what it comes in this is what it looks like so when we take the bad bitch out and we have this guy it looks so we're gonna do we're gonna pop the little back bitch off and it comes with a little brow like little brush spoolie it's a really shitty brush I'm not gonna lie just feeling it right now it's not very good I wish it was angled now to meet obviously a lot more sense but whatever yeah so this is what it looks like on the inside it literally is like little fucking hairs I turn down the brightness a little bit so you can see what I'm talking about there's literal like eyebrow hairs in the cap you can you see that shit that's mad nasty looking so let's go ahead and I just want to put a little bit on my hand so we can see exactly what it looks like going on to the hand and the consistency so dipping into it right here or dipping in it's basically feels like glue so have someone picked up on here I want to see what it deposits like you're here Oh tell me that does not look like a fucking chunk of cat hair where's my hand so I think you're here we literally put on and it distributes micro pieces of hair on the brow on the skin so technically the gel inside is completely clear and the brows is what's making it look very very black because the brow hairs are black so that black jelly the jelly itself is completely clear it's the black hairs that make it look dark if you guys so we're gonna go and try this honestly I don't know why I'm like really weirded out to try this like I don't I don't know like I want to try it I really don't it just look so host we're going to go right the fuck in whoo we're going in yeah I want to go ahead and start applying this gel to the brows to make them thicker okay so as we are putting it on it's like very very intensely wet [Music] okay um so far it's going on I mean it's going on but it's so fucking wet like that it looks like it's painting down my eyebrows do I see that I'm trying to attach the actual little hairs to my real hair so we are brushing them through mm mm okay so I mean obviously it's depositing the little hairs but it is so goopy and gooey that I'm like bitch is it even gonna like dry down like the fuck oh my gosh it dry it off my hand away it dried bitch so as you can see I placed a bunch of little hairs down honestly the problem with this is that it is looking so fucking wet and when it dries it's more dry down like a fucking intense ass glue looking bitch and I'm like do we want that do we want that you know I mean it works there's definitely little hair fibers getting put down but I like my other brow more like it looks it's better it looks fucking fuller which is weird something I don't know I don't know I'm gonna go do my other brow off-camera and let the side dry and then we'll see what we think okay guys so I let this dry down for about 10 minutes we are officially like it's dry completely on my brow honestly we have the verdicts we are done we have the verdict done I know what I think about this I know whether or not to hit or miss I know whether or not how we'll use it again I think that this bad bitch hear me and my brows look thinner is anything where before so the problem with this product here is that the gel is so strong it's literally like glue it's like gluing down your brows with fucking gel I'm not even kidding you like it's flat to my fucking skin that shit is wild so that happens right so that makes your brow look wet and the mixture of brow your actual real brow hairs combined together to be like a thing so they become like a one little unit instead of like being multiple fluffy brow hairs you can see that there is hairs of course deposited there's like little random hairs out there over here over here little random hairs out here peeking through there's my hairs that get put down but do the fact that the glue is so fucking strong and there's no point like it literally makes it looked in all over again if not thinner than the brow looked before so for me this was a full dam I honestly had like high hopes for I'm not gonna lie I had high hopes but I know I'll never use it again like look hope watch she and patchy my brows look there's literally like rock-hard the whole thing's a mess it's a mess it really ain't so yeah you guys have done it for today's video all in all what do I think about the really eyebrow brow extensions hit-or-miss i would say that this is more of a Miss for me due to the fact that the glue is a way too strong it's way too prominent it literally makes my browser glue down like a fucking glue stick like a drag fucking stick down so I would say save your money that was a $50 spend I really did not need to spend I could not spend that money and imperfectly fine but all in all this is not worth the money is not what the prices is a complete miss for me I'm bummed this I really really wanted to work and it does look really really cool on the hand like if you were to make like a little brow thing it looks fucking cool as fuck but literally when it's that strong of the glue like what's the point of it what's the point but I do have 2 min to like I don't have no brows like there's definitely brows down so if you have no brow hair and you just want to look like little random hairs all over your skin maybe that would work better I really have no idea I technically do have brows so I have no fucking clue like not a clue in the world so anyway that is different video guys hope you guys had fun watching had so much fun creating it for you guys now I need to fix these fucking brows I can film another video after huh but anyway I love you guys so much and I'll see you guys in my next video bye you guys I love you blah okay swirly intro commence [Music] hmm look how fucking fuck these browser hmm a chakra Center nothing I've got my little pomegranates here you know for this moilee god mm-hmm okay cool okay baby so I'm sure Haney am whoo Oh got the fig leaf fucking Brown's new fuck me [Music] 
Hey guys, so welcome back to my channel. So today's video I am so fucking excited to be filming and I'm going to be filming a full face using products that beauty gurus made me buy. Basically, this is people in the community... in the beauty world that I, that made me purchase them and I'm gonna talk about what I think about the products, whether I thought the recommendation was good or not and I thought it would be really, really, really fun I actually got this idea from makeupbyjaack, who is another YouTuber he actually did a video, and it was "Full Face Using Products MannyMUA Made Me Buy" and I watched it... I thought it was so fucking funny, and I was watching it and I'm like that's so funny that, that he bought products I had recommended and I was like, wait... I've bought so many products that beauty gurus and other beauty influencers have recommended to me, and I thought it would be such a fun idea so, thank you Jack for giving me this idea and I'm gonna of course leave his video linked down below that I'm talking about right now because it is his idea, and I want him to give him credit. Actually, I don't know if it's his idea originally or not, I just... that's the first video I saw personally, so I'm gonna give him credit 'cause that's what I saw personally. But anyway guys I'm going to stop rambling 'cause this is a "Get Ready" so, it's going to take a little bit longer than usual. So, let's go ahead and get into this video. As always if you guys do not like this video, if you guys don't like me, please don't fuckin' watch it, you know the fuckin' drill with that. Like, what's the point? What's the point in watching me if you don't like me? Just don't. Just don't. I get it, I'm not everyone's cup of tea but I could be your cup of tea. But anyway guys, if you guys do like this video, please go ahead and subscribe to my channel if you're not already, and if you're new, what's up? I'm MannyMUA and welcome to my channel. Thank you so much for being here, I appreciate it. But yeah, let's get into this full face using beauty-guru-made-me-buy makeup. OK guys, so let's go ahead and get started. First thing's first I apologize for this hair, I apologize for my appearance, I literally just got back from the gym recently. I took a shower at the gym, so I like am not the most, you know, like pretty-as-I-can-be. You know? But I look not that pretty, and I need a haircut. So uhh, no I know its rough, its rough in these streets. OK guys, so what we're gunna do first. We are going to prime. And first thing's first, we are gunna start off with the Bobby Brown Vitamin Enriched Face Base And this I actually bought because of Mr. Jeffree Star. He uses this so often, I was literally shook. He would literally dip his little "booty" blender into this And he would just literally put it all over the face. And actually guys as you can see I actually have been using it. I have been using this a lot recently, and I absolutely love it. It's so moisturizing. It's basically like a moisturizer and primer in one. But it's just like, I don't know I can't even describe it. How it's just so good. It makes my skin so hydrated and so plump and supple, but keeps my makeup on a little bit longer than usual basically all I need is this. So, I really love it. Like I really, genuinely love this. And I've been using it for a couple weeks now. And it's been great to me. It's truly been great. When I apply it, my smile lines are smaller. That's like a big thing for me. How I like foundation is how it reacts to my smile lines and how much it falls into my smile lines. And I notice that when I'm using this primer/moisturizer, my smile lines are less. This one, Jeffree, was a great purchase bitch. And I appreciate you always using it, 'cause it fucking works good. OK, and next product guys we are going with the foundation, and this is the Laura Mercier Flawless Fusion Ultra Longwear Foundation and this bad bitch was recommended to me by my homegirl my country bumpkin, Laura Lee. Laura Mercier. Laura Lee. I see you there, girl. I see you. She always raves about this. She always tells me that it's such a good foundation, and it stays on her face so long throughout the day. I've actually worn this once and I really really liked it. So I'm going to go ahead and use this. And we're going to see how this reacts. Also, the coverage is great. It's fucking great. Also, you guys, I am the shade 1N2 Vanille Not Vanilla, 'cause it has an e at the end. Vanille. And honestly I just feel like it looks so pretty on the skin. Like it really just looks fucking bomb, bro. And it's actually like, kinda my color. Which is great, it's not even like too much darker than me. You guys know I love to go darker. I do. I feel like the coverage is beautiful, it's like a medium to full coverage. The finish is so pretty and it lasts on the skin all day long. PS, just in-case I forget I apologise if I forget throughout the video, but I wanted to do this. I bought this at Sephora, this is where I bought this and I also bought the Laura Mercier foundation at Sephora as well. I think it'd be cool to be able to say like where I actually bought the product. As you can see I don't know if you guys can tell but honestly, the foundation is just fucking beautiful. It really is. Like I'm shook. Laura, you fucking did that, thank you so much for this recommendation because honestly, I love it. I always use products that other beauty people use like, If they recommend something, I'm much more inclined to try it than just seeing it on a shelf. Does that make sense? I just feel like there's so many products nowadays, 
Hey, guys!
Welcome back to my channel. Today's video is going to be a testing
of a new foundation that I saw online. A couple people were tweeting me
about this foundation saying like, "Hey man, you need to try this out,
it looks a little funky, it's a little weird." And I’m like, "Okay, I’m totally down to try out
and test out some products for you guys, as long as you guys are requesting it." And I did see a bunch of you guys
requesting me to review this foundation. And so, I bought a couple shades.
This is the foundation right here. Elizabeth Arden flawless
finish mousse makeup. So it's a mousse makeup,
but it looks like a foam. It's like the weirdest... I saw it online
and it looked the weirdest consistency. I bought a couple shades because
I know [inaudible]. I hate shopping for foundations and concealers online,
that's like the worst thing to me. I need to go to a store and get matched.
Like I cannot.. like I can't. So I bought a couple shades and we're gonna
be testing out this foundation today. I'm going to wear it for a couple hours
and see how it lasts on the skin. Looks funky and I really want to do a first impressions
with you guys and try it out on camera. So yeah guys, that's todays' video.
I hope you guys enjoy it as always. If you guys don’t like this video, if you guys don't like me,
please don’t funcking watch [inaudible]. But if you guys do like this video,
please give it a thumbs up, and subscribe to my channel
if you aren't already. And if you're new... what's up,
I’m Manny MUA and welcome to my channel. Thanks you so much for being here,
I really really appreciate it. Let's go and get into this first impressions
of this foam foundation. So let's read about this little thing
really quick in the back. What it says, it says... for normal skin,
natural coverage, translucent finish, makeup so flawless, so natural,
it looks like your own skin. It's like a light airy cloud of color. Okay then, we'll see if that is the truth or not. This is 1.4 ounces, 40 grams of product
which is actually more than normal foundations. It's usually one ounce of product.
So, that's pretty cool. Can you guys hear that? Sounds a little weird,
sounds like a [inaudible]. So, we have beige 40,
I don’t think I’m going to be beige 40. Honestly, I don’t even know why I bought
that fucking shade. I'm an idiot. So, it's because I like to go all tan. Um... let's do buff 26. So, we're going to test
the color and see how it comes out. It sounds like a little aerosol. Oh my God! This feels so funky. That is dark as tits, are you kidding.
That's not going to work, I can’t use that. We have bisque 25. Okay, is their oxidizing like really dark?
Like... really dark. And I like to go dark with my foundation,
I do, don't get me wrong. Pero, this is like hella dark and these are
like the lighter shades, what the fuck! Okay, I’m going to find one,
hold on, even if doesn't match. Okay, this one. How is it that beige 40
is the closest to me other than shade 25? So, the foundation itself is $35,
which is really not a bad price point, 'cause Elizabeth Arden is a higher end brand. Comes in this really funny, funky,
almost like an aerosol hairspray finish can. So, we're going to go and apply it with
a brush and a beauty blender half and half. I'm already primed by the way.
Half the face I'm going to use with a kabuki brush. Okay. Look's fucking odd. The finish is very pretty, it's very natural
like they were saying. Very, very natural, pretty lightweight finish. The color is not that bad. This is not the amount of coverage
that I usually go for. I need more coverage than this. So we're going
to try and build another layer on top of it. But for now, we're going
to apply one, let it dry. This is what half the face looks
like with it on and half without it. And it looks really pretty, it's oxidizing
darker than I can tell in the camera. It's getting a little darker as it's
like playing with my skin. Looks like a little worm. If you have a beauty blender, I just noticed
that you need a lot more product, for the beauty blender side. So much foundation for this side,
holy crap... the beauty blender. I would definitely suggest not using this beauty blender,
definitely use it with the brush. I definitely think it did a great job
at evening out my skin tone. It looks very very pretty,
very natural and very lightweight. I'm looking at the view far right now
so I can explain it to you guys. It looks pretty and nice, you guys.
I’m really not mad at this. I'm mad at the fact that if you're using it with the beauty
blender, you need so much fucking product. That's what I’m annoyed about. But other than that,
use it with a brush; use it with a fucking brush. Okay, we're going to apply another layer
with my trustee Y6, amazing flat top kabuki, you guys. Just saying... and see how this bitch builds. I like to build especially on the cheek
area, like in the t-zone, because I have the most problematic areas
right here, in the center of my face. This is like such a wet, luminous finish, though.
It's like really really hella wet. For my oily skin... girl, I don’t know about this.
This feels like a serum. Okay, guys. So this is with two layers on my skin.
As you can see, very very very natural. So I’m going to apply some concealer now
and see how it reacts with concealer, and also just to give me some
more coverage... 'cause, shit! Okay. So the under eyes real quick. Okay, once the under eyes are set,
you're going to go and set the rest of the face. I always always set my foundation, so I have
to really give this foundation a fair shot, and set the entire face with it. Because I would naturally set my entire
face with any other foundation. So I’m going to take the cover FX
perfect setting powder. The claims are true,
it's fucking perfect, this powder. Pressing it in. Okay guys, so this is the base of the face.
This is how it looks right now. I think it looks absolutely
beautiful actually, like I really do. Like I'm not disappointed with how pretty
it looks; it looks really really nice. But, we'll see how long this lasts,
I’m going to keep it on for a couple hours. And I’ll be checking back in with you guys
to see how this makeup lasted. I'm not going to really do anything...
Ooh, should I add bronzer and stuff to it?. Okay, I’m going to add a little bit of bronzer to it
to see how it would like handle a bronzer. Grab any bronzer, I’m taking the physicians
formula butter bronzer. Bronze up the skin... this smells so good. Okay, now that I’m actually bronzy...
see what the bronzer looks like on it. It reacted like any of my other
foundations would. It wasn't patchy, it wasn't crazy,
a little patchiness on the forehead over here. What are you doing? But other than that, it turned out really
really pretty and I’m really really impressed. So, I’ll be back in a couple hours to see how the foundation
lasted throughout the next couple hours. Hey guys, I’m back. So, it has been about
five hours since I first put on the foundation. I was watching a movie with Zeya. I filmed the tutorial on this eye look
I have right now, which should be going up very very soon,
if you guys want to see that, let me know. I finally have my opinion
on this Elizabeth Arden foundation. It's been about five hours and as you can see,
my skin is actually really really greasy and oily. So, this is literally the third time in the day, that I’ve had to pat founder
over my face to get the oil off. To make it look a little more flat. I'm going to scoot up a little more so you
guys can see what it looks like after five hours. You can see my skin, my nose. I don't know if you guys can tell on the camera,
but it's really really broken up, right here, it’s like broken up hard core. There's a patch here missing a foundation
from putting the hat on and off. But, that's like such a subtle movement.
It obviously can be taken off easily. Yeah, oh yeah, that was annoying,
and that’s set, too. So the final verdict on the foundation. Is it worth it? Is it worth the $35?
Would I ever wear it again? What do I think about it?
All in all, I don't like it. I feel so bad because whenever
I do videos like this, like dedicated videos testing something out,
they always end up failing for me. I end up not liking it. And I'm like, "Fuck, man, I need to like
find something that I review that I actually end up liking." But this so far, I don't really like it
and these are the reasons. I think that the coverage was nice,
it was really pretty. The finish in the beginning was really really nice.
And I thought the foundation looked beautiful. And even right now, looking at my skin,
it looks pretty. It's glowy, looks like... I've got a fucking patch. It looks like
really ethereal and it looks really really pretty and like skin-like. But, that's with two layers
of this foundation on. And I got so oily throughout the entire day, I had to blob three
fucking times. And the fucking foundation is coming off so easily. The nose is completely broken up in the center.
I don't know if you guys can actually tell. But, I can see in person, how literally this whole part right here is like...
little spots and it's like literally broken up. And also, you have to use a brush
with this foundation. You can't really use a beauty blender
because it soaks up too much product. Or, it just disperses it really really weird,
I don't know why. Like you have to use a brush
with this foundation, or else it's going to look like
literally there's nothing there. Which is fine if that's the look you're going for.
Not for 35 bucks, that's just a no-go for me. So, all in all, do I think this foundation is worth it?
Is it worth the $35? No, I do not. Am I ever going to wear this again?
No, I’m not. If you guys are normal and dry, maybe it will work for you. I mean,
even the box said "for normal skin". So, that's a claim saying for normal skin.
If I had normal skin, maybe I would like it more. But I don't right now because
I don't have normal skin. I’m oily. So therefore, I do not like it as much
as someone with normal skin or dry skin might. But thank you guys for sending me
the request to check out this foundation. It was so fun to do,
it's such a weird foundation. It's a foam foundation. I wish it was
Manny MUA approved, but it's not, sadly. I'll leave a link down below where you can get it
if you guys are interested in it or not. Let me know if you guys want to try out
any other weird things. Tweet me them. That's about it! That's it, I’m done. I’m going to go take off this makeup.
I'm tired. This is my second video of the day.
I'm like I'm over it. I love you guys so much, have a great rest
of your night or day, wherever you guys are. And I will catch you guys in my next video.
Bye, guys. Mwah. So yea guys, that's what... For normal skin and natural coverage,
natural translucent coverage. What? I’m saying the wrong thing. I'm so sore... I'm so ready to not have to wear
a fucking hat anymore... You guys, look at my hair, it's actually
growing and now I’m so excited. Look at that, look at that shit. Like I'm actually
getting hair there, like this is crazy. Zeya, can you go get me a napkin? Can you?
Can you grow some legs, baby? Yeah? Become a human real quick... Oh, hi gorgeous. The fuck? Look at this fucking bitch, guys. Are you kidding?
-Oh , hi! No, you did not just shove up here. She did, she has a little
corkscrew in her mouth. 
hey guys welcome back to my channel so what is up you guys how have you guys been it's been a minute since I have filmed I know I always say this nursing video like goddamn we get it what what is up you guys today's video I'm really really excited to be filming because I got these new colour-pop supernova shadows in the mail and my first ice washed them and I'm like oh my word my first thought was that these are so much like the Stila glitters like the ones that are in like this shape or this shape - oh wait hold on before everything starts boom you guys I got a tattoo ah oh my god my mom is gonna be Shooks I got it today I got a little crescent moon tattoo on my finger so when I'm doing poses and doing things like this a little thank you so much - Evan tattoo for tattooing me he's a wonderful tattoo artist based in New York and he's absolutely amazing I love him Thank You Evan for the tattoo Nikita thank you for helping me connect with Evan anyway so all I'm saying is that these supernova shadows remind me so much of the Stila magnificent metals and glitter and glow shadows and the swatch I was like wait that's - it was weird so I was like you know what these are $7 and these are 24 so I thought why don't we go ahead and try them both out see what we think you guys already know I love the Stila glitters I think they're absolutely amazing I wear them all the time I've never tried the supernova shadows so I'm very very very intrigued to try these out and see if they are a nice dupe for the Stila ones this is kind of like a this video is like a battle like 25% of the cost of this one is this one so if they work just as good that'd be really really cool to really be able to invest in a multiple colors in the color pop one yeah guys anyway that's what today's video is going to be that's why I have it both of my lids a blank on each eye to put on one on the other they're obviously not the same exact color but it's close enough it's close enough as always if you guys do not like this video if you guys do not like me please don't watch it you know the drill with that but if you guys that do like this video please subscribe to my channel if you're not already and if you're new what's up a man um you a welcome to my channel thank you for being here I very much appreciate it yeah guys it's going to get into this comparison video of its Stila versus the color poop no color pop the color pop versus Stila ok so I'm gonna go ahead and look up on the Sephora app what are these products Stila we have this Stila brilliant long-wearing liquid glitter eyeshadow these are $24 and they're sold at Sephora or Sheila's website of course these are long wearing Sparkle shadow with perfect blend of pearls and glitter to have your eyes with incredible uniquely lightweight water infused texture glides effortlessly then dries down smoothly locking it in maximal Sparkle and minimum fallout which is true I've worn these for like 10 hours on end minimal fallout not a lot on my lash line or anything like that I really really do enjoy these a lot this has 4.5 milliliters of product which is point 15 ounces for 24 bucks so it's going to look up the colour-pop ones here we have walk of fame which is a $7 supernova shadow high-impact ultra glittery shadows have a metallic base an extremely long wearing can be used as a base alone or as a topper this one has two point seventeen ounces four point seven grams so it has a little bit more than the Stila one and it is a much less and much more affordable so it's time to see what we think you guys are this is amazing I'm gonna be chuck for real so I'm gonna go ahead and zoom in so we can see exactly how they apply it on the I already know exactly how these steel ones apply they have pi very nicely so we're gonna go ahead and play the Stila shade in the shade rose gold recho i wanted to apply kitten karma that's my favorite one but I can't find it anywhere don't know where it is at all have to go out and buy a new one there it applies very wet and glittery these two will not be the same shade just ignore that we're just gonna ignore that it is of course a thicker consistency because it does have glitter shimmer particles in it so you cannot expect it to feel like water you know it is definitely a thicker consistency so don't blend the edges a little bit I always do this I'm wearing the Stila ones so go ahead and blend out a little bit on the edges so it's an effortless smooth transition love love love and boom stunning now guys we're gonna go in with the colour-pop supernova shadow so as I'm pulling it out right now of the tube I know that it's a little bit more dry not as much comes off on the paddle as the Stila one does so that's kind of annoying I'm actually gonna pump back and forth which usually isn't really good but I'm trying to get enough product on the brush okay let's try that out also same exact applicator it son same paddle applicator so now it's going to apply this one oh my gosh I'm using it okay we're playing around playing it you guys is it playing literally identical as the other one I'm not kidding you what I say it feels exactly the same it really really does actually feels a little bit thinner so I stick as a formula as the steel one is actually it's a little bit thinner and there's less product that gets picked up using the colour-pop buttons there's not as much product which is kind of odd okay let's go ahead and blend out that shade as well with the brush just how we did a little Steel aside same exact thing how is it gonna blend you guys it's literally acting the exact same as the Stila one and I feel like it looks like identical do we just find a dupe guys I think we just found a dupe and it's literally 75% cheaper damn flip-up really coming for steelo huh okay guys so let's go ahead and look at the shape so we can see them right now of course the shades and themselves are different this one is a little bit more rose gold and this was a little bit more gold but the effect that it has on the lid the glitter flakes everything about it really is so similar that I could honestly if I was wearing it inside my side and had someone be like okay which one do you think is the cheap one or the one that's seven bucks I don't think you could tell like I really do not think you could tell so I'm gonna go ahead and do some eyeliner and put some lashes on and I'm actually gonna wear these for a couple hours and see how they react on the high how much fallout it is and things like that and then I will be back to let you guys know after a couple of hours how they wore but so far so good they're both drying down identically the same so I'm actually hoping they're gonna wear exactly the same as well because if they do holy I've got a great deal okay guys I will see you in a couple hours okay guys what is up I am back it's been about three to four hours since I started filming the first section it's pretty late now into the night I was just kind of chilling with my brother playing with zaiah eating watching American Horror Story so we're just kind of chillin in the household and I wanted to come into a check-in because I'm kind of tired I want to go to bed I can't until I'm done checking in with y'all let's talk about really quickly let's see how it wore throughout the couple hours I was wearing it so okay so as you remember right side is a Stila looking at the lashes there's not a single little piece of a fallout the Stila ones stay so intensely this I already knew I absolutely love the Stila magnificent metals glitter this was a complete win for me of course he looked absolutely amazing one of you guys can see on camera but there are little glitter specks down here on the lashes there are glitter flakes actually a spot right there missing from the pigment completely which is kind of odd little bit more chunky by the lash line on this eye oh there's also fallout on my face on this side as well there's about I can see there's about eight glitter glitter flakes right there ooh and there too you guys so what do we think what do we think about the shades are the color pop supernova shadows a dupe for these Stila magnificent metals glitter shadows honestly they are due for it they are a really really really close good dupe for the Stila ones however I definitely do like the Stila ones more if they are of course a bit more expensive but you actually see and tell in the formula that they are more expensive but they wear better they dry better and they have more glitter reflect in it then this side does I know when I was going on originally this side looked like it was like really intense and glittery but it was actually this side add more glitter particles in it and they looked a lot more seamless and beautiful than it did on this side besides just a little more chunky and flaky then this side is this one has no flakes on it whatsoever all in all Stila for me is a win Stila is the one that won but you guys the colour-pop supernova shadows are an amazing amazing comparable dupe to the stealing ones if you guys could not afford the $24 Stila ones I understand I totally totally totally get it I would definitely definitely check out the color pop super number ones do I like the Stila ones more yes bar these an amazing do for it absolutely for $7 was such a great wear time with a great effect but how beautiful it does look on the high there's no denying that it is an amazing amazing do for it yeah guys that's ever taste video because I find it watching I had a lot of fun all in all both of them were a complete win for me let me know if you guys want to see me do more videos like this I can make this a series where it's like I'm testing out a product that came out and if there's a product that's similar to it or do for it I can try it out and see if it's actually worth the duping or just get the original product itself you know for me with this one I personally love the original product so I would continue to buy the original product but is a dupe worth it yes as always you guys I'll leave everything linked down below as they always do in every single video but I'm starting a little tire now I'm getting like sleepy eyes because it's like one in the market and I'm a little tired I love you guys so much and I will see you in my next video bye guys Wow hey

hey guys that welcome back to my channel so today's video is going to be my June favorites and disappointments I absolutely love love doing favorites and disappointments videos and I actually have a bunch of favorites and three disappointments I've only ever really had two disappointments in a 1-month the fact I have three I'm like oh oh I have been going nonstop the past month of June it's been absolutely insane I'm going to Africa at the end of the month I did VidCon I did I was in Ohio I'm coming out with merch really really soon that I'm trying to get in the works and they're proving and things like that my parents are moving up to LA it's like god there's a lot there's a lot of things a lot of things that's going on right now but that doesn't mean I have not tried a bunch of this month and I actually have a lot of products I've been really really liking some I'm actually shocked that I loved as much as I did and some oh my god slow so yeah you guys not to tell you they do is going to be is going to be my June favorites and disappointments as always if you guys don't like this video if you guys do not like me please don't watch it you know the drill with bad guys come on or in 2017 don't watch me if you don't like me but you guys do like this video please subscribe to my channel if you're not already and if renew what's up I might emulate and welcome to my channel thank you so much for being here I really genuinely appreciate it so much for being here and watching my videos and not rambling let's just go ahead and get into today's video of my June favorites and disappointments okay so first item that I have been absolutely loving and living for this past month has been this this is from a jeffree star cosmetics and this is the velour lip scrub in flavor watermelon gum you guys oh my god like I literally get chills every time I smell it because it give me like flashbacks to my  childhood I was actually lucky enough to smell this and try it out before I actually launched and I love it I love a good lip scrub I just like it so much more than just some sugar like on my lips I like if it's scented and just cute packaging I'm just a bitch of packaging you know and you can definitely DIY your own lip scrubs but I just think that jeffrys are so so nice and they smell so good and they taste so great and I just think these are absolutely mazing and if you guys could try any of them try the watermelon gum from his new summer collection it's just damn so next guys we have the Urban Decay Naked skin shapeshifter I've been really really living living and actually breathing for this I don't know why but I just and what I love about it so much is this beautiful contour shade it's a very nice just cool tone Brown as a nice highlighting shade you're gonna color correct if you want to and I also love the powders these powders I've been using interchangeably this is for contour I like to use it for contour personally and this one's a highlight my under eye and you guys the quality of this is just absolutely amazing like wow urban decay y'all y'all really did that y'all really did that look at the powder look it's so smooth so buttery it's just like wow you guys weren't really putting any games now were you and the reason I really really like the contour shade is because it's a very very natural color it's not really intense it's not too heavy you can really build it to be really pretty and natural or build it to be really really intense and very intensely contoured getting shapeshifter I'm like urban decay you all did that and I think it's absolutely amazing especially you want a highlight contour photos if you're a makeup artist and you need something in your kid that's gonna be great for a lot of different skin types they also have a medium shade I think that they have to so this is the light to medium and then they also have a medium to dark as well so I personally use of course they liked to medium shade and it works so well for me so I absolutely love it next is a bronzer that I have been living breathing dying gasping for air living in prison for the past couple of years for this is the Marc Jacobs tantastic bronzer you guys already know that I love the other Marc Jacobs bronzer I think it's absolutely amazing but but I think I like this one more I think I like this one more and the reason why I like it more cuz I feel like it suits more skin tones I think that this is much more of a pretty neutral bronzer it's not as warm as the other one I love a good warm bronzer I really do but I think that for more skin types I think that the tantastic works amazing and it smells like coconuts oh I don't know what it is about Marc Jacobs bronzers formula it's just one of the best formula for bronzers I've ever ever tried if you guys have never tried a Marc Jacobs bronzer or even just like felt it guys go to Sephora feel it touch it it's amazing it is a pricier item but there's so much product in here that this will last you a good what year and a half like this is insane I use this almost every single day and it looks like I hasn't even been touched doesn't say it hasn't been touched helps like hasn't been touched I don't know how I don't know how this formula is absolutely beautiful look at that little finger you guys are conceited I've been loving this month this is only conceit I've worn this entire month this is all I consider I've worn this is the soft matte complete concealer by NARS in the shade of vanilla mami has been going good you see how that word divot in there did it I've been going so in with this concealer because it's so pretty it gives you the most beautiful finish it's matte but it's not like drying looking matte it's almost like a dewy matte finish it's full coverage it sits beautifully on the skin I haven't even worn my Tarte one since I've been using this one honestly that's saying something it's definitely a little bit harder to apply it in the Tarte one of course you need a brush to go with this one or I personally what suggest using a brush with this one I use the more feet why 11 is just a really perfect for me it's just great picks up the product great deposits is fantastically and it buffs it out super super easily that's the brush I would suggest for it is that morphe y11 it blends out so so well and doesn't crease fast on me either and once I set it it stays in place all day it does not move and I'm just like wow nars Norris has good concealers I've always really liked the NARS radiant creamy concealer I'd always thought that one was really pretty but this one this one like beats that one's ass like tenfold now for two lip items that I have been living for I have been loving this color pop gloss in the shade curvy and this is actually a collaboration with Karen aka I love SATA II and color pop they collaborated to create this gloss and I just think it is the prettiest most perfect nude gloss it's so beautiful oh my god that is a lip bitch that's a lip honey the whole entire collection was absolutely amazing but this is something that really stuck with me and I have been wearing it all month long and I'm like wow and it's like what six five bucks five or six bucks that's good the other lip item that I have been loving shockingly Selda I've been really liking it is this by Kylie cosmetics this is the naked Velvets liquid lipstick and this is from her summer collection and you guys this color is just so look at it it's just the most beautiful neutral nude shade I can't good I do you see that do you see that nude and I just been wearing it all month long because it stays super nicely but it's not drying and it makes my lips look really pretty it's not like a matte lipstick where it falls into the lines of your lip it sits over the lips really beautifully and it just gives it just a nice pretty pout and it lasts so long on the lips you guys I can wear this all day and it'd be like still on it I mean won't be on there like a lot like a matte lipstick would it has a really good same power honestly it really really does and I'm just like oh come on Kylie stepping it up I think that her velvet liquid lipsticks are so much better than her matte liquid lipsticks that's just my personal opinion I think that they feel so nice they're so pigmented they're so creamy and they don't dry down the lips at all because I think that her lipstick formula is a little drying for me it's a little too drying so her velvet liquid lipsticks are definitely like a good in-between for me another thing from Kylie cosmetics I have been loving all month long I know shocking hey who's shocked hear me and I don't mean me a bitch but just like I'm shocked because I've had so many of Kylie's products in my disappointments throughout the months she's always come out with collections and most of the time the collections I've always just kind of been like I'm really disappointed with actually so when she came out with this summer collection I was like whoa she has to myself I really like and that includes the wet set I was shaken to the core with this bad bitch I've used every single color I'm just gonna swatch it slowly so you guys have seen yeah Kylie came out with blinding as highlights blinding as the shades I love the most is privacy please which of this shade right here it's are very pretty like golden champagne shade it's so hard they're so reflective even in the pan it's hard to see the camera will pick it up right here I'm very impressed with those guys I think that they're so blinding so intense and they are a creamy consistency they're very very similar to the Stila the Stila highlighters I feel kind of like putty they feel very much like that they're a wet powder you can like press your finger in and it will dip it'll dip it look yeah I think something about that texture really gives you an intense ass shine I would suggest putting this on with a finger or with a sponge or with a kabuki brush it does not go on well with a normal highlighting brush it just does not it does not pick up the way you would want it to pick up but it is blinding and if you guys get the chance I have no idea if Kylie is coming back with the website I have no idea if our summer collection is coming back I think that it should because honestly it's a good ass palette however this is $62 I think that $62 is so  ridiculous the price is obscene and the fact that this thing sold out first it just goes to show that like her company can do that and price that at that point and anyone's gonna buy it so I just think that it kind of sucks that it's priced so high um 62 bucks or for highlighters I just think that's Wow like it's I was shooken shook him to the core but hey it has a nice mirror it's built very very well it's very sturdy the product works fantastically actually at the price point is a little obscene matches me and last but definitely definitely not least actually it could be my favorite of the entire month is the Jaclyn hill palette with more feet you guys I traveled with this to VidCon and I wore it every single day that I did makeup bitch has gone in bitch has gone  and on these Viking colors huh I've always loved morph equality I've always thought they had such great quality for such a low price point aren't they Tom Ford are they why sell Beauty they're not their quality is not as high as those products are but for the price point that they are the quality is amazing it is I don't care what anyone says I don't care what kind of hate I get from anything with more feet I don't give a bitch that quality is so nice for such a low price point and no one can knock it and no one can say it's not alright so when jacket came out with her palette I was like okay this is gonna be great I know it was going to but it's actually better than the quality of other morphe palettes I don't know what I did it I have no idea but it is definitely higher in quality the ingredients I believe are the same ingredients but I think that they're assembled differently I saw this one post from this hating makeup artist he's such a ass I'm not gonna say his name because he doesn't deserve it but I saw he posted like saying that just basically ragging on Jacqueline and more facing up the ingredients were the same and the quality is the same and that shouldn't be charged a higher price point I'm like yo homie if you actually knew anything about makeup like you say you do you would know that you have the same exact ingredient Dec the same exact order what matters is the amount of things that are put into it when they are put into it girl I digress all I'm saying is that I think that this palette is absolutely amazing and I think that for 35 shades for 38 bucks and you can use look  affiliates coat to save more money on it it's a steal and I would highly highly recommend you Jacqueline hill and morphe palette I know it's coming back and stop soon and so let's talk right now but it's coming back soon and I would HIGHLY highly suggest it and we are now moving on to the disappointments of June sweetheart okay first things first let me just get this out of the way because you guys might have already seen a video of me talking about this these are the magnetic lashes by the brand one to lash I only have one pair left in here two pairs I honestly don't even know I don't know where the other pair went I did a full entire dedicated video on these lashes they are $70 for two pairs of lashes they are magnetic and they are the smallest most plasticy ugliest looking lashes I've ever worn not any candy and is telling the truth guys but if you guys want to see the video on how they worked how they reacted I will definitely leave and linked it down below cuz it's just so much better to see it than to talk about it ii disappoint me other month is this little guy this is the Makeup Forever aqua color paint XL in the shade m16 which is a white it's actually the eyeliner that I'm wearing today and I don't think I shouldn't tell but a lot of it is cracking falling off onto my lashes mostly on this side it's just so cracky so flaky and I'm really really bummed about it because I really really really wanted to absolutely love these I'm actually wearing another one on my lid as a primer just to try it out and that worked totally fine it's just not good for a liner for the white maybe you can use it for like body paint or for something else but for eyeliner I would definitely not suggest this it's not very good but the one I use as eye primer was great so I'm gonna keep testing them out to see what I think about them but I just think personally the white just didn't work for me and it's currently not working for me right now I'm frustrated and last but certainly not least for the disappointments is yes I feel kind of bad for this my disappointment I really do but hey you got to be honest you got to be upfront and I was disappointed this is the Kim kardashian-west beauty contour and highlighting stick the reason this is in my disappointments guys is because I think that for the amount of product you're getting which I will show right here is all the project inning on both sides for I believe it's what $42 for contour stick and highlighting stick and a little brush I think that's so crazy the packaging itself is really really cheap I love the color of it I think the color is really pretty and I love that it's like a soft matte pink I think it's beautiful but when it comes down to the actual important stuff like the price and if it works i think that the pricing is a little too high for what you're getting the product does it work it does work I wear the contour stick and it definitely worked and it definitely blended really nicely with the bristle end of the brush of the little tool that came with the bristle and it definitely blended it nicely but the sponge side is really really hard and super impractical I really wanted it to work and I wanted to love it but for the little amount that you get for the high price point I just don't think it's worth it and that's why I'm disappointed and I'm just putting in the price and like the amount of product you're getting I'm not disappointed in the actual product itself I think it actually worked pretty nicely on me and I'll definitely continue to use it and that's it you guys that's it for the entire video of my june of favourites and disappointments i'll because i'd fun watching it i hope you guys enjoy these videos i love to be honest with you guys what i'm loving something or i'm not liking something I want to be honest I always want to be honest with you guys and I always will continue to do so whether it's promoted by a huge celebrity or an influencer or something like that I'm always gonna be honest and upfront of how I feel about a product and I hope you guys enjoy that aspect of my channel I'm

okay guys next we have this naked skin enhancer this color pop Goss Goss hey guys that welcome back to my channel but it has a nice mirror in it while my skin looks beautiful honestly unless he looks stashed usually you have to watch to find out what the moment I became oh it's just 
hey guys welcome back to my channel so today's video is going to be my top 10 favorite drugstore beauty products I have been recently really getting into drugstore makeup I have been trying my hardest really dive in and start using drugstore products more I love you guys know this but a lot of guys don't when I started in makeup I started working at Sephora right away I didn't get a really experience with any other makeup other than the brands at Sephora and then right at just before I started working at Mac so I really never gave drugstore products a chance I never bought drugstore products I wasn't the person that would use makeup when I was 10 years old and was buying L'Oreal and Maybelline that wasn't me that was in my journey so I had to really experiment with drugstore makeup after going from like Sephora and Mac to drugstore so it has been a journey going from high-end products to drugstore products and that's why a lot of time people will kind of give me shit for being bitchy the drugstore makeup or for being surprised when they work and it's not even that it's literally just me being shocked at the fact that this product that is five dollars works better than a product that's fifty dollars and that really does shock me and I'm like whoa dude how the fuck do they make this happen and I just honestly my genuine reaction when I'm shocked and surprised I'm sorry if it comes across as me being a fucking bitch or whatever it may be if you guys think I'm a bitch then hey that's your call but I don't think I am so I'm just gonna continue to do what the fuck I keep doing this is actually really hard to accumulate I was shocked at how many products I really actually loved from the drugstore it was hard to just make this ten and I'm like what the fuck I'm thinking maybe I should do a series on my channel like top 5 drugstore concealers top 5 drugstore foundations I'm thinking about doing something like that because this was really hard for me to pull and that was a good sign and I'm like yo that means I like a lot of drugstore products I want to talk about more ducts or products with you guys so yeah guys that's a zero is going to be as always if you guys don't this view if you guys do not like me please don't fucking watch it you know the drill with that but you guys like this video please subscribe to my channel if you are not already and if you're new what's up a mani Mui and welcome to my channel thank you so much for being here I really appreciate it from the bottom I heart con todo mi corazon me encanta mucho I guess exerted the vagary let's get into this top 10 drugstore products video [Music] so let's quickly talk about base products first these are my top three of base products on here so by the way guys I'm not gonna be going in full depth intense crazy talking about every single product like three minutes each I don't want this video to be so fucking long I'm gonna talk about them quickly and you guys have definitely seen these products on my channel before so to me a quick movement keep it going keep it flowing kind of thing so first product is going to be the Loreal Pro matte and fallible foundation I'm in the shade of 103 I love this foundation because it stays on all day keeps me matte throughout the day I put it in my t-zone mostly and just kind of let it set into the face and it just looks so beautiful it is a matte finish but it's not like Superman where I look like littering no moisture on my skin left the coverage is amazing the finish is amazing the longevity is amazing I really don't think you can go wrong with the Loreal Pro matte infallible foundation it's fucking sick nasty like thick nasty second product is another foundation it is by wet and wild hmm this is the wet wild photo focus foundation you guys okay I just recently started using this I'm actually wearing this on my face today I really really really really like this foundation I think that the finish is really pretty it's like a satin matte finish more so on the matte side on my face it looks a little bit more matte than into satin but it does look beautiful on the skin the coverage is a nice medium to full it's buildable I was so shook when I first tried this out I honestly was shocked the first time I ever tried this was in my wet and wild one brand tutorial and I used it so many times since because I really wanted to give it more of a chance and enter being one my favorite drugstore foundations ever like I absolutely love it the little paddle thing kind of weirds me out it's I get a little paddle and I wish I was like in a squeezy tuber and a pump but I think for five bucks usually I really don't think you can go wrong the one thing I don't like about this is a smell I think it smells like straight-up fucking paint as if I literally just dripped paint from a scaffolding onto my face it literally smells like that and I hate the smell so much I mean it goes away and the finish is beautiful and it's really well worth it for six bucks come on I can end a little can a little bit of paint okay number three is this by Maybelline this is the Maybelline fit me concealer this is it was actually the concealer part was the hardest I actually like a lot of concedes from the drugstore but you can see that was so hard but I have to say that this one is my favorite one this works so nicely it's a nice medium coverage you can build it up to be more full coverage the Finn is beautiful on the skin it blends out so nicely and it doesn't crease crazy on me once I said it quickly it just looks like a beautiful ass concealer reminds me like the NARS radiant creamy concealer and in a way in a way it's not the same it doesn't have as much coverage as an arse one does but it does remind me a lot of that so if you guys are a huge fan and they NARS one how doesn't just check this out to see it is a very very similar similar type of concealer and I just absolutely love it so much the one thing I will say about these those I wish that the shade range was was more vast I'm like dude this is such a popular ass concealer at the drugstore how they not have like twenty shades I don't understand but I hope Maybelline does come out with more colors with this and it will rule the fucking world item number four is this this is the Physicians Formula butter bronzer this has gotten some love I love this bronzer so much it smells like a fucking tropical oasis oh my god it smells like my fucking like my taint but honestly it's absolutely amazing I think that the color is beautiful the pigmentation itself is beautiful the finish is really nice too it's not completely matte again it's another satin like glowy finish I had seen this floating around so many places all over YouTube and people were like dude this is the best problems ever from the drugstore I'm like okay let me try it I actually really love it and I haven't found a bronzer at the drugstore that I like as much as this one if you guys like bronzer if you guys like a nice glowy bronzy finish if you guys just like to look a little more pan and not so pale then out of Li suggests B Physicians Formula butter bronzer it's fucking bomb so I was like coconut it smells like literally smells like pina colada mmm so like my fucking childhood fool product number five is this this is the Milani make it last setting spray I talked about this before on my channel and I think it's absolutely fucking bomb so this drugstore setting spray works as if it's urban decay I'm not kidding you it works so fantastically it does have a lot of alcohol in it though it's a second ingredient which means it's the second highest ingredient in the ingredient deck but I will say that this really does keep your makeup on so much longer I'm wearing it on my face today it's Pritz out so nicely as well I do think it's weird that it's perfumed it literally smells like perfume I think that's kind of odd that it smells like perfume but honestly like as you can see I've gone through a good hefty amount about use it so often I wish it was more product in here it only has 2.3 fluid ounces but I can travel

tried I'm like how how the way that this applies is so beautiful it blends out to literally perfection I don't know how they do it I don't know what I'll does editing this shade is like an apricot pink shade that has a little bit of golden reflect in it kinda reminds me like NARS orgasm but a much more subdued version of it it's much more apricot and not as glittery but this is what it looks

I was in New York I went to the Fenty Beauty event I got to see Rihanna there, and it was so Incredible I was shaking I was like that's Rihanna ten feet in front of me such a cool well done event I thought was absolutely Beautifully done and the products were there We got to play with them a little bit so basically I got home last night And I had a huge PR package waiting for me, so I figured you know what these are all the products here I'm going to film a huge get ready with me Using all of the fenty beauty products film it for a review and a lot of you guys are like Manny where the fuck is this review so many people have done it already of course And I really, if you're watching this, I very much appreciate you watching this. I know it's up pretty late I have been using some of the products here and there when I was in New York I was there for eight days and that is why I couldn't get my video up earlier Literally Laura and Jeffree had it up like the next day and day and a half New York is really draining for me. They push through it. They're troopers I don't know how the fuck they did it, but they did it so if you guys are watching this I'm going to be doing a quick little giveaway for you guys right now if you're watching this you're gonna be entered into this giveaway All you have to do is like this video and comment down below where you're from and why you want to win that's all you need to do I mean if you're subscribed to my channel that would be really great, too that'd be great, subscribe to my fucking channel I have doubles of a lot of products I have stuff from the PR package I got stuff from the event that I got so I'm like you know what I had doubles of things things I have not used why not give a bunch of it to you guys because you guys are my fucking followers I love you guys, and I appreciate you guys watching this video even though it is up a little bit late Also, of course I'm gonna be tossing in some Foundations some of the matchsticks and things like that as well, so yeah I'm sorry. I've been rambling a lot. I've been gone. I only remember how to film a fucking video I've been gone for so fucking long, but yeah You guys as always if you guys don't like this video, if you guys do not like me. Please don't fucking watch it. You know the drill with that But if you guys do like this video, please subscribe to my channel if you're not already And if you're new what's up I'm MannyMUA and welcome to my channel, but yeah Let's go again to this Fenty beauty review hits misses. All of it. Okay guys, let's go ahead and get started a lot of these products I have not used, but I will let you know of the products I have used and that I have tried and I'll have of course a stronger opinion on those a lot of these things are gonna Be more of a first impressions for me as well, so let's get started I have not tried this so this is the Fenty beauty Pro filter soft matte primer and this guy retails for $32 and you get how much you guys get in here 1.08 fluid ounces Which is a really good amount of product for a primer. That's very very very fair. Okay? It comes out More of a creamy almost like a lotion-y consistency Yeah, it feels like lotion 100%, so we're gonna put that all over The skin smells really nice actually smells like lotion Feels like lotion, too - I think there's definitely some drag when I'm putting on the skin like I really have to like move the product whoa Much more viscous, but it feels really nice on the skin so personally I have also been using a little bit of pore fessional from benefit in the t-zone I have again gnarly pores and I feel like it really helps this foundation look a lot better so I put a little bit of Porefessional in the center, so now I'm gonna take the little foundation brush. It's very thick a very dense very soft I'm liking it, and I'm gonna take the foundation. This is the Fenty Beauty Foundation It says shake well shake away, and you get one point zero eight fluid ounces in here and this retails for $34 so I think that is such a fair price point for a foundation I think that's actually really amazing when I tell you that I've worn this foundation every single day that I was in New York, I'm not kidding. Since Friday, I had been wearing this foundation every Single day that I was in New York every single day because I liked it so much and I'm not kidding It's literally like when I found my favorite foundations right now every single day I worn this I've been complimented on my skin, and I'm like yo and when that's happening bitch So this is more of a soft and matte foundation and gives you about a medium coverage It doesn't give you really full full coverage unless you build it up to be more full but again It looks beautiful on the skin, and I definitely can say it builds up very nicely I build it to be full personally because I'm a full coverage girl But if you're not a full coverage kind of person, this foundation still looks wonderful because it gives you a really nice Medium coverage doesn't look really scary on the skin It just looks really pretty But it does dry very quickly So you need to work with it kind of quickly and like really make sure that gets into the skin nicely You know patting motions of course will give you more coverage, and I'll take one more pump And I'll take the little Rihanna beauty sponge. This is the first time you it It's very soft very squishy, so I like that I'm gonna pounce out all over the skin Sponge is $16, so it's cheaper than the Beautyblender, but it feels like the Beautyblender which is pretty nice I'm just gonna pack this all over the skin just to build up the coverage a little bit and again This is in the shade at 230 I find this one matches me a little bit better when I was at the event they have like different little sections that you can Go and try some of the products, and you can pick what you wanted to have and they were color matching people But I thought this was really weird like they were color matching people and there was a lot of red lighting everywhere It wasn't like natural white light or there wasn't no like there was no sunlight so people that were getting matched I'm assuming we're getting matched with the wrong shade I grabbed the shade 230 cuz I matched myself And I'm like hopefully this is like decent and it was decent it was totally fine Don't get me wrong, but it wasn't like definitely my color even this one is a little bit dark for me But it's so more neutral as you can see guys. It is definitely a soft matte finish It's not really shiny whatsoever but it's not super matte. I think it's perfect I love that it literally looks like it filtered on your skin sets itself It's a great foundation and I fucking love it. So the next product that we have are the match sticks these retail for $25 And I'm gonna take the shade maple and it's a basically is like a bronzy shade how much product you get inside of it you Get point 25 ounces, which of course, I really do not think this is a lot of product I think it's actually a very little amount of product for 25 bucks, and you'll see where I put this or no, okay? Ok..We're not gonna use that shade Because that's literally doing nothing, thank god i grab the shade amber as well. This is more of a cool tone contour shade Okay, so maple was a flop amber was a flop. Let's go and try to shade mocha now because I just feel like those are Really, not working. This is definitely much more of a darker one. There we go, that looks more accurate And now, we're gonna take the contour and concealer brush This is like a little tiny brush that they have and this retails for okay, so this little guys 24 bucks It's like a kind of an on-the-go little contour brush. I think this is um. I don't know man I personally would not spend 25 bucks on this I definitely would not buy it myself, but if you guys are fans of Rihanna awesome. I'm gonna go ahead and blend this Matchstick in with the foundation, okay? Okay that definitely looks a lot better than it does on this side It's still not like living for it though hold on we're gonna try it on this Yeah, I'm gonna do it like this this is how I'm gonna apply I'm not gonna apply it from the stick directly. To me, the stick's a little bit too hard And I feel like they take off too much product, but they blend out pretty good There's definitely no harsh lines or anything that but of course I am stippling with this little brush And I would definitely suggest applying it with a brush and not applying it directly on your skin. Well the color is beautiful I like mocha a lot. That's definitely the color that works the best for me, so it blends out don't get me wrong I just think that it takes a little bit of time to blend out it's not like an easy like Quick thing as much with the sponge it definitely blends up a lot nicer than it does with the little brush I would definitely not really suggest the brush the sponge is a lot prettier And it looks a lot more diffused and not as harsh. It's not my favorite product It's definitely my favorite product the the cream stick in the contour shade let's go and try the light shade This is supposed to be a concealer and highlighter in one also guys one more thing I fuckin love Rihanna I love her so much. I think she's literally amazing and if I can fucking switch lives with anyone It would be her, but that does not mean I'm not gonna be as honest as I possibly can be in a review about her products all I'm saying is I'm gonna be honest No matter what and if you guys don't like that if you guys think that I'm being like mean towards her Or if you guys are gonna be intense and like defend her yo, I get that but it's a review I'm a youtuber this is what I do full-time and Just because I love Rihanna just because you guys love Rihanna does not mean that every single product of hers is gonna work amazingly for Me personally the matchstick Contour stick was not a win again. This is like one of those products. That's not it's not as emollient It's nice creamy you doesn't have to like press on so you don't take off any of the coverage. Okay, cool now We're gonna take the little sponge again We're gonna blend this out, so it says you're supposed to be able to conceal with this as well And I personally don't think you can I think it definitely leaves a lot of darkness here, but it is definitely brightening I would definitely use this as more of a brightening highlighting stick and not a concealer stick whatsoever It doesn't really cover anything But it's very brightening which I love and I feel like the highlight stick blends a little bit easier than the contour stick Maybe because I'm lighter in complexion that could be it. Okay. We need some real can see there on this too, okay I'm gonna take a little bit of some concealer for real and put it underneath my eyes. Just to really actually conceal Yeah, that's what I want to see see that okay. Dude. This is the difference. This is like really brightening conceals My darkness, this is not as brightening of course. I want full coverage underneath that eye, girl. I want full coverage I'm just gonna go ahead and quickly set my under eye because I do have concealer on there so I can definitely See a difference between the highlighter stick and the contour stick. I do like the highlighting stick don't get me wrong I think it actually does really brighten up everything for sure But I would not use it as a concealer stick it does not conceal to me It does not cover up really anything, but it does highlight really nicely And I definitely see an awake under eye like it's definitely much more like oh I don't know how I feel just yet I'm not really huge into like cream contouring as much so this is definitely a little bit more different for me now we have one More stick product we have highlighting shimmer sticks that are also $25 a pop there are also point 25 ounces I grabbed to shade we have the shade starstruck and the shade unicorn those look like the most fun to me and look like the most like I would be into, so we're gonna take the Shade unicorn on the floor this suppose we get purple. Okay, so yeah, I see it. I see the purple I see all right there. I definitely see something I'm seeing something I might just blend out a little bit and what we think the foundation comes off the stick use a fucking applicator for the sticks, I'm just telling you I Think your life's gonna be a lot easier if you use in a little Some type of thing to apply it where like a brush or a sponge because I'm telling you it like comes off the foundation comes off starstruck And we can do a little there. We go. I'll just like quickly do it I'll bounce it. Starstruck's looking very beautiful on camera Whoo whoo yes God? I'm a plane like this like if I swipe the foundation is gonna come right off, so I'm actually Living for starstruck right now girl it does a beautiful on the skin starstruck specifically I'm not really a huge fan of unicorn I think it disappeared pretty quickly and doesn't look purple whatsoever starstruck yes unicorn no, and then we have actual highlighters I Wanted to zoom in a little bit more so you guys can see what they look like a little bit closer She came out with a fucking slew a slew of highlighters. We have All these bad bitches right here, so the highlighters are retailed for $34. These are the Killawatt highlighters They come with a .28 ounces of product eight grams of product and these come with seven grams of product so the one that I'm living for the most Honestly the one I'm gasping for air for is Trophy wife, so this is trophy wife. It is a Gnarly-ass gold shade it's very intense. It has glitter flakes in it. It's one of those highlighters. I had a fucking whoa like Whoa it's extremely extremely gold almost too. Gold for my complexion. I don't think that looks very good on me because it is so Ridiculously gold, but we're gonna put it on my skin anyway So we can see what it looks like so we have a metal moon Which is a lighter version is much more white shade? This is what you get off this one This is metal moon right here next to it. This is it right here. This one's a lot more Powdery it's not as reflective. It's okay. The metal moon ones. Okay. It's not my favorite So then we also have these guys which are a two-in-one highlighter This is in the shade mean money and hustle baby So let's go and swatch these guys so we have a more blinding intense side Which is this one, and we have a more soft subtle side on this side, so we have them both right here side to side, we have that gnarly intense fucking blinding ass bitch right here, and then we have this subtle bitch for every day so that is really cool about this you guys can make it more subtle you guys can amp it up with a With the other shade if you guys want it to be more intense which I think is really cool Then also grab the shade lightning dust and fire crystal. Let's watch these guys as well They look like this on the hand they're much more white very pretty I really do love the killawatts, these guys right here Not a fan of that one, and I think trophy wife's amazing So let's go and watch some of these guys on the face are these apply some I'm gonna put some over this and here we Have the cheek hugging highlighter brush which retails for $32 Look at that fucking bitch, looks like a shark fin So we're gonna take this shade at trophy wife and we're gonna apply that on the left side of the cheek I'm packing it onto the brush it packs on very intensely. We're gonna play right here Hugs the cheek Y'all do you all see that fucking shit, dude like that is so intense Like Jesus what the fuck? See this shit. That's crazy so on the skin as you can see from here looks like the yellow Patch on my face when I'm looking head-on which I think is kind of annoying. This is definitely Not a shade that is like works for me very nicely, but again. It is beautiful. I would say more so for Medium to deeper complexion. I'm gonna take the shade metal moon and put that one right here It's right there on the forehead as you can see it's alright. It's definitely nothing special I would not buy metal moon whatsoever, I don't think it's that nice. Now, we're gonna take the shade hustle, baby I'll put that on this side over this highlighter I Want to take the other white one on top of this area Okay guys, I look like a fucking glazed doughnut nut case on this side Jesus Christ It looks really nice damn fuck. Okay, honestly They're stunning the highlighters, the Killawatt highlighters are so sickening. I still love trophy wife. I've already worn it on my eyes, and I think it's stunning as an eyeshadow. The duos, stunning I loved them. Metal moon, not my thing not my favorite one, so I'll pass on this guy, but the other three fucking nice man, so last but not least we have the Fenty Beauty Gloss Bomb Universal Lip Luminizer for $18 its 0.30 ounces a product, and it is of course a gloss or lip topper. Gloss type situation. I love the big dofer applicator Whoo oh Good, oh, my god. Yo this feels so nice It's like slightly tacky, but not too tacky where you're like. Oh, this is sticky. It's not sticky you're gonna Feel it on the lips for sure it's more of a heavy gloss, but it's so fucking stunting This is a hit for me. This is a hit for I'm this highlight is distracting cuz it's so blinding Okay, guys and that is it for the review on the Fenty Beauty collection by Rihanna. All in all what do I think of the line? I think the line is absolutely beautiful, I think that they did a great great job. Kendo is the brand that owns Fenty Beauty right. Rihanna is basically the face of Fenty Beauty it's like Fenty Beauty by Rihanna But Kendo is like the brains behind it. They're the brand that owns It's the same thing with like Marc Jacobs beauty, you know Kendo owns Marc Jacobs beauty It's not just Marc Jacobs beauty I think that kendo did an amazing amazing job, I know Rihanna, of course, was very very involved as well I can definitely tell that this line was a collaborative thing. It wasn't just done by one person things I did not try in this video where the blotting powder. I am NOT I don't need to blot right now, but I have used it and it did work fantastically and the blotting paper I did not use in takes video you because I don't need to blot also worked fantastically and is a really really fun like a little roller situation You kind of pat off, but all in all I think the line is great There were some definite hits though some definite misses for me personally. No line is literally perfect in my eyes I think that there's always room for improvement There's always room for growth when it comes to collections and things like that the foundation is incredible. The primer felt fantastic, the other highlighters were incredible. I'm like the brushes were fantastic, the gloss is beautiful I mean, it's a it's a gloss like it's not like Revolutionary of course but not by any means, but it is beautiful, and it feels really nice on the lips And if you bought the gloss you would not be disappointed, but yeah you guys Thank you so much for watching today's video and don't forget you guys to enter the giveaway That's going on right now All you need to do is subscribe to my channel and comment down below where you're from and why you want to win the Fenty Beauty collection.

we knew what's up at man um you a and welcome to my channel thank you so much for being here I really appreciate it thank you for uh joining the maniac fam thank you and like yeah love you guys I'm literally getting stronger cuz I go to the gym more I'm sorry when I'm hotter and when I'm skinnier I'm more cunt then I'll do some fucking service let's just go and get into this video right now okay guys so let's go ahead and start on the first item of holiday stuff that I think is actually really really cool and worth being Monte so first things first we have this this is the Sephora favorites give me more lip this guy retails for $68 I bought this for $68 the value is two hundred and fifty four dollars so every single year Sephora does things like this they come out with these little lip kits or it's like a highlighter kit or an eye liner kit her mascara kit things like that I only bought one because I just wanted to talk about the fact that they do have kits and all of them are a great deal but the one that I noticed this year that was the best deal is the lip product kit the difference between this one fuck you actually save a lot of money on this one so the difference is 186 dollars I actually did the math for all of them in the store and this one was the best deal for the entire Sephora favorites you get five full-size lip products and then you get one two three four five six seven eight nine nine mini so definitely getting 14 lip products here you get an honest hacia gloss bubbly brown lip lacquer dior hourglass huda beauty Marc Jacobs Tarte Laura Mercier smashbox Sephora collection you get tons of different things this is it right here you guys get a ton and if you guys are more of a beginner into the makeup realm and you guys wanted to try some multiple things i would suggest getting something like this if you guys wanted to dabble in wearing makeup and wearing some lipsticks and just trying out different lip products that you might like yourselves i would definitely suggest the lip kit of all the kids that i saw this was the best deal so a second little guy that i picked up were these guys right here these are from Stila i'm a huge fan of the glitter and glow shadows the glitter eyeshadows that they came out with and these are a pack of a six of them this retails for $45 and the value is $72 I really just wanted to talk about this really quickly because I just feel like this is a really really good deal when it comes to using the glitter at magnificent shadows so it comes with three glitter and glow shadows which I'm actually wearing right now I'm wearing one of the glittering glow shadows right now and the other side are the shimmer and glow this is absolutely nude I had no idea first of all this is something I got home I realized I said new shimmer and glow I thought there were all the glitter and glow shadow so that was kind of intriguing to me I was like wait I thought these were all the glitter shades so each of these you guys get 2.25 milliliters and honestly for an eyeshadow like it you don't need that much so I'm actually going to go in swatch the shade kitten which is a shimmer and glow shadow I don't know what this is I did not know they came out with these this is something that's new to me but as you can see right there this is a shimmering glow it's gonna be a shimmery base for that show wow that's fucking nice whoo child and it's going to swatch a glitter one as well just I guess let's see let's go on swatch these right here this is in the shade smoldering satin right there so we get a shimmer and you get a glitter so if you guys are the type of people that really enjoy glittery shades or something really bright and luminous onto the eyelid I think you guys would really really enjoy this set also you guys have been wanting to try out the Stila glitters but they're actually kind of expensive for one of them alone for one normal sized one like this it's $24 so I thought had value of you get six minis for 45 so I thought that was a really really good deal personally and I really do enjoy these shadows a lot so I would definitely suggest checking out the Stila eye for elegance kit of course the armies of course but hey let's go and talk about another item we got these this is the Tarte high-performance Naturals blush Bazaar Amazon clay blush palette so this guy I bought it for $44 and it retails for one hundred and fifty dollars so you are saving 806 bucks when you buy this this is the last one I was so happy I bought a house shook I was like please please let there be one more and this was the last one it was like thank you Jesus so this is what this guy looks like right here this is an entire blush palette it's a blush palette so the reason I wanted to include this in the best buys of the holiday season is because one it's only $44 which of course is a lot of money don't get me wrong it's a lot of money but with the value of being 150 I think I was like whoa the value of that was absolutely amazing and guys tarts blushes are some of my favorite blushes of the entire beauty industry I think they're absolutely amazing I'm actually wearing one right now they just last so long on the face it's ridiculous and they're so smooth and they're so creamy animaux just like I just honestly really truly love them and I really do enjoy that they have a nice variety of colors in here they have some that are a little bit deeper and complained so a little bit deeper ones here which would be great on darker complexions they have some lighter ones they have some corals there's some pinks they have some mods they actually have this highlighter I think we got a highlighter we got two highlighters I'm actually not the biggest biggest fan of tar highlighters it's not something that like tart like my first thought is not highlighters my first thought is like blushes and complexion products so I really really really do enjoy this I think this is an amazing amazing value in an amazing amazing kit you get ten it's a big fuckin thing look at my face look at my man face fucking Pac Man up in this bitch so next item guys that I thought was a really really good value for what it was is this by Kat Von D these are the everlasting liquid lipsticks this is the mini liquid lipsticks set it comes with one two three four five six seven eight eight lipsticks and it retails for $49 I think that that was a really really good deal I'm not exactly sure if this is for holiday or not because it does not say what the retail of value itself is but I thought you know what this is actually a really really good deal Kat Von D has some really nice liquid lipsticks and it comes with a great variety of shades as you can see here that comes with like the black one a brown some nice cool toned Jade some nude some warmer shades you get some like cranberries some Mahdi's up in here let's go ahead and swatch a couple of them this isn't the shade of sanctuary I think these are just shades that are really really popular from Kat Von D each one of these guys is point 10 fluid ounces I'm gonna go and swatch sanctuary who's kind of swatching a little streaky but hey it is what it is it's right there like every other thing too worried it's going to swatch this one Hawkwind woo Hawkwind I like that beautiful shade that one's less tricky then sanctuary was right there beautiful shades I honestly think that Chi Bundy has such a nice variety of shades in her cult in her makeup line so that's why I wanted to talk about this really quickly and of course it is just a good deal 49 bucks you get a liquid lipsticks they are mini but it's just a good deal if you guys wanted to get into liquid lipsticks or using capital D liquid lipsticks or just liquid lipsticks in general for a nine bucks eight liquid lipsticks that's the win for me that's a fuckin win so next I wanna talk about really quickly is another thing that they do every single year and I don't know if you guys know about this but the four does this every goddamn year which is a great fucking deal this is the Sephora favorites perfume sampler so I guess I technically did have to Sephora favorites so I bought this for $65 and a retails for 119 that's the retail value of it basically what it is you sample all these different types of scents and the scent that you like the most I think you go back and you return like your little slip that's inside of it and they will give you the medium-sized of this fragrance for free because you technically bought this so this is a really really good gift or just a good I don't figure self you want to just try out different sands and you're like oh I don't know what kind of something I want to try it have some really really nice cents in here that was sold it very very well when I worked at Sephora 17 samples 17 yeah this has been going on since I worked at Sephora so it's been going on for years and years and years and it does well every single year and they have another one for men as well I've seen this is a great gift to give someone so I really want to bring it up to you guys in Baguio this sampler is absolutely amazing these items I bought here are when I went into the store in Sephora and bought them I'm sure they have so many more different gift sets online but I didn't buy these online I bought these in the source of your way into a Sephora store you should probably see all these items there and this is where I thought like wow these are really really cool sets good cool gift ideas that people would actually really enjoy okay guys we're down to the last one we're down to the last one we got this guy right here so the last item here is by touch insole these are the metallic liquid foil glitters another glitter eye product that I absolutely love comes with six okay guys so this retails for $40 and it is a $60 value so it is a little bit less of a value than the Stila one you guys only save twenty bucks on this guy but again it is a savings we're saving money and so guys how these work it's kind of like hard to explain so how these work you guys use the little liquid that it comes with first and then you apply be like glitter flaky part on top of it to give you a really really intense foiled metallic ass shit that's absolutely beautiful I'm actually gonna do it on my arm right now let's do this really pretty golden so we have the liquid right here use the liquid side and you go in and apply the liquid on your hand or on your I what the fuck on your hand I mean I'm applying on me and fucking blinding fall okay play that let it kind of like soak up so once it's starting to get a little more dry I like to kind of smooth it out with my hand it's gonna be easier on the eye if you smooth out with your finger I just feel like it's easier and then I'm gonna go ahead and apply the more flaky part and this guy it comes out like a weird little paddle I'm not the biggest fan of the panel but what you want to do is you want to apply it on the shimmer and just pack it on oh definitely again with this one I would actually suggest putting it on to like a on your hand the back of your hand and then like packing it with that because this is kind of a bitch to apply in this little area right there you see a little more of a white it's so blinding it's hard to see right there so you can see right there this is the one that has the more glittery intense flakes this side is the one that does knock the camera can't even figure it out with that blinding okay guys so basically it's very similar to the Stila eyeshadows but it is a two in one type of process and it really intensifies the shades so much and it sets the cream underneath it so they last a really really nice amount of time on the eye and you just get a really really fucking cool ass effect and it's just sickening and in hits so I thought this would be really cold you I had no idea that they had this for holiday and I think it's really smart for touching soul to do this I feel like this is like one of their best parties ever created was the metallic liquid foil glitter product that they came out with so coming up with one that comes with six okay guys and that is it for my entire little gift guide for this season I just saw a bunch of these random items something you know what that looks like a really good set and I've these a lot of the items I have tried myself personally so I'm like you know what this would be a really great value for someone that has more of a beginner or someone that's wanting to find really good gifts to give someone that just didn't really know like the way around the gift set or something like that I hope you guys enjoyed it have a lot of fun of filming this video if you guys if you guys want to see me do one of these for all tuks I can tell you make that happen I'm not really sure exactly what type of gift sets that they haven't also if they have ones that are similar or the same then maybe I won't I can definitely do if you guys want to see it if you guys like this video I can tell you make it happen for you guys other than that that's it I'm gonna go off and play with zaiah and just go hang out and get some food I'm kind of fuckin hangry starting to get my own fucking lipstick not wearing yeah you guys thank you so much watching today's

with I'm like on a tangent right now I just woke up from a nap so I'm like I'm like in that zone you don't mean but anyway today's video is going to be a review on the new honest Tasha prism palette this this looks like an inside stunning gorgeous look anyway I wanted to review the new palette because of the last palette the subculture palette behind a saucy Beverly Hills was not my favorite palette that they ever had came out with you know I thought was a little bit too powdery was kind of hard to blend and things like that I'm just very curious about the quality of this palette is it going to be so much of a subculture is it going to be a little bit harder to use like what is the tea with the fucking palette so that's what today's video is going to be guys we're going to review and demo the new prison pop on associate Beverly Hills I'm actually wearing her new glow kit for sugar glow kit which is fucking stunning and I'm wearing their blush kit too which I also really like as well so two wins two hits in the holiday collection which I'm really really happy about so as always if you guys do not like this video if you guys do not like me please don't fucking watch it you

to enter the giveaway just subscribe to my channel and boom you are entered great let's go and get into this review [Music] okay so let's go ahead and talk a little bit about the pellets itself okay ready so we're gonna start on the pallet this is the prison pallet the cover of it is a fealty type black print it's literally identical to the modern Renaissance and the subculture when it comes to the print I love this gold detail with this prismatic feeling I think it's fucking stunning I love that the all-black packaging is very sleek and it's beautiful and I'm fucking live so you guys open the pallet of course it's the same presentation as the other uh Nastasia pallets is what you get let's go ahead and right there that's what she gets that's what it is we of course get the dual ended and brush we got a fluffy brush and get a packing brush which i think is very very fucking cool I love pallets that come with brushes when they're nice when they're nice I like if they're not at the nuisance anyway so it comes with 14 shades and it retails at $42 and I believe it's available already it's available I think goes on the 2nd and the 3rd of October and store and online it's already available it comes with 7 mats for duo chromes and three metallic shades eyeshadows made in the USA the fuck usually they're made in China which is crazy I had no idea this wasn't made in the USA which is awesome I think it's really cool that they kept it at the price that they normally keep their pallets even though it's made in the USA which I know is so much more expensive to make shadows in than in China so this is really fucking cool that they kept at 42 bucks I mean I don't think they could really pick it up because they already sent the prices at 42 whatever I think it's fantastic that they didn't make it any more expensive the brush is made in China the eyeshadows are made in the USA ok guys so for the net amount in here I can't really exactly find it I cannot find it on the palette you cannot find the website it says net weight is 0.7 grams and point zeroes two ounces each on associate Baron those pallets are known to have not that much product in them that is what it is they have a smaller pan size that's how they can fit so many colors in one pellet the Pens are a lot smaller than a normal circle shadow is and they have a lot less in the pan but that's what makes it 42 bucks so it makes it a little bit more affordable than pellets that would have a lot more product in it so it is what it is but honestly that's it I'm so curious to see if this is similar to the subculture I'm gonna swatch with my finger just to see this is the metallic shades I want to see or swatching loose in right here we have pyramid pyramid right there I just watched that one twice dimension don't feels real fucking nice dimension was stunning let's do Spinks oh me pinky right there Spinks and let's do osiris because that's the one I think I wanna use on my lid Osiris right there so we're going to do a swatch on the hand one one so this is a couple of them right here so this is the five I just watched on man right here Osiris is a little bit more patchy than the other shades are right there it's a little more pouch you can see more skin through but I can already tell feeling these shades they're a lot nicer already in subculture honestly they're a little bit drier in formula they don't feel as wet as the subculture palette colors do but they're still really nice I'm gonna swatch eternal eternal spills very wet eternal feels very oily and like Oh more wet consistency and I'm gonna swatch thrown still more on the dry side we're gonna swatch that one want to swatch that one at least two on the sides right there it's stunning what those swatched beautifully makes me very happy but I want to see the fall out test I'm so guy that's what I did okay we're gonna Pat we're gonna pat pat pat pat you guys this is a good sign there's some follow of course because that's a natural shadow reaction so it's going sort into this one tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap in oh my gosh this is so much fucking better already just by pressing on it I can tell tenfold how much more pressed and tight and compacted the colors are let's do this one there's some follow of course is some right here too somewhere here but that's super super normal for an eyeshadow palette that's very very normal I like actually I enjoy some fallout in my shadows I like to feel like I'm getting some pick up on my shades and really getting some saturation and pick me in there I think when I'm dipping into a eyeshadow and there's nothing coming off I'm kind of like the fucking knew it I actually really do enjoy some fallout in some pickup on a shadow but not too much like the subculture had it but this one was fucking beautiful okay guys I'm already like living and breathing gagging for it so let's go ahead and see how they apply on the eye because we did swatches on the fingers they swatch beautifully I'm very very impressed the matte shades were not too powdery which is fantastic so now let's go and put it on the highs and see what kind of thing we come up with okay guys so what we're gonna do we already just dipped in with a twenty seven a fluffy brush of course any fluffy brush works fantastically for this and I'm gonna take the shade lor which is a beautiful rose petal II pink shade I'm gonna put that into the crease and see how that acts on the eye and see how it blends out looks I'm noticing right now no fall out on the eyes whatsoever picked up beautifully didn't have too much powder pick up this is less powdery and intense then the fucking amount of Renaissance palette like this is such a beautifully pressed palette I'm very very impressed and I'm not just saying that you guys know I fucking read the subculture palette to fill I'm really really really loving with this palette so far so now guys I'm gonna take a morphe r39 I'm gonna take this shade Eden which is a basically like a peach like deep peach a need some fucking beach so we're going to place that into the crease and mix it in with lure oh that's so fucking stun so guys I'm noticing of course that Eden is acting the same way as Laura its blending out so beautifully and there's no excess fallout on my face it just all kept on to the brush really nicely of course with Fallout you guys definitely under like make sure there's no fallout on the face which I've been doing but I'm just letting you guys know I'm just kind of talking through with y'all so I'm taking that same r39 and i'm take the shade parallel which is a deep deep brown and that didn't go on the outer corner ooh it's fucking beautiful honest us yeah y'all did fucking that only the outer crease guys are actually gonna keep that on the outer crease only I don't want to go too far in with it I wanna keep it deep out here guys okay I'm so torn right now because I really want to use Osiris or dimension or throne I don't know which one to use though Osiris watching it it feels so dry like this is actually a pretty dry shade of the pallet like it feels very like press down really hard thrown swatches beautifully and dimension swatches fucking beautifully I think we should just do fucking the room cuz that's still not speaking to me right now do it fuck it I'm going in oh my god we're going in guys this is a duo come Shane Oh oh my god I love it I love it and it's applying beautifully on the eyes of course I'm using my finger with this I just enjoy applying intense lid shades like with a finger so straighter like more duochrome me let me try a little bit with the brush just to see what we'd get off of a brush okay picks up pretty nicely on a brushes the color right here this shade though guys I will say this shade it does give out some fallout there's definitely some follow happening with my finger it's not just with the brushes it's happening with the finger as well he's a really really really really kind of impossible to avoid fall out with you finishing there really those hyper intensely pigmented shades come on that's gonna be the fallout okay oh that's so pretty now just go ahead and blend in the Eden and lower shade with the lid shade just to make sure there is a nice easy transition and nice beautiful blend that we're doing okay guys this what we got so far on this eye I'm gonna go do the top of the eye on the other side real quick and I'll be right back okay she is getting it together I'm fucking living and breathing for this fucking lot and I think that uh Nastasia did an amazing job with his palette so far now I'm taking morphine 36 I'm gonna take a little bit of that black shade obsidian which is a beautiful name for a black and I'm gonna put that on the outer corner mixing the brown with the throne shame and then to the crease really really deepen it all nut hmm taking a little bit of that same and 4-3-3 from morphe just gonna blend out that black a little bit I'm gonna take a little bit of this shade dimension on my inner corner of my eye because it's honestly been speaking to me this whole time and I don't know why I haven't been listening or take a little bit of dimension it's like a really pretty lavender bright shade to combat that's stunning their own shade that's sickest fuck that is sick as fuck I live taking out how to morph um to ten just a little packing brush so that's our base color right there I take a little bit of Lucid which is a lighter shade but that even closer in okay guys so now that we have at the inner corner done I feel like it's very very smoky and vampy by this for what I'm liking because I really want to be extra and that bitch I'm gonna take Osiris which is that really pretty bluish purple shade on a pencil brush I'm gonna run that on my lower lash line huh okay okay guys the shadows not my thing I thought it was going to be my thing but it's definitely not my thing I mean use my finger instead I mean we can definitely make it work you can definitely definitely it work it's not as nice as the other shades are that's for fucking sure and then you cook it looks really patching and intense I'm like oh not the biggest fan but of all the shades that's the only shade I didn't really work for me like I really wanted to but you know what that's so far it's only been one shadow and this whole palettes I didn't like so that is totally fine with me I feel like that's still a very positive experience it's just not my favorite shade take a little bit of lore and I'm gonna put that underneath my Cyrus just to blend it out a little bit doesn't look so harsh on this morphe e18 brush this is a bigger pencil brush whenever I'm doing anything like on my lower lashline guys like blending out my lower lashline I'd like to take an e 18 specifically it's just small precise brush like a but it still pencil brush which is really really cool okay amazing let's do some eyeliner I love you guys always tell me that you want to see me do my eyeliner but I don't know why it's like such a boring theme and I never do it correctly in front of you guys I'm always like it's not my fault P shying I'm liner shy you know of course it was going so well it's okay we can always make it drag that's fine we can make it drag if we need look a little rough but uh I'm gonna finish the other eyeliner off of camera and I'll be right back awesome for some lashes on to make it look more kunti okay guys we have the lashes on now we are wearing Lily Miami lashes my go twos or take a little bit of my NARS pot that I always always always use I'm going to do a quick little line underneath my we're gonna let that set in place and I'm gonna put that green shade because I really wanted to use that one to put that green shade underneath and then we're gonna take that same brush I'll gonna take shade sphere which is the really cool minty intense Ashley this one has a lot of kickback on it but it's a neon shade so I don't really expect anything less I'm going to press the concealer would you like a fun little different line y'all do not need to do this but I think you're just a fun little pop and the reason I put the concealer underneath is because he's gonna actually make it more vibrant and pop a little bit more also guys when I was off of camera I add a little bit of that same glow kid on the brow bone to give me a little bit more of a highlight but this is what we have you guys this is the eye my fucking lip you guys we are finished with the look this is what we have going on right now on my lips in case you guys are wondering I am wearing Kylie cosmetics hazel lipstick this is from their new holiday collection coming out also I added a little bit of black eyeliner on my inner like waterline just to give it a little bit more of a smoky feel and this is what the look turned out to be an absolutely fucking love it but anyway what do I think about the palette is it a subculture part too is it better than the subculture how is this present palette in comparison to the other shadow palettes and I have to say guys this is one my favorite palettes on associate has ever ever ever done other than the modern renaissance that's like of course my number one it's like holds a special place in my heart but I honestly think they did an amazing amazing job the shadow quality is so much better than these subculture palette the one at least I tried I'm not sure exactly if they recalled some and put more out I don't really know exactly if they did that or not or if the palettes that are out now are better than what they were putting out in the beginning anyway all I'm saying is that I think that the prism palette is so so good and definitely worth the 42 dollars of the price point I think the shadows are beautiful there were some hiccups of course that one shade Osiris was not my thing at all but everything else other than that was fantastic and I'm so so happy to see that they come out with such a beautiful palette following this of culture palette great job to anastacio Beverly Hills you guys fucking killed it with this palette and I think it turned out so beautifully and I think you guys just about ready yeah guys that's it for today's video I hope you guys enjoyed this review on the UH Nastasia prism palette I love doing reviews of palettes I think it's so much fun that's it guys that's it for today's video everything of course I talked about in today's video will be linked down below as well as brushes that I use and things of

hey guys welcome back to my channel so today's video is going to be a review and first impressions demo on the brand-new two-faced little love light prismatic highlighter I have not yet tried them and I really really wanted to do a first impressions video to see if they're worth of the price or not and I asked you guys on snapchat you guys wanted me to do a review on them or not and a lot of you guys requested me to do it so I'm like okay fine I'm going as soon as I get back from out of town I'm going to film with these bad boys they're so absolutely beautiful edges and see I'm like the packaging is adorable so you guys want to see a review and demo and is it worth it on these highlighters I have no idea yet if I'm gonna peel these or not keep on watching as always if you guys want this feel if you guys don't like me please don't lie to me with that but you guys like this video and like videos like this give this video a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel if you want already so again to review and demo of the new Too Faced Lovelight heart highlighters sure let's talk Twitter hey guys so these are from the brand to face as you guys know I'm sure you guys are not living on a rock you guys know this is so classic to face packaging these retail for $30 each and they came up with three shades first we have blinded by the light which is the lightest shade we have ray of light which is the pinkier shade and we have you light up my life which is the golden highlight shade they each contain 9 grams of product which I believe that's a lot like 9 grams sounds like a bunch thank grams that's a lot that's a lot of so the Sephora app tells me that it's a heart-shaped highlighter with a silky smooth texture that allows for a buildable pearl radiance and it's a liquid to powder formula and it's Bane it features a luminosity boosting agent that instantly brightens it delivers gorgeous color payoff with a pearl radiant finish cool so I'm going to honestly just swatch them on my hand first I'm gonna swatch them here and just see what we think of the colors first in the swatch and I'm gonna decide which colors which two colors I'm gonna put on each cheek to see how they act on the tree can we just talk about the inside and how freakin sick nasty that press is look how cool this is with this diamond heart filter Dennis I don't know I'm just literally living and breathing for it I think it's so gorgeous again this highlighter is $30 so it's got to be worth a honey okay so we're going to go in first with the shade blinded by the light which is this color right here of course we're going to swatch it on our finger we're going to cute one too okay we got some shine we got some shine a little harder can I press it a little harder the more that came off and now we're going to put this we're going to swatch it on our hand and see what we think we have gorgeous I was a little skeptical on the finger but on the hand it looks absolutely beautiful so far I'm digging blinded by the light this is a lighter shade I'm probably in for this one on one of my cheeks cool so now we're gonna go in with the rose see that little seen that color this is in the shade ray of light which is the pinky one it's just ah look at this this is so beautiful honestly it makes me go on the light you know what I mean like it's so pretty we're going to give it a 1 to give it a fair swatch go to fair swatch okay that's right here so this is a peachy pink color of course as you guys can see it's a very peachy pink not as blinding as the white one so it's going to swatch on the hand see what we think of it right here next to ray of light you can see right here very pretty this one is not as blinding as you can see as the first one is but of course the first one is a lot lighter maybe that's why it's a little bit more intense feeling this shade it feels smooth like the first one but it actually feels a little bit more powdery then the other one does like a little bit more powder kicks up on this one not a bad thing I'm just saying that is what I feel thankfully not not too bad not too bad as you can see not too bad now we're going with last watches that you light up my life you light up my life in the gold in the cold the goal is so beautiful to it literally looks like brick of gold I live I  live and breathe are you get a fair swatch again it was very very smoothly just like the first one did ooh intense like the first one was as well I like this I like that okay great so I feel like that one was a beautiful beautiful swatch so we have the gold one we have the peach one we have the white one as you can see they look like this right here I feel like the white one and the golden are the most reflective the pink is a very subtle you I suppose so because the bold one looks really nice I'm gonna going with the white Hammond going with the pink on each cheek just to see how the white and the pink will build on the face so far I'm impressed with the white one and I'm impressed with the gold one let's go in highlight the right side of my face with the white one blinded by the light bitch better blind me or else cuz this is not being called blinded by the light for no reason you feel me I'm gonna go in with a more free em 5 10 brushes my classic go-to highlighting brush so we're going to load it up layer two okay layer three so blinded by light this isn't right here with four layers on my cheek it looks beautiful on camera I think it looks really pretty on my face as well it just took four layers to get it to what I wanted it to be for opacity opacity it got there so I think that we can you can definitely build this highlighter when I went in with the first swatch I was like tear cut like it just didn't look like it was gonna be a blinding highlight which I wanted it to because it's called blinded by the  light but building up it definitely got there anything it's absolutely beautiful now we have to do the other side with the shade ray of light which is the pinkier one because that was the less opaque one on my hand and I want to test the most opaque and then less okay and I'm gonna go in with the brush - why 14 so we are going to load that bad bitch up okay one layer is not enough two layers still not enough three layers four layers hmm this one's not as intense this one's not as blinding another one it's a really pretty pinky peach okay well swatch on the hand swatch on the face we have the peachy pink one on the side huh we are in a conundrum guys I have my verdict I have my red whether I think these are worth of the $30 or not oh my got $30 for the plug this is with four layers each on the sides of my face four layers of this color four layers of this color to get it to the opacity I wanted it to be the white one got there the pink one did not so I will say my verdict what do I think about these I think that total they are a beautiful highlighter I love the packaging I think this diamond-encrusted press is freakin phenomenal that the heart is adorable I love the concept so much however I think that the product inside of it if you guys like a natural highlight that you can build you're gonna love this and I think that you guys will love it and you guys will go out and buy it I'll be obsessed but if you guys are anything like me where you guys want a powering highlight right away and you want it to be blinding a really intense that I don't think these are gonna be your favorite because this took me four times to build and they still not even that lightning that's four that's four layers of highlight and it still is not blinding and that's the lightest one so I think that's kind of that's kind of annoying to me so in my opinion personally do I think that they are worth the $30 no I don't only because I like more of a blinding highlight I feel like these highlighters were blinding and intense and really POW I would be into it but these are much more of a soft ray of light kind of highlight and if you guys are into those soft highlights awesome I think you guys will really really love these because they look really really pretty on the skin they're very soft and they're like a glisten I like it for layers later I like it but I don't think that they're my thing personally like personally but personally they're not really my thing and yeah guys that's it for the entire video happy I said fun watching my review and demo using the new Too Faced highlighters the little heart highlighters that are really really adorable and cute let me know you guys want to see more reviews on things reviews and first impressions are really really fun just to see well my first question is right away to see if I like the product or not I'm like is it good it's like if I can like it am I not gonna like it you know I'm my face can't lie I'm just gonna be like hold me I like it already don't that's just what it is so how these that's a good thing about me when you're watching me that my face does not lie at all I like it or I don't like it and these I liked but I didn't love them and I wouldn't pay the radar um I'd paint like $20 for them I paid 20 yeah guys I love you guys so much okay the night or day where you guys are and I'll catch you guys in my next video bye guys my 4 layers of it to get into the opacity the opacity that I really is they're really honestly I just noticed now really you guys couldn't tell me that there was listing on my chin the whole time well that's right now they're me load her up [Music] hey guys that welcome the sound on hey guys welcome back to my channel no I was a gaggle but you guys you like this video and bike and bike videos like be one of those bidets testing testing uno dos tres wearing a hey wayya ring so as you guys can see from the title of today's video today's video is going while it's a total twister [Music] 
hey guys that welcome back to my channel so I tell you is going to be a highly ass requested video so I recently got this a bad boy in the mail this was sent to me by an associate Beverly Hills his brand they did send me these subculture pellets but that does not mean that I'm not gonna be honest and 100% truthful no matter what I get sent tons of products from tons of different brands and I always stay honest no matter what and that's not changing for any brand so today's video is going to be a review and demo using the newest subculture palette this has been in a lot of controversy recently like saying that I was like really powdery and that's not blendable and things like that I had used it one time but I only used about three shades to do one look it was just a quick one too and the shadows worked fine for me I only I mean I only use three so but today's video is gonna go a little more in-depth and I'm gonna put some of the more bold colors on my eyes say to see how they work and how they blend with the other colors in the palette as always if you guys don't like this video if you guys do not like me please don't watch it you know the joke with that but if you guys do like this video please subscribe to my channel if you're not already and your free new what's up a man um you a and welcome to my channel thank you so much for being here I really really appreciate it but yeah let's only get into this review and demo using these new subculture palette by Anastasia Beverly Hills so a little bit about the palette this retails for $42 on on a Sasha's website there's 14 shades in here there is one two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 11 mattes in here which means there's only three foiled slash shimmer shades wow that's hard to say as you can see I used this color this color and I'm gonna try to do a different look just so I can use as many different shades on my eye as possible so you guys can see what they look like or how they act so we're gonna take the shade on as you guys can see as I'm pressing into it there is tons and tons and tons of fallout there's no denying it there's definitely a lot of fallout we're gonna mix it a little bit with the shade mercury which is a little more of a cool can you see that it's a lot powder there's a lot of powder going on here so I'm gonna go ahead and put this into the morphe m-53 3 today blending a fluffy brush okay okay this palette is extremely pigmented holy first of all I'd actually expected mercury to be this dark we're looking at it on the pan it looks like a very very light transitioning gray here it looks like darkest okay don't know why hmm what do y'all think iw they went on a little bit darker than I was expecting for sure let's go and take the shape axis right here which one take the shade axis we're gonna put it on the lid on the outer lid holy these are really pigmented holy I want to tweak a little bit on the inner corner as well so the shade axis is extremely extremely pigmented a little bit product goes a very very long way this one I feel like is one of those treats that's a little bit too pigmented where it's like oh if you mess up a little bit it can like go awry very very quickly so be cautious of that this color is actually a little bit harder to blend out then they'll actually type in it's a little bit more of a you really need to sit and work with it you know really work on in now I'm going to take the shade destiny right here it's a very pretty military green shade I'm gonna lightly softly press that without seeing it four three three in the center how's it good towards the center in here I'll bring that in so if you guys were to get this palette I just think that the blend is a little bit tougher to do than other palettes that I have yeah cuz I'm really I'm really really really really working here on blending this out and I'm not really getting too far with it uh yeah okay so this is what we have so far as you can see the blend is not as seamless as I usually like it I think it's a little bit more patchy kind of annoys me now I'm gonna take the shade all-star holy this one is extremely thick I'll urge us pressed it twice oh my god oh my god and I'm taking on a morphine m16 seven a great packing brush I'm gonna pack that on to the center of the lid I'm really just playing with as many colors as I can because I really want to be able to have a nice definitive thought on this palette so I'm using as many as I can I'm sure some of you guys are thinking man you what in the are you doing with this I I'm like you know I'm just kind of playing around I'm just doing my thing and I think that into the crease blend into the crease she's a little weird because I feel like when I'm blending this all-star shade it's kind of blending into nothing I just like it's not as pigmented as it once was when I put it down so a little bit more in the center it's just not as easy to palette to blend as I thought it was going to be I feel like my crease is starting to look a little bit muddy um the colors starting to blend together a little bit in a weird way they're not like sticking to my eye specifically I don't know I don't know guys I feel like this look is a look I could have easily easily accomplished and like with no problem and have a nice seamless blend but I have to really really work on this blend so that's kind of weird I'm gonna take a little bit of that sheet adorned and I put that on the center of my lid just on a really really really center point okay so now I'm gonna take a little bit of a pencil brush and I'm gonna take these blue yellowy type shades the shade edge and NuWave and I'm gonna go and run that underneath my lash line really dust off as much product as you guys possibly can I'm gonna take a little better shade at Roxy I'm gonna put that into the crease right here maybe that'll help warm up the crease make it not look as like blotchy and weird this is also a very very very powdery shade and now I'm gonna take the shade Rowdy which is like a really pretty dark plum --is-- really deep deep deep cool tone purple and I'm gonna put that on the lash line down here ooh a little blend blend out that shade you guys I'm sorry I find being a little more quiet in today's video I just feel like whenever I'm doing a look like this or something that I need to really really really really concentrate on I get a lot more quiet so I'm like wait  I need to really focus on the look you know I'm saying which kind of sucks I feel like what this palette yeah I think the look turned out to be pretty cool but I had to really really again really a lot we're gonna take the shade Electric which is like a really intense weird like yellow-green I'm gonna go and swatch over here I'm gonna show you guys what it looks like right here on the inner corner and this brush gives you like a very subtle almost like UV glow that's kind of a cool shade that's very different and never seen shade like this so this shade is actually taking a lot more building than I thought like the other ones we're so pigmented where I was like shook this one you need a lot more to actually build on to it let's take that shade cube and be done with it we're gonna take that on the brow bone this is a white with a pink reflect it's basically pink like when it goes on the skin it's pink it's not like white at all as you guys can see there's like a pink reflect on my brow bone this one is another shade that takes a little bit more of a building to it okay guys so this is it this is the look I ended up coming up with using the subculture palette I think it's really cool fun give her a look for me I don't really do too many looks like this I just feel like this palette wasn't the easiest palette to blend out that I have I think that I have other palettes that blend out a lot easier than this I think the fact that they're so powdery doesn't really allow it to stick to the skin as much I don't know if that makes sense and when I say powdery let me show you guys what I'm talking about so for example let's take the shade down right I'm taking a little fluffy brush you just kind of do this and I know if you can I don't you guys didn't see on camera but a lot of product gets picked up but I think that's kind of I don't like Roxy for example same thing same exact concept with Roxy as well usually I'm obsessed with an associate cause I think that they do beautiful palettes I love their color schemes for example the modern renaissance is like one of my favorite paths of all time this has gotten some usage as you can see it's so tore up because I use it so often and these shades are very powdery - do not get me wrong these shades whoo child powder but for some reason I've like the modern renaissance palette the shades blend easier than these subculture palette shades do and they're a little bit more true to color I feel like these shades are much more like oh yeah that's exactly what I'm gonna get soon as I put it on my eye that's the color but subculture one I just felt like they look a little bit different on the eye than they do in the pan kind of weird I wasn't really expecting that but that's totally what happened all in all what do I think of the pallets I think that for $42 for 14 shades I think that's a great price point however I think that this palette for me is more of a Miss I just really don't think that it's the most practical and I feel like if you're more of a beginner I'd make up it's gonna be a little bit difficult to use I really really do I don't think it's gonna be the easiest like let's just let's just do a quick little eye look with the subculture it's not as easy to use it's much more it's much more work I would say for me personally I probably will not be reaching for this palette again because of the fact that it is a little bit harder to use for example I can take Jeffries and drogyny palette technically this palette has shades that are similar to Geoffrey's palaces without first but I feel like those shadows blend easier and they're just as pigmented just as nice discipline is a lot easier they're not as powdery so I just don't think I'll really be reaching for this palette very often so for me it was a Miss it's not a hit but like I say in all my videos no brand ever comes out with things that I'm going to love 100% of the time there's always gonna be things that I'm obsessed with like the amount of Renaissance there's things I'm not gonna be obsessed with like the subculture palette or - osseous so I think that Anastacio is brand in general is absolutely beautiful it's amazing they killed it in the beauty world and I really do think that their brand is like one of the forefront beauty brands of all beauty brands I think theirs is like one to look at like wow people are excited about on a sauciest brand which is why what do I even wanted to film this like I was excited about this palette and I was just had to film this yeah you guys that's it for today's video as always give us a night or day wherever you guys are and I'll catch you guys in my next video bye guys can y'all hear me you guys this foundation of oxidized so intensely Jesus I went on like my color and there turn orange whatever clothes sweet yes this look is really cute if a boy Bundy better okay bitch you did that you  dead Donna piss out really intense pimple right there it's called a swollen I'll see you later peace emblazoned peace [Music] 
hey guys welcome back to my channel so in today's video is going to be a fun testing products video you guys know I live live and breathe and die for these kind of testing products videos I've just gotten into them recently within the past couple months and they're so fun to try especially cuz I can do a couple of them in one day and I can get so much done it just it's great the whole thing about it is great and I absolutely love it so today's video is going to be testing paper makeup I literally have a plethora of paper makeup that I bought I've seen this floating around on Twitter and I was people like testing out paper makeup and putting it on their faces and seeing like literally foundation like that was in paper bronzer that was in paper blush and highlighter in paper form and you put it on and you apply it and I was just like like that sounds really really cool to me you know I just wanna test out paper makeup for myself I want to see if it's bomb does it work does it not work and I just kind of wanted to see what it was these are all from my Couture my Couture as always if you guys all like this view if you guys do not like me please don't fucking watch it you know that you're with that but if you guys do like this video please subscribe to my channel if you're not already and if you knew what's up and man um you and welcome to my channel thank you so much for being here I really really appreciate it yeah it's going to get into testing of paper makeup okay so let's read about the product I learn just pulled it up on liner right now we have different kinds I got foundation paper bronzer paper blush paper and highlight paper foundation paper is $18 highlight paper is $18 a blush paper is $15 and the bronzing paper is $18 as well so the reason I'm actually wearing makeup right now is I wanted to take out half of my face apply the paper makeup on the side with nothing on and I also wanted apply on the side with a full base on already because they are promoted and they're talking about as blotting papers they're on-the-go blotting papers are not specifically like a full coverage foundation on bare skin you know what I mean but I want to try it out on both ways they are blotting papers that are on the go that you apply when you're like getting oily and it deposits color as well that's what the site looks like and that's what the site says to me so I'm gonna test it today on my face on half with makeup on and half with my makeup on so I grabbed a little white beam that oh why be take my right side because it's easier to see what I'm implying it so I'll take off this side goddamn whoa and there we have it we have half the beat on well I'm gonna keep the eye makeup on because I know that I make it was a knife honestly it's very pretty so I'm gonna keep that shit on I mean there's literally no point taking off my makeup because there's no eye makeup that's paper okay you know what we're gonna use this to prep the skin be fair be fair and prom your fucking skin do not cheat Matt be fair in this review isn't this such a trip like this to me this is a fucking trip like we literally have pages of paper foundation that's weird so this is the nude glow flawless to go foundation powder paper how to glow to go step one tear one sheet from the booklet use one sheet for entire face step 2 press and sweep sheet all over face step 3 use sheet to buff and smooth out powder right thing so let's go ahead and rip our page first we're gonna play on the bare skin face nice whoa so my fingers I press and sweep sheet all over face and you shoot above him so press and sweep press ensue you guys are really trying this work you guys understand here that's what she done like that's all I could use for a sheet it because I have a man faith I'm not mirror it's writing to the page try another page dear God dear God no no no in settling in my bugging pores you can see like right there where it's at you can see how it falls into your pores like a mother fucker okay guys so we're gonna use it on the other side as well let's be fair ensues on the other side as if it's a blotting paper okay Oh God can see right there I talk to make my pores look so fucking gnarly I mean it looks way better on this side than it does on this side clearly look at those pores look at the unevenness this side is definitely not much better it's still falling into my pores in this area right here makes them super super emphasized and intense so far the foundation powder is kind of busting for me that's definitely not a it's not a go it's not a go let's go and take the bronzing paper now yeah so we have the bronzer papers right here okay so let's use this this is the most cool toned bronzer I've ever ever seen it literally is making me look like I have a hollow cheek rub it and pat rub and Pat okay but why is it making my cheek look so cut though not gonna lie it's cool for contour for bronzer I'll put it on the bronzer areas okay also I've noticed at the bronzer this is where I put the bronzer it almost looks shiny ah-ah that is shiny and the shadows it looks cool but as when you hit the light it's shiny it's like a shiny bronzer doesn't ring since it's shiny okay let's see the sign so the sidewith foundation is definitely me luckily have a contoured cheek not gonna lie I'm kind of living for this contour don't you but it's so fucking harsh and intense like you can't really pat it out or else is gonna just deposit more and more color it just keeps going higher and higher definitely better on the side with the foundation and the side without but still bronzer not ago okay so let's go ahead and try out B highlighter now I got a little sample of so we have the highlighter now we are using the highlighting paper in the shade who don't belong in the shade at Crystal Cove so let's go ahead and apply some Hank paper where is that read that oh I feel like I'm doing the fucking full face using highlighter challenge all over again this is so fucked definitely is giving a highlight though you cannot there's no denying that's highlighting my face it just looks so blotchy and you really cannot work with this whatsoever let's try it the rest of the highlighting people on this side with the actual star T lightly oh wait the highlighter that worked that fucking worked on the side with foundation and stuff already on it whoa whoa whoa go light handed with it that definitely definitely made it so much more blinding intense don't put it don't on you for I don't know I just tried that but on the highlight spot that fucking worked oh girl god no no ya know if that piece the highlighter huh one side was atrocious and the other side actually was fucking sick nasty so that one is a that one's a little conundrum right there we have blush paper right here and this is the last one guys the last paper thing hmm we're gonna take the shade Studio City I'm going to rip out a page of blush I'm going to put it on the blushy area hey it's definitely depositing some color that one is definitely depositing some color which is cool there's so much here so much here and like literally nothing right here where I actually started to apply it so that's really weird on the side with the base it definitely is looking so much better than the one with out why is it actually looking really fucking pretty taking off my makeup that's annoying like I literally am getting like I'm getting foundation here that's fucking annoying as fuck but at least a color that deposited was actually pretty and it looks pretty sweet on this side and that was the blush so we have this side which is with no foundation on with literally nothing on just it's just prepped and yeah that one's rough and then we have this side which is the side that already had foundation on had a full face of makeup on already don't look that bad at all to me don't look that bad at all to me okay guys so final verdict on these products what I think about it I'm gonna talk about side with no makeup on inside with makeup on so foundation paper sided with nothing on it was fucked the foundation paper did not work at all it was so so patchy so just gross looking and the side with makeup already on I also didn't like it I thought it did not work very very well the color that was deposited was falling to the pores really really badly and I just don't think it looks good for sulfur foundation paper that's a Miss for me I talked about the bronzing paper so we have the bronzing paper on the side with no makeup on the bronzing paper is probably the worst on the side with no makeup on it is literally shiny I don't have words I'm out of words to talk about it just doesn't work the same things I said about the foundation paper same thing applies for the bronzer paper the reason I also don't like it on the side with the base already on is because it's such a cool toned color usually bronzers are supposed to be a little bit more warm in tone but this is extremely extremely cool tone and it has that shiny finish which I don't like I think if you were in the Sun it would look really off like shiny from literally here to here like that just looks really weird to me that doesn't give you any kind of depth it doesn't give you any kind of like illusion to having higher cheekbones nothing so I think that the bronzing paper was a complete flaw on both sides well let's talk about the highlighting paper I think the highlighting paper uh here I don't know what happened to it it got literally taken off by the blush there's literally nothing left a little bit right here Leia bar here and that's about it so that was a complete flop on this side it definitely gets a shine don't get me wrong it gives you a shine but it's still a flop the side with the base already on the highly paper totally worked so on this side it was a complete miss for me but on the side with that base already done the highlight paper was a total success so putting on top of a highlighter it definitely made it more intense more blinding more enhanced so I don't know that one makes you a little confused that one did work it definitely got the job done it made it look more bright and more intense and so last but not least we have blush the blush on this side there's blush down there's definitely Bush on my face I can see some type of pink color it's so heavy right here even though I applied more of it right here I don't understand how that happened it just looks a little weird to me in my opinion no no no but on this side it totally deposited the color really nicely and it was blended out really really well on the side with the base already on with blush Rt Hon like I was kind of shocked at how I see that one blended and it came off as really pigmented as well I was like whoa so same thing applies like I said the highlighter on the side with the face already done blush and highlight they worked pretty well foundation and bronzer paper on both sides to me were not good at all and yet guys that's it for the today's video because I have fun watching I hope this helped in any way shape or form a lot of people have been asking me what I thought about the paper makeup and this is my final verdict I think that it's a fun product thing is really fun and kind of edgy and very very different I just don't think it's the most practical product $18 for 50 pieces of paper I don't know man it just doesn't really make sense in the wallet sense for example you can like put a highlighter in your purse or you can put a blush in your purse and it's gonna be more practical because you can actually get more uses you get a lot more out of it bang for your buck but if you're so on the go where you can't fit those kind of things in there you need to just toss in a paper the blush and the highlight I totally would like I think it would actually be pretty practical if you guys are so on-the-go have no space in your bags for anything toss in a piece of paper and put some blush on later on on top of set foundation please God because this is not this is not happening besides not it's not that it's not the business so I don't know you guys this is one of those products you have to use at your own discretion whether you guys want to spend the money or not I just wanted to talk about it I put it on my face I gave you guys the demo this is something that you guys definitely try out for yourselves I don't know man I don't know this is one of the things words like I personally will not buy this again I personally will literally probably never use this again but if you guys are someone that's on-the-go that needs just blotting papers in the purse just a quick little touch-up just like kind of blot then I think it could be more practical for you guys but other than that I don't see it really working out in any way shape or form yeah I got some because I found out watching this video I'll leave where you can buy these bad boys down below if you guys are interested in checking them out but as always have a great so the night or day where you guys are and I will catch you guys in my next video bye you guys nah there's someone talking she heard is just applying a little bark they uh don't bark they uh [Music] do you hear her little ass someone can't be knocking right now there's no way I'm not answering the door talking Memorial Day don't

Brandt 2% retinol complex serum you guys this is the part that's changed my skin and when it comes to texture do I still have texture yes of course iw have texture still but I promise you and I say that my texture has diminished literally 50% in the past month of using this I'm not kidding you it is like I swear by this am utter almost done with this I think I have like another month left in here but I use this every other night maybe like three to four times a week and I use of course SPF with it as well during the daytime retinol is basically like an agent that helps clear skin texture like with like blackheads whiteheads things like that a lot of you guys tell me like dude your skin's looking so good recently what are you using what the is going on with your skin why is looking so nice it's the dr. Brandt 2% retinol cream I mean I'm sure any 2% retinol will be great to use it wisely and use it well but this one I just noticed has been the best for my skin and doesn't make my skin break out any way shape or form it's the most hardcore yet soothing version of this is what it looks like a little thingy this little pump I swear by it I swear by it the next product we're moving right along I can't talk about this what it could be - this is a makeup remover that I've been using consistently this is the Lancome buy face y'all double action makeup remover I'm not kidding you guys when I say this is probably the best eye makeup remover I've ever tried ever this  takes off everything literally doesn't sting your eyes at all it's an incredible remover it's like shocking like how bomb it is so I think it's incredible if you guys are looking for a really good remover that doesn't sting your eyes that takes off literally everything waterproof any makeup you couldn't need to be taken off this will take it off for the eyes it's amazing like holy don't sleep on it Lancome y'all did that with that one next moving right along we can talk about a primer I've been loving the past month this is from our Borean this is the pink perfect cream this is a blur secret glow skin refining four and one primer or Borean is a Korean skincare brand I believe and they are now in Sephora and it's really quiet out with them up in New York they we have like a little meeting and they were the sweetest team ever and they gave me couple other products try the pink perfect creamy okay I'll try it out and bitch I literally am in love with it and I think the reason why is because one it is a little bit blurring it's not like so blurring like a professional or not so silicone II like that but it gives you like the most beautiful nourishing base for your skin while also blurring your pores a little bit I was like what the it doesn't really control my oil don't get me wrong it doesn't as a base it's incredible like as a skin base I'm wearing it today as my base like I've been wearing it every single time I've been doing my makeup I use moisturizer and then this and I just noticed that like let me when I put it on it just feels luxurious it's like a rich white woman on the go it's like oh my god like I can't even handle how nice this feels I would go to Sephora get a sample of it just try it out it's more of an expensive primer for sure by Georgia guys just try it out see how it feels on the skin it feels incredible to me like how you like glittery oh my god let's put on some icing right now I shouldn't be wasting it I know I'm sorry it just feels so smooth and so nice and it dries beautifully it gives you a little bit of a silky feeling but it's not too much what it feels like straight of silicone it's not like that it's incredible hello hello hello yes can you hear me perfect I'll be right out okay my man just got here so I will be right back anyway he said have to realize I need to finish this video and I know these are really really random products that they're not like fun exciting products to be talking about but they're ones that I feel like are gonna be really really good for like being on the go you know I mean so next the product I want to talk about really because I've actually like gone do like almost half of this this is the it cosmetics it's your brush love instant brush cleaner so you gi you I would use these cinema secrets cleaner and like a huge like blue tub it's so intense it's so big but it smells like pinked and I feel like every time I use it it's like going away on my life like this like less less time in my life being attached to it but it works so well so my mom actually embossed this cleaner and she was like do you want me just try this lip random cosmetics brush cleaner she's a huge fan of it cosmetics as am i I love them too and I was like oh let's try it out and this guy's is like the complete opposite of what the other one is it cleans your brushes amazingly but it smells like citrusy and it smells so good and then greens just so much much better than what the last one was like of course there's AG alcohol in it and whatnot if you are someone that like has makeup brushes and doesn't want to clean them like D clean up every single time try the a cosmetics brush love it is so so good and that's like and has a pump on it you have to like pour into a little thing and use it it's just like balm I can literally wear this as perfume we have next ooh this one is like the product of the month as well this is the anasazi XM r ez highlighter you guys I don't feel like there's like anything else to say besides I've used this so many times on my channel now I've talked about it so many times my channel now it's just like girl this highlighter on God's green earth you know what I like about this one so much is because when you put it on it doesn't give you a golden cast on your skin could you see I feel like with the really gold highlighters I love them so much but I feel like they do since I am a lighter a complexion and gives you like a golden cast this one is gold with no cast it just gives you a golden shine and it doesn't give you like a weird like if you turn it's like gold so if like that's what I really would like about it it's such a high shine it builds so nicely it goes from like such a subtle shine to like a beaming so quickly and I just feel like it's amazing I just want to congratulate uh Nastasia Beverly Hills nor Vina and I'm ready for this amazing highlighter you guys absolutely killed it I love Hamra she's such a wonderful person I think she's the sweetest nor Vina as well like you guys are just both amazing and congratulations on this amazing collaboration part two of our easy to guys never went our music came out with a palace ass yeah old old school right there those are the good times next part I want talk about really quickly actually have two glosses here because I've been really really into gloss recently gloss has been something that I'm just like dude I love a good gloss or a really creamy lipstick these two are some of the ones I've been wearing very frequently this is the dose of colors can you not after this is the today's the first time I ever tried this one I'm not gonna lie this is what I've been wearing really frequently today was the first time I tried this out and I honestly love it it's actually the gloss I'm wearing today those the clothes came out the new like high coverage glosses we're going to swatch it on my hand you guys let's see what the color is it's basically a really beautiful take a dirty pink it's like more of a cool-toned dirty pink it's not too too bright it's not too cool it's just a really really pretty neutral pinky color I think it's beautiful and you just Josh shine it's alright comfortable on the lips you want it to not wear lipstick and get a good like high coverage full coverage on the lips I will really suggest a new dose of colors classes and they smell like cake batter okay guys and then the second class I want talk about is of course the event a beauty event a glow gloss balm this is like one of the best classes I've ever encountered it's so comfortable it smells amazing like water mmmm hmmm no it smells like fruit punch that's like the one cent I can say it smells like fruit punch the coverage is not nearly as much as the other one as you can see there's a lot more streakiness in it but this is more of a high shine comfort glass or doesn't like give you like a lot of coverage it's literally just a beautiful high glossy gloss and it smells amazing and it feels amazing and it's not sticky it's a really really lightweight formula it has a high shine to it and it's from Fanta beauty who doesn't love finding beauty honesty at this point so last but not least when it comes to the favorites of this month I want to talk about this really quickly I've not used this that many times I will use it a couple times but honestly I've noticed how incredible it is and I'm really shocked at how nice this product was this is the BH Cosmetics zodiac pellet one the fact that it's a Zodiac palette that's already literally like so cute go BH that's adorable but I want to talk about this color in the middle specifically and you know the reason I even tried it it's because of freakin Rocio Orozco say ah this is cuz a-you bitch this color in the middle right here is so incredibly beautiful as like it's like a white with this golden undertone that's so so nice so these are like big shades I'm gonna show you swatch a couple of there so I can show you guys the big shades are so creamy and nice it's like really weird like how incredible these are I'm not kidding you I was taking it back these are definitely more on the powdery side there's no denying if it's a little bit powdery but I feel like they can definitely be worked with how beautiful these are like they're actually really really intense and they're BH Cosmetics are really really cheap and the mats are super smooth and super nice and super blendable like later like my mind was blown not even trying this out she wasn't wrong like these this is really nice especially for a drugstore brand like BH Cosmetics for them to come out with such a nice palette like this for such a cheap affordable price it's 25 shadows that comes with oh that's a highlighter ah 25 color and highlighter palette that's nuts like that's incredible you know what we look up how much is this one I'm actually quite curious its 22 bucks for 25 waiting for 25 you know you're joking nope 22 bucks i I don't know that one I truly don't know how they did that that's like incredible pricing wow I just think it's so good it has a great variety of Matt's as well those Matt's right there those neutral transitioning Matt's they're really nice of it your deep shades you have a back of a brown you have some purples I think it's really nice and I'm like really really impressed I'd be H on this one really impressed okay so that is it for my favorites I only have two disappointments and we are gonna be done with today's video so first one I want to talk about I already talked about this actually on my channel I'm sure guys watched it I did a reviewing products are super super low rated at Sephora and this one and I think the reason why it is two-faced white peach palette took the cake for me as you guys I was actually so excited about it you know when you're excited about something you tried out in your disappointing that you're making it makes it look so much more disappointed that's how I felt with this so I tried these shades out and honestly they were just not good the one like the mats were like not that pigmented these shimmers were not that great either and they give me any kind of like trying on this like on the idol I just like the colors were not cohesive enough these two layers are cohesive I think the first two layers are fantastic but these four look when you cover that what what kind of what peach has power is that this is a peach palette they should have kept it at eight and made the shades better they made it twelve and a lot of them didn't really work very well I just didn't like this palette that was really really poorly done and I wanted to like it a lot and that's why I was so disappointed like I was so I've had so much high hopes for him just really I was like you know I really wanted to live for it but I couldn't and I was a really big Sequoia frame and second is my palette of the month was actually this night honestly again this is one of the things where I like had such high hopes and expectations and I was sorely let down this is the Mac Jeremy Scott palette the packaging I just have to say before we even start the packaging is a plus this is so cool beautiful so well done the whole entire collection is amazing Jeremy Scott is absolutely using Mac's amazing but you know what really disappointed me of the palette is when you open it you're like oh my god I'm gonna be getting something so crazy so  lit I'm gonna be living I just feel like when I opened it I was like oh look I just wasn't happy like one the colors are just so off like it just they're so off to me I'm looking at him and I'm like what the is going on like what's happening I get the whole like color scheme per bar I'd miss immunity like this is a very like Valentine's Day bar this is like a bronzy neutral bar a blue bar a purple bar I just feel like one the amount per shadow was like a joke like literally that's such a little amount and literally look when you're looking at it feels like a kid's like a kid's palette and I wasn't really impressed and like i swatched a couple of them and they were super powdery super just like chunky and I'm sure a lot of them blend great I'm sure a lot of them worked very nicely and feel great but swatching so um I'm like oh my gosh this is not good dead-ass the zodiac palette is like nicer than this one and I were just disappointed because like the way the packaging setup everything all the packaging all the product is so beautiful on the outside I bet that a lot more to do with Jeremy Scott and Mac had to do with of course the formulas of the product but I was just disappointed in the actual formula of it and the amount you're beginning and just in general like it just didn't look appealing to me I thought it was like the whole idea was really cool that was like a like a music bar situation I don't know but it looked really cool look sickening about the end of the day it just they didn't perform very well what I was disappoint when open it I was like oh hey you don't like the color scheme I don't like how much product is in here I don't like all the black empty space around it it just doesn't make sense to me and that is you guys that's it for my favorites and disappointments of the entire month it was so much fun queenís with you guys I love doing them hope you guys enjoy them as well I think they're just a cool fun way to kind of interact about our favorite products that throughout the entire

hey guys and welcome back to my channel so today's video as you can see from the title is going to be a one brand tutorial and I'm so excited to be filming this because it is a full face using all elf cosmetics eyes lips face cosmetics I tried a lot of things from ELF in the past but this is like years ago and they had some really really amazing hits and some misses for me definitely like most brands do I don't absolutely love everything from every single brand it's literally impossible for me I haven't found a brand that I've done a one brand tutorial on where I lived for every product there's always some type of disappointment when Wilde was close though because he hasn't push it so yea that's what today's video is going to be I'm gonna be doing a full face using all elf cosmetics I literally went to Target and bought like this massive massive bag of makeup I already have all the products you're still in boxes like so I'm really excited from this video and I hope you guys have enjoyed watching it as always if you guys don't like this video if you guys do not like me please don't fucking watch it you know the drill with that but if you guys do like this video please subscribe to my channel if you're not already and if you're new what's up and man I am you Wayne welcome to my channel thank you so much for being here I really really appreciate it Beata calling into this full face of using only elf cosmetics okay we are going to start this shit with some primary we got a primer right here excuse me so here we have the elf poreless face primer should I do one of these guys should I do like that every product to be fucking cute you know okay so we're gonna do is we're gonna put this on the face I mean it says it's a poreless face primer I'm assuming to be one of those silicone feeling primers that's what I'm hoping for at least filling in my hands it feels nice oh my god that smells weird this smells like actually okay you don't smells like it smells like the dr. jart pores no more that's what it smells like if you guys ever smelled that it feels really nice feels very very very smooth it might be a little too smooth we'll see cuz you know when like you use primers that are too silicone e it like everything just kind of sloths off your face I'm gonna be taking the oil-free SPF sunscreen flawless finish foundation I grabbed it two shades I don't really know what color would be I grabbed natural and sand those like the lights two shades hour at Target I love that I have as a pump or my gone we have sand right here I think I'm gonna go stand I think we're gonna find and I grabbed a little elfs beauty sponge I had no idea Beauty sponges which is seriously Riku and I'm going to take sand we're gonna press out while we're the face this is much more of a natural finish foundation as I'm putting on right now I can notice that like I don't see a lot of my skin underneath it but it looks really freaking pretty so far I'm kind of living also this sponge it's a little rough to me actually like it feels very rubbery huh I don't know if I feel like I'm living for the sponge to be honest let's try it on a little brush I got one of these elf brushes as well cuz it looked like a nice brush this reminds me of like a Sephora one when I worked on safar they had a brush like this and I was like using it so far I've used about ten pumps for the face and I don't even get have that much coverage which is a little weird to me that's with using the Beauty Blender so I'm gonna try it with this brush and see how the coverage is with the brush this brush is pretty nice actually I don't think it's more of a natural to medium coverage after even building it out is what it looks like I can definitely still see like my surreal skin underneath it can still see the redness of my pimples and like my little acne spots and things like that but I honestly think I stand really natural I can definitely see myself using this more like a day to day not good not wanting to use an expensive s foundation but still want a little bit of something something for sure the problem with it is that you have to use a lot a lot of product which i thought was kind of annoying to get to the coverage I have right now so now for concealer I got some concealers these are the HD lifting concealer and I got the shade fair and I got shade light so let's try the shade fair first cuz it was literally such a limited shade range at Target I was like fuck oh my god it's so tiny I thought doesn't make a long ass looking like NARS bitch woah woah you're gonna pull it out I didn't realize hmm definitely a little dark for me oh yeah oh oh yeah that's a little dark we're gonna use a darker one cuz I little bit more of an orange undertone on the spot so I have a little bit more darkness on the face it's like my beard hair my circles on my eyes and I'm gonna take the shade fair and I'm gonna use that to actually like highlight and make it look pretty you know I'm actually really not the biggest fan of these shades oh my god this is like a beige like it's like a beige concealer almost like I really I'm really not a huge fan of this color so let's blend this out okay so I hate the color of the concealer and I hate the coverage I think it's not enough but the finish is actually really pretty good too like a really glowy skin like appearance we're gonna make this work guys I'm gonna make sure we look snatched this is a little odd I have this foundation palette - and Fairlight let's look at this looks like they're all creams there's like this yellowish shade right here what does this look like you guys I feel like I look really queasy I think that's how you feel like look right now me just to top it out of this to see what this yellowy thing will do that'll kind of brighten it up I feel this shade blend aha okay so this will you look like so far I think the base look I mean the base looks fine I just look really greasy and oily and a little too like as if I literally mixed a foundation with oil that's how I feel it looks so now we're gonna set it I grabbed the elf HD powder HD powder sheer I don't really know exactly what that entails bad at all well that's still leaning on so now I'm gonna take a little bit of oh shit it's like I need just like a little white HD powder you can work for Danny yeah so we're gonna take that I'm gonna set underneath eyes much better in my opinion doesn't look so oily and so like like scary looking let's take that powder on the rest of the face as well hey guys we have everything set in place on efficient elbow right here in this area right here is the missing foundation when I was padding with a powder the foundation literally came off with it so I was like ah that doesn't really normally happen but it did and boards have to kind of roll with the punches at this boy okay so I got this little palette from of course of this is a total face palette and it comes with these shades right here and the shades look really nice like I'm I want to try these out them take it as a bronzer and blush so we take the fullest face brush from ELF as well and I'm gonna take this little color right here and I'm going to bronze up the perimeters of my face with this shade and let's see how it works is there any part being put down there's a little bit of color coming off okay I have to really really saturate the brush to get any kind of pigmentation okay so that is literally flopping for me right now so we're gonna go in with this guys I got another one just in case I feel like I grab doubles of everything how scared of a flop st. Lucia blush and bronzing powder and I'm taking this bronzer well this looks a lot more pigmented whoo let's see oh yeah whoa I was after the last one I was not expecting that shit I don't know dude I feel like it looks really patchy what do you guys think I feel like it looks a little phat true hmm okay let's try this out again you guys this powder is really really bad she taking a big brush is blending the whole thing hopefully it'll marry a little bit better okay so that looks better but it was really really catchy so that's kind of annoying but so let's go back to the same palette and they take the blush oh that's really pigment to it hmmm nice so that works it's starting to build there we go we're getting somewhere three layers later we got somewhere okay come on elf work with me here buddy took about four layers but we definitely got there there we go looks really nice looks pretty I'm happy with that yeah okay guys so now we're gonna highlight the face and I grabbed this this is the beautifully Barrett liquid highlighter and I'm gonna put this down first and then we're gonna go on top of it with the powder highlighter that Mel has it looks really nice on the hand I'm actually really impressed so let's go ahead and highlight with that and take another little elf fresh okay let's try this out and see how it applies on the skin Oh bitch that is beautiful I'm sorry I'm a little shaken we blend out that a little bit god damn well not back in that oh my god that's fucking beautiful that is a saving grace right there [Music] Oh elf you did that girl you don't did that one I can say that with certainty that is my favorite product so far is the highlighter Wow okay guys so this is the base so far this is what we have I'm not living for it to be quite honest the only thing I'm living for is really the highlighter and the foundation was pretty once I got like ten pumps later um I just feel like my face looks really really patchy and I feel like everything looks really harsh so I don't know I'm not like living for this base or anything I try to make it work as best as I could um so let's go move on to the brows in the eyes and see what we can come up with okay guys I went in I zoomed in a little bit closer so you guys see everything a little bit more clearly as you can see underneath my eyes looks really heavy and cakey and almost looks yellow it's really weird um I thought there's like areas of foundation and concealer missing we're gonna keep it going and we're into our hardest to look fucking bomb okay I'm not giving up on elf I'm not giving up on health products I'm not they have good fucking shit okay so now we're going to do our brows I'm gonna do like the right brow on camera I found this little brow pencil this guy right here either just has a brow pencil in deep brown and so I'm gonna try that out so I have this one and I also have a little brow kit the brow kit I have used before and actually really really enjoyed it so if this does not work and it's a mess we're gonna use the brow kit okay so what it looks like so far take a little pen so that you twist up definitely depositing some color oh girl might be a little dark for me but hey there's color coming off and I am very happy with it I mean this thing said I was deep brown bitches his black the hook product itself is actually really really really waxy and it kind of picks up a little funny on the brow but you know at least it deposits the color and it definitely gets the job done let's take this little light brown color right here from the dark brow kit and we're going to brush that through does that do anything honestly if anything at least it's to set this waxy brow pencil in place now taking the same concealer that we use for underneath the eyes we're going to try to carve out this under brow and see how we got the broader look let's do a little bit of a cheat to make our brows a little bit lighter we're gonna take a little bit that same concealer on this little brush we're gonna run a little bit of that concealer through the brow hair to make it a little bit lighter cuz gosh darn it that is some dark brows we got a brow on guys we got a brow on honey yes okay I'm gonna finish the other brow off of camera and I'll be right back so now we have the brows on we're gonna go ahead and move on it to the eyes I'm gonna take the elf eyelid primer this is a shadow lock eyelid primer you guys I remember when I first first first started using makeup I would use this eyelid primer because it was opposed to be a dupe for the Urban Decay primer potion and I would use this primer all the time so I can afford that okay which I would use this one and they definitely worked really really well so I'm really excited to try this out again I mean my expectations now with makeup are a little bit different because I use makeup every single day all day but definitely back then when I was just doing a little amounts of makeup it definitely did the job so I would do some eyeshadow and I grabbed two palettes I've heard amazing amazing things about the elf Prizm eyeshadows I've never actually tried this personally myself and I grabbed the eyeshadow palette just the matte format just cuz I want to do a really just cute clean a basic look just what I wanted to do I also grabbed one I grabbed the eyes these two shadows this is a long lasting lustrous eyeshadow and I grabbed this smudge pot in Cruzan cheek cheek regime chick I don't know so this is what the palette looks like right here let's swatch one there definitely they're definitely pigmented we've got the two swatches right there they're pretty and we have this a matte palette this house looks really nice I'm excited try this out okay so let's start to go in this shit right here and a little bit of this pinkier one right next to it these two that's gonna go into the crease I've not yet tried these so let's see how they act well well there's definitely definitely some pigment there guys that looks really pretty oh my gosh yes we're gonna make something happen guys we're gonna make something happen here now I'm taking more fewer 39 I'm gonna take a little bit more of this chocolatey brown shade they feel really nice when I'm dipping my brush into it guys I'm gonna put that on outer corner you guys so far I'm actually really impressed with this little palette the shadows is it a little Apache yes it is I think that was a little bit of work and like some love you can definitely definitely get a nice ass look I'm taking that deepest darkest shade at the very end I'm gonna take a little bit of that I'm gonna take a little bit of that I'm gonna put it on the outer corner very low just to deepen the lashes out here came easy now that we have the crease colors down I think everything's looking pretty freakin good I'm going to take this little smudge pot this is in the shade cruisin chick or sheet osek this is literally like a little pot I just watch a little bit on my hand and this is what it looks like right here I definitely don't hate it but I don't love it either I just look at this guy and see what this looks like this soirée shade whoa this feels like goo what the fuck it's literally putty look at the shit this I don't really like either so I'm gonna choose the lesser of two evils I'm gonna go with this smudge pot you guys this is not going to be my permanent lid shade i'm going in with that prismatic shadow over top I just wanted to have a base to make everything pop a little bit more and that's why I'm using this smudge pot I'm gonna take this middle shade right here from the prismatic palette I'm gonna Pat that over top just to give us more of a bright brightening effect so we have on the eye so far it's like a smokey peach is what I would describe this color as on the lid thing looks really pretty I'm gonna take the lightest prismatic shade on a little tiny morphe m32 six favorite small little packing brush for the inner corner and a brow bone I'm gonna highlight the inner corner with that come on shade these prismatic shadows I'm very impressed with mmm I'm so sorry goddamn I'm gonna take this little elf smudge pot imma take some oh wait holy fuck that was like so creamy way hall that is pigmented shit when we were using that but on a better brush no offense hmm Wow I was really impressed okay let's do a little so look you guys look up I went to that is holy fuck Oh for those wondering this is the morphe m25 0-0 it's a great little pencil brush for cream liner you guys I'm so impressed with how easily that glided on glid on glide it on move oh no elf eye products are really are really serving me right now they are really giving it to me hard so now that I'm living for the high and I actually really think this is so pretty this look come on alright I'm gonna take the new formula elf lengthening and volumizing mascara and the shade black kanaka maole I'm not really living for the mascara I feel like it's really doing anything I just like its coating my lashes to make a little darker so I grabbed it these little lashes from ELF these are the luxe lash kit in winged and bold I don't know that's what it's called winged and bold these are the ones I grabbed they look like a very very natural pair for me this is like the most drag that they add so uh yeah these lashes feel like paper let's see how this goes bro no where's the last shot okay I'll put on another pair of lashes in a little bit but we're going to take this palette again and I'm gonna run that underneath the lash line same colors that I literally put on the upper lash line just to kind of marry the whole look together so it doesn't look too off on a morphe 35o so grab this just to add a pop of something this is the teal tease eyeliner and I kind of want to put it on these waterline just kind of give me a little bit of edge and sex appeal same style as the black one I think it's going to be similar yeah it's definitely similar feeling creamy as hell which is cool not as pigmented the black one but we're gonna put that in the lower lash line okay I'm gonna go put on another pair of lashes really quickly just cuz I feel like this is looks so funny and I'll be right back to do our lips and then we'll be done time it wasn't on and I just did my lips okay guys sorry you guys I totally did not know what that my sound was off of this what we decided to do is I use the lip liner in the shade natural and the elf day.tonight lipstick duo in needed nudes and that's what we decided to do on the lips today and I think it looks fantastic it blended so nicely it was super creamy super pigmented and I was very very pleased with it and that's how you guys that's it for the full face using elf cosmetics video having signed fun watching at so much fun crane this video I had my verdict on these products is a lot of them worked fantastically a lot of them did not work too the way I wanted them to work I would definitely say that my favorite products today that I used or the eye products I thought the eye products worked so well honestly things worked as if they were high-end I were so impressed I'm really impressed with the eye look I did today we using only elf products I'm not so impressed with the base products like the stuff for my face I thought I thought a lot of it was really really patchy and I'd like the coverage of a lot of things I just don't think my face looks really good right now um it looks really really oily and kind of greasy and that's with setting it with powder and I don't know I just don't really I'm not the biggest biggest fan of how everything turned out on the face the highlight turned out to be fucking sick nasty butter than that I'm not really impressed with anything else I also really really really enjoyed the lip products as well they feel so nice and so luxurious on the lips and they are super pigmented super creamy I was very impressed with that stuff so all in all I think elf is a definite win in my book Elle has some amazing products I just don't really like how the base for now buzz and I think they're not really really nice you guys have any other brands that you guys would like to see me doing a full face of let me know in the comments bar below and I'll definitely definitely get that done whether it's drugstore high end any brand that you guys want to see do a full face of I could definitely make it happen if they have a full face of those product move yeah guys I hope you guys enjoyed this video

hey guys welcome back to my channel so today's video is going to be another random ass testing of a some products video I actually just really love testing random shit these are honestly some of my more favorite videos to film cuz just fun to test random ass shit out like I just really enjoy it like Allah I was actually in CVS and I was just kind of like biding my time because I had an appointment to get some I'm gonna end up what to get some filler in my face my boobs right there from it cuz mommy's looking a little tired people always like oh my god man you look so tired and I'm like cuz I am so I got a little bit of filler underneath mine's whatever I'm so swollen but I was at CVS just kind of passing time because I was early 20 point mint and I was passing by the as seen on tv aisle and I'm like hmm those aisles for some reason just kind of really like pull me in to see these like random ass little products like - they work do they not I just really enjoy the acid on TV shit so I was passing by I solve this and this is magic minerals by Jerome Alexander this is like a mineral makeup that is supposed to be magical on the face it's supposed to conceal and cover blemishes age spots fine lines and uneven skin tone it's also do a lot of things so do a lot of things so we'll see if this shit actually works it's like open and see what it looks like it's like a little thing is like these little magical crystals inside I guess these is the magic part I have no idea other sizes because going to be obviously testing out this magic minerals product I see on TV I've never actually seen the commercial on TV it was just in the i/o and it says s seen on TV at the top as always if you guys don't like this video if you guys do not like me please don't fucking watch it you know the drilling yeah but if you guys do like this video please subscribe to my channel if you are not already and if you're new what's up a man um you a and welcome to my channel thank you so much for being here I really really appreciate it let's go get into this testing of this magic [Music] so we're gonna open this babish up okay let's just see what it cleans let's look at the clean look at the fucking claims helps cover conceal pimples blemishes scars birthmark you are a fucking liar helps cover and conceal pimples blemishes scars and birthmarks not just okay okay you know what no hold on Manny get into the zone you are not going to be skeptical of this product you are going to review it and you're going to be open-minded you're not going to be a bitch you're not going to be hard on it you're just going to be open and willing as if this is a bare minerals powder it's claiming to conceal and cover pimples blemishes cars and birthmarks very interesting micronized mineral powder talc free comes a little brush to apply with cool so apparently it's unique built in color correctors height skin imperfections instantly has pink mint lavender and yellow which are all color correct different things okay so to use apply it liberally all over entire face with included stubbly brush after applying buff vigorously to set the makeup for a flawless look okay so feeling it right here feeling the compact it feels really really lightweight not in a good way lightweight more like a cheap lightweight feeling the mirror is pretty good the mirror doesn't like it's not bad it is a nice just classic mirror but the compact itself feels really really light and kind of cheap no fans no fans we have to prime our face okay I'm gonna be using the morphe prep and set spray for primer I fuckin love this this is seriously one of the best prep and set setting sprays the fact that it comes out like a fine miss mmm and then I'm take a little bit of benefits Porefessional for the poorest areas like oh my cheeks and on my nose I want to get this powder a fair chance I want to do everything that I would have normally done if I was applying any foundation we're gonna be fuckin fair okay so we're gonna go in with this powder from Jerome Alexander so we are going to apply this powder on the face I have a lot of imperfections going on right now which is my normal I'm gonna go in with a little Buffy stubbly brush which is one of those just kind of brushes that you find out like Rite Aid in those pack like 20 and it just like really really really cheaply made it's that kind of brush so just that's all I'm like pressing for you but it sets to use this when you so I'm just going to dip in the powder let's see how it looks we're getting some powder off here we're getting some powder as you guys can see right there powder just fall out on the tray as you can see so we have the powder on that little brush we're gonna go into our buffing in to the cheek and see what we have here this powder also claims that it's a one color fits all and just kind of matches your skin magically I feel like it's picky about my dry patches right here that's weird because I just don't have any dry patches so what the fuck Jesus Christ I'm like literally going in here like twenty fucking thousand times okay using that brush like I cannot like I physically cannot keep using that brush I'm gonna use a good one I'm gonna use a morphe y 7 to really give this powder a fucking go you know okay I do notice that the powder is definitely giving me an even skin tone but what's the fun picking on my driver we're not even get dry patches from That's not me this is my entire face with the powder on I definitely can tell the difference between not having the powder on and having the powder on I definitely give me a little bit of coverage and makes my skin look more even for sure but the claims were that I was gonna be able to cover and conceal like blemishes I can still see the bruise right here like hardcore this gives you like a maybe a sheer to medium coverage it's definite some like full s coverage like it claims to be weird but it does gonna become a blurring effect which I kind of like okay guys so final verdict I am done I this the powders on me so much excess powder so guys what do I think I do definitely think that it evened out my skin tone I think my skin looks pretty I think it looks so fucking dry it's because it's a powder I can see literally like balling up right here makes my skin definitely look drier than the Sahara Desert it did its job when it comes to it gave me an even complexion it really did but I had it literally go in like 20 times to do it I learn how to use like five layers to get into this opacity I might dude do you really like just use fucking Studio Fix for one layer you know what I mean like it just does it seemed super practical to me doesn't look terrible color-wise compared to my neck or anything I definitely don't think it'll match a darker complexion but girl honestly I say save your fucking coin I'm gonna go and give this a Miss for me I don't think that it did what it was going to do like full fucking covering how's it gonna cover a birth marks on my face this you will see so much blue undertone and my just my facial hair like honey you can still see my redness popping out from my pimple it's not it's not what it fucking said it's not magical I'm sorry I don't prove this I say save your fucking money go grab Studio Fix from Mac or go grab like the pro powder from make it forever cuz those works so much better no tea no shade no pink lemonade but that's just why I donate so yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this video had fun doing it I absolutely love doing little reviews they're so fun for me and I just think that they're fun to show you guys little random products I never would have thought of or never even thought to look for or try out but because I've YouTube channel like that's

brushing I don't like these kind of brushes these are the kind of rushes that are like final verdict done done that part I will not because I do not fart in public I definitely do think that it worked

slick it's so funny a little accuse from what's right and he gives me like more about it gave me a little more voluminous finish the gag that's a minimizing being very slightly like but it literally little is if you're wearing yes yes I don't see a little different no I see a blurring primary Behar see no blurring and I still see thank you we still have pores normal it's so annoying how nice or frustrate so I that's my monster that's her monster we can really easily yes we have this its skin a macaron so that rich because it doesn't accurately I actually have no idea what I'm doing there's France watching this trying to slap us silly special edition this is the ELMO edition okay and basically again it is I think it's like a CC BB cream okay actually Q is like polka dots which I don't

emphasize your pores a literally like it made them big you guys understand like how bad it actually looks look how obviously like there's literally his skin in the product setting right on top of it and you can tell you be immensely embarrassed to be ashamed using retinol that's how it's still bad okay this for me is also flop I would like for you to try it because literally it's just removed every bit of makeup off of my face how much I try that one you already use this shut up oh please okay so I have it okay wait let me start with like this and I was a hobby where following my video

peripera very pink that actually really cute this was a England concealer now it says what and they just velvet okay okay this is literally the Q's bar I've ever seen ever I think it's precious like

shut up 
hey guys welcome back to my channel so today's video is going to be another highly asked requested review video recently I got my hands on the entire Kylie cosmetics birthday collection this is the entire collection right here yeah it's not going on I actually think it's really cute I love that it's all pink soft think that's why have a pink background today because I was feeling like Kylie oh you know I was really feeling them so yeah you guys that's what today's video is going to be I'm going to be reviewing the entire birthday collection from Kylie cosmetics and I'm just really excited to try this out because I really liked her vacation collection I thought that vacation collection which I think was her most recent one had really really really staple sickening ass items and like I always say just because I'm sent a product from a brand and does not mean that I'm going to be biased or not as honest just because the product was sent to me either way if the products are great I will say they're great and if they're not I will say they're not so that's just my two cents I like to disclose that in every video just because I am sent a product does not mean that I'm going to be biased and be like I'm in favor of the brand because they are thin to me no it's not how it works that's just not how it works for me and I know a lot of people are like that that's their lane that's what they want to do that's fine I guess but from even from my audience I'm going to always keep it 100% truthful with you guys because that's how I'm em and that's how I'm going to continue to stay so as always if you guys don't like this video if you guys do not like me please don't fucking watch it you know the German thing but if you guys do like this video please subscribe to my channel if you're not already and if we knew what's up I'm Manny MUA and welcome to my channel thank you so much for being here I really really appreciate it but yeah it's gonna get to this Kylie cosmetics birthday collection review video okay so first things first I'm going to be using this guy this is the I want a tall pallet here we have these shadows right here this reminds you so much of like when I was like in elementary school and like the girls would have really really cute like little journals had like pink glitter on it and it'll just like very like girly very very like elementary school ish like it just rising so much of what I was like a little kid in general just Minds me like when I was a child and my childhood so this guy retails for $54 it comes with a blush a highlighter and it comes with nine eyes shadows each Shadow has 1.4 grams of product and the blush has nine point five grams and the highlighter has seven point five grams so I think that there is definitely a good hefty amount of product in here so it is fifty four dollars it's not a cheaper palette by any means I think that the four is actually kind of pricey for nine shades and a blush and a highlighter so we're going to try it out also Kylie's collection came with brushes which i think is like one of the first time is she came out with separate brushes and a collection they do feel soft the brushes are $30 for the set of four I think that's very pricey for four fucking brushes I'm like oh I think that the brushes are a little bit too pricy for what you're actually getting they feel very very cheap very very lightweight they just do they don't feel very heavy or luxurious I mean I have more few ones that feels so much better than this by far and not nearly as expensive but they do feel soft we're gonna take the blush Cheers right here with the brush so not much product is getting picked up okay let's go and use the blush oh my gosh first item the brush on the face it feels a little bit rough actually it doesn't feel as soft as I thought it was going to feel yeah it feels a little bit bristly for sure but the color of this blush I think is fucking stunning and it's actually looking really nice - my face is bloody hell right really pretty okay also the cool thing about this blush color I feel like it would work on a lot of different skin tones now let's go ahead and highlight with the shade confetti where I take on a morphe and 5/10 see how it works okay so that effect is definitely there it's definitely highlighted and pretty this highlighter though it sits on top of the skin it's not a highlighter that's really like finely milled and soft this is definitely more of a chunky consistency and has little tiny flecks of glitter in it the color itself is stunning it definitely definitely is I'm gonna swatch it beautiful beautiful shade there is little flecks of glitter in it and it is a little bit of a thicker consistency a little bit more powdery but it looks really nice so I'm happy about now we're gonna highlight the other side of the cheek with one of these and these are the new high degenerate loose powder highlighters in the shade Queen and the king so these are the ultra clothes and they retail for $14 each which is not too bad at all actually this is what they look like it's a really really small container like like really really small maybe $14 a little bit high for the amount of product you can name here you get 4 grams so so we have this shade Queen right here I just watched it on my finger okay so this one is actually much much much glittery err than the first shade this is like straight-up body glitter this is not like a highlighter by any means and if you're into that great that's awesome I'm not so much into that really as much and here we have King that's gonna swatch that one next to Queen so we got King right here woah so I definitely would say that I like the shade King more than I like the shade Queen I feel like it's not nearly as a glittery and it's a lot more finely milled than the other one is to be honest so I'm gonna take the shade King Matson to go on the other side of them so let's take the shade oh my fuckin Vuitton oh my fuckin bottle the shit King is everything right on these guys Queen is a miss for me King is a hit for me so I don't that helps you guys out but I would say Queen no King yes also another thing that is a miss for me are the brushes I do not think that these four brushes are worth the price for brushes for 30 bucks I just don't think these are put together very well they loose form so quick look at that one that one wasn't like the box and that's like fucked so now let's go and move on to the eyes I'm gonna do it really just natural pretty look because I feel like if you're buying this palette it is much more of a natural pretty palettes I'm gonna do a more of a natural pretty look with this I don't like to think that it looks a little bit similar to the Valentine's collection don't get me wrong I look at this and I'm like I literally are not he first thought valentines collection when I saw it I was like so we're gonna take buttercream frosting on a morphe e 20 7 which is ice I gave fluffy blending brush when we take you right here and we're gonna take a little bit party time which they more soft a docile dusty pink and that's going to a crease they are dusty but they're not too dusty where I'm like overwhelmed like other palettes I've tried recently it's blending out really easily it's applying very nicely I'm not mad at it so I'm gonna take the shade 1942 on in more feet are 39 there's a nice easy blending brush and I'll put that into the crease I feel like Kylie must have changed up her formula on her mattes because I feel like they've gotten a lot better since she first came out with shadows okay can you guys see this I feel like you guys must be able to see this like it just blends so easily and they feel so soft I'm gonna take the shade of birthday girl and this is gonna go on to my lid on the morphe m to 10 it picked up very nicely it's not too powdery it picks up nice someone put that onto the lid right here this is definitely a really just pretty average champagne shadow with me go and swatch anything here this is what it looks like on the finger it's a very really pretty satin finish it's not metallic by any means it's just a shiny shimmery shade it's right here it reminds me a lot of actually the highlighter in this palette because it does have a little flecks of glitter in it so if you guys are into shadows have a little bit of glitter in it they'll give you something that a nice pretty of champagne color you might be really into this I'm usually really really into metallic shades on the eyes like I want more popping than this but hey it's not bad at all it's not bad at all it looks really nice for a nice satin shade there is quite some fallout in this shadow and I think it's because of all the little glitter flakes that are in it so definitely suggest packing on intensely very much pack on do not swipe on the lid at all pack pack pack we are just moving on a lot of guys we are doing quite well I'm gonna take the shade midnight and I wanna take that on a morphing on four to five and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna smoke out in my liner mm-hmm right here guys right there I'm gonna take that and do a nice like shadowing or into a shadowing oh I love sing shadowing the black is pretty pigmented it's not like holy fuck pigmented but it's definitely pigmented enough but you can definitely layer it to get full opacity black ain't gone you okay I'm much more pressing I thought was gonna be honestly as I hate to say mmm it's going to swatch the black on our finger and it's fucking black oh okay let's see it's definitely I mean it's definitely black it's not like the blackest black I've ever used ever I think that this block is better than the black that she had in a different palette I don't know what pot was I don't remember but this black is definitely more pigmented and I would definitely it's a little bit deeper than the black before for group for sure [Music] what I like about doing shadow wings I just like they don't have to be perfect at all they can just be like they can just be do I don't know creature they're just like this cute little like fluttering moment we're just like oh but it's a shadow it's not that big of a deal if it's uneven you know now I'm gonna take the shade new year new me we're gonna take it on that you 36 and really we're gonna put that underneath the lash line right here on the outer corner oh she's pigmented oh that's such a beautiful color eh I'm God I am fucking not and the shades one of those really intense metallic foil shades let's swatch it on the hand yeah it's one of those shades it's one of those foiled metallic intense ones which I very very much enjoy I think it looks really pretty on the eyes I think it actually is very pigmented I'm thinking let's just take the pink and let's put that on the inner part of the eye very very very pretty hot pink yeah okay oh that's more pink than I thought it was gonna be so therefore I need to blend okay I'm gonna quickly put on some lashes and mascara and I will be right back and there we have it - guys we have the final I look completely done and this is what we have so far I actually really like the look I really really really liked it last step I'm going to be highlighting and taking that birthday girl shade again with the Kylie brush the flat shader one I'm going to highlight the brow bone so this brush it totally works it works fine it's not like one of those brushes where it's like revolutionary it doesn't feel very great but it picks up the product nicely and it deposits the product nicely so if you guys are a fan of Kylie and you guys want to try the brushes go ahead and check them out what I said earlier still stands I think that the four brushes are not worth $30 but hey your opinion can be different from mine so yeah so now let's go and do the verdict on this palette what do I think about it I think that this palette actually worked totally great like I literally have no problems with it whatsoever all the shadows blended very nicely the look is really really seamless the colors are very very pigmented like I'm actually like I had nothing back to say about this palette whatsoever other than the price point do I think that this palette is worth fifty four bucks honestly I don't know this is one of those things where it's like what I personally buy this if I saw this would I buy it like oh I need to have it I probably wouldn't but if you are a huge Kylie fan and you love Kylie cosmetics and you want just have as a collector's item I would definitely suggest buying it the shadows work beautifully I think everything looks really really nice it's very very seamless so is this a hit or a Miss for me this one is actually a tit I think the product will work very nicely I thought the bush worked nicely the highlighter worked great that all the shadows worked great so we have some lip products now when I say some I mean a fucking flat on who needs as many of the things I don't know so first we have it the cute little Kylie Jenner Velvets liquid lipstick mini collection and it comes with six velvet liquid lipsticks I believe that both of the mini sets are $36 that's what they retail I think the packaging is really cute it's very Valentine's Day again and I like that it's like a very pretty nude rips it reminds me a lot of the Kim Kardashian collection what does she did the lip creams this reminds me a lot of the lip creams for sure so if it lips I'm gonna take the shade commando I think that her velvet liquid lipsticks are so fucking nice I actually really really really like them they last nicely and they feel really good on the lips they're not too drying okay and there she never did what the fuck so we have commando right here this is the chic commando feels great looks really really pretty thing the course stunning oh my god it feels very pretty on the lips now let's do one of the bright shades of The Velvet liquid lipsticks we're gonna take these shade surprise me and this is a really intense bright ass hot pink Wow yep this one's a little bit stickier than the nude is but usually with these I come to realize as I try more and more and more makeup the bright shades like this I don't think any brand will ever come out with a bright shade like this that's not gonna be a little bit streaky I really don't and once you like do this mm-hmm the stickiness goes away and because it's not a matte matte lipstick it's not gonna dry in weird spots to make it look even more patchy so that is a go so now I'm gonna go ahead and insert all of these swatches on my arm of the velvet liquid lipstick so you guys can see exactly how they swatch and see what they look like on skin so here we have the shade la so we get with just one so yes I have fucking hairy arms I'm a fucking man let me live next we have the shade party girl one swipe very pigmented right away this is a really fucking pretty shade holy shit next we have birthday suit one swipe very ultra pigmented again nice just like the other shades were now we have the shade sprinkle this one is slightly slightly more patchy than the other shades are but still very nice coverage next we have the shade commando right there very nice full coverage and last but not least we have surprise me which is this shade right here and these are the six from the minis so for those guys are they hit or are they amiss I would actually say that they're a hit I think that they're really cute I think the clothes are really pretty and I also very much like the velvet liquid lipstick formulas so for those they are definitely a hit and I would definitely pay thirty-six bucks for the six shades it's like five bucks a mini thing that's cute it sounds you bad so um yeah I'm down for the minis of the Velvets specifically so now I wouldn't go ahead and go into it via glosses now we got some glosses we got the shade cherry piling of the shade cupcake so we have cupcake oh here it's more of a nude very pretty brave looking coverage oh my god that's done and now we have the shade cherry pie full cover just fuck again probably has good causes I'm putting on a cupcake right now and they're so smooth feeling - shit oh I live for cupcake cupcake I'm living gasping breathing and living for it much are these each glass is at $15 and they feel very smooth on the lips they're not sticky whatsoever they're nice and full coverage so both of them are a hit for sure I like cupcake a lot more than I like cherry pie I just like I wouldn't really wear this kind of shade as a gloss specifically so um definitely both of them are a hit they're both are really nice both full coverage they look really nice and they feel very very nice on the lips too so definitely that is a go so next we have the lip kit in the shade 2020 I'm something that's a little cheese turning I'm gonna and this is what it looks like actually really like the packaging anything it's so cute it's like just all nude and light pink and of course they live kids retail for $30 so we're gonna take the shade 20 lip liner which is a really pretty like I don't know how many swatches code yet to notice let's see on the hand okay okay it's a straighter Bessy muff that's what that is I love Kelly's lip liners to you by the way those are like one right here things actually does they thinks she doesn't very well [Music] okay so let's go in with 20 liquid to matte lipstick this Shay is nice and full coverage it is not streaky whatsoever let's see how it looks when it dries down and this is what the color looks like once it's dry again it is full coverage very dry uh-huh it is dry on my lips it's probably not gonna be coming off for a minute I think I'm just keep this lipstick on for the rest of the video because that's gonna fucking mean here and I keep trying to take this out my mouth is already burning if you are a fan of Kylie cosmetics liquid lipstick - matte formula then I think you're gonna really really really enjoy it 20 I'm not a huge fan of her look-alike formula I think it's a little bit too drying for me personally so for me personally it's a Miss but if you guys liked her formula that I think you guys are going to love it and it will be a definite hit for you for sure and last but not least we are down to the last thing we have the matte liquid lipstick minis so this is the shade one wish that is such a pretty like soft rose pink nice and full coverage there's no stickiness whatsoever next got the shade baby girl another shade that's nice and full coverage does not give you any stickiness very cool very cool next we have the shade angel right here which is a really dark rosy pink it's actually pretty similar to this shade over here next to the shade August bug right here whoa this one is a little bit streaky I can see some skin peeking through that's definitely not has full coverage as the other shades are on my arm but this one is still a very pretty color and I'm sure once it's dried down it would look really nice next we have the shade all nighter right here wow that's a fucking bright shade holy shit right here this is another one of those shades that's a little bit trickier this one reminds me a lot of that August bug where it's a little bit streaky I can see my skin peeking through underneath it once it's layered you come sure you can definitely get oh fuck that's a shit yes watch bear with me okay I'm not a good swatch sure and last but certainly not least we have the shade gorge right here and this is what it looks like this is okay so this one is technically the streakiest of them all I don't you guys couldn't tell with the lighting but there's definitely a lot of skin peeking through especially towards the top right here this is more deadly need to be layered two or three times to get full opacity as see it's definitely definitely streaky you just like how that one is and that one is these two these three are pretty good these three are pretty streaky so here we have the shades are basically completely dried out um this one as its drying isn't gotten a little bit stickier if you guys can see it but there's a little bit more streakiness and this one these two are pretty good um this one is the most tricky of all that one's pretty streaky as well and this one is actually a little bit tricky as well okay guys so are they little minis of the liquid to matte lipsticks a hit or miss for me they are more of a miss I feel like there is shades that are a little bit too streaking here you can definitely make them work though if you bought them you can definitely make them worth it just layer a couple of shades I personally just don't really like how these formula for a liquid some mats already so for me I'm just I feel like I'm a little bit more hyper critical of whether they're streaky or not whether they're too drying or not etc this one doesn't feel too bad though this one's not killing me like some of her other ones huh for sure I'm a fan of this one so far doesn't feel too bad okay guys and that's it for Ty's entire video of this review on the Kylie cosmetics birthdate collection the entire bundle is a hundred and seventy five dollars so what do I think of this entire bundle as 175 dollars um honestly there was a lot of hits for sure but there were definitely some misses I'm not a huge fan of getting things like it that are in a bundle if I know I'm not gonna like multiple things so for me personally I wouldn't buy it as a bundle I would definitely just pick and choose some pieces these I thought were nice for example I thought the little bit liquid lipsticks were really nice I thought that keying highlighter was nice I thought the palette was actually really nice collectively was the entire Kylie cosmetics collection was it a hit or was it a miss I think it was definitely more of a hit for sure I think the packaging is Q I think it's very girly it's very pretty it's very like party esque I think it's a little bit childish just a little bit childish when I bought the bundle as a whole know what I bought individual items yes so yeah you guys just take my review with a grain of salt if you guys enjoy Cudi cosmetics products get the bundle get do whatever the fuck you want to do I just wanted to review this because this is my personal opinion on the items and no matter what I'm going to say honest and give you my personal opinions always just let you guys know what I think personally as always how great was the night or day wherever you guys are and I will catch you guys in my next video bye you guys [Music] guaranteed I'm alive in the dollar sign guarantee I can blow your dick hey guys welcome back to my channel hey guys and welcome back to my channel fuck that giggle man so yeah you guys that's what today's video is going to be I'm it let's try one of these bad bitches on fucking video I'm fucking tired man 
hey guys welcome back to my channel so today's really is going to be a favourites and disappointments video I've not film one of these in I what I feel is months I've been really busy with travel recently and I feel like what I'm traveling a lot I do not try a lot of new different products like I travel with things that I really know work for me because I'm I mean I'm traveling I need to be able to like be secure in the fact that I want them my face to look the way I wanted to you know what I mean but I do have some products I really want to talk about they have really become like staple products in my travel kit right now so I know I've been loving them so much and I've been loving these for the past couple of months actually and I have a couple of disappointments as well because those are always kind of fun to toss in I always talk about products that I love so I need to toss in some products that I don't always love you know I'm saying so after today's video is going to be to my may favorites and disappointments as always if you guys don't this video guys do not like me please don't fucking watch it you know the drill with that mixing so how do you say that because that's if I did it but you guys do like this video please subscribe to my channel if you're not already and if you knew what's up at mani MUA and welcome to my channel thank you so much for being here I really really appreciate it but yeah it's going to get into this favourites and disappointments okay guys let's start with some skincare items first I only have one to talk about and this is from the ordinary this is a brand new line that's carried out Beauty legibly I don't really know much about it I got a huge PR package sent from them recently the ordinary advance retinoid at 2% a stable emulsion of next generation forms of a retinoid so i have a lot of skin texture as you guys know I've talked about my texture all the time I just feel like I've texture all over my face had little bumps have little just under the skin abrasions and so I always kind of struggled with that and I've always had uhm those bumps all over my whole entire life so Laura Lee the home girl she told me she's like to use retinol and I'm like no I'm never really try retinol and she definitely highly recommended using retinol to me because it really helps with texture on the skin and so I'll try it and I got this package from ordinary and I've been using this literally for the past two weeks now and I've noticed a change in my texture in just two weeks I've noticed a change in my texture and I'm like I don't know if you guys can tell or anything that but I have definitely noticed there's been less texture on my skin recently and it's been really cool it's really really exciting and this product is like eight to ten dollars I was shocked the ordinary is known for really inexpensive prices for their skincare which is high-end skincare stuff so I'm like what the hell howdy suggest using a retinol in your everyday routine if you guys wanted to really solve some skin texture and wrinkles and things like that I really noticed a huge difference with using this but you need to make sure that you are using SPF when using it because it is a very very very strong purified form of vitamin A I think it's something like that I don't really know much about that shit but it's really really intense so you definitely be using SPF when using retinol or retinol and things like that so I use every single night and I've noticed what's different I've noticed a fucking difference so let's move on next part talk about really quickly is the cake in big sponge by Vera Mona I've talked about this before and I fucking love I done a whole video on this to be honest I did like a first impressions I'm like the best Beauty sponge ever and this is wrapped up because this is when I purchased recently like I bought a couple of myself and I just love I've used this sponge so much this is one that's been used right here in front of me it's such a good sponge of soaks up water so nicely it's not as soft as a Beauty Blender but it picks up so much less product than a Beauty Blender does it deposits product so nicely so full coverage so great at baking with powders as well it like cuts lines so easily if you guys are looking for a nice-ass sponge to apply makeup that isn't gonna break the bank it's not as expensive as a Beauty Blender either it's like 13 14 dollars I would definitely check out the Vera Mona cake and baked sponge it's so freaking nice like next month I wanna talk about quickly is the morphe prep and set spray I talked about this as well and I absolutely just love it the applicator a bitch bitch not only do I notice a huge difference in the longevity of my makeup when I use it to prep and set my makeup I love the application how lightweight and airy it is but it still gives you like a nice full application it gets you everywhere but it doesn't feel like your face is completely drenched in setting spray I don't really like that feeling I don't like it where my face feels like super super wet and intense from using too much setting spray and I honestly never feel it with this another reason I love this one so much is because I love to hack on really intense shadows on my lid and like I like to wet my brush wetting your brush with this is so easy just like a quick spritz I literally have like three cups of this it's so good next part on talked about really quickly is this powder by Charlotte Tilbury this is the price of your item this is definitely my most expensive item on the entire list of products I've been loving for the past couple months this is the airbrush flawless finish skin perfecting micro powder that is a long fuckin name I just love this powder so much because it gives you such a beautiful bright and awake look it I'm actually wearing it underneath my eyes today just to kind of brighten up everything this is where the power looks like oh it feels like butter it's absolutely beautiful I use the shade one personally right this what the powder looks like it's so Airy lightweight but still gives you such a nice amount of coverage super brightening and super just beautiful on the skin it makes it literally look airbrush I'm so happy it's called airbrush flawless skin because it really does give you that appearance and it's great for all skin types I've noticed when even when I'm having like drier days or drier likes patches after using the retinol I've noticed that this doesn't really pick up my dry patches as much whether you're oily dry combination I think you'll really really like it it just sucks because it is a pricier item I bought this one when I was at like Nordstrom I saw this when I norm that's where I bought this but it honestly is so worth it and I would definitely highly recommend using this powder me and Laura bought it together actually we're both like we lived next item is a more inexpensive item that I have been loving so much you can ask all my friends I'm always talking to me about this blush it's so embarrassing this is the wet and wild blush color icon pearlescent pink blush by wet and wild I'm wearing it on my cheeks today this blush is just so fucking good it's like the perfect amount of pink has a little bit of gold reflect in it it's not the smoothest feeling powder it's really not so watching looking here but on the face it's just so fucking pretty this is what looks like right here kind of a little bit reminds me of NARS orgasm it's just a much less intense version not as gold chunky glitter as NARS orgasm it's just a much more subdued version and a much cheaper version since like what $3 I have been wearing this blush you guys nan fucking stop for the last like three months straight ever since I did the wet and wild one brand tutorial maybe not three ones like two months I've been using this blush every day it's embarrassing and I'll tell my friends like guys have you tried on pearlescent pink and they're like mani we know you love the blush I calm the fuck down am i I would highly highly recommend wet and wild color icon blush in the shade pearlescent pink it's a good ashy look good I think I'm down to the last of my favorites yeah one more this is a collaboration this is from kim tae and cake face beauty these are the lion-hearted lashes are actually not in here because i just wore them recently I think they're in the section one yep they're right here they are this a bottom pair of lash right here this is what they look like they are so drag they are drag as fuck and I literally live for them so hard I've been wearing them non-stop this entire month they're so beautiful there so draggy they're so intense and they're so fluffy and like they like when I open my eyes like they hit my fucking brow like they are drag and I think him tie and cake fake speedy did such an amazing job on this pair of lashes and congratulations to you guys again you guys fucking killed it beware though because if you guys have smaller eyes this is a very intense lash this is not like a little like flutter lash like this is not a cute little like wispy pair of nothing these are drag as fuck and they're gonna look really big on you but on me I'm a dude like they work on my eye shape just fantastically if you guys have smaller eyes just be a little more careful with it just a little more careful with it and so now on it to the disappointments I have a to disappointments in today's video one is this bitch why did I buy it this is the 3 second brow actually did a whole dedicated video on this I'll leave it linked down below if you guys are interested in it but honestly it should did not work on me what so ever my brows are too thick it just did not work I thought the brow product was too dark I thought the brow product didn't get put down nicely I thought it did not get put down evenly the whole thing was really kind of a mess if you have less brow hair than me or if you have no brows at all maybe it would work on you I have no idea but on me personally it just didn't work and I'm like why would you spend $20 on this and my other disappointment for today's video is this little guy this is the ELF concealer I'm not sure exactly what's called I think it's called like the flawless HD concealer I'm not exactly sure what this is called actually you just today I felt this tutorial on this eye look and like this face look earlier and I used this I did a full one brand tutorial of elf and I try for the first time and I really really really did not like this because the color selection was horrendous I use like the lightest shade this is in the shade light and I use the shade fair I think and they were both still too dark the finish was so like oily and greasy when I put on powder on top it came up on like a brush I was like likes like I was shocked at how much I really didn't like this and I was like okay cool we're gonna make it work and I definitely did like three layers of this to try to make it work as much as I could but it creases super easily I don't know maybe I was just using this wrong maybe I used the wrong powder to set it it just was not a good concealer I'm not bragging on it because it's drugstore cuz I love like Maybelline concealers and things like that let me know if it works for you guys and how you guys personally use it maybe I was using it wrong who knows but this was not a good concealer and that's it you guys that's it for the entire video on my may favorites and disappointments products video I know there wasn't very very many but I have been doing a lot of traveling recently and I didn't get a tryout that many different products but the ones I have tried the ones that are here I absolutely loved so much I think it's so fun to test out different products see if you like them see doing them just you just never know with makeup so I had a lot of fun at testing these products out and I actually loved all of them of course everything I've talked about in today's video will be linked down below as well all my social media links Instagram Twitter snapchat everything will be linked down below for you guys we guys want to check those out but yeah guys thank you guys so much for watching have a great so night or day where you guys are and I will catch you guys in my next video hey guys what what are you doing [Music] no people no that's a mole that's a fuckin mole this is the second video I feel place a little fucking shut all right Banco all right Dean Cole hey guys hey video had so much fuckin fine Ziya 
hey guys that welcome back to my channel what is up you guys I am man your way if you guys are not familiar what is up there was like this viral video going around on Facebook and on Twitter and I got tagged so much to try these quick cats eyeliner strips literally it's basically eyeliner tape but that was the vibe I was getting from the little videos of that it's literally like eyeliner on tape and you like put it down and you like peel it off and it's like so I really really really haven't really wanted to try it out and finally got them in an email and I'm so stoked are they a hit or miss like what is the T about these quick cat eyeliner strips so we're going to do that today we're going to do a review and demo on this product so if you guys want to see that video keep on watching as always for guys do not like this video if you guys do not like me please don't watch it you know Joe is that but if you guys do like the video please go ahead and subscribe to my channel if you're not already subscribed and thank you so much for being here if you are a subscriber of mine but yeah let's go ahead get started on today's review on these quick cat eyeliner strips tapes I mean honestly this can make our eyeliner game easier I'm game so okay so went ahead and went on the page right now for the quick eyeliner strips so I just wanted to talk about really quickly this is what it looks like it comes with 32 strips 16 for the left 16 for the right and it comes with an eye liner in it any retails for 995 which i think is a really great price point even for just like the eyeliner alone 995 is like really good currently it's on pre-order how things are available just yet you guys can go ahead like the one I just read was the refill pack and then I found the other one that's eyeliners chest pack 32 pen included free shipping for 1195 so there's like two different ones on the site but they contain the same thing let's just with the let's just read the instructions on how to doing our tank but before I even start honestly when I first saw a video going viral I 100,000% thought it was literally tape that has eyeliner on it like already eyeliner like free on it I don't know how I was literally think I'm like how the did they do this it's literally like eyeliner tape that you like just stick on and you're like Remy remove and it's like eyeliner I was like gum as I'm reading this right now that's not the case I totally thought that was let's just open this bitch okay if you have like an you have an instructions we have instructions right here so we have a this is this is the gagra here this is what I mean this is without Mischa you apply the quick hat liquid eyeliner liberally to Zone two on sticky side distribute ink evenly so basically you're using an eyeliner on a spot on the tape and then the tape is like the transfer you're putting eyeliner on a piece of tape and eye but they make it easier for you because it's like outlined perfectly I don't know we're gonna go ahead and dive right in what I decided to do I wanted to do half me like not have my face but like this area I want to put like a foundation on cuz I know a lot of people do their eye makeup after their base I'm one included so I wanted to do a little bit of my base here one one out just to see like that makes a difference or if like using it with the base down first if I'm peeling if I'm like putting this tape down will it take off all my  makeup I'm like that's not the look that we're going for you know I'm saying we're gonna go ahead and try to put some foundation on really quickly on this face this face is rough too that you guys she's really going through something flem's gonna put a little bit of my NARS radiant long wearing foundation anyways because either on what I will we're going set this area okay cool so we have half the face with foundation on with concealer foundation it's set in place so we're gonna go ahead and see how the eyeliner sticks onto something that's primed and ready to go with foundation on and another side we're gonna do on completely bare skin and see how it goes on maybe goes on better maybe goes on worse so we're going to go ahead and go right in this is actually what a strip looks like right here sorry that's taking me so long to even show you guys this is what the strip looks like right here so literally it's just like a little tiny strip of tape and there's different sections there's like a one two three and four section the back of it so what it says the rear read instructions realtor Lee this is for the left wing so this is for this side slowly move remove backing shade in Zone two on sticky side so it's basically saying to remove like this and we're gonna remove the tape boom now peel zone three apart from clear transfer layer okay okay I'm seeing right here peel the second strip stick bottom edge of strip alongside our edge of a book we know I did it wrong because I feel like this is supposed to be filled in like this is not supposed to be here okay guys I think I did this completely wrong and we're gonna have to start over with the city I think what I suppose I suppose I'll leave this on like this and then filled in because look I'm like see then you remove this little part right there so we're gonna this one more time you ever tried a couple more times we actually if I can get you like I'm not stopping until get this correctly let's try the right wing ha maybe my left is being gay I feel like this is like the back part here remove wax backing from check remove wax this is the wax back hand could be late its waxy place strip sticky side up on the scratch pad below apply it okay okay okay maybe you like I I think I went too quick I think I always too crazy I'm saying so I think what I do is I apply the eyeliner to this little part right here just see okay I'm he doesn't see but there's like that little black part of that little indent right there you play there so we're gonna take our little eyeliner we're gonna apply it to the back of this liberally they say liberally taking a little highly know that I came with I really saturated it like hardcore did a time now we remove again okay now I think I'm getting oh my gosh I think I'm getting it okay the eyeliner itself when we swatching it is sickening that is black is the night sky no I think I up again but I'm not gonna stick this to my eye are you kidding this is a almost a joke at this point I messed up twice in different ways okay I know removed the wax that or I know I know like the back of my hand you remove the wax and put a pop of I'm loving it you know okay we got here wax strip removed so I'm gonna do now I'm gonna do the same thing I'm gonna cover it in black damn I think I'm wasting a lot of eyeliner with this now that I separated the back I'm gonna remove the white strip right here go more I see okay okay okay okay oh my gosh oh my gosh okay huh we have something we have something here Eileen here okay we finally got somewhere you guys okay I'm so excited holy it took me a minute but we got there I moved the mirror closer so I'm scared I want to up the authority but the back yeah okay we have our right Eileen there dick to the base it's hey dick to the base of the eye really make sure it's saturated we have it on Oh feels weird it feels halo and carefully peel away from eyelid awake my lid from center outwards to reveal the perfect cat eye Wayne fill in areas lacking saturation okay I'm not giving up on this yet okay we have a flick at least we're gonna do the left with makeup on honestly the right was kind of a flop so far so we're gonna try the left so we're gonna do it correctly this time like I now I know the zones okay so now we're gonna do we remove the wax strip first this takes a long time for someone that wants to do a quick eyeliner yeah so now I'm gonna take the eyeliner and this Islander guys like I said earlier what i'm swatching it it is so pigmented like it's a very very intense this time I'm really over saturating it because it didn't come off that much in the first one on my right side and this bit just flooded if it doesn't transfer with this it will not transfer and I'm gonna be upset we're gonna go ahead and try it and putting it on with foundation and everything uh-huh press it in also a lot of fun you can come off with this one it worked better on that side I'm doing everything correct I don't know what's going on like I really don't we're gonna try the right side one more time I've literally wasted already like I think six strips trying to figure this bitch out oh my god I'm gonna use a different eyeliner I'm not gonna use a quick high one I'm gonna use the Kat Von D yeah maybe that will make a difference I'm gonna use the Kat Von D eyeliner the one I use like literally all the time I'm gonna try one more time and honestly this is a flop and I have my verdict I know what I feel about this and that's final and that's  final look at my eye wax removed boom I'm getting so much better at this tattoo liner by Kat Von D and we're gonna see if that makes a difference because the first one is not my favorite okay annoying thing about this is I feel like you're wasting a lot of eyeliner when doing this that's nothing something you have to note let's go ahead and do it the right way you will really member now we're really pressing with him I mean that was better than the clique at one what is this look what I can just like this boom boom boom boom boom boom that's so much easier okay guys that is ever today's video what do I think about these quick eyeliner strips honestly I guess technically for me like the proof is in the pudding I literally tried doing it several times we got to a point that I just couldn't do it anymore the one with foundation and primed came off better the one without just wanted to note that out this I just did myself a quick little one - it just did not work for me and I really wanted it to because the videos look so promising and so good maybe for using a different form of eyeliner maybe using a gel eyeliner maybe using something else to fill it in but it does not work with what it came with which is the whole point of this video I wanted to show using the actual quick cat eyeliner itself also when looking at it or here feel so shiny this black eyeliner is it is shiny means really black but it looks silver with the cops running it is it did not work with that one it just wouldn't work on me I don't know maybe my eyes repelled it I don't know anyway I guess all in all I would say for me this was a Miss sadly I really really wanted at work I had like high hopes for it you know I've tried to go into these videos with like a open mind I try not to be too negative about them even though I feel like sometimes they're gonna be gimmicky I'm like you know what it's gonna be cool it'll work but sometimes it doesn't work out like that and this is one of the products for me it just did not work out they're not too expensive which is great like twelve bucks or nine bucks to the refills and like ten bucks for the eyeliner itself which is really really cool but I think that for me I would pass I wouldn't buy it myself only because I just there's no significant thing that it didn't work for me enough where I was like you're doing too much work for not enough payoff just from my  frame of mind please just let me have this I'm going to do a gel eyeliner on my hand let's not get crazy I'm gonna do it on my hand and see how the transfer on the hand is but gel eyeliner on this now we're gonna go ahead and see this one I know it's gonna work like I just feel it in my bones jaw liner it takes forever to dry I just feel it's gonna work on this one okay over here we're applying it pressure pressure what is going to happen I don't know ah so much better I told you guys I felt at my bone we're gonna do it on the left I'm taking the Inglot gel liner by the way guess you all right okay run try the left side again guys we're tight left side one more time and of course it's already a diner there but now we're at the point where we already know it's gonna be more pigmented so let's just try it thank you guys for bearing with me I want to do a real good review the problem with the gel liner is like when you're pressing it in it gets everywhere because it's a gel so any little movement is going to move it a lot I mean it's definitely better it's not good enough that's my problem is that's not good enough yeah you guys got the verdict still doesn't really work I would say definitely works a lot more with gel liner it definitely did great on my hand and it's a lot easier to fill this in but the problem is that it is not the most user-friendly thing I would say just a stick to do it I normally if you guys can if you can't then this might be a great thing for you to like as a resource to help guide you when doing a winged liner using gel liner of course I wouldn't really recommend doing a liquid liner because it did not work and never transfer like literally ever barely transferred like a dot so yeah that's my opinion that's my thoughts on this product hope you guys enjoyed it and as always have a great show tonight or date wherever you guys heart and I will catch you guys in my next video bye guys I love you what so what's up you guys welcome back to my channel today is wait anything remove the wax backing from the strip place ship side oh there's like a lot of things gonna run it okay I walked up and I'm like oh hi I need powder I'm oily [Music] yep are they going to leave it that's when he gets to know them I cannot believe that math of like waste that comes from this that you get three strips from one strip 
Hey, guys! Welcome back to my channel. So I've a special guest, it's about freaking time.
 - Hi, everyone! Hi, everyone, welcome back to Manny's channel.
So today is really exciting for both of us. I’m like dying. Like I don't even know
what to say, I'm so so so happy. Like this has been in the making for such a long time.
- Yes. When did we even start discussing a collab? This was like over a year ago. - Yeah.
- A long time. The idea sprouted and I just
felt so right at the time. And a lot of people have wanted to collab
with my brand all of 2016. And I was like, you know what, “No, I'm just gonna do me.” And I just felt like it would be such a perfect collaboration
to work with someone that's actually my real friend, best friend and that I have like a real relationship with
- Yeah. No, totally. And I just feel like we're always on the same page. It's like wired, friendship is so easy and so good.
- Easy peasy. Easy... let me squeeze my fucking hole.
 - Yes. This collaboration is really special for me now. This is my first collab ever with my brand and I'm so honored and happy that it's with you. I couldn't be more honored that you chose me to be. Yes.
- Like I want to say so so so exciting. This is actually like one of my... this is my fourth collab.
- Yeah. So like in a span of three years and my fourth collab,
This is the one I have been the most excited for. This is like the most genuine friendship
I've had with the brand. Yeah.
- Ever. The most I've been excited. I'm like nervous. Me, too.
- Like I'm shaking, like I'm nervous. I know and it was really hard to keep it a secret. Like we told a few friends but we didn't want it to leak;
everything leaks online nowadays. Oh everything. So quick, Quick! Accidents happen Accidents do
 happen, Manny maybe slipped up once or twice. But it happens.
- It was a good thing. It ended up being all great. And you guys have been so receptive and so loving
towards our collaboration and we considered you enough. It's been so overwhelming, so great.
- The response so far has been unreal. So of course now it's time to reveal what is inside
the magical box that everyone's been seeing. Everyone's like, "Open it up!"
- As always guys, if you like this video, if you like don't like us, please don't fucking watch it. Please don't. You know the drill of that. Okay guys, now it's time to reveal the collab bundle.
 - Whooo! This is what she looks like!
- Damn! This is actually just the outer sleeve too. This is not just a [inaudible], guys. So this is like a slip cover like when you get an album
 or a CD and then it slides off slowly like shevorskin. So this really looks like a really really cool, awesome
crescent moon with Jeffree Star's emblem. We decided just because both of our emblems that
we've been using for a long ass time are a moon and a star. Come on, when the stars and the moon align
I think it is perfect to put our logos together, combine them and they look so cute together. And I think it also looks fantastic
 and I think that we, it just turned out beautifully, like I think the team worked amazingly
on this and it just looks fantastic. So everything with the hologram, the black like that's how my last collab was, so we really want to incorporate that into this one. It's very Manny branding, yes.
- But also the [inaudible] as well, so it's very... us. And I've never done like any black  packaging for my entire brand, yet.
- Yes. It's been very pink, very loud. So I thought
it'd be really cool to just kinda like flip it on a whole other level and just
do something really different. Yeah. No, I completely agree. I think it turned out fantastically.
- Whoo! This is what you guys do. You slip off
 the little slipcover, like this.
- Boom! Bam! And ou get this super super cool on this matte, so it's like
a glossy black print on this matte black packaging. This is like the actual box for it, so this is what
the box is, with everything that comes in. - It's like star emblems. I'm dying. I know. So then we open it and we have little flap
 - that's on it right there. - So cute.
- So cute. So we open it and you have
 this super amazing badass hologram, and super cool triangular effect
here on the actual unicorn itself. - It's so so so so cool.
-Yes. I love that it just looks like it's moving. - Almost pixelated. It's so cool. I absolutely love it.
- Which is so cool. - So this is what it looks like guys.
- Yes. So I know a lot of you have been asking
and everything in the bundle will also be sold separately. That will be awesome. So, but if you do want to get
the bundle together it will be for what? - A discounted price?
- A discounted price at fifty bucks. So it'll be $50 for the entire bundle usually. If it's two liquid lipsticks and a highlighter
 it'll be sixty-five bucks. - It's a good deal.
- It's a good deal. You get like literally 20% off,
almost 25% off. So it's an amazing, amazing deal.
If you guys want to do the bundle as a whole, and you guys of course
will be getting this entire situation. And if you don't and you just want a lipstick
or maybe just a highlighter by itself, those options are available. - And for the first time ever,
- Ever! literally ever on Jeffree's brand ever; so if you guys want to buy any part of the collaboration
 separately and not inside the bundle, you guys can use the code MANNYMUA
 to save 10% off. - Yaa!
- For the… individually, not on the bundle. - But I've never done a code on my website ever.
- I know. - And I think it's only fitting.
- Right. - [Inaudible]
- Yes. So all jokes aside I thought it'd be really cool
for also for our many subscribers, and everyone that loves us together
 to get something cool for the first time ever. Because you're getting
a great deal for the bundle, so we wanted to include something
with those who want to buy individually. - Yes.
- So if you guys want to buy individually, you can and you can use the code MANNY MUA
 tif you want to save 10% off on top of that. And I think the most important part
 is when does it come out? Yes! Oh my gosh! Okay.
The launch date is on April 8th. - Whoo!
- At 10 a.m. Pacific Center Time. Yes so April 8th it's around the corner
 I'm so excited. It's literally come in up so quick,
4 days after my birthday. That's the deal so now as you guys
I'm sure are dying, - to see.
- They're like come on, come on! The actual colors and the names of the colors
 so let's get right into that. Okay the first thing that
we're gonna talk about is the highlighter. - Yes. Bam!
- Which is this guy right here. - Ahh!
- The packaging alone... The packaging is literally so badass, It literally looks pixelated like
 I love that it looks like it's moving. When the light and the sun hits it,
it is everything. I love that you wanted to do
 something different, like not a lot of brands do this crazy type
of light reflecting packaging, - and I'm like it's so... I'm obsessed with it.
- I love it. It's so unique. - What's she called?
- The name of her is Eclipse. - Yes.
- Okay. The reason I wanted to name it
Eclipse is because, when the sun and the moon align
 it's a lunar eclipse. - So that was so cool.
- Yeah. Cause the sun is a star and obviously
I love moons so an eclipse is what happens, - and I thought the name eclipse was sick.
- Yes. It's perfect. Do you remember when
we were talking about the collab, when we started it, you were like we don't have
any names, what about eclipse? Yea I was like Oh!
I guess we're done. Great. - Your gut always knows shade names like.
- Yeah. It just does.
Like the names, it just does. Like your gut knows the names
 and I think Eclipse works perfectly, especially cause
it's so blinding like eclipse. Now, I don't know if anyone's been noticing
but he's been wearing it a lot on his snapchats. - It's literally all he wear.
- And maybe go back this week, last on your channel and it's...
- It's everything. - And there's something special.
- Oh yeah. Oh my God I can't. Okay so we've changed up the normal
 skin frost stamp in the powder, and let's show everyone
what's the new stamp. Whoo. Oh! It's so good! You guys, so we have
the crescent moon stamped, along with of course
the Jeffree Star emblem inside it. So we have the moon stamp
and we have the star. Even the outer packaging itself is all black,
it's matte, has a hologram. The back has this really cool. - Yea with the moon.
- Black like packaging. - Like the crescent baby?
- The little moon, the little eclipse. It's so cute. How would you describe this color?
I would describe it as a icy peach. Agreed. It's really blinding. It's blinding, it's stunning. You guys want to see swatches that's fine. So I'm gonna go in with a Morphy M510. Ok and I'm gonna use
 the Excelsior A23 Highlighting brush. Perfect.
So we're gonna go in, - and we're each gonna do a couple like a one two.
- Okay. Literally all you guys need is…
it literally picks up so much product. Guess what I've been doing lately is
I've been just like touching the moon barely. - Bam! Yeah.
- Just caressing the moon. Go ahead, I want to see it. - Guys, this is just one, this is just one thing.
- It's so pretty. - That's dry normal. She's going in.
- Go in. It's like I'm sorry. - It really like compliments so many different colors.
- Look how different it looks on us. - I know.
- It's still like amazing. On me it looks like a little more peach. You can actually see
the peach pinkiness coming out. - Yeah you really can.
- And you also feel like it looks a little more icy. Whoo! And then
you also can use these wet. Look I mean you don't really need to.
You want like the most extreme highlighter on earth, you definitely can wet your brush
with some Vicks Plus. I'll do a little bit like I did this one photo
and I put [inaudible 08:06] in the photo actually, and I had put this highlighter on as my base
and then I sprayed it a little bit with some Vicks Plus, - put it on and that's like what is in that photo.
- Yeah. - It's so blinding.
- I've even done like little brushes like this, where you wet them, - and I'm doing like Eclipse in the corner.
- Oh same and then the brow bone. Oh yes the brow bone. Oh I made [inaudible], I already put a little bit
 of Eclipse on my brow bone before you got here. Well, it's fantastic.
What is on your brow bone. - It looks so so cool.
- Okay let me highlight this nose. Let me have my face have it.
All right cupid's bow action. Oh I'm sorry. Oh my God. - She's feeling metal.
- Common filtrum! I'm highlighting my chin right now.
Like I'm just screwing myself. A little bit on the chin;
you look pretty on the brow bone. A little on the forehead.
A little on the ears. I'm wearing a hat
not gonna try to go there right now. - God. It's so good.
- I'm obsessed honestly. So I've been sneak-peeking and wearing in
a few of my videos the last month and I've just like, - I just love how it looks on camera; it's so pretty.
- It looks so good, it's so beautiful,
it's so blinding, it's so intense. And it's obviously the Jefree's formula which is
 already so so so nice. It's so creamy, it's so blinding. So this icy peach just really
complementing your whole entire line. - Yes.
- It wasn't just like a random color. - Like I felt like it's a really good mix.
- Yes. - And your colors.
- Hi. - All right. Shall we swatch the liquid lips?
- It's amazing. And now it's time
for the liquid lipsticks. - Hey guys the first shade,
- Yes. we're gonna be talking about
and trying on is the shade Daddy. Yes! I just thought that would be such a fun name. - We say it all the time.
- We do. It's so fun.
People like call us daddy all the time online. It's just a fun thing.
I think it's a fun thing, and I just really thought the name Daddy
would be so fitting for a lipstick. You do and I'm tied up,
that's a safe word. Yes.
Now are you ready to how this color? So you guys, this color is a…
I would say more of a cool tone medium brown. She looks like this, Bam! This color though. Guys honestly, the reason I chose these colors
is because I do the pink nudes all the time. - Yep.
- I've done the [inaudible 10:07] like with the pink nudes, and they're great and I love them
and I wear them all the time. But I want to do something that I still love
and wanted to be just a little more different. - That's exactly.
- I'm obsessed with this.This is like giving me… I don't know almost when
I say like 90's super-model. - It's very like grunge glam.
- It is. It's super grunge glam and it's honestly
so beautiful and we'll try it on right now. - Shall we swatch it for everyone? Yes.
- Yes. I'm dying.
Come on [inaudible] applicator. - Oh my God I'm so excited.
- I know me too. Work, oh okay she's already done. - I know my pretty.
- Sorry Mom, we just got our lips done. I'm like, "Oh, I need to hurry the f up." So this is the shade Daddy I love it.  It is so… it's really cool tone but
 I feel like it could work on literally any skin tone. Any skin tone because it's like a medium tone color.
It's not like super light, it's not super dark. - It's right there.
- It can literally work on every skin tone,  from the lightest of complexions to
I feel like some of the deepest complexions. You can really wear it
and pull it off easily. - Your eyes are so crazy it's cool.
- Does it? Yours too? Thank you. I just can't wait for everyone
to try this shade. It's so so so good
and I think you guys'll really like it, because it's a neutral color which is so very very me.
Like I'm so very much in the neutral realm. - But it's more of the cool tone end than the warm tone end.
- Oh, I love it. - So I really love this color.
- Hi. Ok guys so the next shade
that we have is I'm Shook. Whoo! I mean, honestly when we started production
on this months ago, Manny came up with this name. Oh my God it's perfect and since then, that word... it's kinda gone like everywhere. - We ate bora boras when we came up with the name.
- Yes. And bora boras that was weird,
that was what? - Oh, God.
- A long time ago. - That was like August. 16.
- Yes. Yeah so that was a long time ago. That was
when we came up with the names of our lipsticks, and I'm like 'Dude.' Now I'm Shook is everywhere
but it doesn't really matter like we've been saying. - It's a fun catch phrase. I love it but…
- We didn't invent it. It's fun. And it sums up our lives. So this color is actually like a burnt coral. - Yes. It's so pretty.
- That's how it is. It's stunning and I know since
we're launching this in spring time, - I thought it would be such a perfect-ass shade.
- It is. For the spring. It's so beautiful; same, it's a medium tone color. It's not gonna be too light on people;
 it's not gonna be too dark on people. It's just gonna complement
so many different skin types. Any skin tone can wear this one
 it's just a beautiful shade. - It's so… agreed. Let's get to swatching.
- Let's get swatching. I feel like I take so long to swatch
cause I'm like holding my breath. Right. No totally and you do one… - you do one thing for one lip.
- Yeah. Oh I'm obsessed with it.
 I'm in love with it, I wanna marry it. - This color brings all the [inaudible 12:54]
- Yes, ma'am. Honestly this color is so --
oh my God, it's so beautiful. - It is.
- On you it looks like everything. I've been trying not to wear it
on snapchat or anything, but I've been like,
I'll wear it like around the house. - Yes.
- Just to wear it. Just to try it out
 because it's so beautiful, and it honestly just brings out
so many pretty different tones, it has like magenta tones,
has pink tones, has red tones. - It's just like, are you kidding?
- I know it's everything. I think that the shades
that you chose are so amazing. They're very universal and I think
that they are perfect combination as well. I think that we have like the really fun cool tone new.
We've got the really pop warm red in the shade. I think honestly you really
can't go wrong with either of them. I think they're so perfect and they're
 very different for me. So I'm very excited. I love that you went
 a little bit different with them all. Ya I went different but I feel like… in the difference
 realm like I didn't do like a yellow lipstick. - Right. That would not be you.
- Right. You know that would not be me. This is so very Manny. It's so really really pretty and it's very like a color
 that I would still wear no matter what. - Yeah.
- I just want it… I'm not gonna be putting out
a great lipstick. - It's not my thing.
- Right exactly. - But this.
- But this! - This is like Cholita.
- I'm obsessed with them. And that's it you guys.

vo please subscribe to my channel and to Christina's channel and I'll leave of course link down below as well as her video bi you guys let's get into this transformation [Music] she has more dryer skin so we're gonna focus on what your skin has very tanana glowy skin oh my god you poor you guys you got burns more dry I'm going to use a little bit of fix plus we're take the Too Faced hangover RX primer it's a nice nourishing primer cuz I was drinking too much you sure won't just tell me Manny what you really think you sure were isn't that for makeup yes but you need to apply like moisturizer tons of things so now we're going some foundation guys wanna take the co Gendo aqua foundation in the shade 113 I just have this might or I don't know this is in your shade we're going to try it I'm going to a little pump and put a little bit on the cheek just to see how it blends we're gonna use it doesn't work yeah I think it totally works look I think it's blending into your skin so nice II can't even tell you same color mm-hmm you do have really nice skin so you don't want to cover it up you know nice yes you do no pores you just look snatched snatched nachi so wait your makeup in my neck I'm just taking a little bit down cuz you are a little bit more fair on the neck doesn't want to match it a little bit better but I'm gonna do a very soft layer that's why I'm blending it down with a sponge looks really great on you looks really natural and I look more I look all the same color yeah where did you never do a little bit the Tarte shape tape oh I know that is yeah cuz you have one I'm so proud of you watch you guys Jeff she has some tart shape to guys but she has the wrong color it's true not only am i concealing what is I'm highlighting as well is that how you get dates to like you just highlight I want to know cuz I'm honey now how you look up for me dude you have no one rides not yet holy shit just under eyes okay yes you are highlighted I'm look up for me okay and I like to bake or like set the eye from the backwards going in so you're using a Beauty Blender yeah he's not a brush no because you have since you're saying that you have drier skin I'm also using a I'm also using the RCM a no color powder which is a powder that's a really really good for people that are more dry because it doesn't pick up on your dry patches and it doesn't like make you feel drier the areas that are more Creasy for example like you have more smiling to here on the areas I do too like to use a more excessive amount of powder there cuz I just feel like when you're applying without damp Beauty Blender it just helps with moisturization okay guys she's still burned back here like we're not gonna show now imma dust away the excess powder my guys to get watery har they do because I was laughing so that's your father so guys I'm gonna take a little bit of bronzer now this is the Marc Jacobs fantastic runs err that's expensive mmm lightly bronze up the forehead I don't tan it just peels same no really yeah I don't go into the Sun are you a vampire mm-hmm first lightly brush their bronzer so this isn't contour right no this is more like just bronzing up the skin making it look more healthy or I put it right into the hollow of your dad I know what blush is this we're taking wet and wild which is a drugstore blush mmm in the shape pearlescent pink placing on the apples and blending it backwards I think that's because you have to know such nice cheekbones already we're taking my jeffree star cosmetics x-man emu a highlighter oh ma look at that oh shit oh my god can you put it like all over maybe I can't so you put it right up towards the eye I like to I like to tell you like I could always round it out here like a moon yeah like a little crescent moon so you just dust the entire nose for you because it's a small petite cute nose yes and the chin on the chin a little bit cute chance no chin just like to focus the glow in those centered areas well that was pretty painless easy right we're gonna do a little bit more of fix+ easy breezy beautiful Maybelline I'm and this is to help melt in the foundation everything till they look less pottery yes or take on a saucy eyebrow is in the shade of soft brown let's see that works for you are you soft brown in the pod no way yeah I know it's like a little red for me this is medium brown I'm gonna go with medium as well to do my actual base so do you prefer the pencils or the pods I'll be the pencils yeah it's just easier to like map something out okay so you're actually drawing on it yeah exactly those two the painting yes ah yeah exactly okay let's keep the brow I guess more than natural sight I think when I started filling my brows and I was listening to Instagram oh God who's the palm added and then it was like really thick just really dark and it just looked wrong it's intense that pump means a really intense air pump yeah however you say it pommade I say call me pommade that's the same of Jose because he speaks French guys okay she's talented you can the one speak French have a day job you edit your own videos I mean I do too but still goddamn she'd has different shaped brows not obviously in a bad way or anything that it's just different this one has thicker hair here so you kind of have to focus my product on the outer corner what I'm doing brows on people I like to follow like how their brow shape looks on that one brow and then how that brow shape looks and try to make as much glass as possible or take the Mac painterly paint-pot oh that's the Paint Pot mm-hmm I've heard that this is yes Mac painterly paint-pot this is what I like what I was using in the last video membrane yeah lightly set the primary place down so what kind of looks we do do I don't know what do something kind of more bold I wanna be sexy oh okay God receive jacket he'll palette use my coat simply for temper set ah um you don't have a co in Morphy so you need a back they'll shut on our 30 a brush guys the outer portion and we're gonna blend it into the lid so we're gonna put it into the crease guys so she was saying earlier she thought that this was a crease right there but the crease is actually like right here but you can like see when you're like tilting you head up in the orbital bone I feel like that's something regular people didn't realize no definitely might take a or darky Brown no focus it on the outer corner into that little V we're gonna do like some glitter on the lids because I feel like okay you're known for holographic I would love sex for you to decorate my face lightly blend our ice keep watering there we're not gonna really be able to focus a lot of product there so I grabbed them with the tissue everyone we're going to know we're gonna make it fucking work it's not matting a little bit of a darker color on the outer corner guys to give that some definition now guys we're going to be taking the diamond dust by Stila I wouldn't put that all over - I have to let it dry yes a little bit please I shouldn't open mine not yet a little bit we don't want it to go away yet so and you guys can just stare at my nose instead mm-hmm nature can and they're gonna like it and we're likely blending the edges guys by the way so you blend the wet into the dry yes mm-hmm just slightly just to give it a little bit it's not as harsh if I wanted to do something cut crease or something one tense that fine but this way I just want to have a nice Lendl end it's a little hard to do this stuff because Claire doesn't blend out so you have to just kind of be willing to finagle damn mommy you sexy so now guys we're gonna go in with some brown liner because you do have a green hazel eyes your eyes actually kind of similar to mine it looks good I never put shit in my water really no and I'm gonna blend out the excess here to continue on because that's gonna be our way kind of cheating the fact that you keep crying off of that stuff that's fine just look like up to the side and I go perfect yeah that's right I just need that like your eye to be open basically I'm just running a low transition shade right here transitions just basically we did in the top we're doing in the bottom didn't I oh is that a highlight yeah we're gonna highlight we're taking a highlighting shade from the dark in that way mixing the top two I'm gonna highlight and then I live on the brow bone as well just to give it a little bit of a lift at the top most point that's nice okay so you do it right here like at the point not not all around it that's right not touch I just want to focus on like opening I enough rake right here without looking too so you don't Cleary that up or down no okay right there dang simply ha logical I'm gonna do Adam have you open your eyes look down okay like this like that I'm gonna lightly do a super thin soft layer now we're going to apply some mascara I'm actually happy you applied your own mascara okay are you sure you trust me I sure do please God you guys were gonna put some lashes on these are cute little pair from the lower lashes that are cut to fit you specifically tiny tiny your tiny the lashes sit down for sure darlin okay yes what are you T Oh God [Music] my little Cindy illogical with her little lashes lip pencil can I go nude on you my lips it's a game we're gonna really try to fake that you have bigger lips though so every night darker look like we're gonna cheat the system here yeah what if I like yeah no we're a little bit okay I'm just letting y'all know we're gonna do it just just the hair dude we're gonna do Geoffrey start mannequin man can you get maybe a mannequin yep like do it correctly taking a little bit of boss to the center just for the center here a little bit of shine and voluptuousness to this

[Music] 
Hey guys welcome back to my channel So in today's video as you can see from the title is going to be a full face using only Wet and wild products. I've been doing full face using one brand videos for so long since like the beginning of my channel Why am I winded oh God? I'm out of shape I think they're so much fun to film because they're kind of a challenge like if I don't have a lot of the products I'll Just kind of try to make it work with what I have like I did with last Maybelline one But this time [I] came more prepared I went out and bought so much wet and wild products I literally bought like one of everything to see if I could actually use a full face of just wet and wild I have not Tried a lot of these products. I'm talking like most of these products I've not tried So this is Gonna be a first impressions and full face using wet and wild products This is not sponsored by wet and wild I wish it was I wish it was actually no who knows what if I don't like some shit What if I don't like some shit that's gonna fucking suck, but yeah guys that's what's gonna be today's video I'm super excited to film this and yeah Let's go ahead and get right into it as always if you guys don't like this video if you guys do not like me Please don't fucking watch it. You know the drill with that. Do not subject yourself to watching something you don't like Because I don't give a fuck But if you guys do like this video, please subscribe to my channel if you aren't already and yeah Let's go ahead and get into this full face using Wet'n'wild products only K guys to start this video I literally went to CVS and spent about 100 bucks on Wet'n'Wild Products literally this whole bag is completely filled with wet and wild shit got my receipt. That's a long receipt Tell me that did not sound like "We're making waffles" First things first guys. We are going to try the wet and wild cover all primer base This is just a primer that wet and wild has I've never tried this I've never tried most of these products It's completely sealed let's see what it feels like okay. It feels like a Moisturizer feels very smooth going on the skin. Actually feels very Almost hydrating what the fuck. So this guy says [that] it's a magic potion that it refines pores fills fine lines of brightens complexion evens skin tone no, don't do none of that. Looks pretty much the same to me, but uh I dont know maybe on camera it looks a little bit different to you guys. What do you think did do you feel like it's Smoothed out my pores. I don't I really don't see it. But maybe you did? I just feel like I look more matte, but [it's] supposed to be a mattifying primer, [okay] guys, so I grabbed the wet n wild  photo focus foundation I've heard great things about this foundation like I really really have it I've heard it's amazing So I really want to try this out I grabbed the color buff bisque there was a very very low color selection at the store, so I'm like Just we're just gonna kind of trouble shoot this and just pray that it's somewhat, okay honestly This is not really my shade, but when do I match my shade? (laughs) Never bitch, never. That's that's totally enough like that is enough grabbing a beauty blender Go ahead and blend this out and see how it looks the foundation smells a little funny It's a little strong so far looking really nice. Oh my gosh, okay living. God the smell is so strong though It smells like fucking paint What? Coverage is like a medium to fullish coverage fullish it has a slight sheen to it, but it's not like Dewy by any means to me it looks more on the matte side. It's more of a Satin finish? okay but on a real level like I'm really impressed this shit is six bucks I can see that's getting a little bit darker on my skin as it's oxidizing My neck is definitely a different color than my face luckily I have powder that I can kind of put down there Hopefully, it'll match honestly it set so fast though. I was like like I was [shooken], how fast it set I had no idea it was going to set this quickly, but honesty I'm really not mad at it I think it's really pretty I think the coverage is really pretty and I'm actually really excited to keep trying this out because it looks really nice. What is next? Let's go with some concealer I bought this one. This is [the] photo focus concealer. I grabbed it in the lightest shade. This is in the shade Ivory light I struggle with getting product out of Applicators like this I had to dip in. Maybe like three times per I it's like okay I didn't realize we were doing all that, but we're getting there we're getting there Okay, the color is nice It's nice and light it'll really highlight me I think Dude this color is really oxidizing on me. Am I tripping? Or is it oxidizing as fuck Okay, blend the concealer. Hey, that's looking really nice Guys look a nice though awww that looks so pretty. Okay cool I'm into that. This stuff sets so quickly I'm like what the fuck is in here. Glue? oh my God I have to like fucking hurry [ok] now to set the entire face in place. I rhymed. I'm Dr. Seuss. I'm taking the photo finish Pressed powder. This is [the] shade right here. I grabbed in the shade buff Take a little bit on put that underneath the eyes to set my under eye concealer Please don't change the color please I know it's a little darker than me, but please and we're actually put that all over the face With this little wet and wild Kabuki brush so far the color selection that I chose is uh Not my color. It is not my color. So I'm actually gonna grab my darker shade I grabbed two [be]cause it's gonna be like my bronzery shade I wanted to use it as a bronzer put that down the neck trying to match up my uh? My neck to my face I suppose so I don't you guys know this I'm sure you guys have noticed it before but here I have discoloration on my neck. I don't really know why It's like just dark here. It's like there's just like a darkness there. It's almost as if someone like choked me out It's so weird [like] I don't know why I have it, but I just have discoloration there I wonder has anything to with my vitiligo but I don't think it does [be]cause it's dark So now I'm gonna take a little bit of that same tan color I'm just gonna put a little bit on like the right here on the perimeters of my face. Honestly I hate this brush I I hate it  why do I even use this I don't know. This tan color though is actually so fucking pretty as a bronzer, holy shit. Oh my God I'm a fucking idiot I'm a fucking idiot What I could have done is I could use this thing to put underneath my eyes to set my under eyes But I forgot I had it. You guys I'm gonna take this wet wild highlighting and contouring Palette. I'm gonna take the lightest shade And put that underneath my eyes just to brighten up everything again. It's gonna Brighten it up? Oh it is oh it is Come on, son, and also. This is in the shade Dulce de Leche no, [okay]? Let's try the darker color right here. The contour shade on my trusty Morphe Y9 best contour brush I've ever gotten it's so amazing. I'm just saying And put that into the contour areas you know that looks It's a little more warm than I would go for a contour shade honestly, it's not as cool toned as I was Thinking it was going to be but honestly it's not bad. That's not bad at all ok guys. So we b.. Ok this just fell out of this. I just want to talk about this this just fell out of this I would love to know Who on this Earth? Is going to use this motherfucker right here this little thing for their cheeks ok guys So I'm gonna grab the shade pearlescent pink on my Morphe E4 and I'll put that into my blushy areas and see how this looks Ok ok that's such a beautiful ass color. What the fuck and it's blending so easily wait I've never tried [wet] [and] [wild] blushes before are we on to something here or mommy's slightly Shook a little [okay] guys, so the only highlighter that they had at the store was this one. This is in the shade crown of my canopy That's not a shade. That's not the shade Crown of my canopy. That's the name of this crown of my canopy Ok crown of my canopy then. This is the color right here It's not really a bright highlighting color It's just they did not have one at the store, so I'm like fuck man And I don't have any of the other highlighters here I have him back at my house in like San Diego, so I'm like okay well I'm just gonna use crown with my canopy on this Morphe 12 brush oh ok I see it I see it. it's like a pinkish Like a pinky highlighter. It's such a beautiful color. It's not blinding or anything. This is actually more solid blush topper like if I could I would go in with a lighter color. [be]cause this is a little dark for me But it honestly looks so beautiful [I'm] not mad. So I also grabbed this little palette. This is the color icon Comfort Zone, Palette and I wanted just to grab this brow bone color because it looks like a light champagne tone So I'm gonna grab a little bit of that and put that on the top of my highlight I think? Just to see if it'll give me a more of a brighter. Yeah Oh yeah, that worked great ok guys so so far. This is the face honestly, and I'm not mad at it What so ever Let's move onto the brows and the eyes. Okay you guys so I got this little ultimate brow kit by wet and wild and I'm going With the brows on this this is in the shade ash brown, so this is what the little kit looks like Obviously this looks a lot lighter than my tone. Oh, it comes with a little tweezer so guys what we're gonna Do now is gonna fill in our brows using this thing is getting like this is such a cheap little thing let's just What's going with the slightest brownish ash color right here I want to fill in the beginning part of my brows with that just to see if it would actually fill in at all because It's so light Way way too light, so we're gonna go in with the Darker Brown. Pray that the Darker Brown... Oh yeah much better. I just I have to go with the Darker Brown. There's no way in fucking hell I've been filled in my brows with powder in so long. I'm like this is so weird to me. Fill in your shape Whatever shape you want to do. Oh, I guess we're going thickems today, okay? I'm gonna go finish the other brow off of camera, and I'll be right back. okay guys the brows are on, they're a little bold they're little intense and they're a little dark, but with what I have this is all I can really do right now, so don't judge me too hard P.s. I already underlined them with concealer underneath the bottom to really sharpen them up, but now that we're done with the brows I'm gonna go ahead and finish off with the eyes now I'm just gonna take that same concealer that we use the photo focus concealer And I'm gonna use it as my eye primer [be]cause the concealer worked really nicely underneath my eyes Didn't increase a lot. It's still not really creasing that much and it gave me a nice coverage So I thought why not try it on the lids as well. Oh Amazing so now with that same Kabuki brush. Just gonna literally press over with whatever powder We have left to set the concealer in place, okay guys, so I grabbed this palette This is the Au Natural Palette in the shade nude awakening So I don't really ever really use a lot of drug store palettes things like that I've heard just terrible things about literally all of them that are made. Oh, I should definitely use this brush that it came with definitely this this what the palate looks like right here has a lot of uh Colors in it I guess. Let's swatch a couple well, that's a the chunkiest Shadow I've ever swatched in my life so I'm gonna go in with this really pretty neutral color right here on a morphe E27 a blending brush That's gonna go right into the crease honey and I mean so far the color is going on. It's blending I don't hate. taking this maroon shade. That's pigmented though that that's really that's pigmented oh yeah. Oh yeah, shit That was much more pigmented than I thought It was going to be because the last color was not as crazy. So we're gonna try to blend Child please. We have that nice Purpley color down much more pigmented than I thought I was gonna be truly and not trying to be a bitch But I was gonna be shit, [okay] So I think I'm gonna do is I want to cut that crease taking the same concealer we're taking that on a Morphe M41 Best Detail lining type brush for me. I just love this one so much you guys I've talked about this so many times I'm just going to carve out. I'm talking like a fool like a full fucking cut crease like a full moment nice Okay guys, so this is what I have so far. Okay guys So if you constantly add that purple and just build it and build it and build it With a small detail brush this one is the Morphe E36 I just keep building up that color you will get something like this. Just an easy casual cut crease with the perps Looking good because of the concealer is there it's kind of creasing a little bit so we want to really set that quickly Actually, I'm actually Gonna Take that same Highlighting shade that we put underneath our eyes and we're actually gonna put that on to the eyes to avoid everything from creasing just set everything in place if you have lids like me you can thank your lids creasing and uh Folding over so easily and this is what we should have so far Hell yeah, bitch it's looking fucking pretty bitch Yeah, bitch (laughs) I'm just kidding Let's do some eyeliner pero eyeliner. So I grabbed the wet n wild mega liner this is a liquid eyeliner and it is a felt-tip, fuck I hate felt-tip. I always use brush tips, but it's fine ok it's black as fuck. That's awesome. Oh god Be careful so let's do a wing Ok guys, this is what we have so far cute little cut crease moment OTaking that same loan natural palette taking that brow bone and I'm actually gonna put on the brow bone this time for real Just gonna highlight the brow bone a little bit. Okay guys this is what we should have at the top of the eye. looking It's looking cute, It's looking good Cool. I'm gonna finish the other eye off of camera And I'll be right ok guys so due to the fact that the applicator is not the applicator I'm used to. The liner just kept getting bigger and bigger and thicker. So we have the top of the eye completely done I'm basically done. This is what I want it to be i'm gonna just keep it at that So what we're gonna do is we're gonna take this nude liner pencil kohl it's like a kohl pencil this is the biggest pencil I've ever tried fucking what is this a fucking nine incher here, and we're gonna run that nude underneath Our water line and now what we're gonna do is we're gonna blend a little bit of that contour shade underneath the lashes So it doesn't look like there's like literally nothing there? So let's take some Mascara. This is a new Mascara I believe that they just came out with this is the renegade Mascara lash the fucking packaging is so sick. It's like a diamondy Weird as heck like package which I love you know I like live for some weird if it's a weird if it's some weird shit i'm down ok so this is the applicator It has like a little weird ball at the end of it. okay lashes are curled and now I'm gonna be taking the renegade Lash Mascara I just love this component I really really do think it's so fucking sick nasty like I can't get over it we're gonna use this Mascara It's supposed [to] give length and volume but I think It did definitely give [me] a length and volume I'm just not like really in love love love with it, but we're gonna just put it on ok great So I have some lashes on right now I'm wearing some bellas by nubounsom you guys already known this is the homegirl lash for real This is the homegirl lash Finally we're on to the lip. I bought three of their liquid lipsticks. I didn't know which one. I wanted to try out I'm thinking I'm gonna go with this Berry one cuz it's very like monochromatic And I heard these are great. So I want to try this out. So it's funny How this is the exact same packaging as Jeffree's packaging coincidence? who really knows? I'm gonna put on the shade berry recognized. Let's try this Pleasantly surprised with pigmentation great let's turn into pink That's what two layers. Two layers to get full opacity for five bucks This is amazing, and that's it you guys That's it for the entire video using all wet n wild products a lot of this is a first impressions I've literally never tried so many different things, but I'm honestly so beyond impressed with everything so far I don't think that my face looks bad whatsoever. I don't think it looks like drugstore I think it just looks really really pretty the only thing I was like somewhat disappointed in was the shadows But the shadows were not that bad. it's just in comparison to everything else I was actually really really nice and good on me The Shadows we're my least favorite thing, but honestly like the face turned out really nicely and I'm not mad at it whatsoever I hope you guys enjoyed this video Let me know if you guys want me to do more of these videos these full face using one brand videos like a first impressions Or just trying things out for the first time or whatever it may be I love doing these videos. They're so fun They're really random and really fun, and they're kind of a challenge sometimes But I think [that's] what makes it so much more fun And I'm doing with the drugstore brand you know the last one I did was with Maybelline and I had fun doing that one being that it was a drugstore I knows much more attainable, and wet n wild is another brand. That's much more attainable as well and if there's any other brand they guys want me to do a full face of let me know in the comments bar below and Like this video if you guys want me to continue this series. Yeah, I think that's it I Love you guys so much Have a great so the night or day where you guys are and I'll catch you guys in my next video. Bye you guys what? Do I do?
