hello everybody you may notice I have a little Christmas tree yeah I figured it's getting to that time of the year other people have done it so I've started decorating for Christmas what can I say I just love it too much this is actually in my upstairs kind of office area and this is my rainbow tree which I'm really happy about it's got multicolored lights and it has these pump like colored pom-poms and then these tiny little brightly colored bubbles and I think it's one of my favorite Christmas trees I've ever had just because it makes me smile every time I look at it moving on up from Christmas trees I'm doing a video today that I haven't done in a while but it is something that you guys love to see and it's something that I quite like to keep updating not that it ever really changes that much and it is eight watts in my bag as you can see this is my zoella lifestyle but or rucksack I'm obsessed with it I basically created a bag that was my perfect bag and hence why I've been using it and loving it because I'm essentially designed it exactly how I wanted it for any of you that are interested in this bag you can get it from boots and it also comes with a travel mug and a little key ring inside it as well but I don't have those things in here it's not real leather it's faux leather and it's just really like squishy and that's exactly what I wanted it to be like so I'm very happy about that a lot of people like it doesn't have a popper and actually that was a decision that I made like that was like a conscious choice because I just think the popper made it look but no less cool and I quite like that the way that you shut it is with the drawstring and it is it is really sturdy as well so yeah that is the actual bag bin a self promo there it's just gonna be done as a nut and do the little drawstring open it up now because this literally can fit everything I do like to call this my Mary Poppins bag because it is essentially a bucket bag it does mean I've accumulated a lot of things I probably don't need in here but I have in here and I'm gonna share them with you okay so the first thing I'm going to pull out is my purse this is actually a mulberry purse Alfie bought this for me as a present last Christmas the Christmas before I don't remember maybe it was my birthday Alfie bought me this and I have a grand total of 25 pounds cash look one of the new five-pound notes this is my first new five pound note treat myself to something will that I very rarely have cash I'm one of these people that just never has any so I just have my bank cards my boots card what's that Oh a river island card my driver's license for a loyalty card oh my old rail card I can't use this anymore it ran out in July this year gone are the days I can use a 16 to 25 rail card now I know I was 25 quite a while ago but if you get these at the right time they sort of last until you're 26 I have one receipt for the place where I get my brows done for 40 pounds that must have been for me and pops got a quarter dollar in here don't know why maybe I thought it was a Tempe next I have some sunglasses these are a gentle monster I bought these in Edinburgh recently in Harvey Nicks however I don't believe these are actually the gentle monster sunglasses in here no they're ray bands although it's been getting a little bit more cold and dreary the Sun is still out which makes me very happy because that's my favourite type of winter and autumn weather when it's cold brisk and sunny I think one of my least favorite things about sunglasses cases is when they're really big and bulky and yes they protect your sunglasses and their heart doing the big kind of hard ones but they take up so much room in your handbag so I really like using this one which is why I think I probably got my ray-bans in there no idea where these actual sunglasses are though just slightly worried I have my phone this is the iPhone 7 plus oh I've got a new what's up from poppy days I feel like this is just the normal Gold not the rose gold I was a little bit disappointed with the shade of the rose gold I think this is feels more rose gold II personally and I think that's the normal gold but yeah that's my phone all I need to change my background it says happy Halloween bin and gonna leave my Christmas background on there now I have this this is my Christmas pen that I bought from Tiger when I write with it it drives everyone around me crazy because all you can hear is this is this not just the most festive pen you've ever seen like you just you can't be sad when you're writing with this I just love it chewing gum and if any of you are wondering because I know it's right up there on the top of your list of things you desperately want to know about me I like the Wrigley's extra white that's my preferred chewing gum however it's not that strong and it is one that you have to kind of throw away quite quickly but that's the one I like and I always buy these tubs because the little ones just don't last two minutes hello that's my Chuy's of choice oh I've got my vlogging camera in here this is the canon g7x mark 2 this is what I use to vlog on I don't think I've ever said that anywhere and actually I do get asked that quite a lot so apologies for never answering that for those of you that wondered but yeah I couldn't use another camera to vlog on that isn't a Canon anymore I find the quality a lot better I do find the wear and tear is not so great on a Canon like they don't last as long as you would hope for the price like this screen is coming loose on the back here but the quality is like the best so canon g7x mark ii this little fluffy bit on the top alfie stuck on stuck this on here it's a micro muff because when you're vlogging outside and it's windy which it is 99% of the time in Brighton you won't be able to hear anything unless you have this on it actually does work as well so if you live in a Windy City then you might need one of these if you're planning on doing some little follow me around blogs but yeah I love it I really love it it goes everywhere with me headphones probably not the most like handbag friendly headphones to be fair but these are the ones I had in there these are Bowers and Wilkins I've had these for a really long time I have some friends ones which are cream and rose gold and they look beautiful like I love them if I'm using them for a short amount of time if I'm editing a video and I have those on it really hurts my ears because it doesn't quite sit on them very comfortably these ones are a lot more comfortable ooh there's so much like foundation on here yeah I should probably clean that anyway I mean I'm not really a headphones expert so I couldn't tell you more than that sorry the next thing I have in here which looks like a really cool little device is HP sprocket now this thing I have been obsessed with over the last month every time someone comes around I get this out and I show them what it does this is essentially a printer and this is all you need that is why it is in my handbag because I've basically become attached to it it prints your photos from your social media and your camera roll and all you have to do is turn it on I'll show you I'll give you a demo get your phone you download the app for free and then you can scroll through your camera roll and you literally select any photo which one should go for I'm going to print this picture of me turn on Naomi okay and then because the app so cool it gives you the option to edit the photo so generally I like to per frame on but you can also do text you can put little stickers on you can put filters on it it's so cool everybody I've shown this to has been like oh my god this would honestly be the perfect gift for Christmas I genuinely like to carry this with me because I like to print off the photos and get either give them to whoever I'm with at the time or if I've taken a really lovely photo I like to print off and pin it up on my I don't know if you've ever seen my little board that I have in my office with all those photos on I've started filling it with pictures from my camera roll that I've never been able to print before once you've decided how you want your picture tick yes tick yes again and by the power of Bluetooth it comes out of this it's printing the paper is actually sticky so you can use it as stickers or you can just use it to pin up or whatever you want to do with it and it's called Zink so it's zero ink it's so clever when I showed my mum she was like how do you put the ink in it like where does the ink go and I was like you don't need ink it's just genius and you just charge it with a USB look I just think this is the coolest little gadget I have ever received I love it I genuinely love this I'm going to actually buy a couple for some friends for Christmas because it's also a really lovely gift and it is the sort of thing that I genuinely use and I think a lot of people were genuinely use because what because sometimes I take pictures on my phone and that's it they don't really go anywhere so it's nice to be able to print all the ones I really really like okay what else have I got in here I have got my notebook this is a really cool notebook actually I found this really useful this is mishmash and it's like I don't know how to explain this it doesn't have like an outer shell there's probably a better word for it but and it's in like sections so you can divide up anything that you're doing so I'm currently planning all my December videos and blog posts and content in this and I found it really useful having the different colors for the different sections but I generally don't go anywhere without a notebook oh I can stick this on the I'm going to stick my picture on oh I love it okay what else do we haven't yet this this is quite random but well is it I don't really know we went listening more recently to see a film call a monster calls which can I just say I mean it's out next year but it's probably up there with one of the most heartbreaking touching films I have seen in a really long time if you go and see that film it was also one of the books in my book club if you go and see it take tissues out of everyone that was in that cinema two people didn't cry anyway Lois the cinema and I went for a cheeky little picnics I never get pick a mix at the cinema I always think oh I have to get popcorn and a Fanta rice blast because they're amazing but I never get pick a mix so this time I did and then they're just in my handbag because I'm still like snacking on them I went a bit overboard because I put like heavy things like this in sea as a child I knew never to put these in because they made it so much more expensive those are the things that are heavy on a pick-and-mix lifehacks I have a random a mini colour-pop liquid lipstick in the bottom I believe this is the shade Bianca which I basically lived in through the summer but I don't know because it's all rubbed off then I have these two bags in here because I otherwise things get a bit lost in there I can pop that down now please actually come another little bit of self promo but when you design and make your own products generally you love them a lot so I do actually use them shock horror I love my own products and use my own products these come in a set of three bags and you get these in superdrug this one is my favorite one because it's copper glitter but it's not like it doesn't feel glittery it's still very smooth and it's also a really good size so in here I have oh I feel like this video is so like zoella I didn't mean this got like I don't mean this guy's I just genuinely have all this my handbag so are the hand cream this is the gingerbread hand cream been using it since July love it I have some nurofen cold and flu relief because you never know when you're gonna get struck with a cold or a flu or this is a liquid lipstick I've really been loving recently this is the Tarte Tartus lip paint in the color bestie I love this it's in a favorites coming soon so I'm not going to talk too much about it I also have my Clarins lip oil which is looking a little bit worse for wear I should probably buy another one it's very sticky actually looks like honey let me just smell it though love that smell well sweet got an error ooh a Bath &amp; Body Works marshmallow pumpkin latte this is just I out there I actually think this is probably my favorite bath and Bodyworks scent everyone likes clean hands I feel like I've said that in all my um what's in my handbag videos a glittery hair bauble I always have to carry these around with me do you know I really like these hair bands what I called scrunchies I like these because if I put my hair in a ponytail like I have now with like a tight one my hair kinks so badly and because I've got short hair it kinks in all the wrong places um so generally I like to use a scrunchie because less kinkajou and I also have my mini bake my day fragrance because I'm basically trying to make the most of the gingerbread scent during the Christmas period although I mean I'm not against spraying this in January and February but whilst I'm kind of getting in the mood for Christmas it does make sense so been spritzing that this one says throw kindness around like confetti and it's in like this nice like oh what's this material called canvas e style I don't actually know what's in here oh okay we have some more zinc paper for the HP sprocket we have a Kiley matte liquid lipstick in the shade which I have on today a sharpie I have a memory card reader because I have an 11 inch MacBook Air which has nowhere to put memory cards so I have to use this in order to transfer my footage which actually is a little bit annoying because if I'm out and about and I don't have one of these I can't do anything from my card so generally I have like one or two or maybe even sometimes three of these in my handbag better to be prepared then I've got a normal bobby bobby pin nope what's this hair bobble and the spare battery for vlogging I might put my sprocket back in there actually cuz then it stays nice and clean do you know I think that is everything in my bag and for once there's no like dirty crummy bits in the bottom of my handbag which I'm really happy about because normally that does happen I really hope you enjoyed this video I will leave a link below to anything that I can in case any of you guys want to get any of the bits I mentioned I hope you are having a lovely week so far there's not long now until 24 days of zoella starts I'm very very excited make sure you are subscribed or you've hit the little notification bell that's just down here somewhere give video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it I love you very much and I will see you very very soon bye 
[Music] looks like I'm wearing black lipstick it's actually dark purple hello everybody so for today's video I wanted to do something a little bit different a little bit more relaxed I wanted to use this day before the 24th so the 23rd to just sit down and chat with you about the year and just to say thank you really because I'd scheduled quite a lot of these Christmassy videos and I did this last year and I remember thinking before it was Christmas I'd already pre filmed a video and I hadn't really said Merry Christmas or you know have a great day or you know have a great new year or anything it was just kind of a video of me and Jo that we do every year on Christmas Eve but I didn't really get to chat to you so that's what I wanted to do in today's video I feel like 2016 went by so quickly I feel like I blinked and it went it's been an incredible year for so many different things but it's also been a deeply saddening year in other areas but I am so optimistic and happy and I feel so positive about 2017 I've already made a list of things I would like to achieve or I would like to work on and I thought would be nice to start the conversation off in the comments of this video discussing all the things you want to work on change or start doing in 2017 quite a lot of the time I find New Year's resolutions really difficult to stick to because I set the bar really high and before I know it I failed it already I don't really ever set big goals they're always very little and most of them are personal goal because I'm quite happy with all the big projects I've worked on I've done so many amazing things this year I'm so so lucky I've done some incredible shoots I've met some incredibly creative people that have really inspired me and motivated me and I've gotten to meet so many of you guys out and about which is always so lovely and I've also got to bring out new product ranges and my book got released and me and Joe work together on something which is so nice because obviously we're both in this together but quite a lot of the time it's very individual and that's the same for me and Alfie and me and all my friends you know we all do this and it's also fun but it's always very like you kind of work on your own stuff so it was really nice to get to do the sub life merch with Joe that was like one of my highlights there's just been so many great things um in the kind of zoella category that I've been really happy with but I always struggle to think of goals within that category because with what I do it's so unpredictable you know there's so many things that just come out of nowhere and so many crazy opportunities and different projects but I mean even two years ago I would never have even thought these things would be where they are so it's really hard to set myself those kind of goals and I feel quite happy and content with where everything is at the moment so for me 2017 is working on me I've decided to call it a year of self-love which raised a few eyebrows whenever I mentioned it to anyone because they were like that sounds like something completely different which I get but that's not the vibram going down that's not what I'm trying to say basically I want to take the time to focus on me more because I feel like the year went so quickly I didn't really focus on myself as much as I would have liked I also want to travel a little bit more and you know focus on friendships relationships and really make it like a year of Zoe do you know what I mean yeah just a year of me I'm gonna be so selfish I'm not gonna be that selfish but I'm gonna allow myself more time for myself so that is what I felt myself I'm gonna do I feel like in 2016 I really grew in terms of not giving a crap it's so difficult within this industry I guess industry I still feel like it's a hobby but there you go it's quite hard to feel really confident in every decision you make every video you upload every blog post you put up you want to be a hundred percent happy with everything you do well I do personally because I'm such a creative perfectionist and it's so easy to listen to the people whispering in your ear you've got to be doing this and for a while I feel like those little kind of whisperings took over and when I went away out on holiday to Mykonos I made a vlog when I got back and I was like I'm just not going to care anymore I'm not going to care if my vlog is 30 minutes or it has nothing interesting in it I'm not going to care if I've if I've had the most boring day and that's what I chose to upload I just want to be happy with everything I post and I am and I can be 100% confident and happy when I say that when I hit publish on a blog post or tweet and Instagram a video I want it to be published and I think that has really improved my confidence it's improved my overall well-being and happiness and I think ultimately that also helps me to create things I really love and that for me I think has been one of the biggest things of 2016 is just not caring anymore I'm just staying true to myself doing what I want to do saying what I want to say you know it's like it's so easy to feel suffocated by the things people are telling you you should be doing just that them away and I'm hoping to carry that on into 2017 with any other projects or kind of creative things that I choose to do whether that's a vlog of me sitting in my pajamas for half the day or whether that's a really cool photo shoot that I do with someone you never know I don't generally get very excited for a new year I don't know why I think it's just kind of like another year over here we go again what's this year gonna be I feel like I'm not that optimistic when it comes to like the new year because I feel like I have no control I don't know what I'm doing but this year is different because I have got organized I've scheduled my time I planned more I've given myself certain days to certain things I'm basically getting my art in gear and getting motivated and organized and scheduled and I think that is going to make a huge difference to how I spend my day and how I run like my business side of things and any of my free time I just think it's going to be really great there's already a lot of exciting things for next year in the pipeline which I can't wait to share with you guys but the purpose of this video was mostly just to get chatting about things that you really want to achieve next year for me to give you a little bit of a confidence booster sometimes resolutions are made to be broken but it doesn't matter as long as everyone is trying doing things they love make the most of it because it goes so flippin quickly I also just want to take this opportunity in this video to say thank you so much just for being the best viewers the best readers the best supporters you guys are such a massively positive influence on my life you keep me motivated you're so inspiring I love meeting you I love hearing your stories and you guys are what make me get up every day and make these videos and I love doing it so thank you so much for being there whether you've been there for two weeks or you've been there for the whole seven years I love you all very very much and I really do want the best for all of you I want you to have an amazing Christmas whether you celebrate it or not I want you to have a lovely day I'd also like to wish you all a very very happy new year make it what you want to roll with it there's going to be highs there's going to be lows but we're all in this together and I'm so excited for it enjoy the video tomorrow with Joe is really quite funny and I will see you in the new year don't freak out if I don't upload a video for a couple of weeks the sort of Christmas in January that time is where I like to completely like D come like decompress the year get back onto schedule clear my head after filming two videos a day I will see you in January with lots more exciting things I can't wait thank you so much for supporting me and sticking by me it really does mean the absolute world to me bye guys [Music] 
hello everybody I'll actually let me keep my mic plugged in because I've done that before and that's a bloody ball like hi so in today's video I thought it would be nice - oh god it's given a videos where the Sun comes in goes away again gonna drive me crazy why are you doing this no okay it's going no it's not it nothing wrong ago I did a video called questions have never answered or something like that and you guys loved it I love filming it and I did say I was going to do a part two to get more part two time first question is from Rebecca who said would you still be youtuber if it wasn't your job and you didn't get paid for it and the answer to that question is very simply yes I would still be making videos if it wasn't my job I wouldn't get paid because for a really long time that is what I did it for I have previous jobs whilst I started doing YouTube and I was getting paid no money for YouTube at all and I still enjoyed it just as much as I enjoy it now so I know for sure if they took away any chance of making money from views or I don't know I lost 11 million subscribers I would still make videos because I still really enjoy it the fact that I'm able to make money from it is a huge huge bonus but that's not what drives me to make videos just says if you had gone to uni what would you have studied this was a little bit difficult because I was a very lost teen I did not know what I wanted to do there was a lot of areas I enjoyed in school and there were a lot of subjects that I liked ie photography art and textiles I felt a bit lost because the things I enjoyed very creative and I didn't feel as though I knew the different pathways I could go with those creative kind of loves of mine it was almost like okay like textiles does that mean I have to be a fashion designer if I like photography I have to be a photographer I guess that could just been my lack of research or possibly just lack of career advice in school I'm not really sure I just personally felt very lost being a creative person and not knowing exactly what I wanted to do within those creative fields I did actually go to a couple of interviews for with it up or textiles I feel like it was art I can't actually remember maybe it was textiles I think it was fashion design or something and I went to the interviews and it was actually any interview that I realized I didn't want to do fashion design basically in the interview they were like tell us why you would be great here and why you are so passionate about this I struggled and I was like I don't really know if I am I just feel like I've been like cornered into this direction and that was like the biggest opener because in that interview I realized a uni was not for me and B I didn't know what I wanted to do which was one of the biggest reasons uni wasn't for me because I was like if I don't know what I want to do there's no point going to uni and racking up like a huge student loans that I will need to pay off in the career I have no idea what what is going to be so to answer your question Jeff I don't know if I continue what I would have studied because I never really got to that point I thought I did but isn't things I do enjoy are interior design which I did go on to an apprenticeship with instead of going to uni alright it would have definitely been a creative subject I just wish I had researched more into different areas of both creative subjects oh no there's someone at the bloody door so in a QA Charlie said do you feel that sometimes you want to live a life without YouTube and Fame or otherwise the really short answer to this is yes sometimes I would like to live that life but so deep and complex and the Sun is so bright damn it like I said in my other video if this is such a strange topic I was actually talking to my friend about this the other day and I feel ungrateful ever saying I don't enjoy the perks that have come with what I do it makes me feel ungrateful and I can't help that and I know there will be so many people that say of course you're allowed to have days where you don't enjoy being stopped or of course your ads have days are you if people turn up at your house and ask for selfies and like of course you're allowed to feel those things because you never knew they would happen to you but I still hate saying them out of my mouth I hate people thinking I'm ungrateful because I am eternally grateful for everything that has come out of doing this but of course I would be lying if I did not say that sometimes I wish it was slightly different I don't know if I'm having like an off day and I just wish my life was different for that day or something happens and I'm like this is a result of what I do I wish that didn't happen but of course I would never change anything I would never change how this journey has happened or any of the like amazingly positive happy experiences and things have been able to do but of course there are days where I struggle with it and yeah a couple of years ago I actually very nearly stopped like altogether stopped I don't think anyone would have guessed it because I still flogged and I wasn't logging I was probably an hour be flogged to see films every day and I really struggled like really really struggled it was the lowest point yes like one of the lowest points my entire life and it wasn't about this whole thing it was more about me not feeling like I could handle it all that I was worthy of it or and like the pressure of everything just got so much like I was put on this pedestal and reminded daily that I was a role model and you shouldn't do that and you should be saying this and you should do that and all those things can feel so suffocating that I nearly stopped I was just like in fact my manager was like it's your call do you want to pull the plug and I was like I need to think about it and that crazy to me that I was that close to stopping this because I wanted to just be Zoe I think in that moment I got so suffocated by everything that was going on and you know I'm I really cut out for this like I'm quite a I'm a small girl from a little village and all of a sudden it's just like wow this is a lot and I said no to everything I didn't want to do anything anymore and I kind of like retreated a bit and that wasn't that was hard because I love doing this so much but it would like the more I was doing it the more followers I got the more everything - more and more and more and I was like I genuinely just woke up and was like I don't want to have this may subscribers I want to go back to having like 1 million 1 million was such a comfy cozy like that's also ridiculous because to some people they could only ever dream of having a million subscribers but it was like I was my subscribers are growing and growing growing and that terrified me because I was like if my life is already a little bit more crazy than I can handle at this many what's it going to be like if it's carried on growing and I would just be like I just wish I had a million again like I just want like a safe number um obviously now my my head space is completely different but yeah I don't anyone to like to judge me for that because I remember so many people that's like oh it's not hard it's not hard and yes always going to be people that think how can you have felt like that you know like and I get that and there's nothing you can say to those people because they will always think that way but if you were living as me through that time I think that's the only way you could have ever known what it was really like I don't even think like my friends and family really knew because it was all in my head was one really cool thing that did come out of that though was that I when I was at this point where I was struggling with the like Fame stuff I hate the word Fame and like famous but when I was struggling with that stuff um Cameron Diaz actually Skyped me hey I'm just filming and that is something I've never shared before but it was such a huge help she Skyped me for like an hour and a half and we just talked and she like coached me she basically gave me the best tips that I have carried with me in order to get back to a good place I think and also just to put some perspective on it all like it is weird being well-known it's weird it's not something that you can learn anywhere so to have her give up some of her time to speak to me meant the world to me and she is honestly one of just the loveliest people in the world and now I am much more confident I'm much more happy and much more settled I feel like my mind haven't quite caught up with the speed everything was happening but now I feel like I'm there we're matched and I've learned not to really care anymore you know it's my life I can choose to live it how I want to live it if you're another content creator and you're struggling with like being stopped in the street or like being well-known hit me up because I actually have learnt a lot of thing does that make me sound really like bit headed I don't think so I think I've just like experienced it so I could share my like I can share my journey I guess and that might help other people because just like Cameron did with me I feel like I might be would help other people if they were experiencing that also I don't know I think it's nice to share that experience and knowledge because it's not something you can really Google that was a really long answer I'm sorry Whitney said what's your blood type do you know I don't know should you know what your blood type is mum dad she want to protect it I probably should know that I'm just filming the Q&amp;A ah I've had the most amount of distractions in this video all right so you just trying to yourself my what do I ever just fit in trust myself adoring Jasper said do you ever regret doing things off YouTube like books speech protocol etc have you ever felt that you've lost focus on YouTube I do not regret doing those things because some of those things have been the most exciting big projects it's quite nice to have things to work on like ongoing things to work on with like deadlines and big like releases and things that I'm able to also share with people offline do you know I mean I quite like that there's that difference you know you bought the online thing and then you've got little pieces of you that you're able to share with other people and I really like that aspect those things are great because you have to be on the ball and I think those things have given me more experience and knowledge of owning a business I think those things have been read fulfilling for like my mid-20s so I've enjoyed that and I've enjoyed kind of more of the like running business side of things and like how different that is to sitting down and making a video but I don't think it's ever made me lose focus of YouTube YouTube is always like my fun kind of thing I enjoy this but this doesn't feel like work to me sitting down so in this video for you guys does not feel like work it doesn't feel like a business venture it's just fun but it does mean sometimes my schedule is crazier because I have other things we were working on and those things take up a lot more time than I ever thought they would and that might mean there's like less logs sometimes or more logs in some cases because I get to like film those things and share them with you but I think finding a balance is quite difficult but I love doing all of it so that's the only route finding a balance was the only option how does Alfie help you through your anxiety and if you had any exes who are exceptionally supportive or dismissive of your anxiety and that was by circulant I'll be very supportive with my anxiety thank goodness but I have have exes who were not at all and that is very difficult I think having something like anxiety is always difficult for someone who you are the closest with whether that is a friend or a family member or your partner it's always hard on them because they're the ones that see it at its worst and they can't do anything apart from show their support in a way that you would like them to you can give them helpful advice on what they can do to help you which is something I never did before I just thought well they should know how to help and it's like all my would day unless they actually have anxiety themselves and in a lot of cases anxiety is so different for everyone there will be no one that experiences my anxiety exactly how I experience it anywhere else in the world it will always be slightly different it might be about the same thing but it will vary and so how can you ever expect someone else to know actually what to do unless you tell them I think if someone genuinely care about you they will want to do anything they can to help you and that's the difference between Alfie and some of my eggs I think it was a hindrance for some it was annoying it was like all right why have you left the pump I don't understand why why can't you come with me to this and it's for some people is very hard to grasp and that's just a general thing with mental health some people just can't understand mental health or they can't understand why anyone would feel that way which I think must be a lovely position to be in because it means they've never experienced it in any form and that's great but I think it is important for people to open their minds slightly I think and be a little more empathetic sympathetic towards how other people might struggle with something sometimes and generally speaking everyone around me now is a very supportive I've got mr. Cole who's that from how do you actually deal with things like bitchy people etc like how do you go about rising above it I actually did see Louise tweet a quote which is one of my favorite quotes I have seen it somewhere before but she's reminded me because she literally tweeted it yesterday and I feel like this is the best thing to reply to this I'm not going to lie it took me a good five years to not care about what people said about me and it's human nature to see one horrible thing that's been said about you and to really think about that but you just have to focus on the positive and I know I sort of stopped caring about what people said but I can read it and it just it doesn't like it doesn't affect me in the same way because I'm so aware there are so many people in this world and so many different life manuals which is something my therapist actually told me about the everyone's have a different life manual and we all and in our life manuals and things we have grown up knowing things we've experienced religions certain opinions on things and everyone's is different and sometimes you're going to meet someone who has such a different manual to you that it's like you it doesn't even come like compute you're just like hair but that's because that's them speaking from what they know I thought I dunno that's really helped me because it doesn't mean that evil people it doesn't mean they're horrible it just means they think differently to you and that's not necessarily awful it's just that's the way their mind work and actually I don't know them and I'm never going to meet them and they don't know me really they've seen my videos maybe or they've watched one or they've seen a tweet and they've made a judgement but they don't really know me and therefore I don't attach that same feelings towards a negative tweet or comment anymore I don't know it's the nicest thing it's like we make against the tide for so long and then all of a sudden Sun comes out and the sea is calm and you're like oh that's weird I just don't care anymore the quote is Lions don't lose sleep over the opinions of sheep and I love that because you're a lion and those people saying things about you that don't know you or you know don't matter or sheep and that's what you have to remember I like this one Georgia said have you ever been attacked by a farm no thankfully everyone I've ever met has been super lovely Caroline said if you could ask neither one question and she would answer what would it be oh good question I no idea do you love me or Alfie more Shawna said have hi Shawna I've actually met Shauna before there's there's one fan that was lovely to me have you ever wanted to make different content but held back because of your younger viewers I love this question because everyone has this not everyone I say everyone is not mostly media and some people I think have this real misconception that my audience is all very young but it's not it's actually not my core audience is 1824 by quite a big chunk I think it can appear younger because most comment to the younger are people that use Twitter the most are younger me Cup events book signings are mostly the younger audience and I guess people that buy merch are mostly young I think the younger ones make the most noise I think that's what I'm trying to say but my core audience is 18 to 24 so with that in mind I'm so aware that my audience ranges from as young as like seven which is crazy young to like people my mum vaishu I know watch my videos or people I've met in the street you have their own children who love watching my video so it's it's too much of a broad spectrum for me to think about it when I make these videos I do not think about who is watching them in regards to age I think it becomes too difficult when you start thinking about the exact individual that could be watching and I feel like that could really change who you are and I've never wanted to do that so any video I ever make I'm making it because I want to make it I'm saying the things I want to say because I want to say them the only thing I do do is beep swear words because a because I know my mum doesn't like it I swear and be because I'm aware that there are younger people I wouldn't take the swear word out I wouldn't remove the fact I swore I would beep it just in case although the occasional one does slip through some - no documentary film a documentary I think so in short to answer your question no nothing I ever do is thinking of a certain age everything I do I do because I want to do it and I'm happy with every decision I make and I think it would be weird I would personally find it really weird to think too much about a certain age I think it would it would play on my mind I would change how I would want to say things but I'm so happy with everything I ever upload anything I ever put on a shelf everything I do I love I do it because I want to do it I don't do it with anyone specific in mind Karina said why are your earning such a secret I think in all walks of life people don't really talk about the money they earn in that like kind of openness but also I feel like it's no secret that youtubers can earn good money but it would be wrong of me to ever state how much because then for someone else you might want to keep it a bit more private it kind of gives it away I would never want to be like here's what I last year because a it just why would I why would you need to and be because there could be someone else of a similar size to my channel who might not want anyone to know and it's by me revealing that I'm then sort of revealing what they could be making and I don't know like I'm happy to talk about it with like friends and family like it's not that it's like this big thing that we're like we've been told never to do is just why would you want to I don't know we all know youtubers can earn a lot of money like I was able to buy this house which is amazing but it's not I think the media try and make it like this big thing I kind of just also point out media have never got it right there was an article out recently that says that people can get 240,000 pounds and Instagram I mean that would be great but that is not laughing also I think it's very hard to know how much money someone has because you could have millions and millions and millions of pounds but you might not spend it how would you ever know if how much anyone really earns anyway or you could have barely anything but spend it all all the time there's no way of knowing no way of guessing I think is the right way of saying that booty less Brooke said I'm very curious about how you felt in your first photo shoot were you scared or excited I would love to know scared what so scared in my first photo shoot I am NOT a model I don't know poses I don't know how to look to really like accentuate my body shape or to look good or I don't know how to pose myself to make a great photo so I don't actually remember what my first photo shoot was company magazine front cover of company marketing I was really nervous I was so anxious to do that shoot and also you're sort of letting someone else dress you in something that you wouldn't normally wear so it's not that you even feel your most confident I have been on shoots before where they've done my hair I wouldn't normally do it but I'm like this looks amazing and I feel so confident and that can really drive a shoot if you feel confident in what they put you in or how they've done your makeup or Holub in your hair it completely changes how well a shoot goes but if you're feeling really out of your comfort zones anyway and they put you in something that you would never normally wear and you're like oh I'm just not sure that could be quite difficult but if you've got a good photographer you're always feel comfortable and they will tell you the best ways to like be in order to look the best and also no one's going to ever want to use a photo of you that doesn't look good I feel like it might not be your favorite and it might not be an angle that you like but they generally know what looks good so I just kind of hoped for the best and let them do their job I do this thing where I first get on shoot I can't I like keep my hands very close to me and I'm standing in these photos with my hands like this like and then and then eventually over time the hands like come away and then I'm like work it work it joke so I still don't know what I'm doing it might look like I do but okay I think I'm going to stop there because I feel like that is so many questions and I love you rightly pointed out this is pretty much like a documentary right now or like the longest interview I've ever done huh six feature-length film literally I really hope you guys enjoyed this video and that it gave you a little bit more of an insight if there are any other questions that you feel like I've missed or something you would really love to know there was someone who said I'd love to know more about like the business side so if you have any questions about that or like products or anything then let me know and I can do either like a blog post where I can write down my answers or I can do another one of these if you really enjoy them just let me know in the comments and give you a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and I hope you're having a blended week so far and I'll see you again very soon [Music] 
do-do-do-do-do hello everybody today I'm going to be doing something you all love and something I don't do as often as I would like or as often as I used to do and that is a good old pry bar call I recently went back to Somerset and no trips back to Bristol or bass is worth doing if you're not going to stop up and stop you're if you're not going to stop off in Bristol Primark because it is the best Primark you will ever visit go without further ado I'm going to get started because it was one of those promo trips where there were far too many things I like and ended up taking out an embarrassing amount of big bag this might take a while so I'm going to start Primark homework section is really great in the moment they've got some fab like cool things that are really not that much so if any of you are looking to like do up a room or you've got a new uni dorm and you want to kind of jazz up a bit but without saying too much money check out Primark right now first thing I got with this throw this is one of those throws that got that really soft stuff on one side I don't know what that's called fleece and it's this really lovely like baby pink color and it has gold foil feathers on it it's really pretty and it wasn't even that much as 15 pounds and the size is 150 by 200 which I don't know what that is that double I'm not sure anything like baby pink right now I'm all over and it has foil feathers which I'm just obsessed with I also got this one I'm not sure I went a bit like throw crazy this is a geometric foil large throw this one's slightly bigger this is 180 by 220 very soft very nice oh I thought I got this little ball it's got a mirror on the bottom and it's got this really nice like Paisley type print on the top and it's one of those like your old jewelry style boxes that you open up whatever your heart desires in it I think I might put this on my bedside table and just put like my watch and my little things are taking off at the end of the day and then it keeps it a bit more tidy and it also means when you open and shut your bedside table like drawer doesn't all knock over because it will all be in there two candles I like Taylor candles I've got to like pillar candle candle holders downstairs so I needed some new candles for that this is the sea salt and lavender candle I wasn't too sure what sea salt and lavender would smell like turns out it smells amazing it's really fresh and light and I also liked that they were nice color gray I picked up three dark gray luxury face cloths because I use flannels every day to take off my makeup and cleanse my face so I thought it would be nice to get some new ones because I'm constantly using them and some of mine are looking a little bit worse so we're and I feel like if you get dark grey they never look dirty so what's the dark gray about quite a few cushions because they look amazing we have this whole like leaf print thing going on it's not very tropical and I was digging it so I picked up like all the cushions from that section this one is probably my favorite one has tiny little pink pom poms all the way around it and on this side it's like blue and pink the opposite way and on this side it's blue and pink but with leave why can't I speak I was only five pounds bojong I also picked up this one which also have leads on it I love the whole like navy blue and green thing I think these colors go very nicely together and it has like a kind of hessian sack vibe going on around the outside kind of trim so I picked up that one I also picked up this one which is a teeny tiny shiny copper cushion because I love copper but also think this is such a cool like statement cushion like I love this a lot maybe not as comfortable to lie on all that you can see my face and I got this little one which is blue and white kind of tie-dye effects with tiny little yellow pom-poms on the outside and again just really like that I picked up a fake plant I like fake plants because they don't die and all you have to do is sort of dust from every now and then very practical especially if you are a sort of person that just can't keep plants alive get some good fake ones I actually think this does look quite good as fake plants go this one's quite realistic and it's only from Primark so I really like it it's very cool a lot of leaves going on this is slightly a bit more add on boring but still I loved it this is a bath mat and it's like bubbled and I really like it I think that's so cool and would be lovely to step on when you get a bath or shower there you go can get your bath mats at Primark as well oh and I also got this because I suck at drinking water to anything that can contain a large amount of water for me to sip on all day is good and this is a huge like cup and it says sparkle like a unicorn which is kind of quite cheesy but I also really like it and it's got a holographic unicorn and like pink and silver ombre glitter going on it's just a lot but I like it and if there was ever anything to encourage you to drink water I think this is a really great thing to have to do that I did get some bedding which is like a tropical leaves which I'll insert a clip of now and I also got the parrot cushion that you'll also see in that clip from Primark too moving on to clothes and shoes first thing I got which I feel like everyone has is this peachy pink jumper which says we can't ride I love this oh yeah I got some like boyfriend style jeans Primark now do a size 4 which I've never noticed before and although the size 6 and size 8 is fine for me depending on the kind of story one I did think the jeans and boyfriend fit jeans at that because they're slightly baggy I would go precise for these do you have some ginormous ribs so I don't know if I can pull these off or I don't know if it were like I've been savaged by wild beasts but we'll soon see oh okay so I already have a pair of these joggers they're just like simple joggers with like a white toggle but they are in fact I'm wearing some right now but they're the softest joggers I've ever owned I have no idea what fabric they use to make these but I love them so I wanted to get some more how much were these actually they were eight pounds and I just really like this like so many pink color very nice very nice got myself a kind of you spitting stripy t-shirt I like that I feel like you can never go wrong with a stroke a t-shirt so let's try it look how cute this jumper is stripe check free shoulders check little bit of color on the end check I loved it I think this is so cute this was it really nice with black skinnies and a little black bag and maybe some like other red accessories possibly but I really like that that was only ten pounds I need to rescue my back oh oh these t-shirts I'm obsessed with again a very very soft but they're just these like tight short-sleeved basic t-shirts but I actually wear these a lot and there are only three pounds so I picked up quite a few of these I've got grey one got two grey ones and I got a white one possibly that was it also pick up some white crop tops I think I got these in two different sizes because I wasn't sure which one was sitting back there already spilling out a crop top that's not pretty I also picked up this jumper which I love this is plain black and it has really pretty flower embroidery on the shoulders there's a lot of embroidery at the moment there was one embroidered jumper from Zara that I really really wanted and it was out stop and then when it came back and stuff colors I feel like everyone has this jumper now but this is a great alternative so I'm happy about that I pick up this switch I don't remember picking up at all but I quite like it it's got some stripy sleeves and it's very soft it has quite like a wide neck and it has white at the bottom like that well I picked up this which I don't know what it would look like on me I think I was being a bit optimistic well you know when you first go in and you get a little bit too excited and you want everything I think I was in that phase like it was like the first thing I saw so I was like come on oh love it and then I think by the end of the shop I was like meh I've kind of like it still let's see what it looks like on so it's like a shirt dress like a smock dress with cutout shoulders and tiny little side sleeves I think realistically with the right thing this could look really nice or it could look awful on me so we will see I forgot I bought lots of underwear what's that oh that's a bra how pretty oh it came to set okay how pretty are these little pants and little bralette in that color and then this one which is more of like a newly summoned invert one with matching pants which you like see-through at the back nor two and then I just picked up a plain navy kind of padded one I don't really know if there are some primer fit me properly when there's like this when I like a bit more padded because I don't generally buy bras and pro marks but I was like I'll give them a try and see how it goes down I love this color a lot so we shall see quite a few spaghetti-strap tops because I don't own many right now I'll go through my wardrobe I was like I feel like something's really missing now that Springs rolling around something's missing from my wardrobe turns out with these we actually come in so useful especially if you get cold like me and you I wear things a bit more spring-like but you're like still quite cold put one of these on underneath and they keep you warm for alcohol too and gray one and nude one in black 2 in white because they tend to discolor a little bit quickly and a stripy one and they were one pound fifty each which I don't think you can go wrong with I can't say they last forever and ever but they last really well for the amount that you're spending on them another pair of season soft joggers that this time they're in a burgundy I lost this hat and I don't know if this is going to look absolutely ridiculous on me or if I'm going to love it at you haven't tried it on I kind of love it I mean the bubble is like half the size of my head but I love that this is like three toned bubble I really will get that many accessories actually oh ah look how pretty this Ferrara's it's like bralette oh my god beautiful I love these trousers look at these they're like straight leg quite like smart style trousers but they're green and black and white striking these will look so cool in boots yeah love those they've got like an elastic around the waist as well got some tight these are the weather sensor finish opaque type type keeps you warm wet cool and cool when it's warm I got some Alice in Wonderland style pyjama bottoms because they were very cute I wasn't as keen on the top though so I just bought the bottom do you know what mark actually picked it out he was like would you let me pick something for you and you have to wear it I was like okay and he picked this out I actually really liked the color of this skirt and it had a little pocket so that's a mark choice look I'm more tights tights made with natural bamboo fibers why did I buy more type I don't intend to do that it oh well and I've also got some black thugs because my not seem to disappear I have no idea where all this is this is quite creased but this is a really pretty blush pink what's the words of this pleated skirt that's very pretty I really like that I'm excited to wear that oh my god how cute is it this is a playsuit is it yes it's a playsuit but look at the straps and look at the color I love it well I bought some chokers I'm not sure how I feel about these legs chokers but I thought I would see oh I bought some little hoops marks at leaves in after this Muchnick I can put mineral why not these are only a pound rose gold oops I just quite like the size core they really go on and you will now have a fear not fear but just how terrifying is it stick earrings in other people just as I was doing that with singing butter like imagine if I was having to put these on some Mouse I would really struggle oh I love this this is a cocky kind of suede feeling dress which is I guess like a mini dress and it has this like tie up front which I really like I think that would look so nice with like biker boots and another jacket or sandals in summer or bags put this bag it's a tote bag like a shopper but it's like a gun metal metallic which I really like last thing in this bag it's dungarees do you guys know how much I love my dungarees so I thought I would get some of these I quite like that the straps are thin and I also like that they're a bit more kind of distressed at the knees they're really nice I really like these that is the first back done I found few more home a bit I found another sea salt and lavender candle but this one's in a tin a marble tin which I thought would be nice to the bedroom and I also got there which is a faux plant that you can hang in a little glass like what they call terrarium few more clothing bit a stripy t-shirt some more jeans these are super high weight skinnies that bison in black yes and aood super highway skinnies in black and the last items clothing is a stripy t-shirt but it has thrills on the shoulders which i think is very very cute and this is a long-sleeve okay now after shoes I love this style of shoe however I'm very fussy when it comes to this style of shoe and I've seen some I think I can't wear those I think I'm actually going to look like a grandmother these ones so are very similar to some of the ones I really liked in Topshop but they never had my thighs so when I saw these I was like these look exactly at the top short ones and they have a size three so I was very happy about that they might not be as nice quality or as long-lasting but I like them I got some chunky heel open toe sandal heels in news because I feel like my water was lacking something like this but I could wear with those trousers that I showed you earlier or I don't know a nice dress or even jeans I think and also because they're not that high it's more of like an everyday heel so if I want to be a bit more professional feel a bit more glam and wear a heel with an outfit I think these I will feel comfortable in any higher maybe not and I've got them in new just because I felt like they might go with more and they feel a bit more like daytime as opposed to black these next ones I am obsessed with I guess these are like heeled loafer type open-toe loafers but how cool are these with like jeans just to like slip on I love this color it's like a beautiful like blue and obsessed I think this is my favorite color blue ever I love it and also again he'll go to the daytime any higher not good for daytime I was dairy and I bought some silver ones I think I will wear these though like I think they're really cool and then the last thing I have to show you are these these these are sliders now I've seen a lot of people rock these and they look really cool I bought these as an experiment because I don't know if I can pull these off or if these will look good if all our fails I use them as like garden shoes or I'll take them on holiday and use them as like quick throw something on to go to the pool you know but I really like them and they've got like embroidery on them and they're fun and I don't know sends me photos of people rocking these in an outfit and maybe then I can get a bit of like slider info and then I might have the confidence to wear them so that ladies and gents is everything I picked up in Primark this time around let me know if you guys enjoyed this video by giving a thumbs up make sure you subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you again very very soon with another video 
hello everybody today I am going to be chatting you through my 8 picks for the WH Smith zoella book club some of you may have absolutely no idea what I am chatting about so if that's the case then to cut it very very short I have my own book club exclusive to WH Smith this means that over the past couple of months I have been reading non-stop basically been eating sleeping breathing reading lots of you may already know how much I love reading I have always been a massive massive bookworm you can ask my mum within the presence I would receive on my birthday as a child I would always be far more excited for a book and I always have my nose in a book and on the few occasions where I've mentioned a book in my favorites videos you guys have really loved hearing my recommendations I feel like it gets a conversation started and I just had a check or knowledge oh she's chewing something and I have no idea what she's chewing oh hey I know that a lot of you guys also share my same love of reading which is why the book club is possibly one of the most exciting things I have done this year because it means I get to read books and recommend them to you so I've stuck mainly to the young adult category in the book club mainly because I really want to influence and inspire a lot of young adults such as yourselves or maybe not maybe you're just like me and you're 26 and you freaking level yaa because I love young adult fiction I just want to inspire more kind of young people to want to read and these days everyone is kind of on their phone on their tablet on their laptop myself included and I think that's why I really enjoy reading because I don't know you're just using your imagination you're creating these things in your mind no two people will read the same book and have the same visions and I just think that that's amazing and I just feel like there's a lot of things that we could all learn from books and I just I don't know I just want to share my love of books picking the books wasn't actually that difficult for me there was a huge selection but I went with quite a lot of the books that I had seen you guys recommend or I'd seen other people talking about or ones that looked really interesting to me or had a story that I could relate to in some way so I think I have narrowed this down to eight perfect books and I'm really happy with my choices after every book I finished reading I made notes immediately after I'd finished it and I've just written them all up in this book I've got like four pages of notes so let's get started side note when I talk about these books I will not be giving away any spoilers or at least I will really try not to so if you're kind of worried about hearing too much about books don't worry first book I feel like this will come as absolutely no surprise to most of you but it is all the bright places by Jennifer Niven a lot of you might remember me talking about this last year after I had read it but I couldn't do a book club without including it because I think it was possibly one of my favorite books that I read last year and that is a bold statement to make this book is a story of two people violet and Theodore Finch or Finch as he's also known both very very different characters both in the same school both very deeply unhappy violet is unhappy because she is mourning her sister who has sadly passed away and Finch is he's just a very complex character with a mental illness the two of them meet and the story starts with them up on the bell tower of their school and they are about to jump and the story follows on from that with them forming a friendship and showing how the two very very different people can come together and really make a difference in each other's lives and it is so poignant and amazing and Jennifer tells the story so well her writing is easy-to-follow descriptive you feel as though you're actually there she also writes about mental illness in a really delicate and sensitive way and I actually learnt quite a lot from this book - I feel like Finch is possibly one of my favorite characters from all eight books I don't know why I just felt that he was so complex and I could really picture him and there was so much about his character but I really warmed to and have I been viola in this book I feel like I would have reacted in exactly the same way it's definitely more of a modern love story it's quite a twist on the traditional boy meets girl it definitely feels a lot more real I feel like so many people will be able to relate with either violet or Finch in this story or even if you know someone who's struggling with suicide or mental illness I think you will learn a lot from this book this is definitely a book that tugs on the old heartstrings and I sure shed a tear or two it was the sort of book where after I had finished it I kind of sat in silence for a while and I had to kind of take all in and it was really like oh my goodness like I carried the weight of the book for a while and I really wanted to talk to people about it I would for sure recommend this to anyone of any age it's amazing by the way all books that I am recommending in this video have exclusive to WH Smith front covers especially for the book club so if you're looking at this and you're like this book's normally blue why is it purple if you get it in the book club indirect Smith they're all different to the original front covers which I absolutely love and together they all look amazing and so pretty so yeah just worth noting in case you're looking at them like that's not the book it is now hey the next book I'm going to be talking about is we were liars this is written by E Lockhart and I had chosen this book based on my friend's recommendation she said it was really good I believed her and I was like sounds good to me I read this I want to say in one sitting I can't quite remember if it wasn't one it was definitely two sittings very easy to read the storyline see this one's hard to explain without giving anything away it's about the privileged Sinclair family who regularly stay on an island that they own and it's told from the point of view of Kady who is a kind of spoiled rich teenager which I feel like a lot of people won't like her character to begin with she definitely warms on you and it's basically a tale of friendship love betrayal and very complex family life mixed in with lies and truth and not knowing which is which sounds confusing you just have to read it I think that this is quite a jaw-dropping story and I would advise any of you who want to read this not to look at any reviews online and to go in completely blind when reading this and then it won't be ruined for you it's unique it's poetic and it's extremely gripping to notice it's just one of those books I feel like everyone should read and then once you've read it please talk to me about it because it was one of those ones where it finished I was like I need to speak to somebody about this immediately next book is everything everything by Nicola Yoon I read this entire book in one sitting and even on the front of it Jennifer Niven has put heart-wrenching I devoured it in one sitting that is exactly what I did too i sat and read this I didn't get up to use the toilet I didn't eat I didn't drink I just couldn't put this down it was a complete page-turner it's about girl named Maddie who is severely allergic to the world she hasn't left her house for 17 years she has only really ever had a close relationship with her mum and her kind of family nurse and a guy moves in next door called Olli another character who I really really liked and he wants to try and find a way to get close to her it is a great story I really enjoyed this a lot it's basically a book that explores the extremes that people will go to when they're in love or when they think they're in love and it's so the story is told so beautifully her descriptions are amazing you feel as though you're there I also really love the use of communication in here there are emails back and forth because a lot of their kind of friendship is built on line as she obviously can't leave the house and you see that and you see kind of text messages and little notes that she writes and images and things she sketches and also little like nuggets of Education in there as well which I really really like I also really love the ending of this book and again I was left desperately wanting to talk to somebody about this so I made my friend read it so I could so I had someone to speak to about it because it's so flippin good I really really enjoyed this next up is the potion Diaries by Amy L wood now some of you may recognize Amy she is my editor but she's also my friend and she is also an author herself and this is her novel potion Diaries totally not biased don't go thinking this is unfair I genuinely love this book and I really wanted to put it in here because I think that a lot of you will also enjoy it it's also a little different from all the others because it's a bit more lighthearted and it doesn't have as many kind of more serious issues in it it feels like you are transporting into a magical world when you read this and that is why I absolutely loved it this story in summary is about a princess of Nova and she accidentally poisons herself with a love potion which was meant for somebody else which in turn means she falls in love with her reflection the nation call a hunt in order for people to source and find ingredients in order to cure the princess before it's too late and that is where we follow the main character Samantha whose family are known to be hugely respected alchemists there's a little bit of boy drama there's a little bit of friend drama but the thing I love most about this book is that it feels so magical it's kind of like old magic meets new magic it's fantasy it's Kings its Queens its palaces its potions and I really enjoyed it really really enjoyed it when I'd finish reading it I was really sad but I didn't live there I also found some parts of the story to be quite gripping and really nail-biting like I sat on the edge of my seat like but yeah if you love fantasy and you love um like that kind of hunger games slash kings and queens and potions I think you're really really like this next up is fangirl by Rainbow Rowell so many of you told me to read this book I really enjoyed this so thank you so much for recommending it to me and now I'm going to recommend it to lots of you as well story is about two twins Cass and Reyn both very very different in character Cass is a bit more subdued a lot more quiet a little bit more of an introvert slightly more geeky love kind of writing fanfiction and reads books and then there's her twin sister Ren who is none of those things and is a lot more outgoing a lot more feisty a bit more adventurous and the two of them go off to college or uni as we say here and the whole book is centered around the fact that when they go to college Ren splits off from cath and it focuses on cath developing as a person rather than an extension of her twin sister I think cath is one of those characters that a lot of people will be able to relate to she has so many different characteristics that even I was like that is so me like she doesn't like socializing she doesn't like going to parties and it's really refreshing kind of seeing her build on herself as a character throughout the book and I really really loved how it ended as well it touches a lot on twin bonds which I haven't really read too many books with twins in and it also touches a little bit on social anxiety as well I also think this book is really encouraging for aspiring writers you kind of follow Kath on her writing journey and you can read the fan fictions that she chooses to write there's a real literature vibe about this book and I actually found it to be so inspiring and encouraging and I think if any of you also loved writing then you will also find that - I think rainbow wrote this book beautifully again really poetic amazing literature amazing descriptive writing and also her characters were really amazing next up is Billy and me by the gorgeous Giovanna Fletcher now this one I have been desperate to read so when this was in the huge box of books I could pick from I grabbed it straight away the story is about a young woman called Sophie Mae who works in her local tea shop where she is introduced to the ever so handsome Billy buskin who is a famous actor who is shooting for a movie where she lives the two of them obviously become closer and the story follows Sophie as she's kind of thrust into the limelight alongside Billy and the turmoil that has on their relationship and all the little hurdles that she has to get over whilst being madly in love with this amazing famous guy I think because there were so many things in this that I could kind of relate to in a way and also just little things like her working in her like village tea shop like I grew up in a village so I instantly pictured this beautiful tiny like Pride and Prejudice esque village and I loved Sophie Mae as a character I think she's one of my favorite female characters across all eight of these books because she was so lovable and real and honest and just really relatable and she was funny and cute and she wasn't this kind of perfect ideal woman I think that's why I was really drawn to her as a character it's so romantic it's so dreamy it has its shocking moments and it has some really raw kind of very emotional and a bit heartbreaking moments where you just want to like scoop her up into your arms and give her a big hug it was feel-good light-hearted really captivating and a really easy read so if any of you want to live the fantasy of dating someone famous through a really adorable character you will you will love this book next up is the sky is everywhere by Jandy Nelson this story is about Lenny who is a 17 year old young girl who has recently lost her older slightly more fiery slightly outgoing sister and you follow her dealing with that grief and her emotions and it's pretty much a tale of love and loss I found this book really insightful because having never lost anybody close to me which I'm super thankful for it was really eye-opening and I felt so sad for this character you loved her character you loved all the strange choices that she makes through grieving and through being so lost within herself and you follow her through the book as she finds herself again I think that she captured Lenny's family so well in this because family obviously play a really important part when your family has lost someone so close to all of you it's really interesting to see how that affects the dynamic of a family and how it's affected each of them individually and I really liked that in this story the family were a key part as to why I really enjoyed this I think weirdly I also found myself laughing at parts of this book there's some really like great humor rolled into this along with some real heartbreaking awful parts and I just think overall it was really good all-round read and last but by no means least it is beautiful broken things by Sarah Barnard now this book is the most recently finished one for me and this is a little bit different from the others because this book focuses solely on friendship at first I was a bit like ah no very much I love romance in a book some people don't I do the story focuses on the ups and the downs of caddy and her best friend Rosie's friendship when Rosie makes a new friend called Suzanne and how about of shapes and changes the dynamic between them and how Susanne influences the way both girls live their life this was super easy to read I loved caddy caddy I feel like as a character had a lot of me in it I could really identify with her as a character there were so many things that she does and things she says and the way she behaves in this book I know I mirror a lot of those behaviors in real life and it was quite an eye-opener for me when I read this because I was like oh I do that and wait I say that sometimes and it was also really refreshing to read a story about friendship because pretty much everyone has a friendship and friendships can be just as intense and just as heartbreaking as a love story and I think that that's why I really enjoyed this because I think no matter who you are you will have had issues with friends or friendship groups or your best friend making friends of someone else or issues that might happen with your friend or things they might be going through this book also touches a lot on mental health and abuse as well I just feel like most people will have a relationship with a friend that can be just as upsetting just as devastating just as complex just as meaningful I also love this book because it's set in Brighton so all the little bits that she was describing and the places they were and where they were hanging out I actually can see that so visually and descriptively I felt like I was really in this book I felt like I was really living this book it was really easy to picture everything that was happening because obviously I live in Brighton and just kudos for writing a book based in Brighton and also just a book full of amazing things that I think a lot of people can take away from it if you want to hear any more about any of the books that I've just mentioned there will be review videos every two weeks over on the WH Smith YouTube and over on their blog as well WH Smith will also be providing lots and lots of extra content over on all their social media staff they've got to take overs interviews with authors book cup nights to discuss the books what else they've got soundtracks to the different book titles which i think is amazing some short stories some extra chapters and there will also be competitions and giveaways because everyone loves a good competition and a good giveaway I'll leave all the links down below so that you guys know where everything is and no one gets confused I'm really sorry if this video has rambled on and on and on I'm really sorry I find it hard to talk about beauty in a short amount of time let alone eight entire books that I have thoroughly enjoyed reading and want to share with you let me know in the comments if you are going to be checking out any of those books if you've already read them what'd you think of them without giving anything away of course because that's just spoiling the fun for everyone else don't forget to give this video a thumbs up and as always let me know any other book recommendations in the comments anything you've read recently that you absolutely loved that you think I will also like all the other viewers and commenters might also like and I will see you again very very soon bye 
Hollo everybody as you can see I am in the kitchen I am getting festive, and I'm going to do some baking because everyone loves to bake around this time of year I'm working with Waitrose in this video as part of their new Christmas campaign Christmas together Which is essentially everyone coming together friends family strangers and making the most of the Christmas season Whether thats with cooking, baking, Or simply just having fun christmas is a time for everyone to be together and that is exactly What Waitrose wants to get across which I think is lovely so in this video i'm gonna be making some gingerbread fairy light cupcakes I've done this recipe before on my blog But I'm mixing up the decoration a little bit because I saw a really cool picture on Pinterest That I'm going to attempt to copy because it looks really cool and very magical very Christmassy So let's get started first thing you want to do is pre-heat your oven to 175 degrees Celsius get yourself a baking tin or a cupcake baking tin and Fill it with your chosen cupcake cases. I've gone for gold because I think it's quite Christmassy Perfect okay now you're all prepared. It's time to start mixing Which is the messy job, but also the fun job, so I'm going to pop that to one side If you're planning on doing any baking around Christmas season Get organized get all your ingredients out make sure that all around you So you're not like scrambling through cupboards trying to find things if it's all there out front of you It makes it much more simpler and much more enjoyable right I've got my trusty KitchenAid first thing I'm gonna do is cream together the butter and the sugar so Let's get our mixing bowl and our scales I've got my butter here and We need 75 grams of butter That's 96 so I'll take some off There we go pop that to the side because you will need it for later. I'm now gonna pop the butter in the KitchenAid Now we need to weigh out the sugar and we need 100 grams of caster sugar Now you've done that you want to cream that together, so it's all nice and soft and smooth Next thing you need to add to the butter and sugar is your treacle we need 125 Milliliters of treacle I can appreciate measuring up treacle is not the easiest There we go Don't lick treacle out of the thing it's not like golden syrup. It doesn't taste good It tastes rank if you just eat it out of the bin trust me. I think I did that last time Pour that in There we go, made a right old mess Next thing you need to do is crack in one large egg and one large egg yolk I am using the Waitrose free-range eggs all their eggs are free-range which is good And it's always nicer I think to use larger eggs in baking So the second egg you do only want the yolk so you need to do a little bit of egg dancing There we go happy with that, in it goes perfect now you want to give that a good mix Doesn't look too appetizing right now, but trust me it will be lovely Now in a separate Bowl you want to mix together all your dry ingredients, so I'm going to move the eggs away So you want 175 grams of plain flour I always shake my whole body when I get flour out I'm like Okay cocoa powder Here We want 1 tablespoon of cocoa powder In it goes you then want to add 1 teaspoon of baking powder Now it's time to add all your spices which make the cake tastes absolutely Amazing this is what for me makes this feel like a very Christmassy recipe because it's very warming and spicy and just delicious Basically so the first spice you want to add to your dry mixture is ginger And you want to add one and a quarter teaspoon of ginger. I think ginger is my favorite spice hundred percent one and a quarter There we go the next spice you want to add is cinnamon and you want to add one teaspoon of cinnamon It's like Christmas you could literally just smell that all day There we go the next one that you want to add is mixed spice or allspice and you want to add half a teaspoon of that And Then lastly you want to grab some ground nutmeg Which also whoa that smells so much stronger in this than it does when you bake with it. Whoa. again You want to add half the teaspoon of that? Now you're all spiced up spice up your life we're never done I'm also going to add a quarter of a teaspoon of salt as well And that is all your dry ingredients now in a bowl you then want to add it to your wet ingredients and You just want to mix this until it's just combined you don't want to over beat it I've got spices up my nose these are going to be delicious Okay for this next bit you want to grab yourself a Saucepan just a little one and pop it on a small hole and you want to use 125 milliliters of milk All right Since this measuring jug is too big, so I don't know I've just made a guess And you want to pour it in a saucepan And You just want to really carefully heat up the milk being careful not to boil it. That's the last thing you want The milk is now hot, so I'm going to add that into the mixture very gently Add a little bit and I'm gonna This is when the mixture starts to look so delicious just gonna use my spatula And make sure I've got everything of the edges Now you have your absolutely delicious looking cake mixture, it's time to spoon it into your cupcake cases two spoons One for spooning One for pushing it into the cupcake cases Now all you have to do is pop these in your oven for around 20 minutes or until they are springy to touch a little bit more golden on the outside and tidy up your kitchen We don't have much longer on the cupcakes but whilst they're still in the oven I'm gonna start on making the buttercream icing this is literally a simple buttercream icing recipe and This is just a general one that I tend to follow so for this you will need 240 grams of unsalted butter Let's see how much this is 171 so we do need another Oh 245 Perfect you want to beat this until it is really light in colour so basically until it goes from yellow to white Cakes are out now you need to put these on a cooling tray Until they are actually cool not like a little bit warm, or I don't have time I'm going to fit the icing onto a warm, hot cake wait till they're cold, otherwise your cakes will look really bad I do think the one thing you need to have patience for like a hundred percent Mark, I'm talking to you now These are on the cooling rack I'm gonna leave these Just there to the side Whilst I carry on with the butter icing I've been mixing this for around five minutes I'm just gonna do once more just scraping all the butter off the edge Just to make sure we've got every little bit, and it's as creamy as possible Okay, I'm now going to measure out 400 grams of icing sugar into a bowl There we go it's essentially nearly the entire box and You're just going to very gently cream the butter and add little bits of icing sugar as you go hmm smells so good Now you're going to want to add two teaspoons of vanilla I have some vanilla bean paste one And two Then you want to add four tablespoons of milk although I would do this gradually so you can see whether the consistency of the icing is how you want it So I'll maybe do two first Mix that this looks so great Should I try a little bit Hmm honestly, I think this is the best buttercream icing I've ever made oh, one more tablespoon Okay, I'm going in for my fourth tablespoon Now what my cakes are completely cool I've got the writing chocolate in a glass of boiling water, so that's nice and melted now It's time to do my favorite bit. Which is to ice the cupcakes Just going to cut the end of my piping bag off And pop my nozzle in And then fold your bag over And start filling it Right I am going to start from the outside and work my right in so that I can make like a point I've decided to go with M&amp;Ms because they are the brightest colors and for this because we're doing like some fairy lights Needs to be bright so oh That wasn't as smooth as I thought  it was gonna be I thought it was just gonna go ahh My writing chocolate has fully melted you could cut the end off You want to start and kind of just go all the way around to the top Don't know how easy this is gonna be with chocolate. Let's just give this a go There we go perfect one done Okay I Quite like it when it goes a wiggly It looks like proper fairy lights you know what I mean Okay Chocolate is done I actually do think this is going to taste much nicer because we've used chocolate not Writing icing so you want to get your M&amp;Ms, and then you just want to stick them in Very light Okay, and there you go. These are my Definitely don't look quite as good as the Pinterest version, but I'm really happy with them, and they are very delicious cupcakes I will leave all the Ingredients and the links and sources to everything down below if you guys want to recreate these in time for Christmas Don't forget to share your photos or videos of your together moments using the hashtag Christmas together I think that's gonna be such a lovely positive hashtag, and I can't wait to see what you guys post in it I also can't wait to see if you decide to make these they'll probably look better than mine but I'm excited to see them give this video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it, and I will see you again very soon I Really want to eat one of these should I try I'm gonna try one guys Gingerbread cupcake I've got it all around my mouth? Oh my These are the best things I've ever made 
hello everybody today I'm doing something I have not done in a really long time I'm doing a whole video I realized I haven't done a whole like a proper sit-down talk you through things have actually bought hall in a really long time and I'm very sorry about that but don't know how that's happened but I have a homework haul for you today and these are some of my favorites to watch because as you know we moved house not too long ago so I'm still collecting little bits here and there for our home and so I've saved lots of it in a really big pile so that I can show you now and then I can start distributing it into the house let's get started there is quite a thing to this homework haul it it didn't start this way but it seems to have ended up quite autumnal autumn Hall a little bit of Halloween thrown in it's not to earlier say I don't think so I mean the first thing I want to show you is this plant pop I thought I saw a spider crawling up the curtain then oh it wasn't a spider it was just a little crack in the curtain this was from Urban Outfitters and it's a little pot and it has googly eyes on it it then comes in this size and then yeah you guessed it it then comes in this size I have a lot of plants around this house and I have lots of like tiny little ledges in my office so I did buy how many of these it up like I think I bought wall nearly dropped it I think I bought three of these because I want to put a little cactuses in so it looks like it's their hair and then just have them like scattered around my office which I'm very excited about so yeah those were from Urban Outfitters also from Urban Outfitters I got this gold planter which is in like a little black stand they have some really nice planters on that website if you are looking for something to be plants in definitely check out Urban Outfitters they've got a great selection and then picked up this which I'm not gonna lie I thought was gonna be least five times the size of this I guess this is perfect for my office and the tiny little plants but you're not going to fit a lot water in this when your plant round so yeah when this arrived I was a bit like steady on are you watering way too many plants of that watering can that was also from Urban Outfitters and again this is from Urban Outfitters it kind of I mean there's a lot of mugs in this Hall jeez this uh kind of goes with the plant pots with the eyes on I think I'm just a little bit obsessed with googly eyes I also thought this looked quite Halloweeny because it's like a little ghost I don't know I really liked that that was also from Urban Outfitters I then picked up these for my office because I have a kind of leaf print theme going on up there and these are it's this wine glass I'm not going to use them for wine I'm just gonna use them for water and like juice or whatever I fancy but I really really liked those so that was just a set of two and again Urban Outfitters because I don't think you can have too many fairy lights I bought some fairy lights these ones look pretty damn cool you can see them here they are full of like glittery bits so it says ten glitter bauble lights so I think I'm gonna put these up in my office they are by the Brooklyn lighting company white LEDs on a clear braided cable these are battery operated which I'd prefer not to have only because sometimes I forget to turn them off and then I end up wasting so much battery life but they were so pretty I couldn't like not get them like that's so pretty yeah Urban Outfitters and then I already have one of these but I kind of wanted this one because it was pink and black and so what I thought I would do is put this one in my office and then put the other one that I have currently in my office somewhere else in the house because they're just really cute to put like little signs on or like positive messages or yeah love it oh I love that 90s film marathon which one of these is your fav let me know that was just the Urban Outfitters section oh hang on another thing from Urban Outfitters before I move on is some peach bedding its bedding with little peaches on it and I don't know I thought it was really cute so I bought it peaches moving on to bedding now I don't know about you but I do feel like sometimes when you move house you realize what you have that you should probably throw away and for me that was a lot of our bedding that we had like used reused reused again and just we ended up we were ending up putting bedding on that we didn't even really like so I've thrown away a load of our old bedding which meant I had room for new bedding which is why I also bought the peach one but I was on the next website and they have some really nice bedding on there so I picked up this which I'm not sure about and I know almost a hundred percent our fee is going to hate its fleece bedding like actual soft fleece I love the idea of this because I love being cozy but I do feel like this could be sweaty hell I sweat quite a lot on my sleep anyway possibly tear my little bit gross but I think maybe I might sweat even more if our sheets and our fitted sheet yes that's right ladies and gentlemen I didn't just buy the sheets in fleece I bought the sheet in fleece um I'm just I'm gonna see what it's like so these are from next in a gray I'm just very intrigued surely it's like getting into the coziest little cocoon like I am just imagining that this is gonna be the coziest bedding I've ever owned but I don't know it could swing both ways so I will let you know the other bedding I picked up was this which is a really light gray star print and it's brushed cotton which again I love our feet not so much thankfully I'm the one in the relationship that actually buys the bedding so he hasn't really got a lot of say in that um unless of course he wants to go and buy his own bedding but and I also bought like a charcoal gray fitted sheet in brush cotton as well so if all if the fleece fails we can fall back on this then maybe after you won't hate the brushed cotton as much you know also from next this is quite big oh I bought this extremely large faux fur throw I find it quite difficult to find throws that drape nicely over king-size beds there are some amazing ones for double beds and single beds but once you go beyond double like they just don't fit they look too small they don't work um so when I saw this one and instantly fell in love like this is like autumn in a throw and it's also big enough to sit on a king-size bed so after this video I'm probably gonna put it on this bed although it's not quite cold enough here yet for any one to warrant having a thick faux fur throw on the end of the bed also from next I got this doormat it says hello it's like it's like inscribed is that right embossed it's got a little embossed hello on it which I really liked I was only ten pounds and all that was quite reasonable we needed a doormat it's starting to get a bit wetter now so dirty feet coming in through the front door needed a doormat all the bits now I've left to show you are all from home scents and they are all amazing I'm just gonna go like straight in autumn I bought a gold speckled pumpkin I don't feel like there's any any explanation for this you know why I bought that it's gonna look great somewhere in the house I also bought a orange pumpkin with little black polka dots this is really light and it was really cheap but I really like it and I just think even if I just put it on this bedside table in the background or put it on the step by our front door I just think it would look so cute and I don't know I really liked it I've got two sets of Lights the first being these little pumpkin ones I think he's a glass you know there's ten on here and they again are battery-operated but that's fine and yeah they're just thought they were really cute they've got really like smiley faces and they looked really nice quality so I picked those up I also got these these are little plastic skeletons that all move let me see if I can like than much you look I just really liked it he's like all their joints move I just oh yeah skeleton lights I also picked up this little sign that says I put a spell on you and you can turn it on look it's lit up I'll find a place for this for sure mugs and crockery I did go a little bit crazy on not gonna lie at first I saw this one this is a little mummy mug and I liked that it was like all round and it had a really big handle and it was really nice to hold so I thought well I have to have that one because he's really cute then I saw this one I thought that is gonna look amazing with whipped cream and flakes and all the chocolate sprinkles with a hot chocolate in it and that is just a really cute smiley little pumpkin in a copper one again very great size and a lovely big handle why Halloween mugs like bigger handled so now I really like it so I got him then I saw this one which is by a designer called Ray Dunn who I have never heard of before but you will see I did pick up a few of these items and I am actually obsessed with everything I picked up of his so the inside is orange and it is a huge mug like look at the size of this and it just says trick or treat and it has a little pumpkin on with black kind of diamonds on it it's just lovely it's really lovely I love that then I also picked up this one this is also by Ray done in fact everything I'm going to show you now is by Ray done you'll notice that the illustrations are very similar I really liked the handle on this one look it's like higher up I don't know and it has the top of a witch's hat and it says bewitched and inside it says has a bewitching day then I picked up two sets of four kind of tea plates I guess they're not like big enough that you would have your dinner on but they're good enough for like little snacks and like every Halloween I'm planning on having like a movie night and having friends around and I just thought these would be perfect perfect so the first one says scaredy-cat and it's a black cat then we've got the same as the mug with the hat that says bewitching then you've got like the top of a little pumpkin face and it says trick-or-treat and then a little owl that says whoa so I've got two sets of clothes which was actually my mum's idea she was like oh you're gonna want to get two sets because if you have more than four people some people won't get a plate and I was like ah very true mum just so wise so I picked up two sets of those and also they really didn't have that many and I loved them too much to get home and be like I wish I'd got another set and I never did so I picked them up I also got this style of plate which has like a little lip on it and they're oval and I've got this one that has the little witch's feet and it says hocus pocus on that one and then the same pumpkin that was on the mug and that says trick-or-treat then I got these like snack platters and there's this one that has all the different witch's feet and it says eat up witches and this one which I just love so much this says the witching eat scared patrocle tree and then it just says it all the way around and it has the Hat the pumpkin and the cat and then some dangly spiders I'm all set for Halloween dining at least candles wise I did pick up a couple of candles I picked up this one which is epic it's huge and it's in this really lovely like battered copper jar vast jar container it is smoked pumpkin by a company called gilded Forrest oh it smells so good a lot of the time I love pumpkin cents if they're too sweet I don't tend to like them much because they're really sickly because this is smoked pumpkin it smells like when you light a candle in a pumpkin I'm really happy with that and I'm excited to start burning it another can do I picked up was this one which is apple blossom tart and crisp by DW home which I'd never heard of before or can't open it ah but it's just like a very sweet apple scent and it smells divine a few other little homie bits that I picked up from home scents I got this throw because if this is not autumn in a throw then I'm sorry but as a nought to tell you it's also very soft and just oh oh yeah I also got this cushion here down here from home scents now I don't know why I did this but I picked up quite a few tea towels I just feel like you can never have enough tea towels they get really grubby really quickly and you end up throwing them away so I just thought why'd you know what's order it's better to have more than not enough so I picked up these ones which are white with little grey skillets see Skellington have never caught them skeletons in my life skeletons on and they're really cute and a little bit more like you know muted if you've got a very kind of modern kitchen or you don't want too much color soak a nice little pop of Halloween without being too you know orange or black being very orange and black I also picked up these this this is like ridiculously soft these are the sorts of tea towels that you can actually really dry things very well on so I think these ones are my favorite so they've got the pumpkins they've got little candy corns on them and little black stars and they're just like adorable I wish I had a jumper like this and then as I just showed you plain orange with the little Halloween pumpkin faces on and then lastly I bought this beautiful little autumnal wreath I don't know whether I want to hang this maybe on our kitchen door or have it this way up and put a candle in the middle so like maybe even my pumpkin candle in the middle of it on a table kind of in the center the possibilities are endless but it's beautiful like look at everything on there you've got some pumpkins some pinecones some odd shaped squashes little acorn I just loved it I love that home scents are incredible for seasonal wreaths so they don't just have Christmas wreaths they have like a wreath for every occasion spring autumn Halloween Halloween Halloween wreaths I saw this and I was like I don't need a Halloween wreath but I really want one this spider came off so I'm gonna have to stick him on but yeah a Halloween wreath I love this um you can never have too many wreaths that's my new motto so I feel like that is everything that I wanted to share with you basically I'm gonna go an autumnal Phi it's a word or tum na Phi or tum autumn up my house now because I'm calling it it's officially autumn so there we go what's our it's my bracelet so I had a bruise on my arm thank you guys so much for watching this video give it a thumbs up if you enjoyed it make sure to subscribe if you haven't and I will see you again very very soon boy 
Hello everybody! Today i'm gonna be giving you a little tour of my office. It's definitely not anything revolutionary or amazing,but I love it and it's my little work space and if this gives you any tips or ideas on creating your own little workspace so that you can be the most productive that you can be, then I hope this helps! As you walk in, this is the first bit you see, now this is a board that was actually at my Zoella Apartment not long ago and it's a huge, the biggest corkboard i've ever seen and i left it there for everybody to take pictures on the Polaroid and write little notes, and I asked them if I can have it once they were done with it I put it in my office so that everyone else can see it.
I love it. It makes me really happy when i look at this. I also have these like sticker gold glitter letters, which a company sent to me and I didn't ever really know where i could put them but above this I think worked quite nicely I really like this little space. This is my first drawers which i'm not going to show you inside because in all honesty it may look organized from the outside but inside these drawers is just a mess of everything I've thrown in here. it's got cameras, lenses, charges, round acrylic letters... just a little bit of everything in there, which I could definitely do with organizing but on here I've got two of my favorite prints: this one is, I think from "notonthehighstreet", and it just says 'she believed she could so she did', which I think is a really nice quote, i love it it's one of those things that whenever I look at it kind of reminds me that anything I really want to do, if I put my mind to it, I can do it. or i can at least try. And then this one which is actually quite hard to read but it says 'don't let anyone dull your sparkle' which again, I just think it's a really nice, inspirational quote. And I got a selection of plants here. you're lucky because today I've got some new ones and they look really happy and fresh. 
Onto my desk which is where the magic happens, i.e. work. being productive, editing, all sorts of things this is like my favorite chair ever, this is just from John Lewis I just think office chairs in general kind of ugly looking and i think this looks really nice so I'm quite happy with my office chairs. I've got my lamp, obviously most offices need to have a lamp. A computer and because i will often work on my laptop at my desk as well I've got a little stand,  which actually i find really useful. I've got a couple of  plants on my desk, I've got one at this end in my blooming marvelous pot and I've got one here which i think is my favorite part because it looks like the pot has hair and it says 'pick me'. I've also got my pot of pencils, a stapler, a hole punch and some sellotape. My desk essentials: I got hand creams, cleansing hand gel, lip balms and some small candles just to give it a nice scent. I've got some acrylic storage which I just keep my notebooks in, because then they're standing up and I just think it looks nicer than if you have a huge pile on the side, and they're also very easy to grab I think one thing i find keeps me see the productive in here is when my desk is clear of mess, whichm I'm gonna be honest, it isn't always. but when it is I just feel so much more productive and I just think a desk space is something that you have to really love.
 Over here is the kind of corner of the room and I think one thing that makes any office space or desk area really personable to you is photographs and I don't really tend to have a lot of photos in the rest of the house but here i have a lot of Polaroid style photos of me and all people I love, well most of people I love. No offence to anyone i seem to have missed on here. we must go in a Photobooth and  take some pictures. I love this when i look at this i just think of like happy times, amazing memories, and just generally amazing people. this is the second kind of office-y space here which is more of an area where I like to showcase all of the products i worked on and things that I released with Zoella Beauty and Zoella Lifestyle because obviously that's a huge part of what I do as well as make videos so that reflects in the space I work.
And I have kind of a little showcase i like to think it's like my own personal little like shop and it's all of the products that I love and I'm really proud of I like just working and being able to look at and be like "I did those. really happy with those". We've got a lot of the new Zoella products in the cloud storage and then moving onto this side, I've got more of the lifestyle products in this little white crate I'm just really happy with this little setup. I've also got a few of the kind of older more classic products down here and my books it's basically a place where i inflate my ego and showcase all of the things I've raised which i think is fine if it's in your office.
 moving back to this section of unit, which actually is a quite a lot of people's favorite if you're stationary lover or think you might like sounded very sure of that, didn't I? I've got little glass parts of clicps, paper clips and pins, pots with various different pencils, and felt tips, and liners in all the colors you could ever imagine. also some notebooks, and journals, and things. But one of my favorite things in this whole room is my clique storage sharpies. i don't know why, i think it's just very visually pleasing. you just got every color you could ever need and they're all set out in color order and that just makes me very happy. And in bottom two cabinets are literary business files, personal files, house insurance, gas bills, all of the lovely adult things you have to do when you have a home. this is another corner of the room I quite like this little corner and behind me you might notice a door. This goes to Narnia. It doesn't really, it's actually a toilet the shower which i think isn't really needed in office I mean a toilet's useful, if you don't mind someone meters away listening to you pee. I do have other toilets in the house so we use it mostly for other storage and for today i've hidden all the secret things that I'm not allowed to show you yet in here, so i will just leave this shut, because if i open it I fear I may be drowned by stuff. this was actually a gift that was given to me last Christmas? Or was it my Birthday? I don't remember, but it was from my management and they bought me this to put up in the office because they knew i was gonna have this room as my base and they told me i could put all my magazine front cover shoots in the rack so I don't want to take credit for it, I'm not some like vain woman putting pictures of myself in here wasn't my idea I thought it was quite a nice one because i am proud of different covers I've done and there are some really great ones in here. some I don't love as much, but still they're front covers so I put them in. This one I thought was kind of worth mentioning this was the first cover shoot you I ever did back in 2013-14? I don't remember, but this was for "Company" magazine and that's a cool one just thought I'd show you. This one was also so much fun this was with Tyler for  "Seventeen" magazine, amazing day. How cool is it that i have this many front covers, it's just so weird be able to see all like this, but so cool. Moving on from my face to this side which is less Zoella. I like this because it's so simple and you can clip anything you want to it, so this is where I put any little quotes or inspirational mottos Iquite like this one: 'introducing the only plant in all of the world that I will never ever kill'. because it's a photo, that's why. hahaha. I've left quite a bit space on that so i can add some new ones but I quite like that and then down here i have two coffee tables one with a phone which isn't actually work, 'cause it's not pluged in to anything but it looks cool and every office should have a phone i also have this frame with some pictures of me and Mark in it. A autumnal candle and some more plants. one of which is not looking its best. oops.
 and that is it that is my office tour I really hope that you enjoyed it or that it gave you a little bit of inspiration or if you're nosy like me then it quenched your nosy thirst. I actually quite like seeing people's office tour because i'm a huge sack on the stationary. Give video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and I will see you again very soon.

hello everybody and welcome to 24 days of zoella I'm kicking off the first video of 24 that's right right up until Christmas Eve you are going to have a video on this channel every single day so make sure you're subscribed make sure you press the little notification bell that's just down there next to the subscribe button so that you're alerted and almost like having a sneezing fit down that Shh so that you're alerted every single day whenever there is a new video also worth mentioning I'm also doing vlogmas so i will link my second channel below nah no it's not the time so I'll also be leaving a link to my second channel in the description box make sure you go on over there good friend will also be a video on that every single day up until Christmas Eve Oh actually no there'll be a video every single day from tomorrow until Christmas day because you feel on one day then you got loaded on the next day that's how it works anyway you might be thinking why we decided to do 24 days as well er again are you effing crazy and the answer to that is yes because it is a lot of work and I'm a perfectionist so I only want to ever upload videos that I love and that I think you'll love and when that means creating 24 different videos that are Christmas themed that's quite difficult especially when you've done 24 days of so well over a year before and you can't really repeat the same videos so I'm just gonna throw this out there enjoy this year cuz next year there will be nothing left for me to film much like last year after I've just said that like there's no videos I can't repeat them much like last year I'm doing a November favorites on at day one because I have been loving a lot of things and I also didn't upload a video of my favorites last month or the month before because well I don't know the months just kind of slipped by and also sometimes I find it quite difficult because I don't often have favorites that regularly do you know what I mean if I'm having like a busy couple of months I don't really try new things however people haven't done it for two months I actually do have a really nice handful of things I cannot wait to share with you so without further ado also I am wearing a Christmas jumper you just can't tell I quite like the zoom in and I was like oh maybe I'll zoom out and then you can see my Christmas jumper but we all know I'm wearing a Christmas jumper anyway so it's fine I'll start with skincare I received this in my peer box quite recently and it is the Liz Earle cleanse and polish hot cloth cleanser in sweet orange and clove this is a limited edition one for Christmas and yes I've lost the lid and yes I'm really annoyed about it because how do I now travel with this Lizzie cleanse and polish was probably one of the first proper cleansers I ever used this revolutionized the way I cleansed my skin it was the first kind of cleanse away you used a cloth to remove the cleanser that I use anyway it probably wasn't the first one in history well maybe it was I don't know maybe I should fat check before I make these videos probably but I absolutely love the closer closer the clothes I'll cleanse and polish and somewhere along the way I stopped using it because there were other things I was using when this arrived in my Pierre box and I smelt it and absolutely fell in love with it because it smells like Christmas in a bottle I started using it and I flippin love it my skin is quite problematic like it's dry and then it's oily and then it's spotty and then it's clear and then it's scarring and then it's blemish free and I think my skin just really loves this because it's quite like tame I don't know if that's the right word to use but I really like this on my skin really lexis and I've really enjoyed using this over the past couple of months next thing I've been using is this this is the Mario Badescu I don't know if I'm saying that right drying lotion again this is one of those things that been sat in my skincare drawer for a while and I hadn't really reached for it didn't really know what it was and I was getting really lazy with my skincare found it and thought it looked really interesting it kind of splits I don't know if you're going to be able to see that but there's like a pink sand at the bottom it's not sand it that's just so we're going to describe it and then like a milky liquid on top now my first reaction was going to shake this before I put it on my skin then I read the back and in bold capital green letters it says do not shake the solution so I very quickly realized that's not what you do and you dip a cotton swab into the pink sediment so you dip it all the way down and when you pull it out it's like it's the weirdest consistency but it's really cool and then you just dab it on any little spots or areas where you think you're going to get a spot and I do that before I go to bed at night so I do my whole skincare routine remove my makeup cleanse my skin and then I'll do a toner and then I'll do my moisturizer and then I'll dab this on any problem areas and I love it it's like it suffocates the hell out of any spot or blemish and the next day is either half the size not there anymore but also I think it's really helping with like scarring like I feel like normally when I get a spot the redness really hangs around and I think because I've been using this it disappears a lot quicker you know like when you're like all I fill out is a spot coming that's that's when this I think is going to be great makeup wise I do this why do I talk when I'm looking at a camera firstly is the leaves are wrong or YSL Touche claw lift lift on Latia and this is a foundation for ages I thought this was a really sheer foundation so I didn't really use it because I love sheer foundations in the summer but as we're kind of getting more towards the colder months my skin needs something a little bit more heavy coverage for me to feel like yeah my skin looks a little bit more clear so I kind of just left this in my drawer thinking I'll use that in the summer I'll give that one a try another time papi use this when she was around a couple of weeks ago and she was like oh my god I love it it's quite heavy coverage so it took me a while to get used to it but I really really liked it I was like it's heavy coverage I was like what I just assumed much like the two chakra which goes under your eyes which I personally don't think gives much coverage to my like literally so Grammys or be dead under eye circles so I just assumed the foundation would be similar and it really isn't so this is a very build I'm apologies for the snoring dog that's on my lap by the way that is not my bottom or my tummy it's my dog so yeah this is a medium to buildable coverage but you can get quite full coverage with this it blends really nicely my skin I think looks really smooth but still like skin I can't explain it it's like this coverage there but it's not so thick that it feels it doesn't feel thick on your face it feels really comfortable it's comfortable to wear and I also think it doesn't transfer as much I don't know I really really like it for reference I on the shade BR 20 next up I've been using this this is the pixi by petra color correcting powder foundation now I've been using a really light dusting of this just to set my foundation in places where I know I'm going to start to get oily throughout the day which is usually here here and like down the sides of my nose and I love this I mean you're probably not supposed to use as a setting powder because it is quite high coverage powder but I really really like it and I am very fussy with my powders next up is this this is Maria's heck this is the Marc Jacobs bronzer in tantric 102 it's the Omega bronzer merci I love the packaging it's like big and black and very sleek and press this little button no yet and then you lift it and look at the size of this and then you got a mirror as well which i think is always handy and it's a good sized mirror too like you can really you can really check yourself out in that mirror I think what I love about this is it's a very soft bronzer and what I mean by that is sometimes when you swirl your bronzer in the brush and you go to put it on your head you get like this big runs a patch that you then spend like half your time kind of blending over this just seems to like airbrush on your face I can't explain it it just blends really beautifully and it's very subtle which makes a which I think makes it look of a more natural bronzer when it's on your skin and it's also a matte shade too which are quite rare to come by so I love this next up is this this is the Kylie Jenner burgundy palette whole my goal this this is beaut when I opened it I was like oh my god these colors are like autumn in a palette and every single color in this palette I have put on my eyes and that is so rare in a palette there is normally one or two that I think it's nice but I'm never gonna wear it but I love all the others in this palette I wear every single shade but also every single shade goes with every other color and they blend beautifully I actually have them on today I've been wearing this pretty much every day for the past month I think for me it's the color combination that kind of just wins in my eyes you just open this palette and you just know your eyes are going to look great on my eyelashes I have been loving this which is the Estee Lauder sumptuous knockout defining lift and fan mascara I'm going to emphasize on the word fan because my it makes my eyelashes like fan out I think because it grips each one individually and gives each one like a really generous coating without them clumping together or without them looking really natural it's like I don't know I just really really like it when you like a mascara it means it does exactly what you want it to do and that is this is exactly what I mean a loss for words lip product now this might not shock you it's a liquid lipstick I just have like a mini freakout thinking I didn't plug my microphone in or a coarse one I have got it loved in liquid lipstick I love liquid lipstick there are so many different formulations around at the moment and every time I find a good'n I like to let you know about it totte have brought out some great ones and I'll tell you for why name that program taught Tartus lip paint in the shade bestie which I also currently have on which is a really pretty nudie move I would say these go on very smoothly very smoothly very easy to apply but same but what I love about them is that mat straight away like immediately they turn matte which I love they don't feel heavy and they don't crack on your lips and they were really nice I think the one thing that I will say makes this so different from any others I've tried is that it feels very light to wear and generally a matte liquid lipstick you're very aware it's there so yeah you should definitely try these out also some really amazing shades now you may have noticed I don't know if you did but I look like I have sprung from the 80s and that is because on a photo shoot that I was on recently with my brother I had to have my hair put into the tightest ringlets you will ever see and on day one of the shoot we all sort of laughed about it like oh look at your curly hair that looks crazy by the end of the first day I was like what kind of digging it by a second day of the shoot I actually loved it I loved having tight ringlets hair so then I got home and I remembered that I did actually have something that created corkscrew curls and it's this it is the Lee Stafford corkscrew curler I think it's about $19.99 and it does this to your hair obviously you can leave the hair on a bit longer if you want it to be a really tight curl Hey goodness well or you can do it for a little bit of a shorter time and it gives you more kind of like wavy beachy hair also most people who see it say oh my god that must take you ages honestly it takes me the same amount of time to do this as it does to curl my hair normally because I'm taking smaller pieces this gets very hot and you only have to hold the hair on for like two three seconds literally you wrap it round and you unwrap it and depending on how big or small the coat you want the curls to be and how much hair you want to wrap around it really didn't take my time at all which is why flippin night um and I've also been killing everyone else's hair with it and I think they really love it oh okay so two more things I've been loving all over bed work the first being the missing now as you're watching this I feel like there may only be one episode left or the last episode is already aired I don't know yet because I'm filming this in the past oh god I'm confusing myself basically as it stands right now episode 5 oh oh my god it's on tonight oh my god no it's not some tomorrow damn it we're about to watch episode 6 there are eight episodes in the series I feel like I rave about BBC dramas on my favorites videos quite a lot and that is because they are so flippin good down to the music the actors and the storylines they're just all so well done I love pretty much all of them the missing is absolutely no exception if any of you have watched the first series the first and second series don't really correlate as far as I'm aware right now because they're two different stories so you can go back and watch the first series or you can start watching the second series is totally up to you however the first series was amazing do I talk about the first series in a favorites once maybe so the missing very loosely is about a girl that went missing when she was young and then years and years later she reappears is it her what's going on is it correlated to another girl that's been missing they're basically trying to find out who abducted these girls and it's just so gripping and the storyline is so complex but so like amazing like it's so detailed and just so many twists and turns and every episode I'm like I just want to watch the next one and I highly recommend you watching it if you want something else to watch Oh another thing that I have been absolutely loving and I feel like I'm really late to the party with this one is black mirror so I didn't see any of it before about a month and a half ago when pop it no who told me to watch black mirror I don't remember who told me to watch it damn it there are three series and they and every episode is different so it doesn't matter in which order you watch any of the episodes from any of the series and they're just so clever they are written and created by Charlie Brooker who I think is just the most intelligent genius man because the episodes make you think in a way that you didn't before if that makes any sense they really mess with your mind in a good way and they touch on quite modern issues and I think that's really cool and a lot of it is that in the future oh my god is just you just have to watch them to know what I mean but I have really enjoyed them in fact I still think about episodes I've watched weeks and weeks ago that's how much of an impact they saw kind of left me in my favorite episode is probably San Junipero or White Bear just because I think those were really like Sanjana Peres was just incredible that is for sure my favorite white bear was like the most shocking when I watched it and are the first one of EPs of Series three I also really loved I do remember well that one was called but yes you have got to check out if you haven't already and I feel like that is everything that I want to share with you oh one more thing Casta Christmas drinks the flippin honeycomb oh my god so mark had an econ latte and I don't drink coffee so a latte was never going to be really at my street but he was like you need to try this latte so I took a sip and then it was all I could think about and so I was like you know what I know it's only a syrup so I'm gonna ask if they can put it into a hot chocolate which they can and I like hot chocolate I feel like I'm not even breathing as I'm talking about this that's when you know these things that my favorite so honeycomb hot chocolate from Costa is just incredible as it is the chocolate orange one you got to just try them so good so is it good I really hope you've enjoyed this video and that you're excited for the next 23 videos on this channel make sure to give the video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it as always let me know what you have been loving in the comments and also let me know if you're excited for the next lot of videos I love you guys very much and I'll see you in tomorrow

Hello everybody. today I am doing more of a kind of chatty video, I don't know if any of you are very long-term viewers of YouTube But if you are you might be familiar with tags. Tags used to be a thing before YouTube was like this huge thing that everyone was doing and doing really freaking well. People would just sit and do tags and that was like a fun thing to do. I haven't seen anyone do this so I feel like I may have Created a tag don't like quote me on that someone might have done something very similar. I've searched I haven't seen anything But it's kind of a youtube-y tag. So, it's lots of different YouTube questions that I have compiled that I thought would be so nice for lots of youtubers to answer in that own way and everyone's answers I assume will be so different, and it also includes kind of videos. And it kind of really gets to the nitty gritty And I thought it would be really fun to do and I've been meaning to do this for so long And I thought now is the perfect time! right I'm just gonna get like cozy. First question, which I feel like most people will be like well That's easy And we all know that but I genuinely feel like most people who have joined this channel recently Probably don't know the answer to this and the first question is why and when did you start? YouTube when for me was 2009 Wow wait let me just double check that because I Think that's when I first uploaded a video. Where's the time going? I found my first video it's actually on private. I uploaded my first ever video on November 26 2009 I was 19 years old I had already started a written blog And I noticed that a few of my favorite bloggers also had YouTube channel or the other way around where it would be a youtuber who also had a blog and so I was I felt very comfortable writing and Uploading photos because I absolutely loved doing that but the thought of doing a video Terrified me and so many of my blog like commenters were like please do a video at this point I think I had been going to a few beauty events and meeting up with other bloggers And they were like you should do it. It was kind of the time where people weren't really making videos and I Feel like a lot of bloggers were making that step from like their blog to their YouTube It was a really big and scary prospect so Eventually I gave in and I did decide to do a video okay next question is what was the reason you? started your channel And how does that compare to why you make videos today so the reason that I made my youtube channel was More of an extension of me. I think a lot of people at the time We're enjoying learning a little bit more about me and the things I liked on my blog and I felt that doing videos would give Someone a little bit more Of a feel of who I was and the things I enjoyed and to show a little bit more of my personality Because I think it's very difficult to express a personality in a written blog I think with photography and someone's writing style you can get a certain aspect of who they are as a person But until you see them filming you get like a whole other like 3d like dimension of that person, and I think I wanted to engage With my blog audience and my other like blogger friends through video, and I found it really useful I enjoyed editing I've always been into making video since I was younger and it just seemed to make sense I Wanted a place to be me and to express the things I loved and how that differs from today I honestly don't think it's any different for me besides the fact that this has turned into my career which it never intended to back in 2009 the reason I actually sit down and make these videos has not changed a single ounce the reason that I do this is still the same an extension of me and the things I love and somewhere to talk to the people that want to listen I think and I Quite like that that's still the core of why I do this because I enjoy it and if I didn't enjoy it I wouldn't be doing it so that is the answer to question next question is What is the first video you ever uploaded? and then I've got show us a clip and you have to show a clip whether that is a Privatized video or not you have to show a clip in this question unless of course You've deleted it in which case just show the one that you still have that's like your oldest video so for me That is random vlog Experimenting on the interwebs and this was my first video. It was actually a follow me around blog which Still to this day as some of my favorite videos to film and it was me and my friend Louie Going to Bristol on a shopping trip so to be honest not much Changes there, and I will insert a clip now Skip out do use a shower gel I Don't really know why I made that private I think just because I didn't really know what I was doing the editing was bad And it didn't make a lot of sense to have it on my channel once. I started getting more comfortable we'd like to sit down in front of my camera videos so I made it private who was the first person you subscribed to I Wonder if I can see that so the first people I subscribed to I don't know the exact one Because I think I had a day where I created my YouTube channel And I just went through and I subscribed like everyone that I was really enjoying watching which was lollipop 26 X package pixie woo and The Shaytards CTFxC and lauren luke panacea 81 that was another one who I subscribed to as well those were the people that I first watched who is the most? Recent channel you have subscribed to oh I don't know how to check. I wish there was a way of like being able to check I've not made this very easy for people I feel like I've been on a real like subscribing to new channels binge right now But I will write all the channels I'm loving and that I recommend in the description box of this video But for now a couple that I have just subscribed to are the Ingham family the Meldrum's and Conan grey What is your least favorite video you have ever uploaded? Oh, I mean, I guess it's all the ones that are private 'add But there was one. It's cold. I went into lush Which was obviously? Me trying to think of a new way of saying lush whole I don't know why I did that I also have one called Prime Arne lute Which is actually still on my channel, and that was also another one? I was trying to think of another word for haul. I had just had a Really bad horrible awful argument with my then-boyfriend And I don't know why I decided to turn on my camera and film a video I think maybe to make me feel better or to distract me, but actually what I should have done was just not uploaded it It's like it's this massive bull like me to film the video and honestly watching it I just feel so awkward like I'm huffing and puffing in the video. I'm like And then the next thing I got like why do I upload that honestly? I'm so glad it's on private I also have like Alexandra Burke singing in the background really loud because I hated filming videos in silence I just couldn't do it So I would always put music on really quiet in the background Which is so stupid and probably really annoying for people to watch, but I have that really loud in the background I'm in just like the Fallas mood talking about all the lush bath bombs. I bought and it's just the weirdest video ever I know that some people are getting really sentencing mushrooms, and I'm really sorry if you are But hopefully you won't affect on this video if it's bothering me that much what is your most popular video? And why do you think that is my most popular video is my? Seven second challenge with Miranda sings I think this is probably my most popular video because it is absolutely Great like the video is crazy. Let me just double check. It's still my most popular. Yeah, it currently has 22 million views Colleen if you are watching this I feel like The fact that this has so many views and is my most popular video We should definitely do a part 2 of this video Everyone loved it me and Colleen had the best time filming it. There's so many bloopers which are at the end and Yeah, I don't know I I guess Everyone really likes that video how many videos do you have private 'add or? unlisted I have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 Videos on private and how many do I have unlisted oh hello another 1? 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 unlisted and that is because they're like channel trailers or They one is for like Evans Valentine's video and some are part of a makeup collection video that I did So it's not any that I absolutely hate unless it is just I don't need it on my channel But it's still available if people need to find it so I don't feel like that's so bad I know people who have put literally so many videos on private So I'm really really interested to know people's answer to that question next question is show us 10 seconds of your least Favorite private video a lot of these are like Live show like come and watch me. I'm doing a live show. I don't hate any of these I'll be completely honest, so I will just show you 10 seconds of Any of the I'll put ten seconds in of one of these videos enjoy and we're gonna go shopping again, but this time I actually Looks so gross today. I'm having I hate my appearance today And I just can't deny so I give up and this is just what I'm gonna look like But it puts me in a bad mood Which youtuber? Would you choose above the rest in your subscription box at the moment? So if every single person you had subscribed to all uploaded a video at the same time, which one would you click first? I feel like I'm very fussy with who I subscribe to oh My goodness one how will I ever pick one? I think at the moment. It's a cross. Oh can I do a couple I feel like this is way too hard Why did I give myself this question it would be mark Tania or Rihanna Ashley or also the ingham family I've been really enjoying their vlogs and so if I had to pick Oh If Rihanna and Ashley the Ingham family mark and Tom all uploaded a video at the same time I would struggle to know which one to click first because like at the moment Because I am really enjoying watching all four of those who would be your dream collaboration Oh? Nicole Scherzinger Adele Harry Styles Millie Bobby Brown um There is an endless list of people I would love to collaborate with I'd also love to know who you guys would absolutely Love to see me collaborate with I'm not talking like other youtubers. I just mean in life. I'm not saying it's gonna happen I would just be really interested to know who you think I would make a fun video with my main Thing when it comes to filming with someone is is this gonna be a good video Or are we gonna be too awkward? People standing next to each other not having the best time we can have which is why a lot of the time I don't film with people. I don't know very well because I don't think That would be the the best video It could be which is why I thought a lot with my friends and people that I get on with very very well For me it would be somebody who I know We would have that chemistry that were like so on the same page that it would be an amazing Fun video for you guys to watch and also for like us to film so yeah I would be really really interested to know who you think I would get on with really well in a video Let me know. What was the hardest video for you to film Oh like hands down when I first made that video about panic attacks That was terrifying because the minute you open up that side of you that is more vulnerable and more Open to I guess Criticism and you're kind of like laying it all out there and that has taken me years like to build up that confidence to talk very openly and to share really intimate parts of my life with an audience And even to this day. I still find talking about certain things hot and you know I don't talk about Things that like hit quite a core and for me my panic attacks were that so it was absolutely Terrifying to sit and do that very first video where I was like yeah, I have panic attacks And this is a thing and I hope this helps just one person I remember uploading that video and like physically shaking and being like right There's no going back like I feel like it was the best, but the scariest video I filmed to be able to do that and to know I was helping people Made it so worth it and I honestly don't know if I would be at a position where I am now with my anxiety if I hadn't done that because It also made me feel more comfortable With talking about it myself too, and it also made me think right I need help for this so overall It was it was the hardest video to film but probably one of my favourite ones I've ever uploaded because I think it made an Impact on other people and also on me if all your videos, but one were deleted Which one would you keep that's hard because after I've just said that about the panic attack video I don't know whether that's one that I would keep up because as much as it was hardly film I feel like it's probably not the most in motive. I like that when I watch it back I'm like I would have said that's a bit differently or oh, I wish I'd added that bit and I didn't so It would have to be one that I feel, but I have a lot of like connection with I do Love the how well do we know each other? With Alfie, I think that is one of my favorite videos my god. I don't know In all honesty. I don't think it would be a main channel video. I think it would be a vlog because Vlogs for me are more like video diaries. They're the ones that I want to watch back I never want to watch back and what's in my handbag or like a? Products, I've been loving or a favorites. I don't watch those back because once I've done that that's done, but for me vlogs are days, I want to remember and have captured and Those are my favorites, so I think it would have to be a vlog which vlog I have No idea let me have a look. Oh this so many that I love on here like this is just too hard do you know what I think it would be my birthday surprise the best birthday ever or meeting one direction and then this is us premiere or All the emotions with mark because that is one of my favorite vlogs in fact I actually have a playlist on my vlogging channel of all my favourite days so if you guys ever want to know which days are very special to me and which vlogs I Enjoy the most Go on over there. I'll leave a link in the description and you can watch all my like favorite or my favorite days I'm gonna throw it back to you guys. Let me know which video is your absolute favorite that you would Want to be the one and only video on my channel if I had to delete every other video Let me know in the comments. What is the best thing to have come out of creating a YouTube account making people feel? Something I see so many people just telling me how much I have changed how much I've helped with their mental health journey how much I have helped because Ah, I'm like a positive influence on their life or watching their watching my videos cheers them up and makes them feel happy and that For me, I think is the main Thing to come out of what I do is that I can influence people's lives positively and that makes me feel so so happy because I Don't feel like I'm trying to do that and it's nice that naturally That's just what happens because I don't feel that I'm having to try and force it I'm trying to like force people to feel happiness because that's not I mean that's not people want to watch But it it makes me so so happy like Right in my heart like to my core that for the people that enjoy watching me, I'm able to Make them feel Positive and happy in a day. They might be having that is not so positive or happy or if they're going through a very hard time or they're ill or they have things going on in their life that they feel they can't escape from I like thinking I'm that escape for people and That makes me really happy another thing which is amazing to have come out of this is new friendships I have met some of the most amazing people doing this and I moved to Brighton because of doing this like I don't know what my life would be if I didn't do it I'm just so so grateful that I get to do this every day and that I love what I get to do every day and Although there are days where it's so much harder than others, or there's more work than other days It's still so enjoyable for me to do and I honestly couldn't imagine not Doing this now, so thank you for all your support and just for Being the most amazing subscribers and viewers and whether you've been here from day one or you subscribed resides watching my videos last week you are Important to me and you are a key kind of reason that I am still here and able to do this and I'm also able to bring happiness to so many other people so Thank you very much, and that is like a really emotional Question I also just want to say as well the opportunities that this channel have Given me whether that is like personal opportunities like being able to buy a house or moving to Brighton, but also opportunities Like going on the Great British Bake Off which is like my all-time favorite TV program I was able to go on that being a part of band aid oh My god. What are the cool things were done books? Products like there are so many things that 19 year old Zoey that started this channel would have never even contemplated Could have come out of doing something that she loved so so much, and I just think that is like Mind-blowing and last question what one piece of advice would you give other youtubers? I guess it depends because if Your channel is kind of at the stage where it's really growing and everything is becoming a lot more serious I feel like my advice would be so different than to someone who wanted to start a channel from scratch honestly my biggest piece of advice is Stay true to yourself and make what you want to make because if you are making things that you Don't necessarily love or you don't really have a passion for or you're talking about things that don't interest you People are gonna see that if you go back through my channel and realize that I've been doing hauls and favorites for like 7 years. I make the videos I want to make I talk about the things I want to talk about when you feel comfortable and content with that I think people can tell and they get to see the real side of you, and I think that's really important with YouTube because People watching like that connection and that's where YouTube is so different from like films and TV because a lot of the time you don't have that personal connection with so no you don't feel that you have that personal connection with someone and Watching someone who genuinely has a love for something you can really see that and I love getting to know People's personalities and like who they are through their videos so I think that would be my main piece of advice Do things that make you happy? Don't do what you feel that you should be doing and have fun like have fun with it if you're not having fun There's no point doing it. So that is my little youtube tag I don't know what I'm calling it yet, so whatever it is in the title is what it's called. I would absolutely love Any other youtubers who might be watching this to Do the video tag me on Twitter so I can watch it. I'm so so interested to see a Privatized YouTube video clips and B Just to know all their like answers to all the questions questions the questions largest answered tag your favorite youtuber on Twitter asked them to do this tag and One of the questions I did actually want to put in but realize I didn't really want to limit the answer Because I think this should be a really long list Was going to be who are your current favorite? Youtubers I think it's so important to share the love and to give other people the recognition that they deserve so I want everyone in the description of their video if they choose to do this to list all the channels They are loving so after you've watched this video. Please go down into my description box and check out everyone I'm gonna be putting in there. I'm gonna put loads. I'm just gonna put every channel I am currently loving down in the description box and Yeah, that is that is the video, so I really hope you guys liked it It was nice to sit down and have a chat, and I will see you again very very soon. Bye 
 - Is there any card in my teeth? - No, then me?   No, only big teeth   We did not film together for about 18 years.   We only photographed with Mark.   Confrontation   You have something here   (shock)   You startle me, but what's that?   There are photo frames on the ground   Old Swan, our photo hanging on the wall fell.   Horse's   Alfie!   Someone in this room didn't like us   - What happened recently, Supermother Buddha - When you touch my face, that person is not happy.   Super terror   Someone didn't like me to make a movie together. Then I left.   Don't leave me   Hello, everyone.   There is a vlog that tracks me or Alfie knows   Can someone not see our vlog?   I often think about this problem   Although it's a bit digressive, people who follow IG may not know that you have filmed.   - I often think of this - I can't imagine   For those who do not know   I will paste our community account in the description   In this way, we can grasp our latest developments   We moved! ! !   Yaaaaaaa high-five   We have already moved   Moving is a time-consuming process   I think I like it now...   Is that photo? Take a show for everyone to see   We are still organizing a new home   It can be seen from Zoe's photo frame littered on the floor.   - This photo frame contains beautiful photos - super cute   It says M&amp;S Home   Packing and finishing takes more time than I thought   - More time-consuming than I thought - and more trash than I thought   I still have the vlog channel updated but I haven’t sat down for a long time to take a video.   So the background changed   We are in the studio   We have already wanted to take this theme for a long time   I let Alfie help me pick ASOS clothes   No, it's not like this   I bought clothes for you, I paid for it.   It's all my money.   I told Alfie this way   "Go to ASOS website to buy clothes that you think I would like to have"   No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no   Are you not picking clothes that I would like?   Not   - I like it to be the focus. - This is not the case   - Or are you buying the clothes you want me to wear? - 噢Alfie...   I thought so   This game rules, surely A buy the clothes you want to wear B   Hey... I think   Or you can buy your own clothes   I want to test if you know what my clothes are like   But I'm buying what I want to wear   - There will be a lot of women's personal clothing - no   Imagine if I bought underwear   No kidding   You're right   The clothes were bought by me 2 months ago while still in my old home   So I forgot what I bought and bought   I also placed orders twice because I accidentally bought my work pants for the first time.   Then I placed another order a second time to make sure that I didn’t have my pants inside   - OK - the package is not very big   Every time I buy ASOS   You also know   I always received several boxes of parcels, and I discovered that I bought too much   However, you are very small, and your jacket is so big.   My coat is very large   That's right, but this package is really small   - I bought 12 items - very good, I'm looking forward   - Do I have to open it in front of you? - The address of the package that has been on the top for a long time has faded. When did it ship?   May 6   Or June 5?   No, it's May 6th.   I don’t even know what I’m buying   - I'm so excited, I should come to play - it looks like Christmas!   I see brown clothes. Is that what?   When did you see me wear brown clothes!   This is the clothes I want you to wear   - Brown! - This is the clothes I want you to wear   not bad   Do not remove the label first, do not like it before you can return this can all be my money to buy   This is a piece of ... brown ... khaki pants   - Know why I will buy it? Hey Ganhe laughs like this - I don't know   Do you not like it   - Do not like - know why I bought this one?   Why?   Did you watch Liza Koshy wear trousers?   - Haven't seen - Her IG has photos of her wearing trousers   - Didn't read - super-looking   I'll give it a chance to wear it.   I believe in your choice   I just never bought brown khaki pants   The first thing to get this is quite funny   I got a brown ... khaki pants   We just mentioned that day   - You used to wear khaki pants - Look, khaki pants.   Please, it's black trousers, not brown khakis!   Anyway, I'll still try it on, I'll like it   - It will look good to wear - I can accept new outfits   I think so   I probably saw this pants when I searched for "slim trousers."   I just wanted to "buy one to Zoe and it would be perfect for her"   ASOS does a good job in this area   This is probably the reason I bought it, I am afraid it is all this way   This one... looks like   I will like it   I don't know which size to choose   You picked the right thing   I was surprised that this is very my style   Cream and navy blue stripes never go wrong   do you know? This khaki pants will be very cute   Do you think so? Only I think so   We wait until we know the result   I really like this, hello   This number 4, should be a loose version of the clothes   I like   -really? - Yes, I want to wear it with khaki pants   Does Zoe like it or not?   - I really like it. If she usually wears it, she likes it.   - How is it brown again? -Brown odor?   I have no brown clothes in my wardrobe   That's right, so open it   Hey, what's this? !   I didn't know it at all, so I just laughed like this looks like a wrinkled egg   - I like wrinkled eggs (shock) - Look at this   God this is what clothes look great   Model looks good to wear   It's a bit like a super loose Harlan trousers   - It must be nice to wear - I haven’t got this kind of clothes in my wardrobe.   Do you think it will look good to wear?   Maybe, and on the whole   - I may like it after I wear it - I think so too   When I was eight or nine years old, I also had one of these pants   Because this pants is very loose   Make ass look great   - But, I like - I think there is a style of IG on vacation photos   Correct   You can wear this garden-going pool   Then take photos from the top down and it will look like it is in the sea   I dry the pants into the water?   - Makes sense when I didn't say - good   Again this is...

It's almost 30   - Is this better? - Yes, I like it   I feel very good   - Not bad. - I'm not sure if I like it or not.   - I like Ah - it makes my head look small   - will not - a bit too long if the length is here   It will look good   It's too long. Do you understand?   But I think there is a feeling of leisurely at home   I have so many waiting for me to change my clothes at home   Do you not like it?   Do not like, the material is thin and rough   Quality is not very good, you touch and see   Even if you rolled up your sleeves,   - It's very thin - indeed thin   If it is a sweater dress, I think it should be lazy and this is not enough   What a pity, otherwise I like this color very much   Which is your favorite?   It's probably a black lace jacket and a pair of holiday trousers.   That's it, hope you like it   If you like, please like   Please also turn on push notifications and subscribe to my channel   and also...   Also subscribe to Alfie's channel   - A message tells me to do it well - Yes, please leave a message and tell him   I am quite surprised, I think you are doing very well   Maybe I should buy you too   - OK - I'll buy you next time   Thank you for watching. See you next week!  
 Hello all!   For the video of today, I thought it would be nice to sit down and go   a few new and exciting stuff that recently came in my PO box.   I have not done this kind of video for a while. I do them more regularly   on my vlogs, but I feel like me   this time of the year so much in my PO box, I was from, there are so many   great new products that I really want to share with you, so I thought: I'm just going to sit down   and do this on my Zulu channel instead of on my Morezoella channel.   It is truly the most beautiful spring day today and it makes me so enthusiastic   and I even have daffodils and I do not think I've ever been so excited for spring as this year.   I also have a lens with no lens cap here. Why is this next to me?   This is not from my PO box. I am a sloppy b * tch. I have to put it away for a moment.   Start at the beginning. Do you see this huge bag?   This is from Pixi. Pixi is a great skincare, beauty and make-up brand.   Oh! My hair struck me in my eye.   This is huge and so exciting. Pixi has worked together   with four great people. Let me turn this around.   Look! This is huge! OK. Ow.   Here we have Aspyn. Aspyn is a Youtuber,   I really love her videos. She has..   highligters released! Okay, that's very exciting.   I do not feel that many people will show this in the same way.   The next one is, let's bring something down, there we go, Judy's' Judy's life.   And Judy has an eye and lip palette, so that's great.   Here we have Maryam and she has, oh, these look cool   contour palette and a duo brush, ooh!   And last but not least, one of my favorite people,   Caroline Hyrens! There she is! and she has   A double cleansing milk is released. Very excited to try them all, they look great   and Pixi as a brand is just that good, so I'm happy about it.   You have one side and that is the solid cleaning oil, and then the second side is the cleansing cream   and you then do this first and then this one. Super thanks Pixi, for such   generous, great press release, and I am very excited for all the   girls who were allowed to work with Pixi, because what a cool collaboration!   Woah! The next thing in my PO box, this was! What a huge one   pink box and I was very excited when I took the lid off this box   and the beautiful golden and silver star paper   removed, to find all the books of Paige Toon.   So, one of Paige's books was in my book club, and what The One We Fell in Love With, and   I was absolutely in love with it, and in my video I said that   I really wanted to read all of Paige's other books because I love her writing style.   So she was very, very generous and decided to send me all her books.   So I think, I mean it will take a while before I've read them all, but I'm so excited about it!   My bookshelf has now grown considerably in large.   This is changing in a workout. They are all pretty heavy. Next we have this box of Benefit.   Which looks a bit like Kourtney Kardashian, do not you think?   Ooh, do you know what it is? I've said it before, but the press releases of Benefit are   always so impressive. Well, what do we have here?   I've never seen this before.   "They are real! Double the lip '   It has two colors! It is a duo of colors.   That is so cool. Variation of different colors. 'Criminally coral'   'nude scandal', 'juicy berry', 'fuscia fever', 'flame game', 'revved up red', 'lusty rose' and 'pink thrills'   And then .... I'm not going to lie, just lost a few brain cells.   Do not have too much to lose. And then on this side we have   the '' they're real 'duo eyeshadow blender. Huh, what ??   How do they come up with these ideas at all?   So I thought it was just two eyeshadows, but there is this little black sponge.   I am so intrigued by this. And I do not know where the press release is, so I can not   give you more information. How cool! Thank you very much.   I'm so excited about trying this out. The next is the Kylie palette, this is   the Royal Peach palette. Well, I love   so very much of peach-colored eyeshadow at the moment. I really love it. By the way, I even got peach color today.   In addition, I am just happy with Kylie Cosmetics and her eyeshadows are great.   Oh okay. I love these colors.   They are so beautiful. And I like it that there is a mirror in it, because they are not in its other palettes,   and it does have a mirror and now I can see through the day where my concealer is fading.   Oh god, I should probably have checked my face before I sat down to film a video, right?   So this has a number of different matte and shiny colors but also a brush,   a kind of blender brush, which is also very cool   bright blue color. You know what guys, maybe I'm brave   shall I try to make a look with the palette and then also the bright blue? Would that be cool?   I do not know, you tell me. I no longer really know what's cool in this time.   Charlotte Crosby, who is one of my favorite people, has a new brand   called 'Flique', I think you should say so, I'm really sorry if I say it wrong, Charlotte   with Easilocks, and she literally sent me everything   what she has and I'm so excited to try it out!   There is a highlighter gloss palette,   there is an eyeshadow palette in 'midnight moonshine' and another in 'egyptian sunrise' ..   She also has this, some matt liquid   lipsticks. You know how much I love matte liquid lipstick.   Oh my god, they smell great. Okay, this looks great.   'Nude on Fleek' and 'Charlotte'. Look, these really fit in my little street, so a lot of sense to try this out.   We have some stuff from Colourpop what the   Amanda Steele collection, which looks very cool. There are many   rather bright colors, which are not normally my thing, but the Colourpop   eyeshadow and lip products belong to my favorites   so I would really recommend trying it out. The packaging is very cool.   Look at this purple, it would look insane. Aaah,   this is beautiful! This is the ultra satin lip   in the color 'Jiffy' and this is my color.   We also have these palettes, are they the same? I do not know...   And there are four colors here, ooh they are very beautiful. There is a nude color,   a taupe, a dark green, which is my favorite color at the moment, and a very dark purple.   I also found this interesting. This is a 'silisponge'.   I had never heard anything about this before, so I said: 'Okay, let's see what this is all about'.   This is a silicone sponge to apply foundation.   It looks a bit like those things that are in your bras or that you stick on your breasts so ..   This is so weird! Wow!   Okay, I have no idea how you could use this with foundation   but I am very intrigued. Maybe we should give it a chance!   It sounds like a treat bag but it is not a treat. Ooh, we have some stuff   from YSL. Um, I love YSL very much.   It is a very nice luxury brand. We have a brush ..   What? Oh my god, it is the softest brush I have ever felt in my whole life.   It has a Y cut out at the end, that's crazy.   Oh my god, I am in love with this package. It is the contour palette,   the street and eye collector. Ooh, look at those colors   They are so present. I do not know if pink and red stand for me,   because I'm afraid I look like I'm sick or beaten   or something. But that is a very nice palette. Maybe I'll see if I can make something out of it,   but my first instinct is not to start with red eyeshadow.   I have the feeling that YSL is always so brave and I ah, I just - I have to be more brave.   Okay, this is the rouge. Oh my god, 'I have a blush on you.' "   I love this.   Okay, this is the most beautiful rouge I've ever seen, and it looks like a stone wall behind the logo.   This color.   We also have a Touche Eclat. Touche Eclat blur primer.   The Touche Eclat foundation is one of my favorite foundations. I really love it.   Oh dear! This has incorporated small splashes of gold into it. This looks beautiful.   The Touche Eclat foundation. Love it, love it.   This is just my favorite. I love this foundation. It is one of my top ..   five. Certainly - well, maybe top three.   Top five. Certainly know in the top five foundations.   So thank you very much YSL. Very enthusiastic about this.   I thought this was also cool. This is a tin box that has been sent by the London Tea Company.   And it has a few very good ones   taste in it. So this is, you have,   London breakfast, pure chamomile, vanilla chai, earl gray, tropical green tea,   peach and rhubarb, which I'm honestly most attracted to.   pure ru- I can never say this, it's like '' rude boy ''   as in '' ruboi ''. But is not it '' rubos? '' Rui-ruibos?   Raspberry inferno, which also fits very well in my alley, and boosting lemon and ginger.   Can you imagine that you are a bit ill and can just do that   no problem, I have some refreshing lemon and ginger. You feel right at home again.   I do not know why, but tea bags in my PO box really make me very, very happy, so I thought: I just share them with you.   The next package also made me very happy. This one says   '' The Glow Glossary by Becca '', '' The ultimate guide to your best shine ''   '' Discover the products to achieve your perfect shine '. Okay, great. We have a..   immediate face refreshing light primer, brilliant skin conditioner,   the opal highlighter, we have the   backlight filter base, and ... what is this?   clearing eye corrector. Oh my god, that sounds great.   Soft kabuki brush, I love these brushes. And this..   Soft, light fading powder. Oh yes, and this packaging is also beautiful.   And last but not least, we have the radiant skin conditioner   in opal, which I think is a cream. With the spring coming, I think this is really perfect.   Thank you very much Becca. Again, wonderful press edition.   I feel that everything in this video is so big.   This is a black box that says '' Gen Nude by bareMinerals '', so let's open it together.   It feels like Christmas. Every time I go through my PO box, I feel so happy and excited and happy.   Wow. Unbelievable.   See all these beautiful nude colors. I'm just in the nude sky at the moment.   If the nude sky was a place   then it would be here.   We have matte liquid lip colors, of which we all know that I'm going to use them the most.   Then we have radiant lipstick,   oooh, buttery lip gloss.   How do they manage to make me enthusiastic about lip gloss?   I normally do not wear lip gloss, but if you're going to call it butter-smooth lip gloss, I want to wear it.   And then top-lip pencil. Oh okay.   Wow. Wow.   How do I make a selection from this? I am always very strict.   When I get all this stuff in my PO box, I really do not keep it to myself.   I have to be strict for myself. Otherwise I would drown in lip products.   So I always make a pile for friends and family and then I give something to the charity   and I also give homeless shelters and women's shelters, because I think that is very important.   But how? Even if...   it's just .... there are so many ..   to choose from. Do you understand what I mean?   Okay, I'm very excited to try this out.   lalalalalala   I have this box, which I think is from YouTube.   So I'm going to open it up and share with you what's in it.   aaaaw oh   YouTube!   '' Dear Zoe, from a beautiful diamond button for the first female inventor in the United Kingdom   to multi-media businesswoman worldwide, you are a true inspiration. Have a phenomenal 2017. Vivian and the YouTube team.   Oh my god, thanks Vivian and the YouTube team!   That is cool.   That is very cool. It has pins on it.   Is this the Carpool Karaoke pin?   So, does James Corden know that there is a pin of him singing in a car?   That is so cool. Ah!   And then I have my own adidas tracksuit.   With '' Zoe '16' 'on the back.   That is so nice.   I'm going to be the coolest person with my own red adidas tracksuit.   Thank you very much YouTube. That is very, very kind of you.   This is a big box.   Look at this!   Here is '' Too Faced '' and it looks like a peach.   And I do not know if- oh, it says '' Zoe ''.   I do not know if any of you have picked up my obsession with the Too Faced peach palette in the summer,   but I was real -   but I was really obsessed with the Sweet Peach palette.   I think it comes back guys.   Sweet Pea- look. '' OMG, it's back! ''   Look at this now.   It smells like peaches. Literally this whole package smells like peaches. OK.   The Too Faced Sweet Peach palette.   Which I go so far as to say that it is one of my eternal favorite palettes in this entire world,   because it is full of the most beautiful colors,   smells like peach,   they mix beautifully, I've really walked here all summer.   It is just a beautiful, pragious palette. Very good quality.   But there are new things! These have not been released before!   Okay, we've got the Sweet Peach shine,   smells like peaches. Peach-infused highlighting palette.   Ah!   Oh my God.   I love it!   Is it acceptable for all products for my face to smell peach?   Because I want to use this all.   Oh my God. It is called "Papa Do not Peach."   Oh, my god, and it's a smaller version.   I think I am literally my favorite product from Too Faced ever.   How will they ever surpass this? There is 'Papa Do not Peach' on the rouge itself!   Creamy peach oil lip gloss.   Creamy peach oil?   I do not know what it is, but it sounds good.   Peach-cicle.   Yes. Fond of.   What is this name? Peach Fuzz.   See how beautiful they look. Just the packaging, everything.   And they all have these very cute little peaches on them that are very cute and happy.   And then, if you thought it was not enough,   It is damn a bag in the shape of a peach.   It is a peach bag.   It is a peach bag.   Does it smell like peaches?   No.   OK. Well, that was a lot of joy.   We have a box from Dior.   Ooooh!   Okay, this is exciting.   The Dior Skin Forever Foundation, which I have never tried before   but I'm really looking forward to giving it a chance.   We also have a beauty sponge,   and I think this is ..   the Dior Skin Forever Perfect Cushion Foundation.   Oooh!   How do you think about compact foundations?   I actually like them very much. They have better coverage than I first thought.   And then we also have the Dior foundation brush, which is beautiful.   And then there are these three small drawcord bags. How cute!   Oh, thank you very much Dior. I'm really looking forward to trying your foundation.   Another black box. This is from Hourglass and this is,   '' Girl: four letters that can change the world. ''   Oh yeah!   '' We are very happy to introduce a new lipstick collection from Hourglass, called: 'Girl: four letters that can change the world.'   Each of the twenty colors in the Girl lip pencils collection is a good reminder that we are all catalysts.   Oh, I love that!   Oh, look at the names! That is so cool! We have,   Believer, designer, discoverer, seeker, peace maker, performer, influence, dreamer,   Idealist, futurist, visionary, leader, icon, protector, warrior, inventor, activist.   I love that! This is so cool.   I think it's really cool that Hourglass is from the sort of   traditional form of press release have stepped and have chosen something that is very relevant to the current situation,   what I find very cool.   And the colors themselves are also beautiful. I never actually   a Hourglass stylo lipstick used, but they look   crazy.   I have this collection from Kiko, which also makes very cute, fun collections.   So this is their Matte For You collection, which   consists of many ultra-mat velvety products. Ah, mm.   And it is dedicated to Valentine's Day, which almost arrives!   I really love Valentine's Day,   because I think the clothes and make-up that is released around this time are all very cute.   Yes, look at this.   There are hearts, it is very beautiful. Kiko is indeed a very affordable brand.   This is called Loving Pink Flame.   This is something that I am very excited about. This is..   a brush.   But it is not an ordinary brush of boys.   There is a heart at the end.   A bit like the YSL brush has a Y, it has a heart.   How cool is that? It is so cute! I love this.   Very much in theme, but very cute.   We also have two pairs, um, matte nail polish, which -   I love this color. This is beautiful. I'm actually going to paint my nails in this color right away when I'm done with this video.   Then we also have a two-wait. Heart-shaped lipstick?   What the hell!   Ah!   Oh my God.   Look at this. Can you see this?   It is really in the shape of a heart. I'm curious how to apply this.   I am excited to try it out.   Ah, a dark red. I am so glad that there is a dark red.   Oh my god, how could you ever use it? They are so beautiful!   Ooh, we have some more of YSL here.   Okay, we'll take a look at that.   But I am very excited to share this with you guys!   These are the Barry M's new Matte Me Up lip packages.   '' Outline your pout ''. So I'm guessing that this is a bit like the Kylie lip packages.   You get a small lip pencil and the matte lipstick.   These are so affordable and so good. I love it!   Oh okay. They have also released the matte lipstick separately.   These are being launched in Superdrug on 8 February and in Boots on 15 February.   That is so exciting!   * drop products *   Oh my God. If you could see what is around me now.   Okay, eye-gloss smudger. Gel top coat. Glossy top coat eye gel. Oops.   For when you want a kind of shiny eyes look, do you understand? OK.   Cool, sounds good to me.   Mascara, volume effect faux cils, the Shock.   Yay, a new mascara to try out! I'm so curious about this!   And then we have a ten-color eyeshadow palette.   Ooh, that's nice.   This is a very nice palette. Although there are a lot of colors in between that I would normally never wear,   so I'm thinking about who I can give this, because ...   Oh, there are a few at that ..   I would definitely wear.   Oh my god, it's really a good 'night out' palette.   And because I do not go out very often ..   I kept it in the box because it made me laugh.   This is from Tarte and if you make it, it has this, uh,   small photo here, on which stands   '' Not been to the gym today, but ..   the name of the cashier in the McDonald's was Jim. So, the same idea. "   And that really made me laugh.   From the inside...   It is from Tarte skincare and it says '' Sweat your butt off, not your face. ''   What I found very funny.   We have a small, kind of, Tarte skincare gym package, which I think is a very good idea.   So you have the 'remove waterproof makeup with fresh maracuja wipes   the 'becomes radiant with the highlighting day cream.   'enlarge and protect your eyelashes against sweat with the lifting mascara and moisturize and color   with the extinguishing lip rescuer. That is so cute, and also   in this press release, where is '' Hustle &amp; Glow '', which I love.   They have added a fit bit, which I find very generous to A.   and B., a genius idea, because, as you know   it is the start of the new year, so everyone wants to be fit   and do a little bit more.   I have never had a fitbit. I know so many people who use it and swear by it.   And I am very excited to use this, so thank you very much Tarte.   That was very generous of you and I'm going to install my fitbit.   And..   watch how I get it.   I just had a little heart attack because I thought my microphone was not connected for a long time,   and I have torn everything out of the packaging. Can you imagine that I should have filmed all this again?   So that's all from my PO box that I wanted to share with you!   Thank you very much for watching, and thank you very much   to all very generous brands who have sent me all these nice things to try.   Give the video a thumbs up if you have enjoyed it and I will see you again very soon. Bye!  
hello everybody today I'm here doing something that I love doing that you all request quite a fair bit which I haven't done for a while and that is a Q&amp;A I've got some of your questions from Twitter and I'm going to answer them do you remember the first youtuber you watched I used to watch two youtubers all the time so the first one was panacea 81 which was Lauren Luke and the second one was oh my goodness so it was Leisha who is X spark egde I used to watch her all the time to be honest she is kind of who inspired me to take the plunge and do YouTube because I loved her videos so much have you ever had a disastrous interview I have done a fair amount of interviews over the past couple of years and there was one which I feel like I've mentioned briefly somewhere but the woman came to my house and she was just asking me all these questions that had absolutely nothing to do with what she was there for since then I've learnt never to do interviews in your own home if any of you out there are watching and so almost interview you go yeah sure let's go somewhere don't let them come into your house she was really nosy she insisted on seeing us like my wardrobe and I was like no it's not really that tidy and she asked me how I felt about the fact that Miley Cyrus's wit was really scantily clad and how I thought it was appropriate that she was a role model for young girls and I was like this has nothing to do with the interview she then proceeded to say when did you lose your virginity I mean how old were you then and I was just like obviously I did not answer that question but it was really awkward and I have had a fair amount of very awkward interviews where the interviewer just persists on trying to push you for the best headline they can get however some are actually really lovely it's right mixed bag what makes someone a good friend I love this question because I have so many friends who are all very very special to me so I think the qualities that are most important to me are someone who is caring caring is like the biggest thing trustworthy a bit weird I'm a bit weird and I feel like if there's someone who I can truly be myself with because they're caring they're trustworthy and they can kind of mess around with me as well that's like the best thing ever I think those are my top three caring trustworthy a bit weird or able to get on my level of weird what is the craziest fan experience that you've ever had year two of the Radio 1 teen awards me and how if you were leaving out the back and I think there was a woman who said your car's just out there and we were like okay and she sort of kind of waved us off bye see you later she essentially released us into a mob of viewers I couldn't see the car I was like okay right the doors closed behind us yeah see you later on your own now thanks for coming there was screaming running shouting I've got pushed up against I didn't even see the car but I got pushed up against the car and I really hurt my back and there was people pressed up against me against the car and I could hear them shouting look because Bay was stuck too because people were pushing from behind them and they were going stop it give them space and everyone was screaming but they could have moved because the people behind them pushing them I was just like Alfie like I'd lost Alfie and I was like oh I'm really sorry guys I'm really so I'm going to polite at this point I should have been literally just gone girl away my back was being pressed against a corner of the car I think it was the boot at this point there's still no one like helping us so then I think I I think I would like that in the end because I couldn't like cope it was all it was all and it all happened very quickly and then the next thing I know I was actually in the back of the taxi but I think that was probably the craziest fan experience because it all happened so quickly but but also in slow motion it was the weirdest thing and I just remembered it actually hurt my back yeah besides that I think when Alfie did his book signing in Waterstones and there was like eight thousand people outside and I just burst into tears I actually think I have a vlog of that is it in my vlog whereas in Alfie Spock I don't remember but I was just very overwhelmed it's a crazy crazy situation to be in and I was just like oh my god like people banging on I mean overwhelmed in like a happy way because I was safe in the car um but it was just crazy how is finalizing book three going on are you enjoying it I had so much fun on Saturday or was it Sunday I can't remember I handed in the first draft manuscript so it's all happening now I still need to do my dedications and acknowledgement but besides that the bulk is done and I'm so happy it was so emotional finishing the last line of the book in fact I almost cried I just really hope come November you guys love where I've taken it that's all I'm going to say can you remember the first time you got your period yes I can I was 14 years old I had a French lesson it was tutor time which is kind of when they take the register and make sure he's still there I think it's about 20 minutes before your last lesson and I was sat on this we had like high stool chairs and I remember thinking ah don't remember having a sweaty bum today you know those horrible black tight trousers that girls used to wear in secondary school I don't know if you still wear them now but we used to wear them the ones that when you walk in a puddle they like flared out so big and I just remember think it's not a particularly stuffy day so I don't know why I've know it's sweaty is that too much information is that TMI it alone so the chairs are gray like a light gray and I remember sitting on a corner for a bit I don't know why I think it's because they were just about high enough that you could have your feet on the ground so you people would just perch on the corners of them and then I moved away and I looked at the stool and I was like that looks a bit like a tiny patch of blood but I don't think it is maybe that was there before or maybe someone's drawn on it because my tutor was a DT teacher so there was a lot of pencils pens and it was the tiniest little mark and I was like no I don't think it was and then we went to French and I remember walking to French and saying to my friend is this if I sat in something is there something on my trousers and she looked but we had dark navy trousers which I feel like is the worst color if you've come on your period because how would you ever know and she sort of did the like walk behind me and had a little look I actually still do that now and the 26 year old sometimes if I have a little panic I'm like I'm gonna walk ahead and you walk behind me especially if you're in a white dress you get paranoid you get period paranoia and she was kind of like no no no nothing there I was like okay it's just a bit weird but what no point did I think goes the toilet and check I just felt like something's wrong got into my French lesson and we were sat on like her wooden bench and I remember being sat there for the majority lesson i scooted along I looked on the bench and I was like is that whit staining or is that blood staining I just don't know I got so confused I was like you know what screw it I'm going to the flippin toilet so I went to loo and I had nothing on me I was one of these people that was really excited to start my period I couldn't wait however I didn't have anything in my school bag just in case because I just didn't think it would happen at school I don't know why so I came out the toilet bearing in mind I think there was like 10 minutes of the lesson left and I think I just stuffed tissue in my pants I just hoped for the best and I remember being on the school bus on the way home with my jumper wrapped around my waist so I sat on my jumper because I didn't anyone to see just thinking oh my god it's happened there's no going back like I'm going to have periods now for years and years and years and I'm gonna have to go shopping when I get back I was really really excited actually will you ever write an autobiography I've had a lot of people ask me this and I just feel like my life isn't interesting enough yet not that I feel like it will get more interesting but I don't know um I feel like it might be something that I do on like my 30th birthday or in my 30s I feel like I don't really know if anyone would read that it's my life really that interesting I don't know maybe in like five years if anyone's still interested by that point there are definitely a lot of things that I wish I could say now but I wouldn't be able to because I really get in trouble or cause drama however in like five six years if I wrote an autobiography I could really tell it how it is now I think and it there's certainly a lot of stories I would love to tell let's just put it that way I've already sold you pre-orders go up on Friday I'm joking how was meeting one direction they're my fav and I need all the deets I realized I never talked about meeting one direction because they all followed but not all of them but a couple of them followed me on Twitter afterwards so I felt like I had to play it cool and not really talk about it story time I said in my last video it was one of the most nerve-wracking days I felt like I looked crap and trust me there's anyone you want to look your best for it's Harry Styles yeah I'm not gonna lie really fancy to him the only thing I was really worried about was that they would think I was really nervous and rubbish at interviewing them I have no interviewing experience so there was a possibility of that I interviewed them Harry and Niall and Zayn Liam and Louie so I had to do Harry and Niall first so I walked in that massive bouncer like walked me in and Harry took off his mic he was like sat opening his own room he took off his mic he came running over he introduced himself to me and to Don my manager who he called Don I think which was quite funny and then Don was like oh no no Dom and he was like ah sorry Dom how's that hones oh he gave me a big hug and he was so lovely he kind of just hovered around us by the door I think maybe he wanted a break from sitting in the chair and he took me over to this fridge that was like full of drinks and sweets and he was actually drink and I was like Mike thank you and he said what about a chocolate bar is that come on you need to pick a chocolate bar which chocolate bar do you want and I was like I have a dime so he gave me a dime bar out of his fridge and I was like thank you and I was like okay I'm a turd interview and I have a dime bar so I think I gave the dime Barton Dom and then someone was like Harry you need to come and sit down so he was like okay when I sit down did the interview he was so lovely as was Niall they were both really chatty and really sweet and he was like you did really well he fired me on Twitter afterwards I would love to know why he followed me because I'll never know because I didn't ask him to follow me and I didn't give him my Twitter handle so he somehow found it or asked someone I don't know I would love to know the answer that Harry if you're watching why did you follow me on Twitter and then I did the other three boys who were also all very lovely but there was just something about Harry and I'm not just saying this because I feel like he's always been one of my favorite members of one direction but he was just like a ball of like happiness and he went like above and beyond to make me feel okay in that situation and I after you'd followed me I did send him a DM and I said it not expecting him to ever see it and I said thank you so much for being so lovely and making me feel more relaxed because I was so scared I don't remember I said I wish I still had it maybe I do how would I find it okay he said thank you very much I hope you had fun and did a great job don't worry dot hope you're well Harry kiss kiss and I was like I think it was just really nice because they are just like normal human beings considering how bored he probably was he was so lovely that is meeting one direction if being a youtuber sometimes hard yes I'm not going to scoot around it yes sometimes it is hard which I think for anyone in any career they've chosen to go into they will have their hard moments and just because being a youtuber may seem really easy to some people because it's not something that they're working within or doing and I just think like with everything you're going to have you're down days and you're going to have you're up days but the difference is everyone else is going to know about them and I think that's the hard bit definitely besides that I love what I do so is it ever really hard or is it hard but I still enjoy it it's a very gray area because it's a hobby and I love it but it's my job and I earn a living from it and you know it's a big responsibility it's a job that wasn't a job a while ago so we're all learning and with the good days come the bad days and it's the same in any career in any job really so flash is my answer to that I feel like as always I've rambled on for far too long so I'm really sorry if this video is a little bit longer than normal but I did put two kind of epic story times in there for you so I hope you enjoyed those thank you so much for watching and give the video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and if you want more kind of chatty Q&amp;A storytime type videos and I will see you again very soon bye

 Hello! So in this video   I'll tie two of my most unpopular things, what they are   household and Christmas accessories.   Christmas accessories. I think I look at such videos as one of my favorites.   So I'm going to throw myself into it.   Where to start?   Okay.   So.   Christmas bedding   I do not think it will be for you   such a surprise,   that I am actually   she bought everything in Asda.   This was something Christmas I could do   put on your bed.   So here we have this,   which is a real thing.   It is called winter haze and is creamy and red   and just beautiful.   14 pounds. Also   I have this which is   have! Heavy and sharp!   I also have this, which   she is so cute. They're on it   kids on a sleigh, girl standing on a snowman,   this skate   and under it it's like   spotted. So when you turn the bedclothes,   there are red and white dots   and it's just so cute!   And then this one   is Alfie's nightmare.   He does not like flannel bedclothes,   because he is in it,   terrible heat,   I think he must stop whining.   And these are   so Christmas.   It's red and green   and a dark blue plaid.   These are so festive.   I'm really excited to be able to   have a bed.   They were for 19 pounds and they are also 100% of the cut wool.   Terribly delicate!   If you have never touched the cut wool, you really are coming a lot!   I also bought this.   Pillow covers.   Pillows made of cut wool.   These are a little ...   as if not as obscene,   I think I do.   They are so beautiful.   We stay with bedclothes.   So a little bit.   Pads.   Now   there are many cute holiday pillows everywhere.   This   is also from Asda.   I think he is my favorite.   And this one is a small square   and he's wearing   small dark blue trees. Like this pattern   but smaller.   And there is "Baby, it's cold out" on it (Honey, outside is cold)   in really beautiful   gold handwritten writing   and I adore it.   It's a pretty small square,   but it was just £ 5.   And she's so adorable.   I love him.   I also bought this one ... where was this one?   I think from M &amp; S.   Yes. Marks and Spencer.   That was it   in under 20 pounds! My God!   Nalo. God.   This was £ 19.5, so it was a little bit   more expensive, but shining!   Look!   There is "Let it snow" on it.   God, I love him!   I think he can   be quite annoying   unzip it whenever you want to turn it on or off again.   But I still think it's a great cushion.   Another cushion is this one.   I bought this in the Haskins Garden Center   and cost 20 pounds and is wearing snowballs   on a gray background.   I think this one would be   he thrown great on this.   Huh. He just looks as if he had   snow balls, but they're funny. And I think,   that you can use it all year round,   but they fit perfectly now because they are Christmas.   Other   is a little bigger   and beat even more expensive,   I really do not know how much he stood.   I'm just unpacking it.   He is from Boden,   where they have the most cute sweaters by the way   and actually some of the nicest Christmas things.   It's on it   on one side "All is calm"   and "All is bright" on the other. Bought   I'm on my bed two. So one   with "All is calm" and the other with "All is bright".   Apparently it is one of the best Christmas gift shops   Homesense. Now they're in Homesense   great things ... What are you eating out of my bag?   You must not! Do not eat my holiday accessories.   I bought the towels "Tis the season to be Jolly" ...   Tralalalala la la la la. And on this side   there is a mistletoe   and they are just me   side nice.   I also have Homesense ... I probably sneeze ...   or not. I bought   this Christmas garland,   they are creamy and red buckwheat.   I just loved it.   I think it would look nice hanging somewhere or something   interwoven in ... not in a wreath, like a garland ...   like, no ... I think it would look pretty nicely or wrapped around the stairs on the stairs.   This was also from Homesense.   This is a garland, a 6-foot Christmas garland.   It's a "Merry Christmas"   with metallic copper letters, so it's pretty hard,   but it just seemed nice to me.   Just think how nice he looks like on the fireplace.   And it's copper.   And with a little copper you will not spoil anything.   These are interesting to me.   Anyway, I can not remember where I am from. Maybe of Oliver Bonus, I do not remember that.   But they're the lights on the star-shaped table.   It's actually a flashlight flashlight. You can   put them on your dining table,   whether during dinner or dinner   during a meal with friends.   It's just   something extra and they are   as if on a small wire, so you can shape or wrap them   around the candlesticks.   I just felt nice and quite festive.   I think that's just a little thing   make the biggest difference.   So we're going away from Homesense.   Each year, the Next Fragrance "Festive Spice"   which smells great.   Actually, I have a diffuser in this room, thanks to which it smells like Christmas, which I am very excited about.   Plus   that's how it smelled like last year,   so it's terribly nostalgic.   They had this!   This huge candle   just with the smell!   Last year I bought, I suspect, with three knots, but it was a bit smaller and   more rounded.   This is a classic candle ...   twenty times larger.   It's huge!   But smells incredible.   I absolutely love her. If any of you is near Next,   so check it out.   Just jump and sniff.   I think this is worth mentioning.   This is a wreath hook.   I thought it was a long time at my door   I can not hang a wreath, because I would have to nail a nail and tied it to the wreath of a cord.   And it sounded pretty painful, and I was sure I would destroy my front door if I had to nail a nail.   Plus, most of my front door is glass.   So it would never work.   But then I discovered this.   This hangs behind the door   for one side, and hang the garland from the other end.   So you can basically hang a garland anywhere   without you destroying something or getting your finger off.   I think it's great. So if your parents do not have a garland on the door   or, I do not know, you do not leave it because I'm on the rails. Buy this, and then you can hang a garland on your door.   Or, I do not know, on all the doors in the house,   which I really wanted.   I will not lie to you. Perhaps you hang a garland and get it almost anywhere.   This is from the garden center.   She is pretty cute, wearing a wooden Christmas tree,   but you will also get ordinary   in John Lewis.   I love you!   Do you love me?   Do you love me?   Then I went to Hobbycraft.   Hobbycraft is super about Christmas, if you like DIY and you are creative in decoration.   In my study above, I have a small 4 foot tall Christmas tree,   there I am painting and resting and sometimes turning videos.   And from that tree I wanted to make the most striking   and the most strident Christmas tree!   So,   I found Homesense these ornaments, which are just amazing.   These are colorful ornaments.   Small, colorful, colorful ornaments, and I was inspired.   I think I can call it the most colorful Christmas tree you've ever seen.   Since I bought those I love, then I'm in Hobbycraft   bought these babbler garlands,   which wrap around the tree. It will look terribly unsettled,   but I'm excited about it.   Maybe I should have colored lights on it too.   And literally treat the tree with colors.   I call it a rainbow.   When I ordered a meal at Ocado,   so I noticed these.   These are ... I do not know where to give them,   because it is useless, but   this is such a return to the past for me.   I and Joe were wearing them and decorating a tree with them when we were little.   They are tiny and wooden.   Sant and trains   and little angels   and they're just amazing, so I just could not just leave them there,   because just ... all those memories.   The most amazing. They're from ... Gise ... Giseah Graham? Gisea Graham.   I wonder if any of you had these ornaments on the tree.   I feel most people have them, because when I showed them to Mark,   so he immediately,   God, I had you!   And now I've got them again and I'm really happy, but I do not know where I'm going to give them.   Eventually...   Now I'm not sure,   where it ... cruelty. Oh no, I broke it ... at your big Christmas tree   I did not know what style I should throw this year,   but at White Company they had some amazing decorations.   So we have it here   a bell that really rings.   So I bought a few ... I think this will be white and silver this year.   Mmm ... I've never done that before.   I'm here with you, as if you were as enthusiastic about decorating a tree as I did,   so I really apologize if it is not.   Then I also bought this with the inscription "Love".   I just unpack it.   And it's made   of silver beads. I think they will look adorable on the Christmas tree, so I bought you at the White Company.   And then they had so many small ceramic hearts and stars   and once again I thought they would be great for my white-silver style.   I would like to know how you will decorate your Christmas tree this year.   Do you have a topic? Are there any things that you can not wait every year to build at home? I mean, you got a box   and if that happens, you'll pull out your Christmas mat,   lights, hang the wreath on the door. I do not know how much you're doing this?   I want to know.   That's all my shopping for holiday home accessories.   I hope you liked it,   if so, do not forget to give the video like,   I'm going to go away because it's under those lights   and moreover, in this sweater, it is quite a pauper. So I'll see you   tomorrow again and I love you very much!   Hello!  
hello everybody today I can be doing my top drugstore picks I think I've done one of these before but it was years ago and so many of you have been asking me to do an updated one even people I'm meeting in the street are actually asking me to update this so I thought it was about time I did that for you it actually took me a really long time to whittle it down to my favorites but I'm really happy with the selection that I've got and it's gonna take me a wee while to get through and the sun's just come out and ruined my lighting it was literally gray and miserable right up until I press record and now the sun's out okay there we go where do I start I really love drugstore such high street makeup I think you can find some amazing things at a much much lower cost and actually a lot of these things are kind of Holy Grail staples for me regardless of the fact that they are cheaper so I will make sure to share those ones with you when I get to them first thing I'm going to talk to you about is makeup brushes because it's all very well having a bulging makeup bag with lots of amazing things to put on your face but if you've got nothing to put them on with is a little bit more difficult although using hands is fine so it may come as no surprise to you that the Real Techniques brushes make it into my top high street brushes the one that I actually am obsessed with is this which is their sponge this thing is amazing I think this is like my fifth one I go through these like no tomorrow they are so good they give you such an even um but also high coverage depending on how you use it finish and I could not recommend this highly enough love this they also have their bold metals brushes which are exclusive to boots these are my favorites I love that these are so soft they're a little bit more pricey than the kind of average range which you'll find in superdrug and Boots and online but these ones I just think look beautiful and I think if you have the budget to stretch to these I totally would I know so many people who sweat by these and I am one of these people I'm not sure why I can't really see out of this eye this one's fine this one not so much I'm not sure what's going on there God so kill every one of those days next up is Foundation I have a lot of foundation in my little Foundation drawer behind me a lot of which are higher-end having said that there is one high street brand and I absolutely love their foundations and I use them regularly in fact I use these pretty much 50% of the time alongside my NARS sheer glow and it is the Rimmel foundations I love these foundations so much I'm pretty sure each one of these has been in a favorites video of mine at some point this one is the wake me up foundation the next one which I think I would say out the three is the one I reach for the most this is the match perfection light perfecting radiance foundation the last one is definitely the heavier coverage of the three this is the lasting finish 25 hour with comfort serum skin perfecting full coverage foundation for me I think it's fairly obvious that Rimmel win hands down on the foundation throw for concealer I have two that I am absolutely obsessed with these are definitely Holy Grail items in my makeup bag regardless of the fact that they are probably the cheapest concealers that I own so the first one is the collection lasting perfection I don't even need to say anything about this everyone raves about this concealer its high coverage it blends beautifully it lasts well and it's just the best concealer ever next up is a new favorite of mine and this is the bourgeois radiance reveal concealer this is beautiful under your eyes it immediately makes you look like you have had the best night's sleep ever it blends lovely it blends lovely it blends lovely it blends really well and it lasts really well and I really love it it also smells of watermelon how have I already been filming for 11 minutes this is why filming videos to me is not as straightforward as you may think because I just sit here and I ramble and then when it comes to editing it I want to smash my head on the keyboard because I don't shut up for powder I found this one a little bit more difficult because I definitely more of a high-end makeup powder kind of girl however this one is one that I do use quite often and this is the Revlon Photoready powder it gives a really lovely coverage and it does make my skin look really like flawless is that makes sense so this one is definitely the one that I reach for the most in terms of high street powder in terms of contour I have to to share with you the first one is this one which is the collection contour highlight and sculpt kit I think this made it into a favorites of mine quite recently this is an amazing amazing kit the actual size of the product is great I don't think you need to go any bigger than this and any smaller I feel like would be a bit more difficult with your brush but I just really like the colors the shades work really really well and also the actual consistency of the product is really great it's really pigmented and it's really cheap and really cheerful and it does the job really well another brand worth mentioning when it comes to contour is sleek their contour kits are also amazing I don't have a powder one for some reason I think I either used it up or it broke so I got rid of it I do have a cream contour kit which is which is newly released from them I haven't used this too much but I just wanted to show you it because I have quite a few cream contour kits like this by much higher end brands and this is a really great dupe look at that and also just sleek for the powder contour as well because sleek is just really great at powder products in terms of bronzer there's definitely one brand that stands out over the others for me and that is L'Oreal I feel matte L'Oreal get bronzers spot-on recently a friend of mine asked me if there were any bronzers I could commend from boots or super drug and I instantly was like L'Oreal hands down and also the body shop actually I don't have any body shop bronzes at the moment but the body shop do some really great bronzers for very fair-skinned so if you're fair skinned to look in the body shop but L'Oreal I just love this bronzer is so great I love how it's huge it kind of reminds me of the Estee Lauder and Clarins ones and this one has a little teeny bit of shimmer this would be perfect for holiday or for summer and also just their little bronzers I love this this is also a Holy Grail product for me I always use this it's perfect for contour but it's also just a lovely color they just get the colors really well they're not muddy and they look quite natural like you really have got a bit of a suntan so I would highly highly recommend you checking out L'Oreal for bronzers blusher wise I found this a little bit more difficult because I have so many blushes from the high street first brands that actually stood out to me above any others is there something that sold in boots and Superdrug currently but they do sell online and they have quite a lot of their own standalone stores there's a store in Brighton and it's Kiko really really good value for money these are the same price as other drugstore or high street products and they just get blush so right and they are so beautiful this I've mentioned in so many of my favorites videos it's gorgeous this came out in one of their limited edition collections this one is a more recent one the packaging is so cute they do lots of different collections and bring out some really beautiful products within them and this one is this one's pretty recent they might still have this one in store this is the baked blush in 0-2 gypsy pink they're so pretty they also smell really great this is another one from one of their collections this is the blending wave multicolor rush to color blush really pretty colors and this is one of their like blusher bronzer or blush and contour kits so I feel like if you can get to a Kiko store or if you can buy online I would definitely check them out for blush they have some really beautiful ones and my whole drawer is just full of them two other brands that I really wanted to share with you that you can get in boots and Superdrug is the Max Factor blushes these are so pretty this one is the creme puff blush in a seductive pink which I've worn the most out of them I've got a couple of these they're just really really nice and also sleek again sleek do some beautiful blushes they have some really lovely blush palettes they just their powder products are really really great so I would definitely check those out if you can moving on to eye shadows now you guys know how much I love eyes shadows so this bit was a bit more difficult a lot of my eye shadow palettes are high-end so when I was going through my drawer I was like which one which ones of these do I use quite regularly and would I recommend to somebody who didn't have the budget for high-end makeup so these two are fairly similar although I would say one is slightly more pricey but the consistency of the shadows is different so two palettes both very similar this one is about what I done here this one is the 17 palette called easy on the eye this one is the sleek palette all night long sleek eyeshadows if you want one eye shadow palette from boots or superdrug I would recommend sleek sleek have some really great palettes with some really great shades and the actual eye shadow is really really lovely and because I couldn't talk about eyeshadow palettes without mentioning my gorgeous friend Tanya burrs new palettes which have just come out I had already seen these because she's already showing them to me and I was so excited to get my hands on them Tanya's eyeshadows and I'm not just this because I'm biased Tonya's eyeshadows are beautiful inconsistency kind of similar to or they're just so creamy they're kind of similar for me to stealer eyeshadows and stealer eyeshadows are some of my favorites they just feel so easy to use and blend and the colors are gorgeous this one is currently my fav this is the birthday suit I palette some really gorgeous shades in there and also there's just the cutest little mirror so Tanya's eyeshadow palettes which you can get in Superdrug this is also another new one that she's come out with and this is the enchanted dream I haven't opened this one yet but again beautiful colors in terms of slightly bigger makeup palettes though I don't really know of any brands within the high street ranges that do something similar to urban decay or Too Faced and technically you can actually purchase to face an urban decay in a lot of boot stores so I'm going to show these in here anyway but I think these are definitely more if you've got a bit more money to spend and you want one big eyeshadow palette I think it's definitely worth like walking that little bit of a distance over to the other counters in Boots and having a look at these eyebrows this one again is a little bit more difficult for me because I tend to use a Mac matte eyeshadow and an angled brush to do my eye shot to do my eyebrows most days but any time I've used a pencil the two that I would definitely recommend to you is this one which is the looks really monkey at the moment it's the Maybelline brow satin in a medium brown one end you have the pencil which is the bit that I tend to use and on the other end you unscrew it and there's a little sponge with the kind of powder pigment in it I don't really use that side that side scares me a bit and there's a dog barking outside that's gonna continue to bark okay well I apologize the dog because that ain't gonna stop barking any time soon so I can either sit here for an hour or carry on I'm going to carry on the other eyebrow pencil that I have loved and used for years is the soap glory eyebrow pencil however I do not have one because I just run out and as I was trying to look for else like tally I didn't buy another one so that is also one that I really really like it is a little felt liner on one end and it has the tiny little pencil on the other and those are amazing liquid eyeliner this one is definitely my liquid eyeliner of choice when it comes to high street brands and it is the L'Oreal Paris super liner perfect slim currently have two of these not sure why I think every time I go in it's just one of those things I throw into my basket it has a really fine pointed nib and basically this is how I learnt to do a Catholic because I find it the simplest and easiest way to do it so there we go mascara wise this is going to be absolutely no shock to you whatsoever I recommend this to everybody who needs a new mascara this is the Maybelline lash sensational in intense black love it love it love it I also wanted to add this one too because I love this one as well and if any of you have tried this and you didn't like it you might like this one this is the l'oreal false lash sculpt and again this is just one that i use a lot and have repurchased many times i honestly think this could be like my twelfth bottle of this last war on eyes i thought it only right to mention some of my favorite lashes kiss note that the ardor ones kiss lashes are amazing i featured these in my favorites quite recently so i'm not going to talk about those too much but definitely check these out and our dao lashes i love these they just feel very natural and they look very pretty and fluttery and i've just never had a problem with these another thing that they now sell in boots and my thing Superdrug is duo glue this is the best thing for applying eyelashes it's so good and it's also covered in something from my makeup bag from holiday it normally comes in a squeeze YouTube that ages ago you could only buy from Mac or online so I'm very happy that you can now buy it in a little thing like this with a brush so you can brush this along your fake lashes perfect very happy with that shut up dog can you not hear your dog barking stop oh my god lip liners okay so I have two brands that are great for lip liners we have bury em bury em do amazing lip liners in amazing colors highly recommend another brand which will feature quite heavily in my lip section is Nick's or NYX because they get lips so right and their lip liners are also amazing they have really tiny tiny little pointed nibs which make it really easy to line your lips with and again every color you could possibly imagine I have quite a lot of nude colors and actually these look pretty much the same in terms of lipsticks this is going to be absolutely no surprise to most of you that I'm gonna say the Kate Moss by Rimmel lipsticks Rimmel Kate Moss lipsticks um these again are Holy Grail lipsticks for me I absolutely love them I don't tend to really buy any other high street lipsticks because I trust these I trust the formulation I know they're going to look great I know they're going to last well and the colors are all really really good I have a few variations here I've got a dark nude the infamous 107 dark berry red it's beaut I have a pink this is number 35 really pretty and a much more nudey pink which is 38 which again is a Holy Grail lipstick for me so if you need a lipstick look no other place besides the Rimmel Kate Moss pop more recently I have been kind of obsessed with liquid lipsticks pretty much all I have worn for like the past four months so I thought it would only be right to feature some of my favorites from the high street first up mix this is just the only thing I've pretty much been wearing on my lips this is the NYX liquid suede in the shade sandstorm it's beautiful the consistency is lovely it lasts really well and then they also have these which are the soft matte lip creams which just feel a little lighter on the lip so if you don't like the feeling of liquid lipsticks you'll love these so I bought this one in the shade London and I have this one in the shade Copenhagen both very very pretty another brand that do this really really well are Revlon with these these are kind of a new addition and these are the Ultra HD matte lip colors they have lots of beautiful beautiful shades they feel lovely when you apply them and they last really well and then more recently my friend Tanya released some which I have never been so excited about in my life I haven't opened these too yet I literally got them like two days ago so I haven't opened these two but this shade is rhubarb and custard and this one is puppy paws these are a lot more pinky and one I actually have on today is this one which is Martha Moo which is a really beautiful pinky kind of nude I guess and I really really like it so thanks ton thanks for bringing those out they're available in super drunk one last thing which I wanted to mention which is a technically makeup but I feel like it falls under the same category and is one of my holy grail things I will always buy and that is the elegant touch nails I have some on today they're like super pretty sparkly ones I absolutely love them but they're just the best brand for stick-on nails you can get really fun ones I have got some flamingo ones or these ones which are just a really lovely matte kind of Navy shade and then you can also buy plain ones in different shapes so you've got these ones which are short oval or these ones which are the ones I generally tend to buy which is totally bare in square you can file them down if you feel like they're too you can paint these any color you want and they're just really easy to chuck on and they make having nice nails a lot easier I am now surrounded by a sea of makeup but I really hope you guys enjoyed this video if there are any other products that you would recommend to somebody from the high street put them in the comment section below and then lots of other people can kind of take your recommendations on board give the video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it I hope you've had a really lovely weekend and I'll see you again very soon bye

hello everybody today I nearly chatting you through everything I loved through January which is the longest month that ever existed and just feels like it takes forever to finish anyone else feel like that I just felt like January was never-ending I'm actually sat in my conservatory today which is different because I don't normally sit in here and it might be slightly more echoey so I do apologize if it is I do have a microphone like directly in front of me so hopefully the sound isn't too I quite like sitting down here I mean my little like conservatory jungle it's comfy it's nice and light it means I didn't have to bring my lights down and get my lights out and it's just it's quite nice to film in natural light which I haven't been able to do in such a long time because of winter I have a lot of things in January a because it is the longest months like in the world and be because I had like a bit of time off at the start of January so I found that I was using lots of new things that I hadn't used before and spending more time watching things and doing things so there's a lot of like beauty stuff but there's also a lot of like random things starting off with beauty stuff I fell in love with this product through January this is the glossy air priming moisturiser rich luxurious face cream this stuff is glorious I got given this at a Christmas party in December in like a goodie bag which was very generous of them and I've like used half of it up my skin is always really dry this time of year it's I guess especially bad when it's freezing cold outside and actually very warm inside because it's a central heating so I have been using quite a lot of this I love the consistency of it it's quite thick but then it does sinking quite quickly and it doesn't leave my face looking or feeling oily which I really appreciate hello used up a fair amount of that already I like using this in the morning but because it has a really lovely like soft lavender II smell but like fresh lavender like this sort of lavender that you would smell in your garden it's a really really nice one to put on at night as well so have been loving that sticking with makeup not a lot has changed you guys know I'm not too adventurous when it comes to makeup although I have been trying quite a lot this month so maybe for my February favourites there'll be a few like a few little makeup items mixing up my makeup bag a little bit but one product or two products that I have absolutely loved using is the Tarte shaped ape contour concealer I loved Hart they have a water-based foundation that I was obsessed with in like 2015 I want to say and that run out and I just haven't repurchased it and I'm using so many different foundations all the time I'd kind of forgotten it existed and then this came into my peer box this is their new one it did actually come with a foundation as well which I'm also enjoying but I'm enjoying this a lot more one of the things I absolutely love about it is the applicator it's huge and it makes applying the concealer so quick and so easy so I just dab it anywhere on my face where I feel like there's a little mark or there's a blemish and then another thing that also arrived which is supposed to be for use with the foundation but I Oh Nala is chewing an earth bullet hang on now ah no don't chew that can I have that or she's running off of it I have used brushes like this before and although I think the face brushes are really nice for blending foundation I just find them a bit gimmicky usually and the ones for eyes are like way too dense and round and too big for my eyelids usually this one I have actually been using to like blend in my foundation and I do think it's making it look so much better so this is the Tarte double duty Beauty brush but I've been using these two things together and really really enjoying them another thing I've been loving is this this is the Bobby Brown highlighting powder in opal glow now you know I love products like this I think I use this in my winter makeup routine I like highlighters with a very pinky glow to them which is why I love the Tanya burr peonies pleased so much which I actually have on today and this is similar to that but the pink is a lot more subtle and it's more as it says it's more open it's not quite as pink and the sheen is just that it's more of like a sheen but it's so beautiful and it gives your skin a really healthy glow another thing which I've been using in very small ways I guess is this this is the cover of X custom enhancer drops and I see a lot of people using these and I just think it's either makeup artists who know what they're doing or people that want to look really chiseled and highlighting but again they know what they're doing and so for that reason these kind of products sort of scared me a little bit because I I don't tend to use cream or liquid makeup product very often anyway but I just thought this screams like disaster and having like a shiny all-over face and let me tell you they are very very pigmented like unreal pigmented this is in the shade moonlight it's a really pretty kind of champagne e color and the reason I've been loving this is because I've been using it in very small ways in a sense that I've just been dabbing a little bit on the back of my hand and then taking like my ring finger I'm just dotting it I'm just popping it like underneath my brow bone so I've got it on today like down the center of my nose or just above my lip on my Cupid's bow I haven't attempted to like put it anywhere else but I should imagine this is beautiful to use on holiday like on your collarbones and your shoulders and your legs and things and let me tell you a little goes an extremely long way you'll have to excuse the fact that the Sun keeps going behind a cloud in an hour of a cloud I just can't help that moving on to body now obviously I've been using a lot of my zoella beauty snow Ella range which was over Christmas and I love that scent and I am still using it but now that the range is kind of all being sold and it's not Christmas anymore it has made me go back to the products that came out in the jelly and gelato range which was back in summertime because they are still available to buy and they almost get a little bit overshadows during Christmas when like the big Christmas gifting Rangers get like pride of place so I had this in my shower and I was like I'm gonna go back to using this I love the smell it makes me so excited for summer and it is the moisturizing body wash called shower shake I love this product so much my skin around this time of year is drier than normal and so using this in my shower does make a huge difference to how my skin feels I don't feel like I need to moisturize it as much and I love using this to shave my legs it's like the perfect product it leaves my legs feeling so soft without having to moisturize it's kind of like a two-in-one to be honest and it's the perfect time of year to be using it plus it looks cute in the shower when I do moisturize my body I've been using two different body moisturizers and one of them is this this is the Joe Malone blackberry and BAE body cream now this is hefty this is not travel friendly it's in a really beautiful glass jar and I bought it when did I buy it like towards the end of January so I mean it looks like I've barely touched it I just absolutely love the black cream base and I think it's my favorite Joan Malone fragrance and I bought it in the body cream and absolutely loved it and then some night times so I'm more likely to use a body cream after a shower in the morning if I feel like I need to but at night if I get out of the bath I've been using this this is luscious sleepy body lotion which I think got quite a lot of attention towards the end of last year or when it first came out because it's meant to really help aid your sleep which to be honest I've not noticed because I sleep really well anyway I am literally one of these annoying people whose head hits the pillow and I'm gone but the reason I really like this is I love how it feels and I love the smell of it it's lavender II but it's like sweet and soft lavender and it's also quite vanilla and it's just it's beautiful oh oatmeal infusion that's that's the best way of describing it it's like lavender has like married up with like an oatmeal smell so the two of them together it's like you could eat it lavenders not really the sort of said that you ever feel like you could eat although some people put laughing during cakes but I'm not a fan of flower cake flavors so I don't normally the lavender cakes but that's what this smells like this smells like a lavender cake I find it a little bit heavy for me like I do if I put it on I have to put a tiny bit on because otherwise I wake up in the middle of the night like a sticky hot mess but then I am quite a warm sleeper so yeah love that and then for hair I have been loving this this is the hair by Sam McKnight in cool girl I think there's a couple of these all with different like girl names and this is the barely there texture mist I freaking love this so much after I've done my hair I will tip my hair upside down and I will spray this everywhere like I've sprayed it on today and it just gives it more it gives it more texture it gives it more volume it holds everything really well and I love it I'm not as keen on the scent as some other haircare brands that I use like way and daven s but the actual product itself is so good but I don't mind that it's not my favorite fragrance it's not a fragrance I don't like it's just I don't really know how to explain it it smells a bit like when you pick flowers but like if you're picking flowers and then you sniff the stems like it's quite a grassy smell but yeah I like it it's amazing moving on to more random favorites these earrings these are little hexagon earrings and I have quite a few different varieties of hexagon earrings I feel like once I got my second hole in my ear I found wearing big hoops looked a bit weird I didn't wear them for a really long time because I just felt a little bit like having a tiny one and then a huge one looked weird I mean it probably didn't but it was just one of those things that I was like I can't wear big heaps ever again now what have I done and then I found these and they're so pretty and delicate now these are either from ASOS and I do think aces have some like this so it could be that they're from a sauce or these are from a brand that sent them to my peer box and I don't remember what the brand was which is really frustrating me either way you can get hexagon earrings like this pretty much anywhere they basically made me bring back my love of wearing bigger hoops so I'm happy about that so probably the biggest thing that I have loved through January which has completely changed my life is Sex in the City I've talked about this already somewhere I think my vlogging channel guys I've never seen Sex in the City and anyone who's like my age is like what do you mean you've never seen it oh my god that blows my mind and it blows my mind too I had a friend who was always trying to make me watch it and I was like yeah well but sometimes knowing there's a whole series of something that's already finished it's quite a daunting prospect so I just kept thinking one day one day one day I'll watch it it's not an important thing right now I'm too busy then over new year and let's start January and over Christmas I was like I have time I'm gonna start a new series watch let's start Sex in the City oh my god I was absolutely addicted every single day I was watching a new episode and I literally watched the entire 6 series and both films like within the space of about two weeks it's amazing I love the characters I love the fashion I love the storylines I love the friend ness of it that's not a very good way of describing it but I love like their friendship dynamic and if you've not seen it you have you just have to watch it it's so funny as well I'm obsessed and I already want to go back and start watching you from the beginning another TV series I watched and absolutely loved was big little lies again another TV series that my friends had told me to watch specifically tan she was like you need to watch it so good it has Reese Witherspoon Nicole Kidman and oh god the girl from The Fault in Our Stars why shailene woodley it's just really great again I love the friendship dynamic Reese Witherspoon in that series is like my favorite version of Reese Witherspoon I just love her character so much and it's one of those things that I can't really tell you about what happens because what happens is the whole series and I don't wanna give you any spoilers but if you're looking for a new TV series to watch check out big little eyes it's great for Christmas Alfie very kindly got me an iPad pro and I was stuck to this thing at the start of the year I was doing everything on it I was coloring in on those like apps but the thing I spent most of my time doing was playing rollercoaster tycoon growing up me and Jo always played a game I think it was on the PlayStation called theme park world and we loved it it was amazing you had to build a theme park well you had to make sure everyone was having a good time you had to hit goals you had to make money you had to extend the park you had to up rides like it was great and over Christmas me and I'll feel like we should both get a game that we can compete with each other on because we do tend to do that sometimes we did it with like Farmville and like there was another one where you had to build a kingdom like every now and then we play those ones the ones we've got to like wait a certain amount of time for things to happen I don't know what that's called I've just been so obsessed of it to be fair I've gotten a bit busy now so I've not played it in like a couple of weeks but through January oh my god it was like the best thing ever every day I even this sounds really bad I even took it to a meeting so that I could tap all my rides to get the money I mean it took two seconds and we were allowed lunch break so it was fine but everyone did laugh at me when I whipped out like my iPad Pro and they're like oh wow you aren't taking notes I was like no I've just got collect my money on my ride some roller coaster tycoon yes if you've not played that game before and you're looking for a game or a major life distraction get roller coaster tycoon last thing which is gonna be absolutely no surprise to anyone who watches my vlogging channel my last favorite is the greatest showman that film is in sane I just feel like it's already gonna be my favorite film of 2018 and I watched it like the second week of January it's amazing it's an original musical film it has Hugh Jackman in who I fell in love with when I watch lemierre's because he was like singing and acting in that so I was really excited about the prospect of watching it and I'd seen a trailer for it like at the end of last year and I wasn't like too bothered about seeing it I didn't watch the trailer and think oh my god I must see that but it was in the back of my mind because I love musicals and I love Hugh Jackman and it had Zac Efron in it so I was like I feel like it's a great casting I'm just talking about how much I love the greatest showman I know so then me Alfie and our friend Holly we went to see it just randomly like we weren't we weren't like all like oh I can't wait I can't wait to see it so down and it's like the second the film starts you are hooked and you have goosebumps with every song and the actual storyline is amazing it feels like the film lasts half an hour because you're so invested in it and then in fact the cinema clapped at the end of that film it was so good two weeks later we're watching in cinema again I have never seen a film in the cinema twice in my entire life that's how good it is and I want to see it a third time I didn't feel like it was only fair to say how much I loved the film without saying how much I loved the soundtrack which I think makes up at least 50% of why I love the film because the soundtrack is incredible everyone I know who I've told to go and watch this film comes out of the cinema and immediately wants to listen to the soundtrack I think there's some kind of like hit like hypnotizing thing going on because it is weird how everyone is obsessed with the soundtrack after they've seen it it's just amazing if you've not yet seen it you have to go and see it sorry this favorites has been so long I really hope you enjoyed it it was a little bit more rambley and I don't feel like I'll edit too much out of this because it's just a bit more chilled I can see some pigeons having sex in that tree can you see them yeah there's Valentine's sex pigeons anyway guys thank you so much for

It's disgusting   And I also love   Choose books   I think stories and books are personal to everyone   I suspect   That people can take something from a story and a book   While others probably do not   And it is really something   Related to how a person feels   For their way of seeing, reading and feeling a book   And so on   Choose books   I feel like a big job   And to urge that he chose the best   eight   To share with you friends   Important to me and   Love it so much   So I feel like this tour   A little variety   In species and stories   And   It has somewhat seasonal books   And that is what you will see   I can say 100 percent that in these eight books   There is something for everyone   I am very happy and very confident in saying so   I will not go into many details   In regard to the eight books   In this video   Because I will talk deeply   About each one   On the WHSmih channel   And their site which I will leave the link to below   You can take a look there   As before   Each address will be given two weeks   To be the chosen address   There will be discussions from the book on Twitter   And questions   And in fact   Go and participate in this   Because even last time   I was watching them talk   And   Read all exclusive questions and answers   And exclusive interviews with the book   And   I   I find them very important   Because you take all your time   And your imagination in the book   Very beautiful   Ability to learn more   From the person who invented it   For whom the story means   Everything to them   And you eat a lot of books   Which I read and   Things you did not hear and did not know   Or think about it before   And all the writers are wonderful   And assistants   And proud of their books   This is very nice to see   Subscribe if you have any questions about books   This is her time   If each book will be somewhat selected   For two weeks   And during that time   It will be half price   If I book the beginning of a club reading this   He, where is he, where is he?   Here is his title if i was your girl to meredith russo   Without much details the story is about   A girl trying to figure out her way in relation to   Friendship, school, romance   And in life in general   I think this is a very important book and I think that everyone should   Read it and I will talk about more details   but this . I loved him so mach   And again every book you choose   The Reading Club has an exclusive cover for WHSmith   They are all wonderful and beautiful books together   As you know, I love horror and excitement   So reading this type at the time of Halloween   I think it's perfect   This book is named Frozen charlette for alex bell   Scary and wonderful   I do not recommend reading it before bedtime   But I loved him   He talks about a girl called Sophie who goes to her relatives' house   And a lot of scary things happen to her   About those frozen Charlotte clay dolls   The front cover says   We are waiting for you to come and play   Scary and will never look at Chinese pottery dolls the same way ever   Next is this book that I love its cover   His name was i here for gayle forman   I always love to look at your tips on books   And many of you advised me to read to this writer   This is what I did and loved this book   At first there is a girl called Cody   And her friend Meg, who committed suicide recently   There is some ambiguity in it   He is very poetic and his story touches the heart   About how to adapt to this girl after the loss of her friend   It is incredibly full of sensors   A wonderful book and I recommend it a lot   It is just a wonderful friendship story   And a little romance there too   Next is a mo, ster calls for patrick ness   This book ... is awesome   He talks about a little boy whose mother is very sick   Uh Saab to explain without exposing the story and burned it, but the imagination in this book   Very cool and playing with your heart   You'll need paper tissues to read   I think it's a movie now and it's what makes me so excited   Because after reading the first thing you want to do is watch it   You understand, what meaning?   I think you understand that you read it   Next is the twelve days of dash and lily for rachel cohn and david levithan   As is evident, twelve days   And the fact that it is wrapped as a gift   As it revolves around Christmas I can not read the excitement there   About Hellen and Loud   There is nothing related to Christmas   Because you know how much I love Christmas   And I feel that nothing is better than hearing songs around it   Watch movies around it and also read about it   They say that fantasy will give something   Better than anything you can watch   So I thought a book about Christmas would be great   Talking about a boy and a girl Dash and Lily   They are a couple a year ago   He is about Dash and he is her lover and I think   Create a Christmas spirit and a night spirit   It is a very loving story and after   I read it and wanted to replay it all again   Next is lying about last summer   You can not hide the truth for Sue Wallman   This story is once again a story in which the twists and turns are stirred   And everything is wonderful around   It has a touch of love and romance   With meandering and big events I do not want to give a lot of details in it   But I loved this very much   Next is a book you can see me talking about   Previously in one of my favorites and I was very happy   To put this in a reading club   I love this story and it is to Sophie Kinsella   His name is finding audrey   This talk about a girl suffering from a neurological disease   It also has a little self-discovery   And romantic enjoyed it a lot because it has qualities   In Audrey I could see it in myself and I think it works very well   When you read a character and be "I do this"   I really like her personality   In general, I advise you to try it   Finally and much better   Little fun, romance and truth   As a rollercoaster of sensations you should b   paige toon the one we fall in love with   About three women have something in common   It is the same man that kind of books   You can not stop turning pages I love and I think frankly that everyone should read it   And here we are all these books for this second round   From the reading club and which I am excited to share with you   Let me know in the comments that you have read any one of them   And your opinions about it   Without burning details   And any of them is at the top of your list to read   Because I am very interested   Do not forget the next 16 weeks will be there   In-depth reviews on the WHSmith channel   Which I will leave at the bottom   There will be interviews with the authors   Extra Seasons and great events   In each of these stories   Which I advise because I love her   All these are for each book   And that's all I share with you in this video   Thank you very much for watching and to stay here   And in this reading club and your interactions in it   She was wonderful and loved to see you read and enjoy   And it is the most important thing   Choose a book that you read when you do it and pass it on to someone else   Will love it   If you want to read it all, buy the eight books   From the Internet you will see links at the bottom   But for one week prices will be low   Take a look at the site   To be successful and there seem to be a lot of book dorms here   And you did not want only one or two, but all   And I applaud you and hope you enjoy them   It was a sauna for us so I would go   I wish you a wonderful week   Sarakem at the weekend   I love you and I will see you again soon   Bye  
 Welcome everyone. Today I will teach you how to make this bronze.   Which I think is perfect for this time of year   Or if you are like me you can fake tan for your body but when you start with the face everything becomes completely wrong   I always deleted bronze at this time of the year so I thought I should put bronze makeup on this video   let's start !   I finished the humidifier so now I will start   I will use the foundation cream of Nars Sheer Glow Foundation in Mont Blanc   Because I love this foundation cream very hard   I forgot my foundation cream bedding   Currently I love "Stippling" brushes   So I'll use the "Real Techniques Stippling Brush"   I will put the foundation cream on it   I feel that the cream of Nars Sheer Glow is the cream that has always come to him   I love it so much   Urban Decay Naked Skin Concealer Now I will use   Which I love very much, you certainly know for what degree I love Xavi's flaws   Now I put it on any random pigments or flaws in my face   Collection Lasting Perfection I will put a little bit of Concealer in Fair   Under my eyes directly   And yes I put a lot of flaws   Especially when I wake up and wonder Have you slept the night before yesterday? What are all these dark circles?   Real Techniques Setting Brush will also be used   I like this brush in incorporating Xavi defects   Take longer than combining it with your fingers or with a base cream brush or sponge   But I like it more and feel it makes it last longer during the day   I'm not sure, I'll show you what I mean   I finished with my flaws   I will use the Luminous Light powder   Sigma Large Powder F20 I will use a brush   I have already spoken a lot about this powder so I will not say much about it   But I love it makes the skin glowing   Which I think is necessary for this appearance   So I love to use it now   I will do a little "counter"   "Anastasia Pro Series Contour Kit in Light to Medium Tray"   I will use this color almost brown   Charlotte Tilbury Powder and Sculpt Brush I will use a brush   I will put a little under my chin   Now I will put a little   Urban Decay Eyeshadow Primer Potion in Anti Aging   I will put it here   here we are !   The next thing I will put is the bronze   Which I think is the basic part of this appearance   I feel that many people are afraid to use the bronze   I know it's easy to overstate   But I feel it ... Can you really put the bronze in the summer?   Hourglass Ambient Lighting Bronzer in I will use Bronzer Radiant Bronze Light   I like things that contain a little flash like this   I think this time of year is the best to use things like this   In the rest of the year, the most commonly used types of bronze were used or containing the least possible amount of flash   But for the bronze look I think he should go out of the usual in the Bronzer   I feel that the basis of the bronze is to make sure that you pull it down the neck   Because you do not want to appear in a very bronze face and a neck completely free of bronze   Because I want to keep that look bronze I do not want to add too much color in the cheeks   But I will add a very small amount   Becca Champagne Collection Face Palette I will use   I will use this color   I will literally put as little as possible on my cheeks because they are of a very strong color   Real Techniques Fan Brush and using a brush   I used to throw brushes that way away   Liquid myself: What are these brushes used mainly?   I felt they were confused   I was always wondering in what use these brushes?   But recently they have used them for "highlight"   Because ... I do not know, put it in a very good way   It gives you a very luminous touch   I will literally put as little amount as possible because as you will see this lighting is very strong   It is from the same pack as Becca Champagne Collection   I will use this color here   Facial makeup is over   The only things we need to do now are eyes, eyebrows and lips   Let's start with the eyes!   Too Faced Sweet Peach Eyeshadow I'll use a tray   Because you know how much I like the colors of this box   Sure I hit a color with my finger   I think these colors fit perfectly with this bronze appearance   The colors I will use are:   First in the eyelid fully CARAMELIZED   Currently I put the color randomly because we will integrate it anyway   Sounds a bit scary   I'll have this color LUSCIOUS   I will put it in the inner corner of the eye   I'll have a smaller mattress   This tile is Clover Deluxe Crease   I will put a few of them in the inner corner of the line of lashes   Using the same brush, the color will be CARAMELIZED and placed in the outer corner of the lower eyelashes line   And using the Sigma Blending E25   I'll put the brown color CHARMED, I'm SURE   Now for my fans I will combine these two dark colors from the Mac Eyeshadow in Mystery &amp; Charcoal Brown box   Because I got a tattoo for my eyebrows so they're darker now than usual   But the annoying thing is that I do not know the names of these colors   This is named MYSTRY   CHARCOAL BROWN This is   For the information, I advise you to get a dye for your eyebrows that is very cool!   Makes life much easier   It probably does not make life easier, but it makes eyebrows much easier   I will use a Mac 266 brush to put them on my answers   I finished one! , See for the difference between eyebrows   I always feel that my eyebrows are scary before I put anything in my eyes   Well, they're really dark, what did you do?   I'll use a little of Benefit Ready Set Brow   Maybe I should have finished my eyebrows first so I can adjust them   Let's remove some of the eyebrow powder   Do you know, sometimes the game of eyebrows stronger than the color hand more than the hand .. "strong eyebrow game"   Do you understand what I mean? You know what I mean   Are they a bit dark? are they !? I can not identify   I think I have to put the muskra and I can take my decision after that   For mascara I will use Smashbox Indecent Exposure   Which I am currently obsessed with   It is beautiful and makes your eyelashes beautiful   If you do not like dense eyelashes, you probably will not like this muskara   But I love the kind of mascara that makes the eyelashes thick   What I do not like is that the masquerade is printed on the bottom line of my eyelashes to destroy everything I have done before   Look at the difference between my eyelashes now   Am I very close? Probably yes   Clinique Bottom Lash Mascara I will use   Because it's the only thing I can put on my lower eyelashes so that it does not end up on my face the rest of the day   I hold my breath   The camera returned to focus   I will put a little of Benefit High Brow Glow under my answers   I will draw it directly under my answers   The pens that like this after you paint your hugs are saved for life because they look great!   I will add it to my fingers because it is a bit thick now   Do you know, after I finished my eyes I feel like we can put a little bronze   You know it's a bronze appearance anyway so I'll add a little bronze   Very bronze   Because this bronze appearance and bronze eyes strongly I want to keep the lips normal   So I will choose the lips a natural light color   To determine the lips I will use a specific Barry M Lip Liner in 17   My mirror is very far away from me now and I think it is not the best thing during a lip-specific setting   I thought I had to put a lip balm before starting this   I can use this specified as lipstick without having to do anything else   But anyway I'll put a little more on top of it   NYX Liquid Suede which is   In "Sandstorm"   Every time I put lipstick, all of you start asking me what his name is.   Let's wait for it now dry, when it becomes wet, it is very beautiful   Now there is still liquid   Well, this is the last appearance   I'm obsessed with him   I know that by the end of this summer I will be using the bronze much   I love this bronze!   I think it is he who made this beautiful lipo appearance from the foundation   If there is a time where you can over-set the bronze it's definitely summer time   I hope you enjoyed this tutorial video   If you enjoy making sure you click the Like button for the video   And write me suggestions for other things you saw on me or you think I should try   I hope you have a nice week and I will see you again soon, goodbye.  
[Music] hello everybody today I am going to be chatting you through some of the things I think would make amazing stocking fillers all the things I've curated are under 20 pounds so I'm not going to be giving you prices I will leave everything in the description box so if you're interested in buying any for your friends or family or even for yourself then the links will be down below but I'm not going to chat through each price because we just know it's under 20 pounds I think the under 20 pound price point for Christmas presents or stocking fillers is probably the most useful for me because generally like bigger presents are slightly easier to buy and it's the smaller things that you want to put in stockings that you still want to have like some meaning and you want the person that you're giving them to to really like them and I just find the smaller presents really really difficult I also think that these are great for Secret Santas if you have like an office party or you're meeting with your friends and you're all doing Secret Santa and you have a budget I hope you find this useful there's quite a random mixture of everything I don't really have categories I've just selected all the things I love but I think you will - or at least someone you know I'm going to kick it off with Beauty the first thing that I personally think I would absolutely love in a stocking of mine this year hint hint is one of these this is a Emma Hardy cleansing balm in a little metal ball and you open it and you get a travel size now and you also get a little flannel I think this is great for someone who might want to try out the cleanser because as you guys know it is one of my favorite cleansers ever but also I actually have a really large tub of this so whenever I go away for a weekend I'm going to stay at someone's house I take my huge ass pot with me what I could do with it a travel-size pot so I just think this is the perfect gift for any skincare lovers or any Emma Hardy lovers another ball I love this packaging I just think it's amazing this is by Charlotte Tilbury I absolutely love Charlotte Tilbury she has some amazing products and she has some really amazing Christmas beauty kits but sticking with the under 20-pound budget you can get yourself this and inside you get a mini eyeliner in black and you also get the legendary lashes mascara a little mini one which again are great for travel but also great for people that might want to try out any new makeup or give the Charlotte Tilbury makeup the go the next thing I have is by my lovely friend Tanya burr who also has a range in super drug and her Christmas products are amazing there is something for everyone of all different price ranges including lots of different products within them and I think although I love her makeup products all year round I think her Christmas boxes and kits and gifts are so adorable I absolutely love them and they are a very good price so this is magnetic and opens and this is called the beautifully defined now it was really hard for me to pick a favorite to show you guys in this video because I loved all of them but this one was hands-down my favorite so you open it like this and then inside you have a little mirror you also have these three beautiful eyeshadow shades I think that's what sold me you've got silky pajamas cuddle me and baking brownies but all three of these colors are like my go-to nude colors you also have a highlighter in champagne shimmer and a bronzer in caramel kisses or caramel kiss and then you also have a little mini liquid highlighter I love this moving swiftly on to something of mine because it wouldn't be a stocking filler video if I couldn't include a few of my products because they are pretty much all under 20 pounds this I think is one of my favorite things that I have released this year into the gifting range and Superdrug and this is the secret Center inside it has all of the fragrances I've ever released in miniature form I just feel like everyone needs miniature perfumes I think these are the perfect gift because there's also four different scents so I feel like there's something for everyone oh look I'm going to spray this one this is the gingerbread one they're also in glass bottles as well so they're really lovely quality next up is this this is the pixie skin treat best of bright and this has three mini pixie products in it pixie again is another skincare brand I absolutely love and I think are of a super reasonable price and I think a lot of people would love to receive this whether they're already a fan of pixie or they've never discovered any of the products before this would be perfect it comes with a glycolic glycolic speak today it comes with a glycolic cleanser exfoliating toner and a purifying mask again perfect for travel and also just super cute everything in miniature is just so much cuter last in the beauty is this this is Neil now neon is quite a luxury brand they're oils and candles are quite I don't know they have a slightly higher price point however this is under 20 pounds and it is the cutest little stocking filler ever I would absolutely love to get this in my stocking this is the neon organics all I want for Christmas is a moment of calm bath shower oil and farm collection so inside this you get a little de-stress hand balm and you all to get a bath and shower oil these oils are incredible so if you know someone that needs a moment of karma Christmas I'm pretty sure they would love to receive this although I know this is for under 20 pounds I do just want to quickly show you something else in the Beauty category that's 22 pounds so if you have a extra 2 pounds and this is the only product where I've gone over I just thought it was worth sharing with you because I love this so much and it is the Too Faced melted Merry Christmas ultimate liquefied lipstick set you guys know how much I love these and to have minis in a little kit in Christmas packaging I think is just the most perfect thing you know someone who loves their liquid lipstick or who loves wearing lipstick in general I think they would really love this it comes in four shades you've got chocolate honey Chihuahua fig and Lady balls which is matte I just really like that if you have the extra two pounds and you know someone who loved it I thought it'd be we're sharing moving on to more lifestyle bits and pieces I have this which I really like this is by monkey and I got this on a sauce this was only 10 pounds and it is a sleepy candle in the scent bubblegum I've never lit a candle with the scent bubblegum before but I just thought this looked so adorable how lovely is this packaging oh and the actual candle is so cute speaking of candles it's a zoella lifestyle candle again it just would have been really weird black candles and not include one of my own so I mean I should probably stop apologizing for mentioning my own products at what point do I get to stop apologizing for mentioning my own products so this is the gingerbread candle this is exclusive to super drug and you open it like this it's like origami goodness and you've got the candle in I'd has a little safety thing on it that you supposed to remove before you burn it my gosh it's gingerbread it's called gingerbread village and it smells of gingerbread it smells incredible I just think Oh to Christmas this would be the perfect gift oh and also once you open the box it has this inside I just don't know how anyone could throw the boxes away like the box is one of my favorite bits obviously the candles great - oh hello Nala welcome to the video another thing that I think is quite a nice little stocking filler is tea that might sound kind of boring and I don't mean of the kind of PG tipps variety although if you know someone who's a massive fan of PG tipps I don't know what my dog eating hang on what you eating but yeah if you know someone who likes PG tipps why not I mean if they need stocking up do it you can buy the bumper box um but actually there are some really lovely tea companies that make the most amazing different flavors and mixtures of tea and I don't know it's just the sort of thing that you don't really buy yourself but it's nice to receive I don't know I could be the only one there but I have to to show you so this is from a company called Bluebird tea company who are based in Brighton they do some of the most amazing teas you've ever seen and they're Christmas gifting is so cute this is like a big clear bubble filled with my favorite festive tea that they do they do a number of different flavors but this one is my favorite this is snowball so you get 10 luxury teabags and it says hand packed into a giant ball ball perfect for your Christmas tree or Secret Santa chocolate marshmallows and coconut in this Christmas tea and it just tastes incredible in fact after I finished filming this video I'm going to go make myself a snowball tea because I love it and I just think it's the nicest gift to pop in someone stocking another one I thought it would be worth mentioning is this one this is firebrand called the kettle shed and this is carrot cake tea you can get so many amazing flavors of tea that I had absolutely no idea about and there's all these amazing brands that do them Oh we give a cup give a cup story at the shed we really do give a cup which is why every time you buy a box of fuze o bags we donate tea directly to homeless shelters across the UK that's so cool I love that this is quite random but I thought it was really cute and I don't remember where I got it from I think it might have been Oliver bonus no no idea this is a grow your own Christmas tree obviously this was not very expensive but again if you are trying to fill stockings and you want a couple of like cheap a bit and a few more expensive bits I just thought this was such a cute idea Merry Christmas everything you need is inside growing Christmas tree and you can write to and then from on the back I would love one day to have this mammoth Christmas tree in my house that grew from this I just think it's so cool I love it another thing that I thought was quite cool which appeared in my p.o box the other day is this this is the original marshmallow toasting kit by the naked marshmallow company how amazing would this be as a gift you can toast your own marshmallows so I think you can go online and create the box you can pick what flavors you want in this one I have strawberry cream marshmallows and salted caramel marshmallows and then we also get the sticks and you get the chafing fuel gel to cook your marshmallows over I don't know I just thought that was quite a nice kind of unisex gift I would love to receive something like this get toasting marshmallows in the evening of Christmas or something another thing I thought that was worth mentioning for any book clubbers out there obviously there are a lot of amazing books that you can buy or if you know your friends are into a certain type of genre I think it's really nice to go out and select a book that you think they might like but when I was in anthropology they had now I love these these are some of my favorite front covers of books I have ever seen so they do classic stories and they've redesigned the covers and I have a couple of these and I just think they make the perfect gift for anyone who loves reading especially if their favorite classic book has also been done as well the illustrations are by Anna bond and I just think they're so beautiful they're the sort of books that you want to leave out so that everyone can see moving into more stationery based things I have two books here this one is from oh dear or also sold in Urban Outfitters and I believe they have a number of different journals like this but with different front covers I just really love these I think these are so great so on each day you can fill in any date you want and you've got the day of the month the objective notes to-do lists more objectives and then you get a timetable all the way down the side I just think for anyone who needs to get more organized next year this would be the perfect gift I also thought this was worth mentioning too because sometimes it's quite nice to customize a gift somebody and Cromer do these customizable journals or Diaries they actually did this one for me and I thought it was so cool I had to share it with you do you get notes pages you get a big page for every day and then you get the month ahead important date it just has everything you need in it and you can customize the front you could put your name you could put a quote that you like you can really go to town and again if you know someone who needs a nice journal or someone who needs to get more organized I think this would be a really lovely gift speaking of getting more organized it's as well a lifestyle stationery book or basically is oh it's got my actually got my list in it I love this because it has everything I need all in one place it says she designed a life she loved and this bit magnetic you open out and you have an arrow which I find really useful if I'm going through different papers or I need to be reminded of things an ASAP if something is to be done is that you also have a little exclamation mark if there's something you don't understand or something you need to go back over I think these are especially good for revision as well some little notes like normal post-it notes with marble effect and then I've got a list here and then on this side you have like a weekly planner so you've got day and night and you've got all the day's then highlight of the week and next week's goals and then once you're done you can tear it off and start the next week underneath it's basically a massive book of post-it notes and we all know someone who loves post-it notes way too much the last two things are books so the first one is this one which I love I feel like I have so many friends who would love this book it's called the curated closet and it is a simple system for discovering your personal style and building your dream wardrobe there's so many great tips in here about decluttering choosing things for you helping build your wardrobe - how exactly how you would want it to be and it's also really beautifully like shots and just yeah I really really like this it has some really useful tips in it and we all know someone who has extremely messy wardrobe the next book I also feel like so many people I know would love this and it is this this is called bringing the outside in this was from oliver bonus and this is actually a gift for someone so i'm hoping they don't watch this video but it's the essential guide to cacti succulents planters and terrariums so everything you need to know about keeping plants in your house specifically plants that aren't really supposed to die I say supposed to because I have killed a few succulents in my time it has some really lovely pictures and tips and tricks in it and I love it so that is everything that I wanted to share with you that I think would make an amazing stocking filler for somebody you know or somebody you don't know even there are some great things in there for anybody really as I said I'll leave a link down below to

Hello everybody today I'm going to be doing a winter ASOS haul There's so many nice things on ASOS right now and I apologise in advance if you get a little bit spend-happy after this video there's a lot to get through so I'm going to make it quick we all know this ain't going to be quick I don't know who I'm trying to... ...fool... ...trick... who i'm trying to... ... ... pull your leg no that makes no sense I'm in the weirdest mood the first thing I picked up was this now this is... the most gorgeous and soft long cardigan I have ever laid my hands on now if my camera would just stay focused on my face that would be great this is just the most beautiful cardigan I have ever seen I have one that I picked up quite recently which is very similar to this but it's grey and it's from Jack Wills bless you Nala and so many of you have seen me wearing that and being like: 'Oh my god, where did you get it from?' ...Jack Wills but this however is very similar this is black and brown kind of... ...it's not really like zebra print, it's not really camo it's kind of somewhere in between but I love these these looks great with like high-waisted mum-jeans, and like a white t-shirt tucked in, and then your converse... ...or some biker boots I just think this is going to go with a lot even though this was on ASOS this is a brand this is called Selected Femme... ...which I've never heard of before, but by golly they make great long cardigans the next jumper I got is by Monki This... ...just amazing... ...oversized... ...massive... ...cosy... holy crap if I could... ...describe properly how this feels... ...oh It's just so soft and amazing, and oh my god. quite a high neck it's not like roll neck or anything but it is quite high up I don't know how this jumper is going to look on me because... generally colours like this unless I have a tan make me look quite washed out I can't wait to try it on Okay... Next jumper is this one now although this was on ASOS again this is a brand this is Pull &amp; Bear I don't own anything, well before this haul video I didn't really own anything leopard-print ... who's phone is that? ...oh it's mine... ...oh my god the phone is ringing out of my laptop which is in another room... ...that really put me off I didn't own anything that was leopard-print mainly because... I've just always been kind of terrified of leopard-print ...but I feel like it's everywhere right now so I did tell myself at the start of... ...like... ...the winter-iness... that I was going to buy leopard-print this winter so... the first thing on my step to leopard-print is this jumper this is from Pull &amp; Bear and although it is leopard-print, I feel like... ...this... ...kind of... ...breaks it up slightly but I love this so much I mean, I shop a lot... ...but this ASOS haul is probably one of my favourite ASOS hauls I have ever done just because... ...there's just some many amazing things on there right now And... ...oh... ...there's just so many things I want to show you... I... ...I... ..I'm getting too excited I saw this... ...which is an extremely soft... ...very fluffy... jumper with a high kind of turtle neck This... ...I thought would look amazing with jeans... ...or a skirt and boots... ...biker boots Oh... ...the possibilities are endless But because this is also like a creamy white, I just think it would go with a lot and I think... ...this... ...looks quite snowy and wintery don't you just find... ...that fabrics in the winter are so much softer ? and just more... ...just like... ...oh... ...amazing I also picked up this which is another like... ...long-lieing cardigan but this one is a lot thinner, and this is in grey, and it's got three-quarter-length sleeves and this is by the brand Stitch &amp; Pieces and I remember this being really reasonably... ...reasonably priced... I think if you're layering quite a lot, this is quite a nice one to throw on Obviously this isn't going to give you much warmth because... ...as you can see... ...you can see through it! But... ...for layering... ...I think this would be perfect Speaking of layering, I feel like under a lot of jackets and a lot of coats I like to generally... ...wear... ...Alfie's hoodies It's nice to have a hood, I like it especially if I'm wearing a bomber... ...or something that doesn't have a hood So I picked up this... this is just simply a khaki hoodie and I really like it very basic... ...does the job... ...can go under a lot of different garments Yeah... ...very happy with that I feel like this are the sorts of things that you... ...not forget to buy... ...but... ...you don't think of them as like staples, when actually... every time I've wanted to do that with an outfit I've gone to use Alfie's And then I was like: 'Why am I not just ordering myself some hoodies to throw on underneath things?' get yourself some hoodies, to wear under... ...just plain ones... ...just to wear underneath other kind of outdoor jackets 'Cause I'm the sort of person that although I really like wearing... ...big... ...kind of... ...wintery coats, in that sort of autumn/wintery stage when it's not like... ...really cold, but jou want a jacket because it's quite brisk... ...I really like that word... ...brisk you're going to want to layer so you can take layers off is you get too hot and put them back on if you get too cold... ...so a hoodie speaking of laying and being cold and too hot one thing that I have to have during winter is a hat I have a lot of bobble hats it just never stops me buying more. I really like this one, because it's grey... ...and it has a really lovely... ...like... ...dark green pom-pom I actually think this kind of green is one of my favourite colours, and I never know how to properly describe it it's like a beetle-green... ...I don't know... ...there you go... ...that's better... I love it... ...kind of I guess emerald-beetle-green but yes... ...so... ...I got this hat this is actually a Missguided hat I also got this one, which is kind of like a rusty colour... and I got this one, which is also a rusty colour... ...this one's Missguided um... ...but the pom-pom was like more furry I guess it's slightly more like... ...red rust... ...as opposed to orange rust I've got quite the selection of rusty hats now I also bought this scarf, because... ...and I'll tell you why... ...I have a lot of scarves, that require being wrapped around a lot of times ...so ones that keep your neck warm... ...basically I don't however have a lot of scarves that only require you to wrap it around once, or for you to just leave hanging, and that is what this one is Because it's a lot shorter you can literally just wrap it round and leave it hanging down... ...or... ...wrap it round once and it's not too much fabric actually... ...very hard to come by these... ...so... ...I mean... you're all going to think I'm being ridiculous ..but it is it's really hard because so many scarves are so thick... ...obviously... ...because the whole point of the scarf is to keep your neck warm, but sometimes you just want one... ...that's kind of... ...looks good... ...but is also available to keep your neck warm if you need to you know... ...and also I love the colours of this one oh, this is a reclaimed vintage one I also... ...bought... ...some new tights, these are from New Look and these are 40 denier I have a lot of 120 denier, or like literally the darkest you can get I don't however have any sheer ones, and I feel like sheer tights at the moment, with little ankle socks... ...are very in... ...so I got myself some lighter ones I also got some even lighter than this, but I don't know where they are and then... ...because these were so cute... ...I couldn't resist them I got these gorgeous little sock that are like... ...I mean they're not going to keep your feet warm... ...they're basically just for fashion.. ...but they've got these little, tiny, irregular polka-dots on them, and they are clear... ...I think these would look really pretty with some heels, or... ...I don't know... ...sticking out the top of biker boots... ...whatever floats your boat Moving on to shoes... ..I have two pairs to show you You may or may not know that I pretty much live in my converse I have high-tops, and I have just normal, low... ...round... ...underneath your ankle... ...converse That's probably not what they're called So I thought I should treat myself and get some new ones ...so I got these... ...white... ...with kind of smeared gold on the ends... ...I love them I can't wait to wear them! I just think converse go with everything, like... ...there is no outfit that you can't put converse to and the amount of times that I've put something on, and I've gone down to my shoes and I've thought: 'How the hell am I going to make this outfit work with any of my shoes?' and without fail, you can put converse on, and it goes so... ...if you do a pair of converse already... ...I highly suggest you do Also got some boots! these are from a brand called 'Lost Ink' which I've never heard of before but... ...they look so cool I was actually inspired by my good friend Tanya Burr, who has some boots like these, um... ...in like a blue velvet... ...is it a velvet? I want to say a velvet or a suede... ...and they basically go up your ankle a little bit more than normal, so I bought these in a black... ...with a little zip that goes all the way down... ...oh... ...just because I think these are so cool I love them ...so thanks for the inspo TB the only thing is you're going to have to show me what the hell I'm gong to wear them with Now onto the last little bit... ...but also the most exciting bit... ...and that is coats I... ...love... ...coats The first one is... ...this one! Oh my god I'm just going to be like living my inner Pat Butcher and I just can't wait! this is from New Look, and it is a faux fur, leopard-print coat and it's furry, and soft, and amazing, and it had a V-neck and a little collar and... ...I don't know how I'm going to make this work... ...but I really want to and I hope this looks good on, because... ...I love it *Nala barks* OI! the next one is this, which is kind of like a jacket/overshirt and this is in a khaki colour, and it's from Pull &amp; Bear... ...and... ...it's got like rolled up sleeves... ...I would say it comes down just below your hips... ...um... ...but it was the back that I was like so obsessed with look how beautiful this pattern is on the back of this jacket *gasps* I love it! And if you had like a grey hoodie under this I'm loving these like... ...outer... ...kind of... ...overshirts and jackets and then there's this one which is kind of like a khaki... ...jacket/winter coat which is a bit more out there... ...but I love it so this again is Pull &amp; Bear, obviously ASOS though and... ...it has this... ...um... ...faux fur collar... ...and it's in that same khaki colour and on the back it looks like this: now I appreciate that this probably isn't everyones' cup of tea, I actually really like it again, with like a hoodie underneath... ...and like biker boots... ...and black skinny jeans... ...I think this will look really cool in winter... ...maybe with a bobble hat... ...or the little scarf! oh god I can't wait... ...I just love fashion in winter And that is everything that I bought from ASOS so I really hope you enjoyed that, I will leave a link to everything that I bought in the description box as always make sure to give the video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it, and I'll see you again tomorrow Bye!! 
Hello everybody it's finally December And I am so so excited for this crazy month if you don't already. I have another channel which I will be filming Every single day up until the 24th, which is Christmas Eve So there will be a vlog every day over on that channel, so make sure these shoulders are really pointy I'm wearing a men's jumper, and it is not a nice fit. It's got Macaulay Culkin on it But the the I think I just need to wear it So make sure you go on over and subscribe to that channel so that you can see Every day when I upload a video 4 p.m over on my more zoella channel it's where most of the festivities are going to be happening so make sure you go on over and do that but firstly this is the first video on this channel in December and that is going to be my November favorites I actually didn't get around to doing an October favorites mostly because I didn't really have Anything new that I was loving that I didn't already love in September So this is kind of the things I've been loving through October and November there's also not an awful lot of beauty product and a hell of a lot of food and like random things first thing is This cleanser this is the soap &amp; Glory deep purifying hot cloth cleanser called the ulti melt I've been using quite a lot of this. I love the packaging for a start. I think it's amazing Oh, I've really hurt my thumb I burnt it on my curlers, so I give this a huge thumbs up for the packaging absolutely love it I have had this before and I don't know why I just never really used it I think I got very overwhelmed with my cleanser collection, and I'm just never reach for this But I really really like it You just massage a great sized splodge of the ultimo onto your face and neck for at least two minutes rub stubborn clogged spots ee then press off with a warm wet washcloth does exactly what it says on the squeezy tube, and it's also a very reasonable price, so if you are on the hunt for a new Cleanser or makeup remover I would HIGHLY recommend this the next thing I've been loving which I don't really have much left of is This molten Brown shower gel. I love molten Brown shower gels I don't know why I just think their sense are very unique But also they really linger for quite a long time And I like that in a shower gel this one is the exquisite vanilla and violet flower This isn't a very festive or Christmassy scent I know around this time of year most people want something. That's a bit more This time of year season seasonal and this isn't really that but I just flip in love this smell a lot It's very unique. It's kind of sweet, but not too sweet because you know I don't like anything too sweet Yeah, I love it. I really really like it any time Alfie's used this in the shower, and he walks back in I can smell it on him. I know he's used it I mean the bottle speaks for itself of absolutely loved it to be fair I never really stick to one shower gel in the shower. I have about five on the go currently The next thing is actually a deodorant. This is the soft and gentle antiperspirant 48-hour protection in Verbena how you say, that's a Benna verbena, I'm gonna say verbena and water lily Aunty white marks for sensitive skin. I'm not gonna go into too much detail I was gonna say here's the story, but it's not really a story, but I used to use the mitchum water lily Deodorant and that has just vanished Mitchum where is your water lily? Deodorant gone because that was my absolute Favorite scent in the world. I loved it like I actually looked forward to spring my pits in the morning and then it just disappeared so I was like right wow I need to go on the hunt for something else that smells great and keeps my pits dry then when Mark was around he used this so he had this and He sprayed it, and I was like. Oh, that's mother lovely Can I borrow your deodorant because we were just getting ready in the same room, so I grabbed his yogurt I sprayed it, and I was like oh That reminds me of something and it reminded me of the mitchum one then I have a little look. What's in it water? Lily it's bloody water lily so Yes, this is great. It's an antiperspirant It does what it doesn't like an but I particularly love this because it smells like my old favorite mitchum water Lily deodorant next thing I've been loving is this this is the huda beauty? Warm brown obsessions palette this arrived in my peer box not too long ago And it was one of those items where I? Instantly saw it and knew I would love it and knew I would use it a lot. I just want to check I haven't got right on my teeth. I also love how compact is very easy to travel throw it in my makeup bag I love these colors a lot there are very autumnal colors So I guess depending on the sorts of colors you want to do on your eyes around this time of year I just I really really like them. I also really love the Pigmentation of these and how soft they are and how easy they are to blend I just really very highly rate this palette every single color works well with every single color They're all matte shades besides this very golden cooperation Marie one in the middle Which I love because I tend to Mostly use this orange here this coppery one and then this one here for like in the crease I am constantly trying out new shampoos. It's one of the things I really love to test because having like Sleeky soft hair sneaky soft sleek and soft hair is Nice, it's a really nice bonus, and I feel like some shampoos and conditioners are Definitely up there with making blond dyed hair feel shiny and some just don't really cut it I Have been using the pure ology hydrate shampoo and conditioner for dry color treated hair and I've been really enjoying using these they both smell completely different, which really threw me off because I was like am I using a different Conditioner to the shampoo the shampoo smells quite lavender E. And then this one's very minty, so it's like a real like menthol Experience like it leaves your scalp feeling very fresh, and I really like that especially if you're washing your hair in the morning it's quite a nice like wake me up feeling I've been really really liking using these I Really recommend them moving on to something a little more random. I can't remember who recommended. I use these sometimes I get really Awful horrible disgusting headaches that literally knock me out probably a migraine to be fair Sounds about right and of course there are tablets and other things you can take but these These bad boys are amazing so these are the cool ensues immediate calling relief for migraines, so there are strip Essentially it's like a blue strip And then this side is very soft and like self like and then you just peel this off And you stick it to your head in fact. I think in one of my vlogs you can see me wearing it and Any time I have one of those awful migraines that literally make you go to bed in the dark I whack one of these on and it really really helps so if any of you suffer with Really awful headaches or migraines as well as your medication. I can't recommend these enough they just feel amazing Or even sometimes if I feel one coming I'm like nope whack on a head strip. Go and lie down sorted like I Never go without these in my medicine cupboard now. I add these to my grocery shop online like every week It's that time of year again when all the festive smells come about and I know I've mentioned this before but I'm gonna mention it again because if Any of you didn't see my video last year you might watch this, and then you know what to go and get your Christmas pal by Christmas power I mean that one friend you have that's essentially me who gets way too excited about Christmas and needs everything festive this smells like Everything Christmasy rolled into one, and this is the next festive spice diffuser I also have a next festive spy scandal, but I just find the diffuser is a lot stronger and I always, buy these every year and try put them in as many rooms as I can and It does really make a difference it really does. I love the smell. I love how long these last Love them love them love them. Love them. This is also kind of and I feel like it's something I love all year round, but I have been loving it that like a little bit more and that is Harry Potter I love Harry Potter I love the films and I've been watching them a lot, and I've also just decided to start reading the books From the beginning again, so I've started with Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone I actually really love the covers of these ones I bought these on Amazon like quite a while ago, and they've been in my bookshelf and I've been meaning to read them reading these just feels very comforting and I Yeah, I'm loving it absolutely loving it moving swiftly on to food first thing Are these and I just have to warn you? None of this is very healthy Cadbury's crunchy melts with a chocolate Center Mmm these sort of remind me of the Maryland gooeys. I don't know if I ever talked about those before but they were Maryland Cookies they were quite big and they were full of like a hazelnut chocolate and I can't seem to find them anywhere anymore, so I don't know if they disappeared or maybe Cadbury bought what the Recipe I have no idea what's going on there, but? Maryland gooeys disappeared and these appeared and I was like oh I wonder if they're similar they are they're delicious is essentially a chocolate chip cookie but with like gooey chocolate in the middle and if you like the sound of that I Would definitely try them the next thing which are gonna have to be quite quick with because it is currently melting Amee's to be fair. These are actually fat, and healthy as far as like ice lollies and ice creams Go these are definitely a lot more healthy than your typical Nobody bubbly these are you moose kind of letter kids? I don't think they are I think they could be for anyone frozen yogurt lollies these are Dee-licious I can't even tell you how great these are I love them they come in a box. There's three flavors There's tropical which is this one there's mixed berry and there's strawberry and they're all great. They're all very delicious They're all very yummy, and I'm the sort of person who quite likes a nice or an isolate after dinner Regardless of what the weather is like, and I've just been eating these like drinking water this next favorite is Christmas chocolates you may recognize some of these Because most families around this time of year will have at least one of these stashed away for Munching whilst you're watching Christmas films or watching something festive on the TV. I however have all four Right of the varieties I would really like to know what your favorite is if I'm honest we have the Cadbury Heroes No Lip Celebrations are all over the floor. It's okay Cadbury's heroes, which have a good selection Personally my favorites and a whisper in the 12 Then we have celebrations, which are mostly all over my floor And I would have to say my favorite in this is the bounty in the Mars bar I know that bounty is quite controversial not many people like a bounty I personally love about D Then we have the roses one of the more traditional chocolate boxes Have to say Not impressed with this new packaging it feels like there's not really many in there and I Don't like this new packaging I preferred the foil wrapping myself Because this confuses me because they all look the same I like the caramel bite and the strawberry dream and their orange the tangy orange cream as well probably the most traditional We have quality Street. Not a lot of people's favorite I did a poll on my Instagram actually and this came out like the worst since 1936 comes in this lovely Christmassy tin and Still has its original packaging that's much much much much very happy, which makes me very happy smells the most Christmassy, also, I think my favorite is the orange chocolate crunch and the strawberry delight and the fudge But yeah, let me know which one your favorite is I actually whipped those out like Halloween was over these came out. They will all get eaten Mostly by me, that's mostly food But then I thought I feel like you can't expect anything Less than just very chocolatey items around this time of year because all you can really purchase Other things I've loved too TV series the first one is stranger things - my Gosh, I absolutely Gremlin Jory talk about stranger things - with me Yeah, there's 90% edible yeah Oh my god, so how if he doesn't want to be in the video she's gonna lie on my lap stranger things - is Incredible, I really love stranger things I thought how can anything top this I did worry a little bit when they said there's gonna be a second series I didn't want it to feel like oh the first one did really well. That's try and like make A second one, but not really have a storyline. I was very wrong it was so good There's a couple of new characters who I instantly fell in love with who was your favorite new character look. I'm talking to my vagina Who's your favorite new character I don't know any of their names. I can't remember their names I Just got an itch sorry guy I thought that season 2 was better than season 1 yeah, I think so too I feel like it had more emotion. If that was at all possible like it had more like more feels I think and surprisingly 11 was in it less know Ya Know she had like a whole dedicated episode. She wasn't in it Oh, yeah, that was a weird up so naturally yeah, that was the only episode. I was a little bit like shit It was actually episode 7. Don't I Flippin loved it and if any of you're watching this and you're like oh I just don't think stranger things is for me. You need to watch it Because I promise you You will like it. I mean that's a very big promise to make It's not too scary. I don't think season 2 was that scary if you ask me but then my level of tolerance for scary things is quite high the other program the second program I Absolutely loved was Bob dogs no Smart program was called the syndicate Alfie's nodding, but he's watched one episode So myself and Mark we spent like four days together why do? You okay another job no while salfi was in Dubai myself and Mark spent like four days together during those four days We managed to watch all of series 1 of the syndicate and most of series 2 it's about it actually came out in 2012 but they've been reassuring it on ITV at the moment so I believe you can watch on ITV player It's about a group of people alfie is mooning me Do you mind I love your jumper from the men's section on a sauce? Oh my god you? Know I should have bought it way more oversized. I really liked it. They probably so got it You can use my affiliate link if you like So it's about a group of people that work together who all chip in for a lottery ticket And they all win and that isn't like spoiling it because that is what the whole If we stopped it, but it's what the hot. That's Mark's hangar, and it is so good. It's very addictive I really think you'll like it go onto iPlayer and Not iPlayer ITV player or you can download them on Amazon which is what I did with the second series And I watched it that way, but really Really good, and it has some great actors and actresses in it actresses Actresses in it anyway that is pretty much everything I've loving over the past two months As always let me know in the comments what you've been loving. Let me know which of these Christmas chocolate tins is your favorite I Want the debate to continue over here because I think on my Instagram poll. It was celebrations and Miniature heroes that won, so like the two classics roses and quality street didn't fare too well don't forget to check out the link to my vlog channel make sure you go on over and subscribe and Get involved with vlogmas give this video a thumbs up if you are excited for more Christmasy content And you enjoyed this video, and I will see you again very very soon

hello everybody welcome to a kind of late September favorites I'm really sorry I was like how have I not done a September favorites I knew there was something missing and I knew I haven't done something and then it occurred to me that it was in fact my September favorites and it feels weird to just leave one out so I have to do it I'm going to apologize now you might not be able to tell and I might just be pointing it out to you and you wouldn't have known either way but I have two of the most painful bulging disgusting weepy cold sores on my lip and I've attempted to cover it over for this video I don't know why I did that because it's really freeing painful and the second I finished it I'm gonna wipe this off and the reason that I'm saying that is because I really wanted to film my autumn makeup look which is essentially this but with like eyeshadow and a little bit more like gold and I couldn't because what this looks like without lipstick on is kind of terrifying I mean it fits in with the theme of Halloween but it looked hideous and I was like I just don't think people want to see my weeping cold sores like exposed so I'm going to save that and switch these videos around and I'm gonna do that next week so for now I'm gonna do my late September faves I'm going to start with a cleanser and this is the BLA SIA milky jelly cleanser conditioning at face wash it actually doesn't look like I've used any I took this on holiday with me and I was also using this before I went away on holiday as my second cleanse now everyone is going gaga over glossier at the moment I believe it was available in the States and now it is available in the UK which means that now that I'm talking about it people watching in the UK cannot actually get hold of it which is great the reason I like this is a lis consistency it's a like jelly consistency but then it feels very soft and it kind of thins down which is really really nice I apologize if you can hear knowledge snoring she's already fallen asleep clearly I am that uninteresting it doesn't have too much of a smell it smells kind of very lightly of rose which isn't too like off-putting for my nose because I don't really like the smell of Rose this is all very wry me nose and Rose I don't really like the smell of rose but this isn't too offensive it's very light and it's very it's very fresh rose scent so I really really love that I like how it makes my skin feel it's really nice and easy to use I just pop it on and then I get my hands a bit wet and then I kind of like rub it all around my face and then I get rid of it with a funnel and it makes my skin feel so soft oh my goodness I think the fact that it's a conditioning face wash does mean that when you finish with this you're like honestly I do this on my skin and I'm just like ah someone's gonna ring my doorbell I don't know how to ring the doorbell BRB you have two hair favorites this month the first one is the Maria nila dry shampoo although I feel like this isn't your normal dry shampoo this is more I would say for if you feel like you need volume and like you know that feeling when you backcomb your roots and it just you got that and it just stays that is what this does this is like a styling product more I think yes it makes your hair look less greasy I wouldn't say I would use this if I wanted to feel like I had completely clean sleek soft hair it's not that kind of dry shampoo it's more the kind of dry shampoo when you feel like your hair is really limp and lifeless and yes it's a bit greasy but mostly it you just feel like you can't really do anything with it can't really style it and just look through it flat kind of like my hair today it's very flat very flat hair day to day this is perfect for that literally spray it in your roots give it a little rub I might put a little bit in it's so good so essentially it's kind of a dry shampoo slash hairspray slash back home in a bottle styler and I really really liked it I I don't know if I put this in a favourites before maybe I have I can't remember but it's the way hair oil all this smells so good way is the brand by Jen Atkin who is a celebrity hair stylist hair extraordinaire just basically over all hair goddess and this is her brand way haircare I use quite a lot of the products in the brand and I really really like them and highly recommend them the oil though is something I basically am a little bit obsessed with I'm gonna put a tiny bit I'm basically doing my hair in this video I just put a tiny bit on my hands like after I've washed and styled my hair and I just run it through the ends just to make sure that they're not like super frizzy just to give it a bit of a shine help take care of the hair yeah I just really like it smells fab and also this lasts sort like I've been using this for like a year like look at it it looks like a barely touched it because you only need to use a tiny amount every time moving back to skincare probably should have done this after the cleanser it's nothing new I've used this a fair amount I have seen so many people talking about this over the years in fact this is actually one of marks like Holy Grail products whenever I see him doing his skincare he is mostly patting this delicately into his skin and it is the LA roche-posay effaclar duo I think that's how you pronounce that effaclar duo this is an anti imperfections corrector corrective unclogging care anti imperfections and tea marks now I have been on a bit of a skincare journey which I think I'll probably do a whole other video on or do a more in-depth chat on on my vlogging channel I haven't quite decided yet a journey that I have not yet completed I don't think almost I feel like I don't to talk about it I'm in a place where I'm like yeah this worked now I can like talk about it but one of the products that I think has made a huge difference is this because as I have mentioned in previous videos although if you're new here you may not have heard me talk about it before is whenever I get a spot or a blemish or a blackhead or toes or a tiny little pimple or even if I have a bite or a cold sore everything on my face or everything that has anything to do with my skin takes so long to heal and the marks just stay around for so long it's almost like you can see every like layer of my skin and on every single layer is a mark or a spot from some time ago and so one of the things I have been doing alongside other things is using this and I do feel like it has made a huge huge difference this is kind of like a serum so you would just put this on after you've cleansed before your moisturizer and again in the evening it's really light it's not agitating on my skin at all and I know there is a reason that so many people rave about this it's great another thing which actually I did take on holiday and is a little bit more of a summer lip color is the cocoa by Kylie cosmetics matte liquid lipstick in the shade dominatrix tick in a really long time and I feel like orange easily is a shade of lipstick that does suit me does suit my skin tone and especially when I have a bit of a tan I just think it looks good I think it's because I have blue eyes and orange your blue or the opposite sides of the spectrum so they complement each other I don't know but I think that's the thing and I really like the consistency of this it's matte and matte lips are my favorite to wear doesn't feel uncomfortable and was pretty much like a staple for the evenings when I was away on holiday so I just really really like this color another thing which is kind of September / October phase because I used it start using this the vlog for it went up not too long ago but I feel like it was right at the beginning of October so this is technically an October favorite if we're going to get very specific but I couldn't wait another month to tell you about this so I've kind of snuck it in here and it is the fenty beauty foundation I love this I absolutely love this I uploaded a vlog it was the Halloween shopping vlog with mark where I was trying this out for the first time so if you want to go and see like me trying it on and my first impressions I'll leave a link to that vlog in the description box to be honest I'd seen a few people's reviews and I'd heard quite a lot about it and I just kind of thought oh it might be worth the try but I didn't have like high hopes or high expectations because it is a semi matte finish soft matte long wear foundation I don't really like matte foundations generally I much prefer something with a bit more of a Jewish so I was like oh I'll give it a go I might like it I don't know we'll soon see turns out this foundation is so great I absolutely love it I love the formulation I love all the different colors that it comes so many colors and actually thankfully I bought this on the Harvey Nichols website and I and I managed to get my shade right for once I don't know how I managed to do that but I did and I also bought a slightly lighter one because obviously I'd come back off holiday so at some point this won't be my skin colour but for now it's great it's very liquidy as you can see I've got some like dripping down the spout but it blends really well and it lasts really well and what it looks like on the skin is really nice and it's I don't know it's just a very easy enjoyable foundation and unless you have really dry skin I wouldn't recommend it but if you have like oily combination I think you'll really like this an alongside it I've been using this brush which I haven't cleaned for the purpose of this video which I probably should have it's the Fenty Beauty foundation brush in one 110 I love this but then I do love all brushes that are quite compact like this it's kind of like the is it the buffer brush by Real Techniques buffing brush I just love brushes like this and this one is beaut I love the design I love how it makes the foundation go on and yeah I've been using that like every day this is quite random and the only reason I'm really putting this in here is because so many people ask me why my teeth are so white and I don't whiten them the only thing I can put it down to is my toothpaste and I was having a conversation with someone the other day I think it was my mum and she was like what toothpaste you're using because your teeth just seemed to be getting whiter and whiter and it is the oral-b I've definitely put this in a favourites before it's the oral-b 3d white looks in glamorous white and the 3d white Lux in glamorous shine I'm basically using both of these and that is all very in mind though that I do not smoke I do not drink black tea or coffee and I do not drink coke or red wine so anything that could potentially stain my teeth I don't do I do think the reason my teeth are white is because of these toothpastes because I mean it couldn't be anything else to be honest bathtime I have been using and obsessing over the zoella Beauty bath milk powders I freaking love them I think it's one of my favorite product products favourite products I have ever brought out because it's such a different like bath time experience and don't get me wrong I love a bath bomb and I love bubbles but sometimes you don't want that sometimes you just want like feel like your skin is in like some kind of conditioning treatment and I feel like that's what I feel like whenever I use one of these this one's actually from the Christmas collection so these are the splash of milk bath powders and they come in little sachets inside like that and you can use one sachet for a bath if you're going to push the boat out you can put two in but one is enough basically so you let you tear this off and you just sprinkle this into your bath get in and it's like it's like bathing in silk I love it I love what it feels like I love the feeling on my skin and I'm just basically a little bit obsessed the reason there's two of these is because this comes as like a duo as part of the Christmas range so in this you've got tea bags a little bath time tea bags but you can also get them in this little tin and this one came out with the jelly and gelato range earlier on in the year but you can still get these and again it's got the little sachets in it I just love them especially this time of year when you feel like your skin needs a little bit more of a boost to random things I don't have many random things in this which I feel a bit sad about because I feel like my last two favorites were really random but the only thing I can really show you in terms of like food are these I only have one left I had three I kept one of each flavor in a little Bowl and I even said to Alfie don't eat these okay because I want to put them in my favorites and he was like your brother's coming he's gonna eat them I was like no you won't he doesn't really eat sweets Joe ate two of these yesterday so now I only have one flavor to show you fabulously though it's the one flavor that is my favorite so that's fine these are the Mowlem sour stripes I bought these in weight rows because they had them in like the Halloween section oh my goodness I like these like stripy things by my arm anyway and I really like sour sweets so putting the two together is actually making my mouth like fill with saliva thinking about eating these because they are really sour so putting those two things together does make for my perfect treat this one in particular which is my favorite one is the strawberry and rhubarb flavor I know that rhubarb is quite an acquired taste I feel like you either like it we really don't like it but these are so flippin delicious I'm so happy that this one is the one that's left and firstly I am going to feature this book because I read this on holiday and I absolutely loved it this is Lily Collins unfiltered no shame no regrets just me I don't want to say it's like an autobiography because it's not really about her life in that sense it's more things that have happened to her but have changed her and she's kind of passing on that advice which I really really liked I thought it was such a good way of sharing parts of your life that you might not normally share and that's not just like facts and kind of where you grew up and it's not just about like her entire life it was more the things that had an impact on her and the things that changed her and the things that shaped her and also other things that she could then pass on like pieces of advice when I was reading this on holiday I wanted to like fold the pages where I was like I must remember that I must remember that quote and there were so many parts in this book that I could completely relate to others maybe not so much but it was really interesting to read about the way she handled certain situations in her life and it was really eye-opening and also very inspiring and I think it would have been the perfect book for me to have read when I was around that age of like 17 18 19 when everything seems a bit daunting and you've kind of left school and you're thinking what is my life I feel like this would have been very comforting to me at that time so yeah I would HIGHLY highly recommend you read this book it just made me absolutely fall in love with her and I think you would really take something from it so if you need something to read I would definitely pick this up and that is everything that I wanted to share with you as part of my September favorites this month I really hope you guys liked it and as always ah-haaa nala and as always let me know what you've been loving in the comments let me know if you've tried these because I need to share my love of them with someone else give the video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and I will see you again very very soon bye [Music] 
why do I look like a choir boy like the long neck's looked okay on me until I started making this video also it's very hot in here so I think I'm just gonna have to take this off hi guys so in today's video I am going to be doing something that is always very very highly requested each year still don't know why it's so highly requested because I'm not the best at makeup we've gathered this now everyone calls me so another beauty guru I ain't a beauty guru I actually don't know why people call me that so putting that title aside I am going to be doing my autumn makeup routine it is technically still autumn we're not into winter yet which is good because I was like I'm gonna run out of time I'm not gonna be able to do it but that's not true because it's still autumn and I am still wearing this makeup look pretty much every other day the only thing that really changes is I either don't put the eyeshadow on or I wear a nude lip instead of the lip that I'm going to vary in this video which is my more autumnal berry lip and this year it's not Charlotte Tilbury glastonbury I know this is gonna be a kind of very relaxed chatty do my makeup with me video this is essentially like my everyday makeup to do I need to tie my hair up mmm probably I have already washed my face using the glossy a glossy a glossy err milk jelly Tenzer and then I have used my la roche-posay effaclar duo and a tatter harper moisturizer so my face is done I do not use primer I probably should I just always find it just kind of like rolls off my skin and I just don't really like the feeling of it so I haven't bothered with that now or ever really the foundation I've been obsessing over and loving a lot is the Fenty Beauty foundation are the reason I have two is because I ordered these and I was on holiday and I ordered shade 200 which was the perfect match when I got back of holiday it's now not so much the perfect match it's a tiny bit too dark I did however order this one which is 140 which I thought would be more of a kind of all year round and I've not been on holiday skin tone but I think at the moment I'm kind of combining the two so what I really need to do is order a new one which is somewhere in between the two but for now I am mixing them the foundation is for any of you who didn't see my vlog where I tried this for the first time the foundation is a pro filter soft matte long wear foundation which just sounds amazing the brush I'm using Oh thought it was dripping off my hand then it wasn't the brush I'm using is also the fenty Beauty foundation brush it's really dirty I probably should have cleaned it if I was a real beauty guru I would have washed my brush [Music] one of the main things I think I really love about this foundation is I feel like you it blends in really really easily and I also feel like you don't need to wear powder with it to set it because I feel like it kind of sets very quickly like it doesn't feel like it's gonna transfer at all right now I am going to put a little bit of the collection lasting perfection concealer in one fair under my eyes I've got some bright dark circles right now I honestly think it's this time of year the clocks have gone back spring forward fall back yeah the clocks have gone back and it means that it starts to get very dark about half 4:00 in the afternoon and I think the less sunlight is affecting my skin especially the old under eyes I always find this concealer is like the only thing that feels comfortable into my eyes and brightens the area as well as concealing it it's probably because I go like three shades lighter than my skin actually is and I actually only have one little blemish right now which is here so apart from that I'm actually enjoying my skin at the moment the next thing I use is the Charlotte Tilbury film-star bronze &amp; Glow face sculpt and highlight but I only use the sculpt cap I'm also using the Charlotte Tilbury powder and sculpt brush and then I just attempt at giving myself some cheekbones go along my jawline and a little bit down my neck I actually just kind of forgot I was filming a video and I was just like thinking about another video I wanted to film and what I'm doing today now I have a little bit more color on my face I am going to do a big old swipe over with a bronzer this is a Kiko bronzer it's a baked bronzer in the shade warm oh no it's rubbed off warm in the launch and I'm gonna use a Real Techniques blue brush I love these that's so cool and I'm just gonna throw that bird it was very close to my window I'm just gonna do this take off I'm just gonna kind of just because it's autumn does not mean you can't have a golden glow the next thing I'm going to use is Tanya burr cosmetics illuminating powder in peonies please which I am obsessed with I absolutely love it and I'm also using another blue Real Techniques brush this is the bo2 it's like the perfect little shape for highlight pack it on now would you look at that have you ever seen anything more glowy and healthy-looking in your life why is the Sun trying to come out now I'm filming this video it's so honestly it's been the darkest most miserable day and now the sun's coming out that makes no sense it's just because I was filming obviously I'm gonna do brows now I'm using the Makeup Forever aqua brow waterproof eye brow corrector I love that it's called an eye brow corrector I really like this I don't remember how I discovered it I think it came into my peer box and I thought what a very interesting concept I always go between powders pencils waxes and then I thought I would try this and I do really really like it but I always flip I always flit I just think whatever whatever I feel like using I'm also using a little benefit brush so I've got a spoolie at one end and a hair in it and then the angled brush up the other just kind of dip it in the brush like that and then I just kind of fill my brows in with it here she comes thought I was gonna get away with doing a whole video without knowledge eyeing to get in that looks freakin terrifying [Music] this is literally like daily eyebrows struggles honestly I've said it before and I'll say again eyebrows are sisters not twins and I mostly say that when my eyebrows look absolutely crap I'm gonna stop there folks because the more I play with them the bigger they're gonna get I'm not sure that is the look I'm going for okay I shadow I'm gonna use a little bit of eyeshadow primer this is the Too Faced shadow insurance it is great would highly recommend I'm gonna put a little bit on my finger and then I'm just gonna rub that into my eyelids I have a dog scratching at me right now to get up Nullah you can get on this bed you've done it multiple times before it's just staring at me I wish you could see her right now gets up on the bed this way come around this way come on and then up no no no oh he did it the naked Urban Decay heat palette it is full of wondrously autumn shades the shade I tend to go for the most is this one which is lombre it's just a very nice kind of orangey shade which I find always tends to complement blue eyes and most Nullah leave my lemon cheesecake alone I'm just gonna pop that over my entire lid using this clover brush which is the three-30 n now I'm going to use a little bit of the shade which is called outs I'm just gonna put that in the inner corner pat pat dab dab dab blend blend blend okay I'm going to use this one now which is a three one one end which is just more of like a tapered blending and I'm gonna go in with this shade which is in fleiger on Fuego like a very lovely dark oh oh Bundy or Bundy organdy oh my god what is that color organdy burgundy oh my god what was I just mixing I was mixing two colors together I'm just gonna blend that in the outer in the outer corner just to give it some definition I would love to know how your autumn has been so far and also I do appreciate not everyone has autumn as a season right now so if you are in Australia what's there I guess they're in spring coming into summer yeah I would love to know what you've been up to what fun things have you been doing have you collected any conkers have you run through crunchy autumn leaves and have you made something with pumpkin in it because if you haven't there's still time I'm now taking a teeny tiny brush and I'm gonna just take that same color underneath my eye little bit I love how my autumn looks don't really change the only thing that changes are the products that I'm using everything else is the same you can go back and watch all my other videos oh dropped it I mean I could probably blend it a bit more do you think blending is probably my downfall you know because I just I think I just get bored like how long how long do you blend for before it's like properly blended you know this eyeliner is the smithing cult B line I pen which is fantabulous I love it it stays put all day it's very comfortable to wear and it's easy to use I tend to just use these pens [Music] I always find my left eye so much harder to do I'm not sure these are the same do you know what guys have I ever told you liner not twins sisters and last but by no means least I am using my ever trusty Maybelline lash sensational mascara I always go between this and the Smith and cut one at the moment and I'm currently loving this again so God doing your lashes actually just brings everything together doesn't it also how was your Halloween I'd love to know I'm glad you all loved the penny wise video when I was editing that it was I mean it was about three hours worth of footage but when I was editing that I was like no one's gonna like this because I'm a not saying anything although I guess some people might prefer that I don't know but I wasn't really saying things I was concentrating so hard and there was a huge part movement that was like if this doesn't turn out well it doesn't matter because it's fun but then there was also a research site of me because I'm very creative and I'm such a perfectionist that I wanted it to at least look half decent so I'm really happy with how it came out I'm really glad so many of you loved that video and thank you so much for all your future what I should turn Jo into next suggestions okay I am now just being a little bit on my bottom lashes some people don't wear mascara on their bottom lashes but I feel like mine are quite spidery on the top so if I don't wear any on the bottom it's very like top-heavy and there we go that is eyes at least now my eyebrows don't look it's terrifying I always feel like every time you do you adjust your brows and nothing else it looks like you've gone so overboard and then when you actually finish the rest of your face you like oh no it's okay I feel like I've been on quite a discovery with lips this year eight last 18 where I realized that I don't particularly like wearing creamy color I love creamy nudes and creamy Pink's I'm talking about lipsticks by the way but if it's creamy color it just ends up like on my chin on my cheeks I feel like it's too messy to wear so I actually recently had a huge declutter of my lipstick stash and I basically got rid of any color was not matte so matte color for me and I guess for any of you that have the same problem is definitely the way forward so that does mean I have kept Glastonbury because for me it is a real classic and I love the color and I do love the formulation but I do find I have to tidy up with Glastonbury a lot more than I do with something like a liquid lipstick so I do still have Glastonbury and I do still love it but I also love this and this is what I've mostly been wearing this autumn is the color pot Moondancer ultra matte lip this is actually part of the My Little Pony collection color pop have like the best collections honestly oh my god it's really cooling oh my god [Music] dah dah and there we have it this is my everyday autumn look it varies as I said sometimes I just wear a nude lip depending on kind of what outfit I am going for and sometimes I don't wear as much eyeshadow but this is the one that I wore mostly go for I really hope you guys enjoyed this look make sure to go down there and give the video a thumbs up if you did and also subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you again very very soon with another video and it's all about to start getting very Christmassy up in here I think this might be the last video I film or maybe not actually I was gonna say this might be the last video film with like all to me although actually I very scaled down on the autumn but yeah if it's about to start getting very Christmassy around here so I really hope you guys are excited for that just a quick reminder actually whilst I mentioned that I am NOT doing 24 days of zoella over on this channel this year I am doing vlogmas on my vlogging channel which is more zoella which i will leave in the description I always leave a link to that in every video on this channel but in case any of you are wondering not 24 days as Wella there will still be lots of festive videos though so don't worry I'm just not going to be doing one every single day because it will break me but I am doing every single day over on my logging channel so I really hope you guys are excited for that I am very excited and I will see again very soon

 Avalanche collapse   Hello everyone, welcome to my channel   I hope you have a wonderful weekend   Tell me what you have done on weekends   I want to know ~~   I recently discovered that my curling iron had burned my blanket.   Well   It's ok   Remember to use the insulation pad   This is the reason for their existence   That's it (big tongue)   It’s time to sit down every month   Talk to you about these little things I've fallen in love with recently   Then let's get started!   There are some small living things today   But I still started with beauty.   I mentioned this before in VLOG   ....Have it? (whisper) Did I upload the VLOG?   I buy my voice!   it's wired   I fell in love with this bottle of perfume   In fact, I haven't spray it yet today   Does anyone think that it's a bit strange to have no perfume?   I think this is like...   The most crucial part in the morning   I forgot today. Because I have so many things to introduce   This is Clean Reserve's   They have some different flavors   One of them seems to be that fresh rain I think   That's one of the bottles on my purchase list (of this brand)   But basically, this taste is warm cotton   And a while back I received some bottles   I think it should be in my post box   Still in...   I do not remember   then...   I really like it. He is very...   unique.   It smells like a clean laundry   I know that not everyone likes the taste of this clean clothes   but   As a fresh fragrance lovers   I can make sure it smells really fresh   Just like the freshly-baked, clean sheets   It's fresh, I think nothing is cleaner than it smells   Or smell the fresh aroma that comes from someone else.   So I really like it very much! Really good   Then I went to Bath when I was traveling at the beginning of the month.   Since the day I used it almost every day   I love it, and I also bought a can for my mother as a Mother's Day gift because she likes it too.   I also love this liquid foundation recently   I use this today. I used it often in the last two months   I really like it. This is the Finishing Finish by Rimmel   Essence ingredients, sustainable for 25 hours   SPF20, Skin Concentrate, Skin Concealer   I have some spots on my face recently   I don't know if it's because the weather is warm   Or the influence of hormones   Anyway, my face grows a lot   This is the only liquid foundation that can get rid of those blemishes.   to some extent. This bottle and Naked concealer for Urban Decay   Together is the perfect combination   I used to mix them to use um...   The color becomes even   This tank is 100 ivory, this tank is 010 bright porcelain   Anyway, if you have a perfect skin   You can try this color number. Because it is a very light liquid foundation   That is, its color is not so concealed   So you can try if you are looking for a very white color number   I really like this one. I mentioned it before, so I don't continue to say   This price is cute and it's very good   The color is perfect, the concealer is enough   I can't say it really stays on my face for 25 hours because it really doesn't   But he's already very persistent, especially if it's just a shelf   And this concealer is really great, he fits perfectly on the skin nothing...   Uh....   Untapped liquid foundation is also scary   That's it   I also like this   This is Smashbox PHOTO FINISH PRIMER WATER   I don't usually use makeup before...   But I should use it   This may allow me to maintain 25 hours...   Keep my foundation for 25 hours   Don't know why I think   Make my face a little sticky before makeup   I think it's totally feel it covered with moisturizer   This is not really my habitual   Makeup steps... but   I have a lot of makeup milk I want to try and I have to try   But I'm too lazy to add this step before applying makeup   So I just put on the foundation   But I found this spray after applying makeup   Full of nice and comfortable   Make the whole look look...   better   Especially if you are already on the light, then you spray it again like (bam)   You can see the whole light   I really think this makes my makeup lasting longer   I think this is the feature of this product   I also like his small package, and the small bottle is very suitable for travel to carry   Because you can also put your handbag   Then all day   Can spray, like a small makeup spray I guess   I don't often do this   But sometimes you also want to make foundation   Looks shiny   You can spray this and use a sponge or brush (evenly). You can do this...   I don't know it like this (pat)   I really like it   Yeah, so I really like it.   Although I only started using it this month, I already like it.   The next thing I have been using for a while   I will use this before I unload all makeup   This is Body Shop's Chrysanthemum Gentle Eye Makeup Remover   This is specifically for eye makeup   But I like to use it on the whole face   I don't just use this and let the other makeup continue on my face   My steps to clean my skin are   I will use other makeup remover after I finish using this because I must say that although I like it very much   And it unloads eye makeup also unloads very cleanly   But I think this is for my eye makeup   Not enough...   So I think I have to unload twice   The first one is because I want to completely remove my makeup   The second is that double remover can remove the first makeup I didn’t notice   But I like it very much. It's very gentle to my eyes.   Because I think my eyes start to itch   And become more sensitive   This part of the eye, I don’t want to keep saying my eyes because I think I’ve said many times   Eyes Eyes Eyes   So I really like it. I'm going to pick it up soon. This canister is almost finished.   I really love to use it recently and it is also very good to obtain, it will not be very expensive   The effect is also very good   The next thing I like recently is   This is Pixi's Petra Eyelash Mascara   I love Clinique's eyelashes and mascara   I also like to use (top) mascara to brush the eyelashes   The results are all dirty and black under the lashes   So there is a super mascara helpful   You can brush your eyelashes faster and more concisely without getting dirty   I recently liked this one and I use it every day   It's about a month and a half now so I think it's full worth showing up in this video   This mascara brush is the smallest and smallest thing I have ever seen   Really crazy   But I really like it and it doesn't make my eyes dirty and make me super happy   Another thing is that I started trying to maintain my body   This should be one of my New Year's wishes   It doesn’t have to be moisturizing but it’s just a bit of a waste of time thinking about my body.   My mother always wanted me to do moisturizer   Every time she takes a shower, she will use oil to care for the skin of her body. She often does this.   Every time she does this, I will want to say it well. I have to do it because   I hope that when I become my mom, my skin will look like my mother   She kept telling me that I should do it so I decided to start   Because I already know about 27?   I just turned 27 when I just happened this month. I have officially   Become a mature woman   If you look at my Vlog channel then you know I'm 27 years old   It feels like 27 is really starting to become an adult.   I do not know why   I think it should be because my mother gave birth to me at the age of 27   So I think   I now   Is a woman   Do you understand what I am talking about?   Anyway, Tanya recently stayed at my house   Then she said, "Can you borrow my body lotion?" Because she just showered   Then I said "Of course"   I went to those dusty body lotions   Before the cream, tell her to take it   Then I just want to say my god. Why don't I care for my skin?   So, since Tanya came, I found out that I still have a lot of great body lotions and creams   I started to use it hard   One of them I like very much   This is it   You may have discovered that this is a Christmas package   I like this package very much   I know some people don't like Kiehl's Christmas package   Classic Body Lotion   But I like it very much. It is full of exaggeration and there is a bit of common   But I really like it   I have never used it but this is true...   It's smooth and the texture is not heavy, it's smooth and smooth.   And it can be perfectly absorbed   I really like it being absorbed so fast and much   This is one of the reasons why I hate rubbing body milk   Because I hate the feeling of stickiness   When I hate to wear clothes, I can feel body milk on my body.   Hey, I just don't like it.   But this...   It doesn't always make me feel sticky   I really like it and it is absorbed completely   I also like the taste of this   It's very, very vanilla, and it's very cute. It reminds me of Laura Mercier's lotion.   But I don't remember which one should be amber vanilla   This smells a bit like that one   This is what I used in the last two weeks   I really like to use it!   The next ~~~   This kettle found in my mailbox   Was sent to me by Joseph Joseph   He is a kettle   Then you fill it up (you can drink it)   One day should drink four bottles of this kettle   I don't really like drinking water. Really do not like to drink water   So when I received this, I wanted to donate it or give it to someone who needed it more.   But then I thought, no   I should try to do this (drinking water)   So I was trying (drinking) but I haven’t drunk more than two bottles a day   It's really bad.... but I can't really drink it.   Four bottles   I can only drink up to two bottles of about half the daily recommended amount of water   Although I know this is related to height and weight, these are   If we want to look at it from a medical perspective   But when you drink a bottle you just have to   * Coffee friends *   Click and you get a little red dot and then a bottle of coffee   Then you press and you know that you drink the second bottle.   The third bottle of coffee   Fourth bottle   So so far I only drank two bottles   But I really hope that I can speak in a month   I can drink four bottles~   I don't know why I feel like drinking water so hard I like water   But do not like the taste of water   I really like water but it is...   Can't drink   A lot of water   But this kettle really makes me drink a little more   I have eaten a lot of snacks recently and I feel happy all month   The first one is this   This is a marmalade biscuit   "Delicious, Savoury, Marmite Oatmeal Cakes Can Be Taken With You Or Serve As A Good Choice For Lunch"   There are four inside. I want to open them to you to see them super cute   Their shape is a jar of marmalade   Now I know that the marmalade is...   Uh   A love-hate relationship   food   So I know a lot of people will think "Er! Ma Mai will be cookies"   But they are super delicious   And when you are a little hungry but you are not eating lunch   Or when I eat dinner or I have finished breakfast   I   It will open a packet, and then it will be delicious to eat with hummus sauce.   Really good!   Same unhealthy because this is what we are talking about   Well, Club Bars is not different.   I just like this   For several years   I am very obsessed with them   I think most cookies are just chocolate and orange sauce   Because I also have   Penguin Oranges and Kit Kat Oranges in the Downstairs Kitchen (bar)   But I must say this is my favorite   As you can see   I think I like this more because   One part is very thick chocolate   This is really delicious   So if you think you tried a variety of chocolate bars   You want to say "Oh! But I have eaten this type"   Do you know what I'm talking about? It's like Kit Kat Chunky This is why I like Kit Kat Chunky so much.   Because it has a very thick chocolate   like this   I want to open one   Is like a chocolate bar   It says CLUB chocolate cookies   There is also a portion of marmalade   TV-wise   I recently enjoyed watching Mary Berry.   Mary Berry is one of the best women in the world for me   I think she   Very relaxed, very positive and cute and I was honored to meet Mary Berry when I recorded Bake Off.   He is really friendly, although the episode is over   But when I saw that episode appeared on TV, I was still super excited   I have a book about her because it's about her TV show   I'm so happy to get this superb recipe   I've finished reading and marking on the page I'm interested in   It's like filling up Bake Off   I really like to watch this   I'm super excited about this night   I am super happy and I keep replaying   So now you all know that I like to watch TV   But I’m also sad because the Call the Midwife finished   So I don't like watching programs right now.   This is why I like Mary Berry so much. This became my favorite program every day.   Another thing that I think is most worth mentioning is that although I just started reading   This book is just beginning to read in March but I really want to share it.   The author of this book is Emily Barr whose title is The One Memory of Flora Banks.   I can't say too much because I really just started reading   But I can tell you what he wrote behind   When you do not believe in yourself, how do you know who is worthy of your trust? Flora has amnesia   She can't remember what happened every day. The joke the friend made, what the parents gave him, and even how old he was.   Even if she kissed someone who shouldn’t be acquaintance, it’s the next day and he’s all recalled   This is the first time she remembers everything since she was 10 but the boy is gone.   Um, so far I feel really good-looking   But like I said I read a little   This is what I think is worth reading.   There is also   This is a cowboy suspender I like recently   If you have tracked my INS or watched my Vlog you will know that I used to wear recently...   Bib short!   This is bought from asos   I used to wear this recently is a deep blue tannin   Then this is not suitable   It's very loose, I like to have anything I like   This is a new partner who has joined me in suspenders   This is bought from Primark   I like this more...   Loose and less   Then I used several pins on it   This is a hole in the knee so it is more relaxed   I think suspenders are like   No need to think about clothing   You can wear it everyday, just change the clothes inside.   You can still have different changes   But you don’t need to think hard to think about what to wear   This makes sense   I really think so   Can wear a loose sweater   Can wear T   Off-the-shoulder, cute, striped   There are infinite possibilities   This is my March love item   I actually want to mention it a little bit...   The best birthday! Many friends and family spent the day with me   Thank you for your blessing, really thank you very much.   It's really cozy like I'm sliding tweet, INS or   Look at your blessings when you look at those social software   This really makes me happy to thank you guys!   If you like this movie, please help me press a praise   Then tell me your nearest love item in the following message   I really want to know what you like to watch   So if you can tell me what you guys are watching recently   Or you've seen it but it still keeps replaying   In any case, let me tell you that you feel great.   Because I really needed some good shows recently   tell me!   We will meet again soon~   Bye~~  
hello everybody today I am going to be doing a bath and body walks body walks Bath &amp; Body Works haul I flip in love Bath &amp; Body Works and I'm so sad that they don't actually have it here in the UK and no matter how many times I've said please Bath &amp; Body Works at least have one store here in the UK that we can buy your candles and all the other amazing bits from alas this has not happened yet so I had to take matters into my own hands and find a way to get them from America to the UK which I have successfully done and I'm going to show you what I got how am I going to pick this box up hello oh my god so I just randomly went on the website and noticed that they had all their autumn or fall as you say in America they had all those kind of seasonal candles and as I said in my previous video when I lit leaves the candle that I really loved I instantly was just in the best mood ever and it reminded me of it being autumn and lighting lots of amazing candles and Bath &amp; Body Works just have the best sense and I just find that they burn really well so this year I decided to go all out and try a lot more of their sense hence why I'm fat hit with a box big enough for me to curl up in solar also I have taken them out of their like individual packaging but I haven't smelled any of them yet so this is essentially an unboxing without me actually unboxing and taking everything out because I would have taken a really long time but I haven't smell anything so I've been very restrained and I wanted to make sure I was filming this video in order to show you I'm not like a candle expert so I don't know all the right terminology but I'm a candle enthusiast and I don't well anyway I'm gonna stop rumbling I'm just going to get to it hands are numb one leaves okay I don't really do say anything about this but this is the new packaging I actually quite like it I think it's I think it's nice love love love this fragrant notes crisp red apple yes golden nectar don't know what that smells of and warm clothes spice this is everything that autumn smells like to me this is autumn in a jar I did actually have this this is autumn again this is like the new packaging I think it looks really nice it's not like so different but I also had a little bit of this leftover this year and I have been burning this as well this one has a fragrant notes of bright red garlic apple juicy fig eucalyptus leaf and fir balsam this also if you were just going to get to two staples these two are I feel like I'll just be getting these every year this one's definitely a lot more fresh whereas this one is a little bit more spicy caramel pumpkin swirl I get very excited for all the pumpkin ones there is a lot of different like food combinations with pumpkin in the form of a candle and I'm all about that however I'm not massively keen on very sweet sickly sense so there's a very fine line between me liking it and not liking it oh my god what does that smell like it's very sweet very sweet but I actually kind of like it so this is fresh pumpkin warm caramel grated cinnamon and vanilla bean this will smell amazing in your kitchen I also really like the like battered copper lids pumpkin spiced cheesecake I could eat a pumpkin spice cheesecake right now and I'm very intrigued to see what a pumpkin spice cheesecake smells like it smells like pumpkin spice cheesecake however I feel like not everyone will like this it has like a biscuity vibe to it it's definitely not as sweet as the other one so this says notes of spiced pumpkin graham cracker crust which is obviously what I can smell whipped cream cheese see I think it's the cream cheese it's throwing me off because it's a bit like salary oh I don't know I think this is definite one that you have to burn to get the full potential but it does smell pretty damn good crisp morning air okay so this one says fragrant notes of crisp full breeze I mean is that a note white oak golden amber wood saffron and soft sandalwood so this is going to be very like woody I love that smells like a man's just got out the shower oh I wonder if this is like the other one that I had last year where I said that exact same thing or is that flannel or it reminds me of like when my dad used to get ready for like Christmas Day and he would put like aftershave all like round here that's what it smells like smells like my dad marshmallow fireside I did get this one last year really liked it I'm actually not a huge fan of marshmallow cents but somehow this works I feel like the color of the candle is really like throwing me off because last year it was like a whitey cream and I think they've put like a bit of gray into it it's kind of a gray color which makes a little bit more Dee oh I've forgotten what the smart like but it has like it's quite tobacco a toasted marshmallow smoldering woods fire roasted vanilla and crystallized amber this is the most realistic marshmallows on a fire scent I've ever smelt because it does actually smell like fire somehow next up is buttercream icing I feel like this would be Anna Ciccone Joey's dream candle so Anna if you're watching this you somehow need to get your hands on this because it smells really good okay so this has whipped butter cream rich vanilla and sweet cream so this isn't essentially very autumnal but it was within the range I think so I'm guessing people like lighting these sorts of candles this time of year that legit smells like whipped butter cream oh my god that is so good I I honestly thought was gonna hate this I really did when I first her I was like oh I'm not sure about that one oh good its spiced pomegranate cider I have no idea what's gonna smell like ruby red pomegranate sweet apple cider muddled blackberry and star anis oh that smells so good oh my god this is like a mulled wine that smells quite Christmassy actually this is quite a Christmassy this will be a good one to light in November I feel like pumpkin pecan waffles this was one of my favorite ones last year I had it in like a small one and I never got a big one so when I saw this this year's like I'm definitely getting a free wig I think this is my favorite pumpkin edible candle so this says maple syrup golden waffles pumpkin spice and brown sugar can you just imagine what this smells like it smells oh my god my kitchen smell of this most of last year so this just brings back so many memories I'm really excited to burn this and I really like this little this little label I know what you're thinking you're thinking Zoey you are never gonna burn all these candles before all the Christmas ones come out well you're probably right but I'll try warm apple pie so I think this is a white barn one yeah white barn it's still on but everybody works Oh oh my god I have never smell something that isn't an apple pie that smells so much like an apple pie how have they actually done that baked gray-smith Apple melted brown sugar and flaky homemade crust I reckon I could legit burn this in my kitchen and trick people into thinking I've made an apple pie every day that is the best thing I've ever smelled and I don't even really like apple pie that much not life marshmallow pumpkin latte I don't think I've smelt this one before this one says pumpkin latte toasted marshmallow creamy sandalwood white ginger and praline musk or praline is it proline or praline it's quite fresh like it smells quite perfumey I can't smell any pumpkin not gonna lie it smells like something I know this is quite a fresh one I quite like this it's not it's definitely not what I thought it was going to smell like it doesn't really smell edible it smells like quite feminine and floral next up we have honey crit says golden Honey Crisp apple blossom and fresh sugarcane holy crap oh my god you know how every single year when lush bring out their Christmas scent I always say my favorite scent is so white because it has that fresh green like apple smell this is that scent it is exactly the same if you love so white the bath bomb from lush you will you will love this and so happy with that I wasn't even going to get that one either I was a bit like an apple dinner sweet cinnamon pumpkin whoa harvest pumpkin spiced clove vanilla cream and brown sugar okay all I can really smell is the clove this is the most festive candle of all of them I smell and I honestly thought this was going to be more like pumpkin II maybe when you burn it it has more layers but that is very festive holy crap that's definitely a November candle cinnamon sugar doughnut again I'm not sure if this is a a autumn one however it was part of the autumn range so crushed cinnamon sugar crystals and homemade donut legit smells like a donut this is making me want donuts this is so unfair I have no donuts I then bought a car thingy so it is a glittery pumpkin and you put it on the visor that is a visor you know when the Sun is out and you flip the thing down you can clip it to that or I think I've already put it on the passenger side because then it's not going to be in my way and you can put sense inside this so your car smells really good it sense I bought art leaves because I love it cinnamon caramel swirl marshmallow pumpkin latte pumpkin apple Oh pumpkin apple and sweet cinnamon pumpkin so I am actually going to put this in my car after this I've wanted to do it like the last couple of days I was like no I must film the video first however I have no idea which one I want to put in my car first the choices - the choice is too varied too much I also bought one for Alfie and I bought one for mark because he was with me when I placed the order and I was like you need to try these put it because he likes to put smelly things in his car auntie backs these are just the cutest things ever so this one is not how Halloween this one is not autumn but it's the BFF cookies and milk I just saw that was really adorable we've got crisp morning air quite like the fresh one the hands are gonna feel so dry after Lit class oh my god that is amazing marshmallow pumpkin latte this one's not autumn but I love the smell of sweet peas so I pick this one up sweet pea and sunlight and apple trees which I really hope smells like that Apple candle I also got three nourishing hand creams God you can tell but I don't get to go into bath and Bodyworks ever I've just gone really like OTT like no one's ever going to use this many hand creams I figured that if I like them I'll keep them if someone else prefers the Sens and I can give it to them I so got a marshmallow pumpkin latte golden autumn day and crisp morning air I love the packaging for these they're so cute then I only got a couple of foaming hand washes in fact I quite accidentally did was I bought a pack of all the new ones and then individually bought ones that I didn't realize already in the pack so I seem to have quite a few but what I'm gonna do is like dish them out because I'm never going to use this money but it's fun to show you so we've got sunlight and apple trees in the foaming hand wash we also have autumn spice strawberry which I'm really excited to smell crisp morning air which is that very fresh one I just pour my ham golden autumn day sweet cinnamon pumpkin full lakeside breeze and marshmallow pumpkin latte I feel like I might have had this one last year actually everyone's hands are gonna smell so great so that is everything that I ordered from Bath &amp; Body Works I'm mostly kind of wet candle heavy but I did also buy a couple of things clean hand and of course my little Sparky pumpkin for the car bitchin verax let me know if any of those are your autumn or full staples and which one is your favorite scent if you've tried any give the video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it I've also kind of gone a little bit o tum know in the background not much but it's creeping in thank you so much for watching and I'll see you again very soon bye 
 &lt;&lt;Exciting New Beauty Products&gt;&gt;   Hello everyone! Today I want to do something on this channel that I haven't done before   This type of video I often see recently and I also like to watch   So I think, "Eh... Right! I want to do this too, I'm going to shoot this too."   Because I think you guys think this is very useful, and... I don’t know there’s something that I think I really like, maybe you guys will feel the same   And this video is... En youtubers sit and talk   The generous gifts they recently received or the new beauty products they recently bought   Some of the things I received have never been shared with you and you may have seen and then felt   "That would be very suitable for me, hateful!" I think this is the purpose of this type of video, so I will share it with you before I use it.   And this is a bit like "This is the first impression of a new product."   I will not repeat the lengthy statement here.   I think we have all grown up   We all know what this is all about   Not showing off, not receiving sponsorship, Balabala Barra   This is my statement, the best statement on the internet   So, there was no fuss ahead   These are my recent receipts   I want to share with you some things that I think are very exciting   The first stuff comes from Too Faced   You all know that this is one of my favorite brands   I am excited whenever I receive their package   Because I think... Well... their new products are very innovative   It's always very cute, I always look forward to what new   And when this was sent, I almost sobbed   I am super excited   This is Too Faced's "Sweet Peach-Peach Aroma" color plate   First, I love Too Faced's color plates.   Nala?   I just heard her voice. Where is she?   I love the overall tone of these eye shadow colors   I love the degree of fainting of them and I also love the color combinations that they come up with   Not to mention that every color plate has... Like... There is a theme   So there is a chocolate savory color plate, peanut butter and jelly   These are my super love   My God, I haven't listed these in my favorites yet.   So you can guess the taste of these   There is a taste of peach   I do not know what the benefits of scented eye shadow   Apart from the fact that it is very novel and there is a bit of fun   Because I have blue eyes, this is the color plate that I will be crazy about.   Because any color with a little orange tone can bring out the blue of my eyes   So when I see a color plate with these colors, it's like these beautiful shades   "Belleny" Super Beauty   "Sweet" looks great   There will always be some colors I'm not going to... so common   For example, the following purple   But everything else is super beautiful, and I think it will be great to match the sun's color.   So I think this will definitely follow me on holiday   You don't understand how big this temptation is, I have to leave these things in the box   So I can show you in the movie   Instead of tearing the package and using it right away   and this   This is "Sweet Blush"...en...the hue is "Shining Bellini"   I remember one of them, but not a peach   Well... it's long like this   In fact, you have already seen me use another one. I am very common.   Because I like it very much   Uh... see how beautiful this color is   In the same way, it would be very nice to have a fake skin color   I like this super   Hao like ~Europe~   Copper cake!   The above says "Bronze cake made with love bake"   So this is...   A multi-faceted shiny bronze cake made up of two shades that is very natural   Or use one of them alone to create a bright and decorative bronze skin   Love this package  噢~&lt;3   This is true... I don’t... I never want to break the packaging of Too Faced, super nice   Very gracious bronze   Hi turn~   I am looking forward to trying it out   This is very interesting to me   This is "Mascara Cleansing Milk - Waterproof Mascara Buster"   I do not use waterproof mascara because...   It takes a lot of work to get rid of   Yep...   And those are not what I particularly like   In addition to this, I will show you this show   It's just this really cool, this concept   So, open the package   It's long like this, in a tube   So you have to brush it over your eyelashes to dissolve the mascara above   I feel really genius!   First, because... I mean, I haven’t used it so I’m not sure if it’s useful   But, first, because, you know, when you want to get rid of waterproof mascara   You have to force your eyes very hard, that is... very rude, sometimes   So I think this may be   We need special   Just like brushing mascara, then gently brush off   I think this can...replace those rude actions   Do you understand what I mean?   There is no reason at all   I just said I didn't like waterproof mascara   Until Too Faced decides to waterproof my favorite mascara, Better Than Sex.   just...   Really, I really want to know what kind of situation you would choose to use waterproof mascara instead of the general mascara   Is it because you want to go to swimming class or because you are going to exercise?   Or because you have to stay outdoors often so it may rain?   I do not know   I just want to know in what situation you would feel "better to use waterproof"   Is it because you want to watch tragedy movies?   I have already used this   A few days ago, because I can't wait, I want to see if it's the same as the original Better Than Sex.   it has   awesome   I really like it   Of course it will be more difficult to get rid of   The last thing I want to show you   Too Faced's stuff is this, this is Too Faced's "Royal Oil - Coconut Body Bronze Imitation Surfer"   Mangosteen essence   Wow!   Like, holiday-tastic   Is there this word?   Oh my God, that should be the most popular word I ever said   How can this be used? Is this a plug?   OK...   My God, this is a holiday taste   Anything with awesome coconut aroma... Oh! I love you   This is perfect for rubbing on hands and legs   If you have things at night, so   Use it!   OPI nail polish   I now think OPI is a great nail polish brand   My mother is a nail worker, she is like a nail groomer or a manicurist, or something else   She uses OPI   OPI is her favorite   And they introduced "a combination of pastel tones"   There are six colors   Well ... there is a beautiful pale blue called "I Am What I Amethyst"   clam?   Then this pale yellow, called "a beautiful little chicken"   There is this super nice light mint color   I feel like I'm going to put this color on my nails after I finish the video   This is called "costly" and I like it   This is a very beautiful, somewhat pinkish color, called "Don't make me face all red"   This one is pink blue. Hey! It's called "I'm a boy~"   And this, it's a little milky white, it's called "in the cloud."   If you like these soft colors like me   Then you will love the colors in this combination   OPI I feel really generous   They also sent me this combination   Also with the new release of the movie "Mirror Mirror - Time Laps"   I remember it was released next month   Some of these colors are really very cute   This can of pink is called "crazy because of madness"   There is this deeper purple, called "What's wrong with you?"   This beautiful shiny gold is called "mirror escape"   An electronic blue, called "Fearless Alice," I think this should be my favorite color   I really like it   There is also this pearlescent color, called "噢...陛下"   Well... this beautiful red is called "too big today"   Pink purple, called "I want to cover everything"   There is this lovely pink blue called "the i's/eyes have it"   In addition to these, they also sent me a special edition. This is   Gray with some silver   And this is called "When isn't it?"   What?   the above   Super OPI colors   How do I decide what color to apply to my nails after the film is over?   The next bunch of things come from Benefit. These are the new Hoola series.   Now Hoola is... I would say that it's a standard bronze or highlighter selection for many people   I personally like it very much and I think it is very, very effective   And they introduced these   Hoola Zero Sunburn Body Milk   Reliable body bronze body lotion   It sounds right for me   I really love the packaging of Benefit is... Look   My God! He has Hoola short skirts!   He has a little Hoola skirt!   He wrote "Squeeze the gel on the sponge." Where is the sponge?   (Inhale) Oh, the concept of OK is too cool   OK, so this bottle is here, then this can be tightly covered so this is the cover   But you can pull this out and then you have a sponge   And I'm guessing...   Almost tipped my apple juice   So I guess it's about squeezing some sponges and rubbing them all over   It's so cool! I'm really... really impressed   I really like them to start the spring and summer course   Whether it is cosmetics or other beauty products have become very summery   I'm really excited about this very summer product.   In addition to this, Hoola's bronze contour brush   Wow!   The texture of this is also very good, look! Looks like bamboo   Then the top of the bristles is green and soft   I like   There is also Hoola condensation   It looks like a small bamboo   Rose gold bamboo my favorite   Bronze water   Softening Essence and refreshing texture Blended into skin Produces natural, bright and sun-free skin   Lets you have no sunburn and radiant Hoola!   "You only need to apply to bare skin or cover in liquid foundation." Cool!   So I guess this will help you to add a little bit of color and a little bit of bronze   I'm searching for this kind of packaging. I really like it.   There are also some of my favorite brands from Urban Decay.   Urban Decay's first product is "Complete with one-time skin-blend complexion correction fluid"   So this is "optical blur, complete and bright"   The color is white   It combines the advantages of light flour base and the coverage of moisturizing lotion and our high technology   Clear formula makes skin feel comfortable   Provides full-time makeup and applies to all skin types at once, but the best is   How it changes your skin, clearing away the cream immediately removes any blemishes   Oh, OK   So I guess this texture will be a bit refreshing   I love this package   I think I would need to test these things for a few days   This...well...the texture is good   I can imagine this will make your skin look very moist and healthy   Hey, I really feel like I haven't rubbed anything on my hands.   Missing!   It really seems that I haven't cleaned anything in my hand!   OK, I'm looking forward to trying it out   Another example from Urban Decay is this beach bronze cake   Hey, look at this package! There is a small palm tree above.   I like   Open is like this   Very good bronze   It is hazy, so if you like the dark bronze cake, this is a good choice for you.   The color of this is "bronze"   Last but not least, I have a box of highlights and the tone is "fireball."   I really like the highlight of Urban Decay...   This is the "afterglow" highlight   Oh!   My goodness   I am very glad that you can see my initial excitement about these products.   This... this... it looks too mad   This is "lasting 8-hour three-dimensional high-gloss powder" This color is super beautiful!   It looks like a series of peaches... My God... Like peaches   I was really fascinated by him.   Its color is a bit like a twinkling pink but pink   So its color is pink, but it has a very lovely pink glitter   It makes me think of my "teasing teasers"... I'm Estee Lauder's "teasing" highlights   I really hope they can come out again   Estee Lauder, if you guys are looking for a "provocative" limited edition   Or simply treat it as a permanent commodity because it's really beautiful   And I'm running out so this reminds me of it   It also has the same cute pink highlights   Oh!   You can't see it in my hands now but when I say you need this, trust me   Clan Poetry recently introduced some new spring products   So I think I'm going to talk to you about these   The first one here is a long-lasting facial makeup spray   En... moisturizing, fresh, soft   I may spray this perfume on my body because its bottle is very beautiful   It feels very luxurious   Uh... but it's a makeup spray so you can spray it on your face instead of spraying it on your neck as a perfume   Next is a new bronze cake   Now, I would highly recommend... If you are looking for a new bronze cake   I would highly recommend this brand of bronze cake   They will launch new combinations in spring and summer   Because they are so beautiful, and I found that they are only sold in a portfolio so you can't buy them later   A few times my friend told me that I love this bronze cake or tried it on me.   Then when they buy it, they can't buy it and I say you can only buy it when they have it.   Because they are so cute   I have two are... I remember one last year was the year before   Because I really love them really beautiful, and they will bring you a very pleasing   A bit of bronze light on your face   And because they are big, I think you can also... I don't know...   Sometimes I use a large brush to dip and brush my neck, shoulders and cheekbones   It's just... I don’t know... I love the bronze cake and I think it’s great   And this is no exception, you see how beautiful   I like to stick all the brushes directly, but you can also dip different colors   They also have this, this is "ombré waterproof ... waterproof shiny eye shadow makeup before the milk"   I really like this kind of thing   They make life easier, especially when you want to wear makeup on your eyes but you don’t have time.   Or you want bold lip makeup, so eye makeup doesn't want to be too heavy   This is very suitable   They are also great makeup pre-milks   They have several colors. I have No. 2 - Golden Sands and No. 3 - Silver Ash   Both of them are very beautiful colors. So, when you go through the Clan poetry counter, remember to check it out.   I have Klein's eyelash raincoat here, which is actually a layer of waterproof outside the eyelashes.   It's kind of like... It's a little bit like a nail polish oil that lets it stick, but it's eyelashes   and so...   I guess you can use it with a variety of mascara   You can brush it up and it will be waterproof after it's dried   But...it's interesting to say that this also applies to eyebrows so I should use both, just   Most should be used on eyelashes   Then the last thing that made me very excited because you all know how much I love the original   But this is the latest: immediately shine and soothing lip oil" And it is very beautiful... Berry red   My God, it's called Number Three - Berry Red   I am a genius!   Or I have long eyes...   I can't tell you how much I love   Hey! It has a new fragrance   Smells like strawberry cheese   When you were young, did you have any... It was a square... Square plastic box   The top cover is a clear plastic plate with brightly colored juice   Maybe there will be kids party and it will pay a little red straw   Then you can put that red straw into the lid and drink   This is the taste! It completely took me back to... Campus Disco in 1995   Wait, that means when I was five, I went to campus.   Maybe in 1999 or 2000?   This is really great and really feels moist on the lips   I'm curious about the degree of color because I use transparent   Uh... this seems a bit dirty inside, but I’m still looking forward to using it.   So the above is everything I want to share with you, and I am very much looking forward to   I also want to know which of your products are most excited about   If you like this video, and you want me to do more of this type of movie, remember to like it.   I have some new favorites and I’m looking forward to sharing with you   I also really want to do (similar types of videos)   I love you very much and we will see you soon!   Oh~  
hi Nana hello everybody it's all so long since I think in my favorite video because the last time I did one was at the start of December which was my November favorites and since then I haven't done a favorite I didn't do a yearly roundup I didn't do a December favorite so today I'm going to do my generally favorite if I'm honest these are some of my favorite videos to film and to watch just because you get a really good idea of what someone has genuinely been enjoying and I feel like that's a great thing to go off of if I watch some of favorite than their like I use this product all through the month I love it I'm like I know you mean that and I'm going to go buy it I kind of want to keep this short because I've just cooked my favorite pizza for lunch and it's now on the side getting colder although I have to say I'm much the first eat pizza when it's like not that hot because there is nothing worse than biting into pizza and it's like molten lava and it burns your mouth and you can't taste anything for like the next two days so I mean I'm quite happy about I'm happy that it sat on the side waiting to me but I don't want to take the P and leave it too long so I'm going to kind of come this quite quickly can I quite hungry and where so much might also Rumble because I feel like it's been a while on foot a hair in my eye I have accumulated quite a few beauty products which generally if you watch my favorite you'll know is the one thing I struggled to actually use because once I love something I continue to use that until like forever forever so where to start I have mentioned this briefly on my blogging channel but I am loving this this is the Sunday Riley Martian mattifying melting water gel toner I very kindly received a sample of this in my PA box in December and I've been using ever since this is one I have students purchase to myself in fact I purchased two because it didn't want to run out and then not have it this is for oily to acne prone skin and although I don't particularly have all over oily or all-over acne I have areas that oily and areas are acne-prone so i have found that this has been amazing generally when I've had spot or blemish the marks take a really long time to fade I always say it's kind of like my skin is see-through and whenever I've had a spot you can literally see it for like weeks afterwards and I feel like that's really helping with this I also feel like any thoughts that I do have which is kind of a given around certain time in a month anyway they're not as what is so savage and not a savage they're not a huge they're not as like painful and I really think that this has helped the overall kind of appearance of my skin so I just really like the tone of stage it's like one of my favorite stages because it's so like refreshing I know it's nice to like practice game before moisturizer the next thing I've been loving is this which is the Peter Thomas Roth pumpkin enzyme mask enzymatic dermal resurfacer this is a scary as it sounds this is actually quite painful but then I quite like a face mask it's like whoa I can feel that working I know that some people don't and to be honest I probably should steer clear of these because I think I have quite sensitive skin but when I put this on my whole face was like whoa I feel like there's like a tiny like army of red ants like going at my face right now but when I took this off my skin was like a whole other dimension it was just like well okay this mask really does something it says a three-in-one intensive skin resurfacer mask exfoliate with pumpkin enzyme peels with alpha hydroxy acid polishes with aluminium oxide and reveal smoother younger-looking radiant and revitalized skin I can only % vouch for the radiant when I first fit this up my skin was glowy it looks amazing the next day however I did have some spots so I think that it kind of drew those out but carried on using it and I use this I don't know at the moment I would say I probably used it like once a week or three times every weeks I don't want to use it too much and it just says to apply a thin layer to clean skin gently massage in a circular motion with wet fingertips to polish with micro polishing aluminium oxide powder leave on for three to seven minutes there's someone at my law it's not just kind of a flutter on and leave it but I highly recommend it it's really great if you want a mask but feel like is doing something to your skin this will and because it said pumpkin I was really like oh this is going to smell so like or to me and like but pumpkin cupcakes I was wrong I mean it does a little bit but it mostly just smells like actual pumpkin not like pumpkin spice goodness I'm going to do the next two together because I feel like they kind of go hand in hand although they don't but it is a new toothbrush and a new flosser I have one of these about two years ago and this bit broke oh and I just realized I literally probably could have just bought a new head with something broken it didn't work I thought I just snapped this but I could have replaced that so I don't know what did we do I loved it and I was like I need to get that slaughter again because I really enjoyed it this flosser is intense if you want to feel like you've been to a hygienist you need to use this toothbrush which is the oral-b Braun some I don't know the actual model of this but it was hard price and Boots after Christmas so I've treated myself to a new toothbrush I feel like treating yourself to a new toothbrush every January it's kind of like you know what fresh start fresh toothbrush I don't know I really don't find new toothbrushes and I just back I thought excited I am pretty different I'm not used one like this before but it got multiple different functions you know but sensitive whitening all the things but the main reason I was drawn towards this is not just fitted it with copper because it was half price it was because it came with a little like phone mouse that you can put on your mirror and you put your phone in it and this syncs up with bluetooth so that it tells you when you're pressing too hard and it gives you a rundown of how long you need to do your cheese and I don't know it's just it's like a teach diary and I really really like it granted I don't always open the app every time I rush my piece so so the app looks like I never brush my teeth but I just love that it tells you when you're brushing too hard which weirdly I always do on this side never this side just this side and at the top which I didn't know before I have his toothbrush though very useful and I like this because it's basically how it works is you filled it with water or mouthwash I can to put muscles in there just because I like my mouth to be all like fresh and minty so I'll put ministry in there eye watering stuff but it's great for your mouth and your gums and your teeth does anyone remember I remember these in school because we weren't allowed to Ingham but they had just brought out those little tabs that you put on your tongue and I used to keep those in my pencil case I had Listerine ones so whenever I was a bit like oh my god I'm sonic sis boy and I don't want bad breath so I'm going to flip myself a little like this string tab how funny is that and then no one would ever know because it was just much dissolved on your tongue little genius I don't even know they're still around I haven't seen anything in a really long time and you press this button and you hold this on your teeth and it shoots the Listerine or mouthwash between your teeth so these two things together I think have a made my teeth whiter be made my mouth feel more clean and see make you feel like you've been to a hygienist every time you use them so I mean this is kind of bulky I have to say it's not like it's not like normal dental floss but I think personally this works a lot better so I briefly mentioned in my previous video how much I have been loving in a Revlon Colorstay makeup foundation makeup partition the Revlon Colorstay foundation love it it now in a pump love it love it love it I got it on today I've been wearing it for like the past few weeks I just really like this foundation this one is for combination to oily skin and I believe you can also get it for normal to dry skin or just normal skin and I don't know I can't tell you what it is about this that I love apart from that it's a great foundation it's a great price it blends really lovely they have a great selection of shades and I would say it's like a medium buildable coverage does it feel drying lasts really well with really like it I'm high support on how much I liked it until I rediscovered it in my makeup and I'll tell me clear out so love you I've also been loving this this is quite random but this isn't Anastasia Beverly Hills a 2/3 brush I got this on cult Beauty because it's the sort of size brush that I really love for highlights I have quite a small face so quite a lot of blush highlight and bronzer brushes are too big for certain areas of my face things like this are perfect for quite like precise blush and highlight application or even contour to be honest which is why I bought it and now I swear by it it's just amazing it's just that perfect size to do those three things on my face eyeliner this is the Stila stay all day waterproof liquid eyeliner I haven't really been wearing eyeliner much I don't know if anyone even noticed but I used to do my little cat eye quite a lot and I just stopped doing it because I was really struggling through the summer to find a eyeliner that was easy to apply and laughed as well they were either easy to apply and within like three hours my afflicted gone because my eyes are really watery as I must have some reason or they were just just didn't have great color payoff I just feel like with a liquid you want it to be really black and you want it to stand out over any eyeshadow or just I'm gonna make it easy to get those like lines and use this with gel liner because I'm just rubbish so I need some sort of like felt tip applicator when it comes to eyeliner so I saw this one and I thought stay all day waterproof though the two works I like to hear when we're talking about eyeliner so I thought would give it a go and I loved it it made me fall back in love with liquid eyeliner I'm not going to say this lasts all day if you have leaky eyes I had a day of cry laughing recently and has as you do how dare cry laughing I did use one flick the other one was fine I seem to have this eye leak more than this one but considering I had like proper tears coming out of my eyes I thought it was really good and actually if I didn't have watery eyes this was definitely see me to the end of the day another thing which I actually showed in my last video is this which is the Rimmel Born This Way brow sculpting kit which isn't completely on it I bought on a whim thinking yeah this looks okay I want to see what kind of the more high street shops can offer in terms of eyebrows because I was quite happy with the eyebrow product I was using which was however in that video I tried it on my eyebrows and I have been using this on my eyebrows every day since I love it it actually does dark brown wax that I put in my eyebrows and I just used a Mac two to six slanted like eye brow eyeliner brush and I'll dip it in the wax side of this and then I put it through my brows I feel like it offers a much more natural look it doesn't feel as flat it kind of gives a bit of shade gives a bit of dimension makes the hairs how you want them to be without having to use powder and then a gel on top of that it's just the best thing ever obviously use a dark brown work for your eyebrows you will not be sorry and it's product I've been really enjoying is this one which I actually have on my lips today and this is the color pop hello cookies as part of the Hello Kitty collection the color pop did and it's the ultra satin lip you know how much I love the actual liquid lipsticks that color pop do so I was really interested in trying out the ultra satin lip because it's a different formulation and this is in the color Taichung it's very similar to color that I love by color pop which is Bianca it's that kind of mosey pinky nude but quite dark I really really like this but more importantly any of you that don't like how drying liquid lipsticks are you are going to love these because the color payoff is just as amazing they're just as easy to apply but they don't feel as heavy and they don't seem as dry I really really like them I want more colors in the ultra satin lip fragrance wise I've been really liking this this is white peacock Lily by DF and dergah and it's the Eau de Parfum I couldn't tell you what notes are in this because white peacock Lily I mean is that flower ain't a peacock that's for sure but what I can tell you is it's fresh slightly floral quite summery actually I feel like this would be a really nice perfume but I loved it like nothing I've ever felt before and I quite like layering this with Jo Malone sea salt and stage or wood stage and I also really like to layer this with the molecule a1 which is also one of my all-time favorite perfumes and it just smells really like light and like fruity fresh floral it's probably mmm I would put it like overly feminine though which i think is why I like it because I'm not really about the free smells and I don't feel like this is that but it has those sorts of notes in it but there's something in it that doesn't make it too overpowering and makes it quite fresh which I really really liked something else I've been loving is oh this which is the morphe palette I think you can get me from colt beauty that's where I got mine from excuse all the like dirty like foundation prints all over it but this is the fall into the forest I think that's what it's called don't quote me on that I can't remember and it doesn't have a written on here anywhere 35s these palettes are actually very very well priced there's such good value for money and you get so many in there there's a mixture of shimmery and maps down this size really lovely highlights or shades and basically every color that I love to apply it to my eyes right now which is why I've been loving it so much and I have today when it comes for eyeshadow I'm a bit of a snob in a sense but I feel like if something comes in a palette like this and there's loads of eyeshadows and it's cheap the quality isn't going to be as good as your standard kind of nas twelve colors or your Urban Decay which has like between kind of fifteen to twenty colors so I kind of assumed this wouldn't be as good as it actually is I don't know why I think it's because these sorts of palettes remind me of when I was younger it's amazing the pigmentation of these eyeshadows is unreal like soul good I've been wearing it like everyday for this whole month more kind of lifestyle things I have been loving this which I've just ripped off my masters to-do list of love if you guys don't need to see that it is from Kiki K and as I showed you in one of my blog I have a kind of a little Kiki cayhall because I love stationery and I are set with this to do lift pad it says today on it and then you've got kind of your rundown of everything you want to do in the day I like this because there's so many point you're never going to run out space and you've got the date then you've got top priorities then you've got for tomorrow and then notes and then a tiny little at water-intake so you crush this off during the day of how many glasses of water you've had and I've been filling one of these in out start of every week with weekly tasks and then if I have more kind of in-depth tasks for the day I will also write those on here as well and it's just been making me very organized one other thing that I thought I would show you is a little treat to myself at Christmas or after Christmas basically I didn't need it but at Ruth the tree at the end of the day but I got myself this little Gucci handbag Tania has a red one and every time I feel with it I'm like it's the perfect size because it's not too big it's like big enough that you can fit your wallet your purse new camera your king is you can fit everything in it but it's not too huge and every time I see how much I make it I need to make a mental note I need to order on these bags at some point because I absolutely love it I've just been obsessed with it it's very pretty it's great it's practical and it was my little treat that is everything I have been loving through January and to be fair probably mostly through December as well let me know as always what you guys have been loving in the comments and Twitter and on Instagram I love to hear from you and I really hope that you're going to be having exploded week give it a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and I'll see you down food 
this is a little bit too dark what you do what you're doing what you doing what are you doing now the Sun is coming out this is this is not gonna work really is this better is this a better setup buzzy this better Nala is this better Oh Oh buzz does not like being on camera go to feed good boy you're gonna be a good boy are you gonna be a good boy I know folks never film videos on cloudy days hello everyone today I'm going to be doing a video I haven't done on this channel in so long so I've been doing YouTube now for seven years that's a really long time one of the first types of videos that I used to do were Primark calls I loved doing Primark hauls and then when I moved to Brighton and discovered that the Primark in Brighton was not as good as the Primark in Bristol I was most disappointed and since then I haven't really done a Primark haul because any time I go in there I never come up with anything no most doesn't need it ears cleaned no this video is just not going well so far and I haven't even shown you anything no no no no no no no no I'm gonna break up this fight hello buddy Bristol prime up is the best Primark in the world Shh quieten down Shh listen listen what's that what's that oh oh oh oh oh I wasn't actually anything Shh no there's nothing to bark up laughter should we film this later because you're both being very naughty your breath smells like a fish mongers long story short I went to Primark here's the stuff I bought did that run long story short I went to Primark here's what I bought well I mean not the best poem in the world is it I bought so much I had to actually fork out a whole pound to replace the paper bags with one of these because I could have risked carrying paper bag back to the car because you know split äj-- on all that first thing I picked up is this this is a I don't really this is a midi dress or a maxi dress I can't remember maxi and it's like a maxi shirt dress and it's in this gorgeous navy and orange and white stripe with short sleeves and a little pocket where the stripes are going a different way and it buttons all the way down and has a little tie around the waist I thought this would be really nice as a kind of transition maxi dress from old from summer to autumn especially if you were to wear it with something like converse yes then this was 13 pounds the next thing I picked up is this which is a jumpsuit and is this gorgeous kind of I don't know I don't know whether I would call it like as techy print but it looks sort of is um excuse me know it has this really lovely kind of high neck and it comes in at the waist and then it has like MIDI trousers like plots and I really liked this I feel like this isn't really an autumn piece but I think it will be really good for the end summer that was 13 pounds also I have three pairs of shoes the first being these which are this lovely kind of dark blue I wouldn't say they're maybe not quite and they're just little pumps with these cute little like fringy tassels and these were eight pounds we then have these which are not your kind of converse but they are very similar and they're in a very pretty rose gold kind of shade and I just thought they would be really nice to kind of throw on and because there were only eight pounds I feel like it doesn't matter if these get ruined as opposed to your standard converse which you might not want to get wrecked but I just thought they were so pretty in fact these would look lovely with that maxi dress actually also picked up Oh also picked up these which are tiny little kind of mock suede ankle boots with little buckles on the side I feel like these are always really good for little dresses or skirts with tights and you can't go wrong with a little pair of black flats ankle boots super comfy and these were only there's no price on these Oh 12 pounds I got these which are like little kind of smock kind of pinafore dresses and this is in a really lovely kind of salmony pink kind of shade it's quite like a dusky salmony pink and it's this kind of mock suede type fabric again and have these little buttons here how cute is that going to look on top of a white t-shirt and in the true spirit of autumn I also picked one up in a car key green because why ever not and these were only ten pounds I also picked up this one which is in a burgundy corduroy and this again is the kind of pin II for style I feel like this is definitely much more of a winter item and this was 12 pounds I picked up these trousers because I thought they looked really comfy but also quite smart instead of joggers these are a nice alternative especially with kind of a t-shirt tucked in or a body or something I don't know I liked the little rose gold zips down the side and I liked the fact that they were really loose but tight on the bottom these were eight pounds what a bargain I liked this jumper it's like a slouchy kind of cropped jumper I think I'd probably roll the sleeves up and it has this on it which just says good morning Tokyo and it has these cute little diagrams on and I just thought that was really nice it's a really lovely like slouchy jumper and that was eight pounds I got this which I don't know what it will look like on but I saw it and I was like all that looks kind of cool and again it's kind of an autumn maxi dress alternative so it's this black one with three-quarter length sleeves and it says nor a Blanc and it has slip quite big slips up the side so I would probably wear this with some shorts and tights or maybe just shorts and then some boots or my converse but yeah I thought that looked really cool I quite quite like that that was eight pounds excuse me a key get off my new belongings belongings items of clothing garments at all why can't you two just go to sleep geez sit as I was saying this one is quite similar but it's short-sleeved and it says NYC LDN Tokyo and Berlin the only difference with this one is that the slip is up the front so you would for sure need to wear something under it but I think like some like pleather trousers would look really cool under this I'm excited to try that that was also a tongue right now you're licking his face and that is so sweet of you but really does does sound pretty vile no no no this is the sound I cannot stop chewing on stairs yeah I think we've had enough of you two up here come on if you could all just remind me after this what it would be like to have two dogs all you know let Alfie know because he's the one that wants a second dog already yeah just just to come back to this video and watch this as a little reminder I picked up this t-shirt which is black and slightly ribbed with these cute little frilly sleeves and it says 90s on it I am a child of the 90s therefore this seemed pretty apt six pounds whenever I'm in Primark I do like to stock up on my basic t-shirts so that is what I did I got these two tops one in black and one in white this is so soft this fabric I was like actually thoroughly impressed and also I love things with a very high neck this was just a little short sleeve tees and that was three pounds so I actually picked up two of those and one in black because I tend to wear white a little bit more than black but they were so soft so I thought they would be good especially to wear under the pinafores and things also picked up this little crop top in a very tiny black-and-white stripe with a little knot at the front that is a little crop and that was five pounds I picked up this body which is so cute it's navy with tiny little white stars on it and this was four pounds - more spaghetti strapp bodies got this one in a burgundy which was four pounds and this one in a stripe which was also four pounds I also picked up this which is a bright orange kind of wraparound style body and that was eight pounds so that was a little bit more pricey but it's also very lovely on dark again bloody ell there's literally no clouds that side that all this side that's the side where the Sun is that's really annoying do we have liftoff I also picked up this which is a really lovely kind of t-shirt jumper is kind of somewhere in the middle it's very slouchy and it's in this really lovely cocky green and this was four pounds how good is that it has a really like wide straight neck I picked up this really pretty little shirt which has just a very high neck little collar and it's just this really lovely a floral pattern but it's quite all terminal and actually I think this would look lovely under something like this like the little pinafore and this was eight pounds I bought this little cropped jumper which I thought was very 70s I really really liked it can you imagine this with some high-waisted flared trousers and platform boots yeah this was eight pounds as well it just has some really nice all terminal colors I picked up this kind of chunky knit mustard jumper which again is kind of 70s it has a little bit of a 70s vibe to it and it actually has a zip down the back and again it has a kind of slash neck and this is ten pounds sticking with autumn I picked up this which is a burgundy jumper it has some really nice kind of like chunky knit going on and this was ten pounds on to bag number two I think this is the same as the mustard one that I held up before so it has a really wide neck the zip at the back and it's quite like baggy and drapey I have the worst terminology for describing clothes and that's ten pounds not that I needed any more joggers because I have quite a lot of dramas and joggers I couldn't resist these these are eight pounds but they are the softest thing I have ever felt in my entire life I cannot wait to live in these from the waist down and then because I wanted to be really matching matchy I actually picked up a hoodie the same but I like my gray hoodies and actually this isn't like a proper hoodie because this isn't a hood this is just like a cowl neck but I really like that and that raw 8 pounds or I didn't say how much these were these were also eight pounds I picked up this cute little corduroy black a line miniskirt with little silver buttons down the middle I thought that that would be really nice for autumn again and that was eight pounds I bought a camo jacket didn't I so this was 20 pounds but I tell you why I really liked it because it's not fussy it has it doesn't have studs or die Mantes or sequins or anything else going on it's literally a really kind of dulled down simple camo jacket and that is why I really liked it and it's also not too thick so I feel like it's perfect for this time of year it's actually really hard to find a camo jacket that doesn't have other things on it at the moment so I was very chuffed when I saw that so I bought this but don't actually know what this is going to like on me because this color is very hit and miss with my skin tones it's that sort of color that either washes me out or looks okay so we will see but it's a very kind of tight figure-hugging body con midi dress and I just thought that that would look so if that looks okay on me but it would be really really nice and that was 13 pounds because you can't go to Primark and avoid the pajama section I did have a little nosy and I just bought these really soft grey very very cozy pj set it's like shirt and trousers boyfriend flannel pajamas called and it has tiny little white polka dots on these are just gonna be really really comfy aren't they you can just tell these were only eight pounds I picked up this scarf which I really really liked also it's quite big and I like a big scarf because you can prop a wrap up in it but it is a white and black tiny tiny little kind of like woven pattern with some black fringing and also some white fringing where's the price how much were you seven pounds picked up two hats they've got some great hats in these were two pounds each and they've both got little fluffy pom-poms can't go wrong with a fluffy pom-pom I bought this little makeup bag I say little it looks bloody huge I just really liked the pattern it's kind of like little is cream with little black splotches and this walls own nearly four pounds and I feel like you're gonna get quite a lot in here from the home section I did have a little nosey and I came out with these two glasses so these are the glass jar with straw oh I thought they were going to have a little bit more of an interesting name but they have these little plastic straws and I think they look like pineapples like massive pineapple tumbler jars and I really like them and they are glass see they were three pounds each and then the last thing in this whole whole whole hall is this which is a little plastic drinks cup which you can screw the lid on to and also has a straw and it says milk and cookies and I just thought that was really cute and this was also three pounds cor blimey I think I did get some tights and socks but I have no idea where they've gone I bet Alfie taking the socks already he's probably got them on his feet so that is my Primark haul I really hope that you guys enjoyed this what a throwback it has been a while since I did a Primark haul so if you enjoyed it make sure to give it a thumbs up it's too bright now what is going on I do apologise for the drastic light changes in this video the dogs the noise the complete chaos that is this video so thanks if you're still watching and yeah I hope you have had a really lovely week and weekend and I'll see you again very soon [Music] I'm a smile feel like if I drank alcohol I would have a stiff drink at this point 
 Hello everyone!   When it's already in the fall,   so I thought it was time to shoot another baking video.   I would say baking somehow in autumn.   It's so comfortable to use a lot of cinnamon.   so today I decided to make apple chopped cupcakes.   For a cupcakes dough you will need:   2 eggs   230 grams of plain flour   155 grams of sugar   125 grams of butter, unsweetened, room temperature   2 teaspoons of baking powder   1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon   half a teaspoon of salt   and for the dough to the apples we add to the dough on the cupcakes,   you will of course need apples.   Once you have successfully weighed / metered all the ingredients,   the first thing you have to do is make an apple mix.   You're going to get apples for that   and rob them,   you get rid of them,   and cut into cubes.   When you have dice,   put them in a big pot   pour with water and let it squeeze slightly.   Allow to brew for 5 to 7 minutes   until they are far softer.   You can also add one spoon of golden semolina sugar to sweeten it slightly.   Personally, I used 2 cooking apples and one tablespoon of sugar,   to make them a little weaker,   but it really does not matter what apples you use.   You can easily collect your own.   The first thing you need to do is to mix and create a cream of butter and semolina.   So I put it in a mixer,   who will do all the hard work for me.   And now I add sugar,   and I'll find it until it's gentle and fluffy.   Make sure you have nothing on the sides and everything is well mixed.   Add eggs,   and then the vanilla extract   before mixing everything.   Next, add all the dry ingredients,   so first smooth flour,   then baking powder,   cinnamon,   and then salt.   And you shuffle it.   Make sure you add all the ingredients.   Take out the bowl   from a blender.   Now it's time to add an apple mix   to dough for cupcakes.   But we will not mix it in a blender,   because the apples would be crushed too much   and we want to stay in the whole.   You do not have to add all the apples,   you can guess from eye,   but it also depends on how much apple you want.   so I'll add now   about two-thirds.   Shuffle it and see what it is like.   I think we can add some more   and the remaining apples   you can use it for decoration   or make apple puree.   It's up to you.   Make sure you have a preheated oven at 170 ° C before filling the cups with dough.   I think this is perfect,   so now you take the muffin plate and the selected cups.   I have decided for these cute golden cups and I will continue to fold.   Good. Now the dirty part   filling cups.   Now you put the cupcakes in the oven   for 15 to 20 minutes, make sure the skew is completely clean   and are slightly golden on the surface   While cupcakes are in the oven,   you'll make a little dump that's more like an adornment,   but you still can not have apple chopped cupcakes without a cake.   You will need:   75 grams of golden semolina sugar   100 grams of finely salty butter   140 grams of self-propelling flour   one teaspoon of vanilla extract   and three-teaspoon ground cinnamon.   So, we put the cooled butter in a large bowl,   It is better!   And I'll add   flour,   cinnamon,   and some vanilla extract   and you will have to get a little dirty,   because you have to use your hands to bring everything together.   To make something like a breadcrumb.   That's about the consistency we need.   It's been a while I used my hands for baking because I have a mixer. That's so disgusting ...   So all the ingredients should be combined together   and look like this.   Add the semolina sugar and stir with a spoon,   so you do not have to use your hands now.   To make the crumb slightly browned and lightly baked.   I'll put it on a baking sheet.   And I'll put it in the oven for about   5 to 10 minutes,   but you have to watch it,   it depends on how much you seal it.   You do not want to burn it, but you want it to be nice and golden.   Like when you make an apple pie,   but you do not put it on top of that cake.   Honestly, my favorite part of an apple cake cupcake is always a crumb.   For brown sugar frosting you will need:   1 teaspoon of cinnamon,   1 teaspoon of vanilla extract,   110 grams of brown sugar,   250 grams of unsalted butter of room temperature,   400 grams of powdered sugar,   you will eventually need a little whole milk.   I would say about two tablespoons.   But it depends only on you, what consistency you want the cream.   The more you give it, the more it will be.   The less you give it, the harder it will be.   So it's up to you.   The trick with the cream I say every time is that you have to whack   butter for a long time.   And in this case we have to beat it   with brown sugar.   So first I add the butter,   now I'll add the brown sugar,   cinnamon   and vanilla extract   and you will whine,   I would say, about 5 to 7 minutes,   until it looks very delicate and fluffy.   Just make sure everything mixes the way it is.   And back to the shit.   Mixing.   When butter is very delicate, fluffy and creamy,   add sugar flour.   You should do this in time   and start at low speeds   or, as I always say, you end up in a cloud of sugar.   Now you add milk   until it comes to you that it has the right consistency.   You do not want it too liquid, otherwise you will give it to   cupcakes a little bad.   But you want it to be easier than if you just had this.   So I start with one spoon and we'll see.   I'll add a little more.   I'd say it would have been half a tablespoon.   Last time ...   check on hips ...   And the topping is HOT.   It always takes a long time before I think it's going to get frozen.   But if you want it to taste good,   you have to give it time.   Do not leave anything in the blender.   I'm happy with that, so let's get it out.   When your cupcakes and crumbs are completely chilled,   you do not want none of it to be a bit warm,   because the icing does not do well on the warm.   Everything dissolves, it will still taste great, but it will not look so good anymore.   Um, so you have to let them cool down, and when they are, it's time to decorate.   You know I love my faithful jewelery,   so I decided for the star handpiece, which is 10 Tarla handpiece,   if any of you were interested.   And I'm using a medium sized doll because I do not have any bigger ones at the moment.   But larger would be better.   And I'll put the icing on the decoration.   Push the top down ...   And I turn the dresser,   so that you can hold it like this, in one hand,   and move it with cupcakes with a rainbow of hands.   So I put it now, it's ready.   To keep the crumb well on those cupcakes,   I'm going to get some frosting up.   And now I'm gonna give it the crap,   and I'll put it on top of it.   I think if you want, you can leave it like this,   but I'm going to give it that little thing, because I think it might look pretty nice.   I would say that these are the best cupcakes for this season,   we will also begin to pull out recipes with pumpkins,   but you can never make a mistake with the jellyfish cupcakes.   Your 12 Apple Cake Cupcakes are ready to eat.   I think they look pretty impressive,   you could share them because they are quite giant,   but they look so delicious, I'm really happy about how they hit it.   If you also decide for this recipe,   so send me a photo on twitter or instagram   and use hashtag: #CrumbleCupcakes   to see how stunning they look.   If you want to see more recipes, write to your comments   any suggestions.   If you liked the video, put your thumb up,   and I'll see you soon!   I suppose I should try it, right?   It would not be a baking video if you did not try your own cake.   You might think, "Maybe they're terrible how can we know?"   "She did not try."   Do not worry, I have you.   God, how am I supposed to do it?   Mmm ... Oh, my God.   It's really good.   I'd say these are some of the best cupcakes I've ever cooked.   Good. You're watching me now.   I'm doing it sideways.

time of the year did you know that you know like my singing no hello everybody today I am going to be showing you some of my festive jumpers that I have purchased this year I did this video last year and it went down really well and a lot of you liked seeing what monstrosity I was able to find in the shops personally I love a good Christmas jumper and if it has bells music lights baubles pom-poms then I am even more obsessed last year I thought there was a good selection of Christmas jumpers out there available for you to buy to get into the Christmas spirit this year I actually think there's not as many that I like now I'm actually quite specific with the Christmas jumpers that I want to wear I feel like either they're really cute and a bit more like I don't know like a nice quality kind of like the one I'm wearing today a little bit more subdued maybe but a nice quality has like an element of Christmas without it being too kind of in-your-face Christmas or I like the opposite scale of that which is the most tacky Christmas jump you've ever seen but ones that lie somewhere in the middle I don't really like and I feel like this year there was a lot of slogans like slay my name's slay my name and like slay me um Santa Bay Bay like I'm really not into those ones and I feel like this year they went to town on the puns and the slogans I just wasn't feeling it I love a good pun I love a slogan but don't call Santa Santa BAE BAE BAE BAE BAE No poor Santa I did send my mom on a mission to Primark she lives near the good Primark and she brought me back a lot of great ones I've also got some other ones from other various places so I thought I would share them with you today if you want something that has like better quality is something that washes really well and that you're going to want to wear year by year and the design and pattern is quite nice and kind of classic you need to go on Bowden they have the cutest Christmas jumpers I'm also wearing one that I've ever seen this is not Bowden I don't know why just held this one up basically really lovely quality but also just lovely patterns like this is such a cute Christmas jumper look at this it has like the most gorgeous pattern and then it has these like little blue like tiny teeny pom-poms it's so cute and yes they're a little bit more expensive but I don't mind when it's lovely quality and actually bit of an FYI this is from the kids section this is aged 15 to 16 which I would say is a size 8 also the one I am wearing this is adult I think but this is like a string of Lights and it has baubles look summer balls and summer flat but I love this jumper oh I just sat on my dog this one is also from Bowden I haven't worn this one yet this is an extra small I just love it oh my god it's so soft and I love the pattern it's tiny little Christmas trees and each one of them has a little 3d yellow pom-pom on the top so yes Bojan for me was a winner this year this is another Bowden this is another aged 15 to 16 this is a little reindeer very cute next up sauce no Primark will do primer as always and every year they have the best Christmas jumpers there is something for everyone if you want them singing dancing lighting up they bought them if you want something a bit more subdued like this they also have these two and actually they feel really soft I'm very impressed I really like this this one is a little bit more cash I would say that you could actually wear this out about some of these I wouldn't wear out and about I would only wear them for fun at home actually let's not lie I'd probably weren't most amount about but this one I think is for those of you who don't like to go to OTT also from Primark in the men's section ok so here's my tip female section lovely kind of playing it safe some of them nice designs cute men's section they go to town I don't know why they only do it in the men's section it's like they think it's only men that wear really garish Christmas jumpers so yeah go to the men's section to find all the best Christmas jumpers this one is a hoodie and it is an elf City look at that so I got this in an extra small and there's a bulb along the hood bells across the front like so annoying but so amazing these would be so good as like a stocking prison do you not think just like get one of these for all your friends and then you can all look ridiculous together it's not going to lie I'm very excited to wear this one next up we have some reindeer so much like the elf we also have the reindeer he has a nice soft tummy he has a hood that is just the best thing I've ever seen I actually kind of want to put this on right now and again cells around the collar and this has 12 pounds to this one which I have already worn is Primark I think this is one of my favourite Christmas jumpers this whole year I don't know why I love it so much I just do it's really soft it's really thin so it's not like too thick you don't get too warm in it I love the little Christmas trees and I love that it's like a high-neck I don't know I just love everything about this and I don't have a price on it because I pulled the tag out but I can't imagine it was that much back to the men's section we've got this one I think this is quite classic it's got a snowman on it no that's not a snowman that's a reindeer oh now this okay when I said that the men's section has all the best ones this was actually in the women's section was this in the Mamas yeah so this one lights up and it's got a Christmas tree with sequin baubles I love this this is amazing now I've not lit this one up yet okay turned it on oh my god look at this you're not gonna be able to see because of the lights can you see it it's proper twinkling in different colors as well again quite similar to the one with the deers on except this is polar bears and it's a lot more like icy and the colors are kind of creams and nudes and grays and I love this like I really love this I honestly think these jumper holes are just one of my favorite holes I've done all year because I just get so excited by a festive jumper I feel like at this rate I'm gonna need a separate wardrobe just for my Christmas jumpers when it gets to like November I'm not even joking either because I do have all the ones from last year that I kept too because I I love them all let it know I like this there's no puns it literally just says let it snow and it's in sequins but what I think is really cool which I did on accident but I feel like maybe this could be a real thing that they had considered was if you do this it's like snow and then you do this oh how satisfying is that I honestly think I would just stand there all day doing this look it's like wipe so you do this and then you clear away all the snow and it says let it snow I just think that's jr. that was the from the women's section as well this was from the men's section and you might be wondering Zoey I know you love your Christmas jumpers and really like them when they're tacky you have yet to show us one that sings and that's where this one comes in this little snowman with a pom pom knows women don't usually have flat round noses today actually the snowman did have a flat round nose he did not have a current oh what fun it is to ride on a one-horse open sleigh hey I don't know how my life has come to sitting in my spare bedroom singing along to a Christmas jumper on camera four millions people can someone like let me know how this has happened I mean I'm not complaining I'm just a bit confused we then have hmm hmm have some great sequin numbers so the first one is this one and it says I'm not a chicken it is in fact a gold sparkly turkey but is that not the most impressive like sequin display ever seen on jumper the silver ones are holographic it is quite a spectacle I have to say I'm loving that and then this one gangster rapper okay this is the only one I bought that had a bit of a pun on it because it also had a pug on it so I feel like that kind of justified why I did it but uh how cute is that and not only that but the Pug is wearing a flippin head scarf I love it and he looks a bit cross-eyed which is just like Nala okay ASOS even though when I actually went on the hunt for Christmas jumpers they didn't really have a lot of choice they do actually have some more in now um but I I don't need any more so I'm happy with the ones I got don't eat anymore here they are so I bought two that were from the reclaimed vintage kind of section and I think these are men's but I quite like them being a bit oversized like roll up sleeves and I really liked this kind of old-school little drawing I guess is it drawing transfer print it's just very festive everything about this is very festive and I love the contrast with the blue I just think I don't know I like it I really like this one and then this one which I wore in my November favorites up on this one but I love this I think also this is one of my favorites it reminds me of the coca-cola advert which has just been aired on TV before I watched this and I got very excited and again this was a sauce reclaimed vintage I love it also got this one which is from boohoo but on a sauce and it's got a little deer on it very cute do you guys remember like if any of you have been watching my channel for like ever do you remember when I had an obsession with like forms yeah my inner fawn fan came out when I saw this and I was like I have to have it also I just I think you have to have at least one like properly red jumper this one is also a favorite because it reminds me of something that you would wear if you went skiing or like I don't know it's a very it's got a very kind of 80s ski vibe because of the fit and the pattern I love this so much I know I'm going to be wearing this a lot and it's like tight the sleeves turtleneck and a really beautiful pattern and yeah just love this one last but by no means least I have this one which again is quite like a class prin it's got snowing at the bottom snow flakes and little bits of snow and I just think it looks really cool I don't know I like it and it's quite fixed that one so it keep you nice and warm and that my friends is the majority of Christmas jumpers I have gone out and purchased this year I would absolutely love to see your favorite Christmas jumper so if you can after watching this video give it a thumbs up and then go and find your most crazy favourite Christmas jumper and tweet me at zoella or tag me on Instagram because I really want

[Music] hello everybody in today's video I'm doing something with a slightly different style this is definitely a lot more of the sort of style that you would find on my vlog channel which is more zoella where I have been doing vlog with bluffers vlogmas this month so if you want to catch up on everything i've been doing up until this very point of december and i'll leave a link in the description so today's video is a bit different because i want to take you around my house and show you all the little festive touches that i have done this year which aren't all that different from last year but you guys really like seeing it and it's the sort of video that I really love to sit and watch and so that is what we're going to do first on the agenda is our main Christmas tree in the living room which we have here which we went and got from a place near Brighton called wilderness woods and it's a real tree because you just can't beat the smell of a real Christmas tree are you naked under that very Christmas this is my tea towel oh you do have fat on under that right oh my god the decorations on this tree are all from the white company because they just do the most gorgeous decorations look we've got some of those these ones are very pretty the Bell some snowflakes glass ones some ceramic ones some little pom-poms this one I love love I like that it sort of hides gaps in the tree and yeah that is the main Christmas tree and I love it this is something that I bought last year but our Christmas tree stand was too big so we couldn't put the truck around it I don't know whether this is the tackiest thing I've ever bought or the best thing I've ever bought and I've got a sniffily dog next to me so I'm sorry for the sniffing but this train goes around the track yay couple of little festive bits over on our chair we've got the baby it's cold outside cushion which was from Asda very cute and they let it snow cushion which has lights in it from Marks and Spencer these super fluffy ones or from home scents this is essentially a chair of cushions which is so impractical but so comfy this candle we've got on our coffee table is from next home and it's their festive spy scandal this is huge this is an 80-hour burning candle and we've I mean it's doing all right actually it's just one of my favorite smells at Christmastime so we have this huge candle and we also have a reed diffuser upstairs in the same scent felt like it was also worth mentioning this throw which me and Alfie have lived in since kind of end of October early November and it's from Marks and Spencer and it's just this huge big throw that's so soft and so thick and so cozy if you want to spend the evening on the sofa watching a Christmas film the mantelpiece which i think is always so festive we've got Merry Christmas bunting which is this kind of quite cool like copper letters and that was from home scents I also got these berries from home scents and we've got those in a tulle copper pot they look like they've got like rain on them I really like them candlesticks are from the white company and then we've got a garland across the top just with some fairy lights in it and some big copper baubles from West Elm I bet you can lick see me in these we also have this really cute stocking this is from where was that from John Lewis last year I think it's like huge big pom-poms I really like it this is a snowman from my Pinterest DIYs I couldn't bear to get rid of him he's just too cute so we've kept him on the mantelpiece and there you go from far away I feel like even though this isn't a real fire I feel like this is such a cozy element of the room and especially at Christmas because with all the lights and the candles it's just so cozy I had this on the radiator last year but this is dried fruit so if any of you have never done this before or ever bought these or seen these anywhere I would highly recommend it this smells like Christmas it smells amazing doesn't it Nala you demonstrating is it one of your favorites I just quite like laying this on the radiator because it just makes the radiator look a little bit more attractive but because of the heat it kind of like warms the room with the scent of Christmas and it's just the best so there you go we've got the tree the Train the cozy chair the big old throw which after I film this video I'm definitely going to get under moving into the kitchen underneath our clock we have this which is a song that I bought last year from Marks &amp; Spencer it's just really nice it looks like chalk on a chalkboard and it says it's the most wonderful time of the year and I just like that all the fonts are different and it's quite handwritten it looks really cute next up is the kitchen windowsill I've got these cute little mice this one has a him buck this one is carrying a bell but this candle holder from home scents which I really really like it's just got lots of red berries on it and you can stick three candles in although I only ever stuck one in I didn't buy any for the other side so that was a bit silly I should have done that and then we've also got another little mouse with a bell in his hand here candle on the go this is fresh balsam I bath and Bodyworks smells amazing and then these lights were from the white company and they're sort of I don't know how to explain them but they sort of all fan out from one point which I'm really quite liked over here which i think is one of my favorite little spots in the house is the kitchen Christmas tree which I am obsessed with I love these tall slender trees because you can find any area of your house whether that a large area a small area or you're just not really sure a slender Christmas tree will always go where you don't think you have room for a tree and that's why I really like this one this one I believe is from John Lewis and this is a 7-foot slender tree and the decorations that I have on this one are my decorations that I bought last year from next next time do some really great decorations and they're all plastic too so there's no like fear of them dropping and smashing especially if you have pets or a dog that could potentially either knock over the tree or brush against it I think that's just a little bit more safe it pops a little bit of mistletoe tinsel around this round mirror I think I like this bit because the tree reflects in the mirror and it just looks very festive the only thing I don't have is anything on the top of this tree which I don't know is that bad luck is that weird I don't know maybe I should put something up there my favorite ball ball on this tree is this one I think that one's really cool and also just the little glittery ones that really like on the table we have this runner which is grey with stars on this is from Zara I quite like this just because it's a little bit more simple I then popped these place mats down I think we've got four of these but I've just popped one in the middle and I believe these are from next as well I've then got some little oliver bonus star table lights these are just battery-operated lights but I've just decorated them around there I'm not sure where this was from possibly next or John Lewis last year and the candle in the middle is winter by bath and Bodyworks up here on this wall which you may have seen in quite a lot of my main channel videos I've just got some Mary Mary bunting the pom-pom bunting which I'm actually obsessed with I wish I'd bought more of this because I think this wrapped around a tree would have looked really impressive that was from home sense and then again that one is Mary Mary and so is that one I just find this wall so big and like bland so I like to put something on it I think this wreath is one of my favorite purchases of this year this was from HomeSense and I just really like how delicate it is this is all pieces of paper and it also has bells and berries and it's just really like dainty and quite delicate and I really like that I think it's quite pretty on this mirror we've just put a little bit of fake ivy along the top and as you can also see in the mirror we've put some Garland's up these are from the white company I think they look really real like I'm really impressed with these so I've got two I've got one up there and then one here just going up there and then I also kind of just weaved in some of the copper wire lights with batteries same up there by the door I've got this little sign that says there is no place like home for Christmas which I thought was quite nice being next to the door have a little reminder this is something that Alfie's mum actually bought for me and it's our doormat and it says have yourself a merry little Christmas and I believe that this is from John Lewis how cute is that hair fusil should I learn Ella yeah moving on now to upstairs into the guest bedroom which I'm sure you've all seen because this is where I feel most of my main channel videos and it's been kind of pimped out for Christmas basically or you can kind of see it in the mirror the bedding changes regularly but it's always festive so at the moment we have this one which is white with these little kind of Kitsch rain gears on which are so cute I love it these are only from Asda and I believe these were about 14 pounds I'm have also got pillow case these furry giant cushions were from Marks &amp; Spencer last year as was this throw which is a king sized throw and I can't even tell you how difficult it is to try and find big enough throws that really drape over your bed so I was really impressed impressed I was really impressed with that I also have this adorable little cushion this is from George at Asda and these curtain lights are from lights for you which I always leave in the description of my videos but when Mark was over one day we pimped out with bull balls and Mark actually did this and he did them in like some kind of order which I really like I just think it adds a little bit more kind of Christmas to the fairy-like backdrop and then another slender tree because it's just fit everywhere like I said anyway you've got space you can get one of these in it this one was actually pre lit and that made life extremely easy you literally just put it together and plug it in this was also from John Lewis and then the bull balls are from John Lewis as well and I think some maybe from next it's kind of a mixture of next and John Lewis but I really really like it I think it's lovely christmas trees just make me unbelievably happy oh I also have that reed diffuser I was telling you about the next one called festive spice so this whole room smells of this which really like just a few little touches but I also have a spiced gingerbread candle by bath and Bodyworks on the bedside table as well as a little zoella Beauty gingerbread hungry hands hand cream for guests whenever they fancy a little injection of gingerbread moving on into the last room now which is mine and Alfie's bedroom and there are a couple of little bits and pieces in here which are festive we haven't decked out the whole room it's not as crazy as the spare room but we do have a couple of little bits that I thought it would be nice to share with you I have already shown this Christmas tree on my vlog Channel but I'm going to show it here through any of you that haven't seen that this is a little four-foot Christmas tree from John Lewis and I've put multicolored lights on it but as I was saying on my vlog channel I love these lights because they include the pink light which I think gives it quite a retro feel and I also put these pom-pom garlands on from hobby crafts and these tiny little glass brightly colored bubbles were from home scents so this is my rainbow Christmas tree and I think it's one of my favorite ones ever it's just a really happy Christmas tree on the bed we have this throw which is extremely Christmasy and this was from home scents I actually found this when I was in my mum's shopping she saw it first and she was like oh my god this is so cute and I was like a hundred percent agree this would look adorable either draped over the sofa or on the end of our bed which is where it is now because we don't have Christmas bedding right now we literally just changed it but I did have some like super soft brushed cotton flannel sheets on and now we have white one so it's not as exciting but this does jazz it up slightly all is calm all is bright cushions these are from Boden I love them you can turn them over and it says the opposite just I don't know they're also really comfortable and there are nice size and I just really like them these fairy lights aren't technically just for Christmas because they've been up there for a while but I really like them and I thought they might be worth sharing with you so there you go that was my little Christmas house tour slash follow me around my house and let me show you all my Christmas things video over hope you guys liked it give it a thumbs up if you did and I will see you again tomorrow bye [Music]

 * HORRIBLE HALLOWEEN MUSIC *  
 Hello! Hello, everyone, today I'm going to do another "What's in my PO Box/Blog Box/New Beauty Products?"   I must think of a new title again   If you haven’t seen my previous video   This basically is to introduce something that is sent to my PO box.   Some are from some great PR companies or brands   There are many new things coming out   I like to watch this video   Because I really like to see everyone’s reaction to these new products   And all of you love my last movie of this type. You said you want to see new ones again.   So I'm gonna do this video for you today   I've seen my PO box, and then picked something I think is good...   Whether high price, low price, intermediate price   Some new exciting things that make my eyes stand out   Let me think I must introduce this in the movie   Tell us first   This will be a very long and embarrassing movie. Only we can sit and see what's in my PO box.   So go get snacks and drinks   Find a place to sit down, take a blanket, and comfortably   Then let's take a look   I have hair in my eyes   I need to start with YSL first   Because I am super ~~~ love this brand   This is Vinyl Couture Mascara   Uh... let's take a moment to appreciate these colors   I also admire that I don't know how to take so many things at once   There are many very beautiful colors in this series   Actually when I received these... I was not so excited   We all remember those days when I was saying...Some people may not know because... Facing facts, after all I am 26 years old.   But I remember I used blue mascara   My first mascara, except the clear one, is blue   I don’t know why, it seemed to be a good idea at that time   But seeing the previous photo is obviously not a good idea   Very thick, (lashes) very thin   Anyway, it's not good   So when I heard this for the first time, I thought "I don't..."   The days when I used blue mascara just passed   It's hard   I seem to be sitting in a rocking chair   But when I watched them still see someone else use   This is not like the mascara I used before.   These are absolutely a million times better   What I'm most excited about is that these are a bit shiny   Although my eyes are a little sensitive to glitter   I think I'm a bit allergic to these glitters or eye products that contain glitter   But these really make me very excited   This is bright golden   And this...it's really beautiful   This is a very beautiful navy blue   There is a little silver glitter   I think it looks great   I haven’t tried any of these   But I must say that they are not as scary as I thought   Even the dark green looks like it's cool   There are also some green glitter   No, it's just a bubble   What I see next is this   It looks really awesome   Take pull ~~~   Look at these beautiful lipsticks   I love YSL lipstick, especially their lipstick   So when I see this   I became very excited with the new series of lipsticks   And I found my name on it   Make me more excited   This is No. 217, called "Nude Crisis"   Ah!!   How can I sneeze with a new lipstick out of the box?   This is No. 216 and it is called "Red Conflict"   This is No. 218, called "Coral Remake"   This is No. 215, called "Pink Spring Heart"   This color is so beautiful   This is No. 214 and it is called "burning fire"   I highly recommend YSL lipstick, although a little expensive   But if you are looking for more advanced lipstick, it is very cost-effective   Next this product was launched by my friend Ruth Crilly.   She partnered with COLAB to launch dry-cleaning hair   This feeling is very refreshing   I think sometimes using dry-cleaning hair makes me feel heavy   I don't know how to say .... Oh, see what I did   But Ruth's not like this   So if you haven't tried it, I will push COLAB   She recently launched a new COLB active dry-cleaning hair   Designed for an active lifestyle, leaving hair fresh, moisturized and protective   Gym, beach, swimming pool or daily exit   I think I will definitely carry this stuff out of the box.   Let's try smelling it   Hey ~~ it tastes great   There is a clean sheet   There is also clean hair   Urban Decay once again introduced great new products and great packaging   In the previous video I said   Two Faced will always have interesting, innovative and exciting color plates or other things   So I'm particularly excited when there are new products   Urban Decay is the same   They cooperate with many celebrities, and there are film collaborations.   I think this is exciting and I really like it   So when I saw this, I thought I would have to put this in the film because... I mean...   You guys look, this is an eye shadow disk inspired by "mirror sleepwalker: time geeks"   First of all, let's talk about this package, because it looks like a kaleidoscope, I like it very much.   (*゚∀゚*)   I know that many people do not like this fancy thing, but...   I like it very much   Hey... wait, that's it? Hey! This is a slide-out drawer   My goodness   check it out   What's inside?   You see...   Is a butterfly!   Hey then the mirror says we are all crazy   I like this saying   Because it is very realistic   You pull it out of the drawer   OK, so you can keep this   This can be lost if it is too burdensome   I am a bit disappointed that eye shadow is not here   Because it's easy to use   But I really like this concept because it's very special   And there is a brush below, with the same pattern above   There are a lot of great colors inside. For Urban Decay, what I have to say is that they often put some very bright colors into it.   Those are the ones I will never use   Like "Hat quotient" "head of scroll" and "pervert"   But some other things are pretty   Like "salazen grum" looks beautiful   The "paradox" is awesome   The Duchess is awesome   "Lily" is awesome, this is a very nice cream with a little shiny pink inside   So... yes, there are some great shades   Anyway, in summary, this is a very beautiful color plate.   There are also lipsticks, five limited edition shades   ( oΔo ) You look at this package, it's really beautiful   Hey, this is the color of Zoey.   You see, this is a dark berry-colored lipstick   I like it, this is "mirana"   Hey! They are all metallic and really interesting   This is just called "time" and metallic color too   This is a metallic gray blue   I don’t know if it will make me look cool or it will look like I’ve been in the fridge for days.   We will soon know   This is the "Crazy Hat Merchant" is bright purple with bright powder   Hey, this is pretty cool. I like it very much.   This one is called...Iracebeth   Is a bright red matte lipstick   So this is not metallic   Then this one is more shiny   (☉д⊙)   This band has bright nude and silky pink   And it's called "Alice"   Wow! This is different from what I thought   This is really skin color, it reminds me of one of Barry M's   Maybe it was "God dear"   This is the one that all bloggers are crazy about in 2010.   Let me know what you think, I think this series is very beautiful   I like the kaleidoscope and the flowers, I think it's cool   And... Yes, I have to go and watch this movie. These brands have all worked with this movie, but I haven’t seen it yet.   Next is Sam and Nick's Real Techniques Brush Set   I remember this was a collection before, so you can only buy one at a time   But many people like it very much   So now it has become a resident commodity, so you can buy it at any time. Great!   I don't remember I've used this group before   So I'm looking forward to trying it out   I like this little branch, it can be used to open up the concealer   So I'm going to open it and put it in my little make-up brush jar   Barry M Introduces Lip Care Oil   You all know how much I love Kerran's lip care oil   This is a soothing lip care oil, they are my favorite   I use the lip care oil, they have a great taste, good durability, make my lips feel very moist   They are probably one of my favorite products in 2015   So when I saw Barry M also introduced lip care oil   It immediately triggered my interest because I wanted to know...   Is this as good as Kran poetry?   Or... you know... at least similar   Because the price will be much lower   This is transparent   Called "coco madman"   Containing coconut oil moisturizing nourishment and silky silk .. tea ... Camellia?   It tastes great   I actually used this one. I think this is not so fast absorbed by the lips. The effect is not lasting.   However, it is still a lot of options for parity   These are great   This is called "Berry Good" Lip Oil, which says "With raspberry and pomegranate essence, extremely moisturizing lips   In the same way, it tastes like the one I mentioned in the previous film and tastes like a kind of drink that you have to insert into a straw to drink.   Plug in and drink, because it's a drink, there's no wrong Zoey, that's how the drink is   I think this is pretty good, of course, its color is lighter than that of the Kelan Poem.   But transparent this should be my most common   This is probably my favorite   Next is Sleek's cosmetics   Sleek is a counter that you can find in Boots and Superdrug   They have a lot of good quality but affordable cosmetics   I really like their stuff   Their eyeshadow plate I know is a favorite of many people forever   I was very excited when I saw these appear in my PO box   These are part of the "Matte Me" series, but also "Super smooth lip gloss" is exactly my food   They introduced six new colors, so we have here...   The first one is "shabby chic" and is a soft pink   This "fire" is a deep red, and I think this will still be popular by the end of the year.   This is the "old good dock" is blood red   This is a "velvet slippers" is a gentle deep plum color   This is the "wine" is very deep berry color   The last one is "Bittersweet" and is coral pink.   Most of these tones are quite winter for me   The colors are darker and the fall is a bit   Except... I think it is... "Bittersweet" and "Shabby Chic" They are more pinkish   But it does not matter, because I think other is also very suitable for use at night   Other stuff from Sleek is the "Strange Paradise" series   The first is the eye shadow disk   This is called "The Fun of the Expo"   It reads, "Come and come quickly! Welcome to the bizarre paradise, a paradise full of fun and pastel colors."   Wow! This is really a very fun and colorful eye shadow dish   I don't know if I would use all the colors   I think for some people who have experimental spirits for makeup   Or someone who wants to be a makeup artist or someone who wants to try different makeup   This is perfect because his color range is very wide   There are three lipsticks here   These are "lips VIP - half fog lipstick"   This is "Sexy Totti"   This is the "big person"   And this one is "Tide pants"   There are three types of creamy blush. It feels funny.   The first one is "foolish" and it is a very deep berry   There is also this is "fast" is a very lovable bright orange   This blush color should be very interesting   Then the last paragraph is "喧嚣"   It's a kind of red with pink tones. It's cool.   These are very exciting to me   I like this scent of Soap and Glory   This fragrance is "Sugar Crush" which is definitely my favorite   "Fresh pressed sweet lime scent, plus kiwi and lime fruit juice and cool capsule technology   European buy ~   Hey... got on the nose   I think this taste is very suitable for shower gel because it smells really like jelly   This is the basic pink fragrance, this is the "clean as I" fragrance   Hey... I'm still super-loving, smelling this smell will bring me back to...   When camping in Newquay (Newquay UK city)   I don't know why, when I was ... how old was it? 17?18?   Wow...what? Maybe I used this for camping   What's going on?? What's going on here? Why does taste have this effect?   I really want to know what's just happening in my head   Does any scientist or student who studies the brain let me know what's going on, because it's really weird   I didn’t think of camping ever since I’ve been there, so I’m not sure what’s going on.   I'm very interested in trying these, I think this combination is cool   I really like this taste, and I think the two will make people feel more... fresh, I think   When I received this in the PO box, I was very excited because I really like the brand Becca.   They have some great highlights   When I opened it did not disappoint me   You guys have a look, this is the “Champagne Flow Gold” launched by Jaclyn Hill...Er...Combination   The smell of the box is very strange, I do not know why   There is the smell of vomit... I don’t know why   But I'm glad I can now record this video   So I can take things out and throw them away   Nepalese cut down... Nepalese cut down   (* ́∀`)~ beautiful color plate   There are three beautiful crimson shades and two highlight shades   This is really suitable for taking out the door   Also, this is the best mirror I have seen in the color tray for so long   Then this is called "champagne series face color plate"   I'm looking forward to try it   Next is Becca's Jaclyn Hill....eye shadow tray   I think she seems to have some doubts about this, or when other people are having problems with it.   I haven’t used my   and so...   I try it with my fingers, hey! I'm not bad   Ok, these colors are beautiful, you guys look   I remember she had sent a tweet saying that the eye shadow was not the same as she wanted.   I'm not sure what happened   Maybe she will re-launch or ... I don't know, but my ok   Anyway...I Phuket (゚∀゚)   Then this is Becca's shiny complexion correction fluid   I haven't tried it yet....wow!   This can be added a bit to mix in the liquid foundation to create a brighter look or directly on the cheekbones.   Both are OK, sounds good, it sounds perfect for me   Then this is Becca's unblemished light....   Wow...so this is more creamy   You see~   This is so beautiful   I don't use paste on my face, I don't know why   Maybe I should try it. I know many people only use creamy blush and brightening.   Uh... I don’t know... I’m not used to it   There's also Becca's Shiny Complexion Correction - "Champagne Jumping" - Powdery Lightening   This I have to say is the most beautiful color   Here's something... with a little orange hue in it   I like it very much. I think it will be... It will be a winner.   Next, here are some ....   These are Models Own's Ultra Jelly Nail Polish   All are fluorescent pink, I really like this idea   Because these colors are more conspicuous   This bottle is a pretty... a little fluorescent pink, called "candy silk"   This bottle is a beautiful light blue, called "candy planting."   This bottle of green is a "comfortable bouquet"   Yellow, called "Lemon Popsicle"   And this "clove" is a very beautiful lavender   Very bright and pink, I like it very much   I have not used the "Super Jelly" series, so I will try it out and let you know if I like it or not.   Here are two new products from Laura Mercier   The first is "Nude makeup eye shadow disc"   Super nude makeup sounds like my dish   I like nude color ~ you guys have a look   This packaging is very elegant and completely unlike Urban Decay, which is much better than Urban Decay.   You see how beautiful this is   There is a beautiful combination of bright and matte colors, as well as a mirror of moderate size   I use every color in it   And I noticed there are a lot of different brown tones   Usually there is only one or two matte browns in a box of eye shadows   And usually it's more... warmer   And there are some nice shades like this...   Dark warm   Gray-tone   A reddish and a brighter brown   I think they really... really picked all the colors you would want   Another is Colourdots lip gloss   This is "Tequila Sunrise (Bartender name)"   It's a pretty pink   I feel so cute, it looks like I can look like a popsicle   do not   Then this is "Fruit Powder Fist"   This is a shallow coral pink   If I want to apply it to my lips, I'm not sure how to use them because they are quite wide   Of course, unless you use a lip brush   Well... same, I rarely use such things, so   I think I'll try it out, especially in summer   A picture that floats in my head is that I painted it as a face.   Then I don’t know how to get halo and the result looks bad   So I hope I will find a suitable way to use, but they look very beautiful   Some of the new products launched by Hourglass~ you all know that I love you (* ́∀`)~   This is the triple of Hourglass... Triple bright face color plate   There is a brightening inside, a blush and a bronze cake   You see~   In the same way, two of them are creamy, bronze cakes are, and blushers are also   Oh, wait!   The lightening is also creamy, so this whole dish is   This is definitely a popular, creamy product is now very popular in Europe, and quickly buy some creamy products   As you can see, I haven’t tried it yet   But I still want to share with you because some people should like to use paste products   You should like this, this color is also very beautiful   There is even brighter skin correction makeup pre-milk   It is said that it can be used as a uniform highlight and soft light   At the same time, cover your skin and refine skin texture to make your makeup perfect   I am the kind of person who often forgets to apply makeup before putting on liquid foundation   I do a moisturizer, let it absorb it, and then I put it directly on the liquid foundation, and then I thought "Damn! I forgot the milk before makeup."   I should use more pre-makeup milk. I know that many people rely on pre-makeup milk to hold makeup for a whole day.   This sounds like something I would love to try.   Next is Smashbox   This box is so big. What's inside?   If you have followed me on snapchat you will know   Pull up ~d(`・∀・)b   Let's pause for a moment...to appreciate this combination   This is the best combination, and this is Lily   Lilly Singh, 嗨Lilly, see how pretty and beautiful she is   This is Smashbox's "Forever Perfect" Liquid Lipstick   Now it looks like... Now popular is liquid lipstick and... Creamy face product   This is the trend I feel because there is a lot of liquid... I have a lot of liquid lipstick to use   I think I can never use it   They sent me all the colors of the new liquid lipstick that they might use   This allows you to spend your life   Lily also introduced this so-called "Bawse" I really like   It is a very beautiful red   I am looking forward to trying it out   I think this should be all, no... oh!   I have another thing to show you   Eh ah ah ah ah   There is always a company that does too much when it comes to launching new products.   And the company is usually...   It's Benefit ლ(•ω • ლ)   This was sent to my house   Then I wanted to say what they did this time??   OK... Hey! Let me try to open it first   Well, you guys look   If you guys look at my snapchat, you may already see it.   Ah!!(゚д⊙) I almost fell off my chair   These are Benefit eyebrows products   I can't hold it so it's still in my lap   Is this the best new product you have seen?   I mean, I’ve seen some things that have impressed me in the past six years.   But this really...   I can open my own... A special benefit...Benefit eyebrows   It looks like ... all the things that eyebrows use are here   here has...   Brow Zings   and also...   Eyebrow pencil, each color has   as well as...   KaBrow, oh! What is KaBrow? I haven't used it   Brush brow eyebrow   d(`・∀・)b   and also...   Gimme Brow   and also...   3D eyebrow color   There is a brow highlighter   a small brush   And "ready, set, BROW" is what everything is used by your eyebrows.   And your friend's eyebrows can be used for a lifetime   Or open a brow salon   They are really generous. Of course, I will pick out the colors I want to use. The others will be distributed to friends and family members.   They may want to, after all, I can't use all 6 colors   But this is really great   I think they designed a lot of new packaging, so they just launched such a combination   So I'm looking forward to trying it out   I'm not sure I've ever used Benefit's eyebrow products before   I think I should have taken "Brow Zings". I know many people like this little brow   In short, I want to stop watching them with eager, loving eyes.   I have to put this down to find my color   Then ... to other people... to give life to other people's eyebrow products   OK, this may be the longest movie in history   Thank you very much for watching. Thank you very much for sitting with me.   I very much hope that you like it   If you like remember remember   If you want me to continue doing this   I like it very much, because it means that after I introduce them to you,   I think I will use them more often because they will not be taken directly into the box   I would rather use it and because I shared it with you   It will make me feel, oh, brain remind, remember to use   So I like to watch it, I also like to use   I hope you have a wonderful weekend   We will see you soon again, 掰~(* ́∀`)~♥  
hello everybody firstly I want to say how very sorry I am that I have not uploaded in two weeks I think that's the longest I've gone on this channel for a really long time without uploading I do have a good reason for it I have been so busy the reason I'm out of breath is because I've just run up to the top of the stairs Oh booster always well stocked with trainers and the reason about a breast is because we've just run out all the stairs and this room is like a sauna so I'm a sweaty mess I'm just going to be a bit of a mess in this video I think I've had to say makeup on all day I'm just not really sure what this looks like but we're here we're making a video yeah as I said very sorry I have been so busy it's actually unreal and I didn't feel very well last week so here I am up in my attic into the seagulls oh it's like being back in my old flat on the seafront if you remember that got my legs open this is not good look it's a good job you can't see I know that you guys really like my more kind of chilled chatty videos or QAS whether that's just me or with a friend and so I thought I would do one today do another little chatty Q&amp;A and have a lipstick emoji ah so the biggest portion of my viewership or audience on YouTube are people over the age of 18 but there is still a huge huge amount of you who are under 18 and I always notice a lot of you have a lot of questions about what it was like for me being a teenager and how I dealt with certain situations growing up and I don't feel like I've ever done a video like this so I asked you all on Twitter if you have any oil on Instagram actually I said on Instagram story if you've got any questions then come treat me I feel like the first thing I should point out though is how different it must be being a teenager too when I was a teenager because funnily enough as much as I hate to admit it that was actually quite a long time ago for me so I was seventeen ten years ago so my early teens was a wee while I'll let you do the math and I get asked the same question quite a lot which is if you are a teenager now how would you find it and honestly I don't know I think you all deserve a medal because things like social media and Instagram and like and like this whole kind of popularity thing wasn't around when I was in school we had MSN Messenger and there was like AOL chat rooms and we could text if we had credit and there is a huge part of me that is so thankful that things like MySpace Bebo and Facebook only really happened towards the end of my teens which was the first one we had we had I feel like I have my space first and then Bebo and I must have been fifteen sixteen and I feel like no one really knew how to use it and it was all very new and it wasn't the same although I will say for any of you nineties kids out there who may have also used Bieber MySpace the only thing we ever really had arguments about was in what order your friends were in your top eight friend I used to hate doing that I think I used to shuffle mine or put them on random because it was like that was the only thing that caused us rao's in our friendship group or did it I don't know maybe I just secretly got really sad if I wasn't someone's like at least top five versus most interactions I ever had with people would be on MSN Messenger and in those days you only had your friends that was it and the only thing you really have to think about with which song lyrics you're going to put in your MSN Messenger like tagline what was it called bio tagline I can't remember but hey if we didn't have Twitter you wouldn't been able to asking these questions so there's that I guess Julia did actually ask how do you think being a teenager in present day differs from when you were a teen and I guess I sort of answered that there's more pressure now outside of your friendship group which I didn't have and the only interaction we had with people who we weren't really friends with with actual face-to-face conversation and then by the time we were sort of friends that's when you'd get there MSN and that's when you get the number but there wasn't that same kind of image to portray on social media I guess I don't know I would love to chat to like a room of teenagers to find out how they really feel about it that would just be so great please let me know in the comments let's have like a discussion about this how do you feel being a teen with things like Twitter Facebook things like ask fm honestly just sounds like a nightmare to me when I was at school someone created for like rape my teacher or something and that was about as like savage as it got how do you control your hormones as a teenager and that is by Shannon you can't just is the answer to that you can't really and actually when I think back to when I was a teenager teenager teenager my hormones are quite extreme but it's only as I look back at some of my behavior I wasn't terrible don't get me wrong but my mood swings and I remember I used to have arguments with my mom and dad and I definitely struggled with the hormone I wouldn't have ever admitted it at the time but looking back I can see that I did being a teenager is such a weird time because you've gone up to secondary school you're sort of trying to figure out who you are who your friends are you're getting put with people who you might not necessarily have a lot in common with but feel you need to be friends with and you see these people every day five days a week like for a massive portion of your life no wonder you're going to struggle with it sometimes so it's only natural again when hormones are included within that that you are going to struggle sometimes and also you start to feel all the feels you start to feel that you start to feel jealous you start to feel bitter you start to feel angry you start to feel over emotional you start to feel overly excited overly happy it's like all the feels all the emotions and all the feels and I definitely have that but it made for some of the best moments and the best memories and some that I can look back on and be like wow I was a biatch to my parents and my brother probably you need to remember everyone else around you is also experiencing that and it kind of varies person by person and you know hormones affect people so differently but essentially you're all in the same boat and it's happening to everyone so don't feel weird or feel like you have to control them in any way I think hormones are something that's very difficult to control but I do think trying to find a bit of kind of you time and chill and have like a space that you like to be in and to be able to go and have a moment I think is really important so obviously like your bedroom like maybe like a candle put some fairy lights on like it's about making yourself feel at ease if everything is getting a little too much so like this video is going to be really long because I'm such a Rambler say Dawson said pressure to smoke flashing vape I did not have a group of friends that ever pressured me into anything actually but I have seen where other people have felt pressured to do it and I guess I when I was a teen I did think see the thing is that it never felt pressured by anyone else and my parents weren't very like stripped in that sense like they would never lecture me about don't drink and don't smoke and mix or bless remember me and my brother to make decisions ourselves which I think was kind of clever because neither of us are very well um and I think the only pressure I ever had with myself like I had friends who smoked who drank I had I hung out with groups of people who were much much older than me doing worse things house parties some of those memories still haunt me to this day some of the things I saw in house parties just I don't think you should see is like a 15 or 16 year old to be quite honest but I never felt like I needed to do that I didn't feel like I needed to smoke or drink or do drugs I just I kind of watched everyone else do it and I like that doesn't really look fun I think he just looks stupid but I just you know a couple in just be like you just look stupid I don't know I like it for me it was like even actually quite like a turn-off I was just a bit like oh no that's not for me and the only sort of like pressure I had really with me in the back of my head thinking but I'm a teen like should I be trying these things like should I be it was almost like it was me pressurizing myself it was weird it was like well I guess everyone should try something once in their life turns out you don't really have to because I could see what everyone else is doing and I really didn't feel like I was missing out and luckily I wasn't within a group of friends where I felt pressured but I know I would have stood my ground and just said no I'm okay thanks and I do think if you ever feel that pressure within a group of friends you have to put your foot down because you'll never look back on that memory of trying for the first time I'm feel comfortable about it because you'll never be too sure if you really wanted to or not and I'm just not sure that that's a nice way to ever do anything I think everything you do and everything you experience should ultimately be down to you because it's your life if anyone is making you feel pressured to have sex to smoke to drink to do anything that you are not 100% comfortable with say no and if they are your friends they will understand that and if they don't understand that they are not your friends did you ever question your body or feel insecure about your figure how did you overcome it yes I feel like I touched on this a little bit in my questions I've never answered I went through a stage where I had grown in high and I was super skinny and all my friends are getting like hips and boobs in a bum and I was still a bit like all when's mine coming and then they happened I happened very quickly so my boob I thought I almost woke up one day my boobs are there and my bum was there so now I've got like stretch marks and for a while I didn't like it because it almost made me look skinnier because it was like oh these boobs don't like go with my body and like I don't look like my friends why can't I put weight on and I struggled with the fact that I just felt like I looked so skinny and I was quite self-conscious at like PE and I hated putting shorts on but what's so interesting is people assume you can't feel insecure about your body when you're skinnier but I would put shorts on and people would just kind of assume that I'm confident because I've got my shorts on and I've got my legs out and I'm sure there were people around me who would have wanted to have had my legs yet in my head I was like I hate my legs hated swimming oh my god that for me was the worst that's like you know when you remember something and you get like a wave of like war I hated swimming and I honestly believe 98% of the girls in my swimming group hated swimming for this very reason if you're going to put like twenty girls who were all like growing and changing at very different rates and getting used to their bodies and trying to learn why things are how they are or why you're not like Sallie next to you or why you've got one boobs that seems to be growing faster than another boob or why you've got like a wobbly bear or why you feel so skinny you're never going to have a great lesson so I think is never going to be a great lesson lesson we we all hated swimming so much like no one enjoy who enjoy swimming apart from that one girl that was there her like blister socks and swim hat and goggles a nose clip like she's the one that loves swimming but everyone else did not love swimming and I just felt like everyone stared at me Anderson in costume because I was so skinny I hated it so much I still did it I still put the swimming costume on I still and I hated swimming anyway I'm just I hate swimming but I don't know it was kind of like a phase that came and went I remember feeling quite insecure between the ages of about 12 and 14 and then past that I think I stopped caring because I sort of settled with the fact that everyone's bodies were growing and changing at different rates and everyone had something about them that they weren't happy with or something that they felt they wanted to change and that was very reassuring to me because I felt like I was the only one who was the odd one out but actually everyone feels like they're the odd one out at some point which I'm very lucky for because there are a lot of people who can't do that which I feel resat about Eve said how to tell friends you can't or don't want to go to parties because they don't understand I love you I love you too that's hard because there were a lot of things I never wanted to go to because of my anxiety but I feel like I just said I don't want to go the worst part of it for me was that I couldn't go not that I didn't want to go if that makes sense it's that I felt like I couldn't not that I didn't want to so I would be at home knowing they ruler night owl and they were all at having a fab time and I wished more than anything I could be there but I knew I couldn't be and it was that was quite a hard time for me actually that was probably in my later teens that's something I knew I had to deal with like that's not something my friends have to deal with that's me and what I should have done was spoken to someone earlier got help earlier and kind of then lived my kind of late teens early twenties anxiety-free rather than trying to sort out a little bit further down the line but yeah I feel like you just tell them an and again if they're your friends they'll understand and if they don't understand that's okay because it means that it's not something they experience but at the end of the day if you don't want to go out or you feel like you can't then don't and you might get somos but that's a choice you've made and if they love you then they'll still say they miss you Abby said what were your favorite things to do with friends etc during high school oh my god okay so this probably was my favorite thing we would like go to each other's houses and we would make with photographs and windows movie maker we would make little films and I still have them that sorts and now nowadays I would be uploading them to YouTube but back then YouTube didn't exist so I was just like making them and like the saving them and we would like reenacting so we did Mean Girls we did oh my god we did like weird me and my friend did the ring like we would reenact a whole film in photos with slides and like text and music and it was great fun so that's what we did as I got a bit older it was like house parties we used to there was a park next to our school so we used to like hang out in the park quite a lot yeah there was a lot of great times actually a lot of great friend times we used to go shopping on the weekends we would all get the bus in and we would get disposable cameras and like take pictures and lots of sleepovers we would always try and do all-nighters and funnily enough you'd all think I would suck at that but I was actually not that bad what to do when you're in a friendship group then fall out because of nothing how do you deal with it or we had a fair amount of these we're readed as I said at the beginning of this when you're put into a situation for the majority of your life for five years with the same people you're you're never going to always get on like you're just not there's going to be something that brushes one person up the wrong way and then there's tension and then it's awkward and then the group divides and then some people are on that side some people on that side then there's a whole division and they don't speak to these people and it and it will be over something that you don't even remember what it's over and I think what's different today that is so different from back then is when that used to happen with our friends a lot of them making up and the sorting out had to have a face to face which I feel like probably wouldn't happen as much now because those things like Facebook and like messengers and Twitter and there's loads of different places that you can see like snidey indirects and things like that but in the olden days in the olden days that makes me sound so agent but back when I was a teenager it would have been something like it would have there would have been something said at school and someone would have taken it the wrong way or someone would've been having a bad day and someone else wouldn't have cared as much as they should have and then there would be like little tips I wouldn't say we ever all like fell out big time but there was certainly like little arguments here and there hello sympathy we've got busy at the moment looking at are you gonna sit down or are you just gonna breathe heavily behind me hello oh oh you're all in my hair but oh alright you're like Amhara right fit good boy good boy I feel like at the time arguments feel so huge and so like like it's the end of the world and that you'll never be friends again and that it going to be so awkward but eventually you make up because what's the alternative like you see each other every day when you're so close to someone like a sibling or like a relative and you're spending so much time with them you do just rub each other up the wrong way and sometimes you are going to have an argument but then you make up and then you're stronger than you were before because you had to like talk through your differences and you're kind of growing up together and actually I think it would be weirder if growing up you never had a dress of your friends because because there's so much going on and so much is changing and it's a crazy time so of course you're going to argue but you just have to know that those arguments don't have to be the be-all and end-all and I think talking and communicating rather than being snidey and indirect online is the way forward safe said I'm not a teenager anymore but when I was I would like to know how important love really is at that age what's so funny is I thought I was in love at that age but actually being an adult it's not the same kind of love and I don't know I think that's all I can really say on that I do think it exists in teenagers like I do believe if you truly love someone kind of like the people that meet when they're young and they stay together forever that is true love and I think that can happen and if it happens to you then you're really lucky but I saw it had happened but it hadn't and it's only as I got older and met new people but I could see that I haven't been that make sense so in answer to your question it's not that important I think what is important at that age is learning to love yourself and learning to love other human beings whether that's friends or like family I think that's important but being in love with someone I don't think is so important at my age personally how did you cope with toxic friends and how can I get out of toxic friendship if you are with a group of friends in school who are toxic and you are you just aren't happy then you need to step away from that group of friends and I know it can feel so hard but I should feel like if you're if if you're with friends you are making happy it's a bullying youth and making you feel uncomfortable they're pressurizing you they're not the sort of people you're ever going to grow up and be thankful that you are friends with they're not the sort of people that you're going to invite your like wedding in ten years then there's no point you know I mean it's it's such a waste of you as a human being because there are people out there who will appreciate you who will treat you with nothing but kindness and love and you may feel like there is no one else but that is if you flip that and if you think you see someone who is being bullied or who is part of a very toxic friendship then you should extend an arm like ask them how they are like check their okay even if they're not part of your friendship group because there's nothing less than feeling like you're alone in something and whether that's you feeling that way or you know someone who feels that way or you've seen someone who looks unhappy and that group of friends or is getting picked on or who have no friends I think it's just as important for you to reach out to them just ask them how they are ask them how their days been ask them what they're doing later like message them anything because that can make someone feel so much happier because as much as I can say Oh like you'll find new friends I think it's just as important for other people to open their eyes and realize that there might be people that feel like they have no one and when I was in school I don't think I did that enough I don't think I extended an invite or smiled at the people who probably needed it more than I thought they did if that makes sense and it makes you feel good it makes them feel good like the saying some friends are for a reason summer for a season and summer for a lifetime and that's okay if summer for a season fine they were great for that season and it was fab and sometimes it's not meant to last beyond that sorry for a reason so they might come into your life for a purpose lifetime is that so rare that was another thing in school I feel like it's such a big deal to have a lot of friends and it isn't have your select friends are that's one with up to three whether that's ten if you have those cool people who make you happy who bring something to your life who influenced you in a positive way that's all you need and anyone who doesn't do that don't waste your time Ella said if you could be a teenager again which teenage year would you go back to and why I would say all that's so hard maybe like 15 like start of GCSEs 14 15 what year is that good 9 I would go back to you 9 because I felt quite confident in myself although I didn't know what I wanted to do I felt confident in the subjects I was doing for GCSE I'd settled with like yeah I'm happy with these I had my like core group of friends I had a social life and I had a lot of fun and I felt more comfortable in myself I think yeah 14:15 and like no responsibilities because I hadn't started exams yet whoa Abby said what was it like when you first got your period I actually got my period in school it was in tutor time right before last lesson and I just I was one of the last ones out of my friends and I was really excited about it I remember that we had someone come to our school who did like a talk she talked about like periods and things you could use when you're on your period and they gave you like a goodie bag when you left and in it it had like two night time pads some tiny little tampons and some like daytime pads and then like a leaflet and like it was just like a little information pack and it made me so excited to start my period and then like a year later I did in a lesson and I was a little bit embarrassed but actually I had to do the old Tyler jump around the waist because I had nothing on me and then I went home I told my mom and then I realized that I was going to bleed like every month for like the majority of my life so I wasn't that excited after that well Jennifer said when did you start shaving I thought this was quite a good one because I had to really think about this I had to think about what the first thing was I shaved I feel like it might have been my armpits or maybe it was my legs I feel like my armpits took a really long time to get hair I remember I had like a couple of hairs there and I was like oh that's weird and I always used my dad's razor that he would leave on like the side of the bar I must have been about 14 13 or 14 and the amount of times I sliced my legs on my dad's blunt razors was a lot what I will say though is if you are planning on starting shaving if you haven't yet gotten to that point leave it as long as you can because again is something you get so excited to do and then you just realize it is a chore and a ball ache and the hair just grows back thicker I do remember though my mum I remember the first time I shaved down there I must have been like sixteen fifteen sixteen because I thought that that's what you had to do I wasn't sure I don't know and I must have left the hair in the bath this is quite embarrassing stories whenever I tell this oh I didn't wash it away and the next day my mom was like if you ever want to shave your bikini line you just you need to be very careful because it grows back longer and thicker and I heard it can start growing down your legs and I remember her telling me that obviously to try and scare me and after that I was actually really terrified to ever shave down there again turns out it hasn't grown down my legs so thanks for that month I mean it might she might not have been lying but I mean she could have just said hey I noticed you shape your bits just be careful and let me buy you a nice razor so you don't have to eat you dance monkey old ones so I think I'm going to stop there because I have been rambling on for quite a long time now thank you so much for watching this video it's hot and dark as I've been filming this and buzz is gone and the dogs are barking and I'll be going crazy

hello everybody in today's video I am going to be showing you a couple of the little bits and pieces I have bought recently in the way of clothing so I have some acyl and Zara I don't actually remember what I bought which i think is not a good sign think I did this when I got back from Amsterdam and I was unpacking my suitcase and I just thought I'm gonna see what's new in its the new inception that gets me every time I'm so excited okay first thing looks it's a duck egg on it is there if there's anything in these that I keep then make sure you go on over and subscribe to my vlogging channel which is where I do more like outfit of the days and stuff and also a lot of this stuff is very summery but I like this it looks cute it has short sleeves they're quite wild it goes in at the middle and it's quite short but it's also quite girly and cutesy I like it I think this is the shirt this is just a plain white shirt this is from misguided it has like really fluted sleeves and I think it's cropped has buttons down the middle and it's a vide it's got like a deep V I don't love the fabric of this I'm not gonna lie it feels quite thin and like cheapy but I was hoping to wear this with some skinny jeans I just thought it would look quite nice with like a gold necklace and some sandals in the summer so that was like my intention with that now this I am hoping this is a kind of 80s vibe spotty jumpsuit with I guess the kind of short three-quarter length rolled-up sleeves and then it sort of comes in to the middle with these like big gold buttons and then you have the trousers I really I'm envisaging this to look so glam I just don't know if this will look how I want it to look but the vision is strong and it's quite thick so I think it would be okay to wear now actually maybe with a leather jacket on top what is there oh okay don't hate it so much now this is French Connection and this is a jumpsuit so it has this lovely back to it that you can tie up and very loose sleeves has a zip down the back and then three-quarter length kind of qalaat style trousers I think this looks quite nice this would look really nice with just a white t-shirt underneath for now I mean looks very wide I guess you can just tie this up a bit tighter but it looks like it could be quite exposing on the old breasted area I liked that so that was a French Connection I haven't bought anything from French Connection in honestly like ten years oh this is oh my gosh this is so soft holy guacamole I just wanted a plain white jumper that wasn't too thick I could put underneath dungarees or play suits or just to kind of wear underneath things because I didn't really didn't really have any just thin plain white jumpers so I picked up this one this is the brand Jacqueline do young guys this is like the softest jumper I have ever owned it's lovely 16 pounds it's really not bad so yeah just a plain white jumper trying to buy jumpers that are slightly more thin because I feel like I mean I'm hoping for a bit more spring-like weather and in the spring-like weather the jumpers don't need to be so thick so that's what I'm kind of crazy going I made a very brave purchase this is by Motel and no it doesn't feel very nice it feels very thin but this is a kind of astronomy style very tight jump suit I don't know when I might wear this but it's the sort of thing that I just thought I would love to wear something like that and I wonder if I could pull it off I don't know maybe if you know on the rare occasion that Marc and Alfie convinced me to go on a night out I might wear this but yeah that was a brave purchase and not too sure what I was thinking with that bike I mean it could look really nice imagine leggins but over your whole body as a jumpsuit so it's like very very figure hugging oh this is cute this is just an a soft gray t-shirt it says high in faux leather fur hi you know I like my t-shirts that are a bit quirky and have something a bit different on them so I thought that was a nice additive to my wardrobe why did I buy these I think I was on another planet when I placed this order guys these are some earrings I don't think they'd look so bad but they they have balls on I think it's just the dime woman tape it up here that I didn't realize they had and I'm not as keen on that bit some earrings oh I got some felt let me see that's the sort of thing I always just forget to buy new ones off because I have some that I use all the time and I just never think to get any others I just I use the same belt like all the time pretty much because I just never know if I'm buying a belt for my hips or for my waist oh this is waist waist and here I have a very tiny waist which I am not complaining about because I actually really like my waist but it does mean buying belts is very difficult and these do not fit around my waist which is slightly annoying I wonder if maybe I could just have these for if I'm wearing jeans on my hips which I don't tend I don't tend to wear jeans on my hips too much I'm much more of like a high-waisted mom jeans type wearer personally oh and then I went a bit hot crazy I forgot about this I brought loads of hat on the premise that not all of these are going to look good or fit so the first one I bought is just this one that says go away which I really liked I mean it's quite big why is my head so small I try that on with like my hair down and back combed and you know curly maybe the more volume the better I also picked up this hat what's this thing that they put round they're very untrusting this one you can adjust the size of thank heavens a nice style hat you know it looks freaking massive I'm not sure about this I find hats very very hard to get right hence I've ordered like four hats I don't mind it it definitely is more like wintery then I got this one this one you can also adjust that's good oh I like this one this one's nicer it's very floppy yeah I don't mind this wait this one's my favorite so far for sure then the last one I don't know that I even like this before I put it on my head no no so one out of three not bad eh these glasses again an adventurous purchase because I love the style of these however my head makes things slightly difficult with stuff like this because they either suit my head shape or they really really don't so we are all about to find out together no oh my god if these were smaller I would love them but why is everything so big on my head I think I might have to start shopping in the child section if there are any other P headed guys and gals out there please will you let me know where you buy your hats and sunglasses because sometimes a sauce nail it when you can select the size of a hat I'm okay sunglasses are hit and miss you either order some and they're smaller and they look great or you order some and you put them on like those and you're like why is my head so small let me know guys help a fellow P header out but also picked up this because I was watching my friend Susie's vlog hello October you should check out her channel if you don't already I love her and I love her videos she was wearing this this is labeled as a swimming costume but it's velvet and lace like I don't know what getting velvet is wet is like but I don't really put it in a home it's a very interesting concept wet velvet and but she was wearing this as like a body with a pair of shorts and I thought it looked really lovely so I'm going to try this on and see what I think I probably won't wear it as a swimming costume I'll probably just wear it as a op but it's so nice it has like let me see if you can very pretty this one looks very tiny though I may have gone a size too small this is not going to fit over my breast I mean halfway okay may have to go to exercise but I will try that one oh I bought a pair of these trousers in a very bright pink and I love them and one color that I do think screams spring it's bright yellow like even if I just wore these with this little t-shirt I just love I love smart trousers a lot and the pink ones that I bought recently I've worn quite a lot so I just thought it would be nice to go for some bright yellow ones this is like a little nod to Easter I bought it from Pullum bear and on picture I couldn't work out what kind of material it was what was kind of hoping it wasn't this material and it is but I'm not I'm not hating it if I'm honest this hanger is very peculiar isn't it don't think it's meant to be like that or like that it's I mean it looks more like a hanging out this is from Pullen bear it's like I'm it's more of a mustard a yellow but it's it's a very like soft Jersey ish fabric I kind of like it it's sort of like a very smart blazer cardigan like I would probably just wear it over this t-shirt it's a bit more of like a thin coat - no I kind of like it I might roll the sleeves up maybe I wouldn't probably wouldn't do the button-up but pop the collar a bit yeah I don't mind it quite like it it's probably one of those things again when the weather starts to warm up that is nicer to throw on than like a full-on coat I thought to get myself some new dungarees because I have one pair that's two years old from Topshop which are starting to go very very stiff and they're becoming quite uncomfortable to wear so I thought it would get some more these ones also are a lot more of a skinny fits because the ones I have a very baggy and these are buy cheap Monday and they're just very dark black color but I flip in love dungarees so much you can wear them in every season like they are the one staple thing but I would say everyone should have in their wardrobe because you can wear thicker jumpers and layers under them in winter with a coat on top you can wear them in someone with a bando underneath I've done that a few times you can roll up the legs and you can wear them with like thinner jumpers and spring like the possibilities are endless with dungarees they're an all year-round wardrobe staple I also picked up oh these are cheap Monday as well we're not a bit with cheap Monday's free some baggy I just flew denim ones because again I have some old ones but they are kind of getting a bit old and like I wore them so much I wanted something like new but yeah they look quite nice as well those ones are more of a baggy style okay so that's everything from ASOS oh no I also picked up this do you ever go on the gifting section of a sauce because I love it they have some really weird random stuff on there sometimes and there was this little book and I was like oh this is cute I might put this on my desk or in my office somewhere and it says girl power and it just has loads of quotes from cool women in it better to live one year as a tiger than a hundred as a sheep Madonna oh my god I love that I'm not bossy I'm the boss Beyonce so yeah it's a book of quotes by lots of cool so I thought that would be a really nice thing to have in the office just to inject with inspiration and also it just looks ok on to Zara I do feel like this time of year is a really weird in-between eat I'm in the shops because it's still cold that everyone is still wearing like their winter clothing but all the shops have summer things in like there's bikinis and like straw hat and I'm just I'm just not quite there yet I flip in love opening these Zara boxes it's very satisfying and then they took like oh I did order this this is a jumpsuit oh I love the color of this so much it's a burnt orange rust color and it has short sleeves and oh it has pockets on the front and the back look at that and it's just big and baggy and it's jumpsuit I imagine there with the straw hat that fits my head oh okay now these I am so into I haven't bought a pair of like platform trainers ever I see people wearing them and I think they look so cool but I just have never bought any until I saw these they're not even trainers they're like shoes how freaking cool are these I love them they were only 30 pounds as well so yeah I picked these up I think these would go great with this outfit just they end I hope I actually get some use out of them though I hope I don't like get a little scared to wear them because they are a tiny bit out of my comfort zone I don't do heels and I love like shoes and trainers yeah this for me is kind of a combination of the two so I don't know how I feel about them but I just think they look so cool I bought some head scarves slash scarves to tie around your neck I've seen so many people wearing like plain purrs or you know the plain white jumper that I had maybe with some dungarees and then these tied around the neck and it just looks so nice oh I bought some more shoes I don't normally buy shoes from Zara but I was quite impressed with their shoe choice these are leather loafers type things I just wanted some very plain slip-on nice smart ish shoes to wear with the kind of types of trousers I've been really enjoying wearing which is like the yellow ones I've got pins and needles in my foot and I just really liked the look of these with the big gold chain on I thought they were really nice I then also got this bag which actually I am very late to the party with the whole like Hessian style bags I am aware of that I just wanted to make sure it was gonna be a thing that was around for a while you know so I picked up this one from Zara it has wooden handles which I absolutely love but it also has a long strap so you can put it over your shoulder and it has this really nice somewhat squashed tassel I tell you why I got this one I like the size of this some of them I've seen a very small and some of them I've seen a huge which I think if you're going like shopping you can use it as like a shopper if you're going for a huge one which I'm pretty sure I did order actually I did order a huge one and it's not here but I like this size because it's a really good in-between size and I thought this would be great for housing all my things so yeah got that as well I am ready for summer oh how cute with this outfit baby you've got the jumpsuit the bag and the spotty shoes I love that I'm sure going to dress with those so yes there are a lot of things in here that I'm really chuffed with a few that I will probably send back as you may have seen that is my little kind of in-between sprit winter and spring pull I really hope you liked it I'm gonna take this off now because I'm boiling hot I'm filming in my conservatory again today and I said to Alfea before I started filming I was like I feel like I need sunglasses filming this I've probably been like this a whole video like for one of my next videos I really want to do a Q&amp;A because I haven't done one of those in so long and I absolutely love sitting down and like getting to answer loads of your questions and feeling like I'm interacting on a slightly more personal level so if you have any questions at all that you would love me to answer please leave them in the comments of this video or go over to my most recent Instagram and leave your questions there for me I would absolutely love to select

 (Acura)   There is a kind of 80's style today   Hi, everybody   Today I want to ....Hey!   I want to introduce... Don't call it   I want to introduce some stationery   I made a video of this kind last year   The result was very successful   Because I believe   I'm not the only one like   An interesting stationery haul people   Many of you like it very much   So naturally I bought some more stationery   Because I rearranged my office   Incidentally, if you want to visit my office   Although not yet finished   I still want to share   If you want me to take a tour of the office,   Give this video a praise to let me know   Once I'm finished, I will make that video for you   Because I rearranged my office, I had a new desk   There are some new gadgets   I want to .... here are some dust drifting   I don’t know if you guys see it   But I do   I need to buy something new   Come to my office   Some things I find very exciting   Some are not too strange, a bit boring   But I will still introduce it to you   My first place to buy is Paperchase   A fantastic stationery shop   Paperchase has everything you need   The first boring thing came   A document storage box!   I'm going to say something... I look like I've got a stereo   Hmmm... it doesn’t play music   But I think this is very practical   You can have a database of bank information   One pet   Like Nala, like a pet's insurance   Place a home bill   Or you can categorize, electricity bills, water bills   This is really boring!   But this is what adults want to do. I really hope that I can learn how to manage adult affairs at school.   Because this is the most annoying thing to do   But if beautiful stationery can make you tolerate a little more   So I think you should be more tolerant   I have a bunch of files, so I think this is very practical   Because it puts them all in one place   I can't buckle it   It has a small handle, so if you want to bring it to other places   I also bought these, they are similar in style, they are lovely little   Like a small drop   I also bought two of this, with a zipper on top   I think they are very practical, for some projects that I am doing   I have notes and some piecemeal papers all around me.   So I think they are very convenient   So I bought two   I also bought a button   This is a bit like a mini version   It is divided into several compartments   It is also very convenient for some plans   I always have many, many different plans in progress   I can't reveal most of the news until it is closer to the time   I'm sorry I can't say it, it sounds annoying, but believe me, it's annoying to me   I also bought another simple button   This is a convenient receipt   In this way, you can give your receipt to your accountant   These are actually things that I use to accommodate my "adult affairs."   But if you can make them look pretty, it will be more fun to do   The next thing I bought from Paperchase   It's these clips and thumbtacks   They are all copper-colored   I have a big note board   It's metal, it's basically a metal grid I think   When I bought it, I attached some clips   But it doesn't have...OMG, it's impossible!   This is the cutest thing I have ever seen~   They are packed in small bottles   I still want to be so heavy   God! You see   Okay~ I love them more   Anyway, these clips are very convenient, you can clip photos   Don't call it!   These clips are practical and can be used on my clipboard   The copper paperclip, everyone needs a paperclip in the office   I don't know if I have bulletin boards to use these pins   But I should buy one, because I think every office needs to put one   It's almost like this, they are in glass jars to make them more adorable. I didn't know it before.   This is Paperchase   I bought them and Alfie laughed at me and I wouldn’t use them   He may be right, but I don’t want him to be   I may use them just to prove that he is wrong   But they are really too. Yes. Love! 36 colored pencils   This is the smallest pencil I've ever seen in my life.   They look like the fairy is using   I think this is why I like them (laughs)   Look at them! They are small   I will use them, and their tiny pencil sharpeners   Because they are so cute   I also bought some thank you cards   I think the thank you card is very important, but I'm the kind of annoying person who forgot to write a thank you card.   Because of this era, you can leave a word   Either tweet or send newsletters to others   But writing cards, sending cards, or even receiving a thank you card has a special charm.   So I bought a bag for myself and Alfie They are so cute   They are the shape of love   But they are a little geometric in style and there are envelopes   There is also a pretty pattern on the back   Above is thanks card   I also bought these very thin label stickers   Can be used on various plans, I think they are super practical at school and university   In this way, you will not forget which page you see, you can also write some notes on it   With a variety of different colors, I do not know   I just think they're great. It's also a way to record what you're doing.   Uh, it's very practical   Beautiful color   Once again, Alfie thinks I don’t need them and I tell him “believe me, I must have them in my office”   I can't live without them, they are so cute   I must have them   A little eraser I want to erase rubbers in other countries   But here we call them rubbers. I guess other places call them erasers.   But we call them rubbers   This is my 3 rubbers   I have a French fries, a small biscuit, and a little popsicle (it's not delicious)   Paperchase made a variety of lifeless things eraser   If you need to go to the store   I tried to persuade Alfie to buy a dinosaur's eraser. I said "You need one in your office."   He said "No, I don't use it." I said, "You need to, you want to buy a dinosaur eraser because it's cute."   But my eraser is cute and lovely.   So I didn't buy dinosaurs   Sticky notes, another thing I think you will never be too many   My hair pierced my eyes   I bought these because I like them very much   I think they are cute, this is written above   "Get him" and then have the date and time   There are tick boxes, options are "immediately" "anytime" "before today" "last time"   "Before this week" or "Delegate to others" There is also a small line to write "Or you're fired."   I feel bad and laugh   This writes "thank you"   (Option) "Give (Who)" "(Who) Gives" "Thank you so much" "Eternally grateful" "Too polite" "Helpful" "Let me be happy" "My Hero"   "About" Then there is a small "Thank you so much"   The last one says "Please" (optional) "Call me" "Complete" "Shut up" "Like me" "Go away" "Send me e-mail" "Soon" "As soon as possible" "Before today"   "Always" There are two options   "I should not request" and "thank you"   A great alternative to ordinary sticky notes   Also with a little humor   Next down is "Anthropology" They have some very cute stationery   If you are a stationery lover, you should go to the store to see it because I promise you will find it   What you want to buy, or something you must stop yourself from buying   The first thing I bought was this to-do list   I think it is very beautiful and practical   I usually record my to-do list on my mobile phone, or I write it on my notes   Or write it on any blank piece of paper, but this is more organized and looks beautiful   The above written "A good thing is a van Gogh made up of a series of small things."   I think this is a good way to set realistic goals for yourself   Then you can tick to indicate completion   I think I'm the kind of person who often buys things to improve productivity.   It also makes me more organized   But I'm not sure if it's totally useful   But I want to try it, and if my organizational ability disappears, I have at least a series of things that make me dependent   Another thing I bought at Anthropology is this   I think it's a bit like a sticky note, but it's not   It's called "love notes". You can write to whom, time and what you want to leave   Then stay in all parts of the house   I think it's cute, it may inspire me to leave some cute romantic notes   For Alfie   Or something like "Please take the dishes out of the dishwasher." "Please put your pants on the ground."   "Please..." Actually he will not do this   I know he will watch this video and say "I won't do this"   Well, "Please don't steal my socks again" This is something he will do   I think this is a small encouragement to inspire me to be more romantic   PS Alfie If you see this at home, you can also leave me a note   I bought more pencils~ I love pencils now   This is a bit sad for me because I have to sharpen them myself   let it go   They are super cute and they have the name of the food you often eat together   Or drink, let me turn this to the front   "Bacon and Eggs" "Ham and Cheese" "Gin Wine and Traning Water" "Fried Potato and Cabbage"   "Fish and chips" "Gut sausage and mashed potatoes"   How cute are they?   I also bought these pens, also bought at Anthropology   They are "iconic 2 way deco pens" There are five colors, they have a little rainbow feeling   They look very interesting. There is a fluorescent pen, and the other is pointed.   I like my pen so I decided to add some to my growing but not used search   I think this is a bit of a stationery, a bit random   From Anthropology, they are called "calm - 'cards for serenity'"   I think this is good in the office   Just in case I feel very stressed   May be on my desk or on my bedside   They are some small cards to keep you calm   It reads, "We are all crazy. We should ask one of our standard questions when we start our dinner appointment: In what particular areas are you crazy?"   It's so cute~   "We have never forgotten the value of calm, but lost calm is a constant risk   Every day brings us new temptations that tempted us to lose our temper   Like the behavior of partners, colleagues, children and computers   The things that distract us, fears and fears make us feel anxious and uneasy   This packet of cards consists of a series of beautiful and moving reminders   Remind us how to deal with our depressed emotions   It is precisely when we need it most, with great power   Inspire our best calm side"   If one day I feel particularly annoying   I can take out a sheet quickly, read it, and hope it calms me down   I think you can also quietly put one on someone's desk   Or on someone’s pillow, I don’t know   You also know that I want the personality of something I don’t need   The last thing was also obtained at Anthropology.   But this is a gift from two great managers in the Anthropology shop at Bluewater Shopping Center.   They are very nice. I chat with them. Then they send me a small bag.   There are many gifts inside   Some of you may have seen it in my home movie.   I described the situation at the time because some of the gifts in the bags were home furnishings.   Look at this cute   Write "ideas and theory" above it with a zipper next to it   I find it very interesting   It's actually a blank book, no lines, nothing   It's all white, I think I shouldn't have this kind of thing   I always buy wired   I really like it, I love the color   It is a very beautiful mint green   Thank you, they are very nice people.   It's a lovely gift, I can't wait to put it in my office   Love it~ It's all in my big bag to share with you   I hope you enjoy this video and give it a thumbs up!   By the way, this pullover is so cute with a cat on it   Thank you for watching my video, I hope you have a good week   I love you, we will meet again soon   Bye~

 Shall we close the window?   Let's close it   otherwise we can hear the traffic   What?   Nala?   would you mind?   oh my god i thought she was going to do something !!   I really thought she should peel there   I think she tries to sit down   Hi every one!   Today I sit with one of my favorite people in the world   Mark Ferris   I got an idea for a video because I saw it here on ASOS   It's a double sweater   So I thought it could be fun that we both wore us the sweater   And try to make Christmas things   Yup.   It was reasonably impulsive   we saw it and thinking "oh my good thinking of the video"   and then we bought it   so I am very excited   However, we have discovered that the person on the page with the art list   are allowed to use their right arm   The person on the other side   I buried! (Laughs)   The person on the other hand has to use his left arm   So we hit the plate or crown about it   I'm good at throwing   Ok, what side do you want?   plat   neeeeej   jaaaaa   but it is flat on both sides   is that a joke?   Yes   oh   It actually fits my arm!   Does it look like I'm born?   Yes!   This is a nightmare, does not it?   High five   open mouth   such a way back   so come on   clear? Yes   done?   We did it really well!   First thing we must do, Mark   is a honey cake house   fantastic   Let's open it first   It smells good   Okay, that's what it's gonna look like   Poor little man   It's a tree   Oh my teeth   See you   Oh my god, see me   Well ... fine   Are you going to make that sound?   It's just my concentration's sound   See!   Nice work   You are better with your left hand than with your right   I know   I can not do it - I'm too weak   See what you've done about my masterpiece   It's snow   Okay   A hand   They call me En-hand-Kevin   Really? Why Kevin?   I do not know   Oh no, how should I do that?   Okay, I'm using my child   Hold it there   Do you mind breathing on it?   NOOOOOOO   Field!   Oh no   What are you crying for?   I can not move   There you are   * Gasps *   Love it   Okay   Next part   This is really difficult   What part?   okay I push it   You push your way, then I push my   Okay   It is impossible   Clear?   * Gasps *   * Laughs *   Neeeeej   Zoe!   I can not do anything   It shakes   Use your teeth   Oh   Release it   what?   Release it   Wait   Is it on?   Jaaaaa   Now you just have to use the big hole   Okay, now you put glaze in all the holes   yeah   Mark, there is no glue on it so it can not hold   Want something?   Neeej   Off my hand   I think we've lost here, Mark   Yes, I think so too   Okay, for our next challenge   should we pack a gift   Celebrations   Celebrate good time, come on   I do not know what's smart   Okay, I'll keep it here   Just a little tighter   Okay that   I hold you sticking   We are a good team   Okay   Wow, you're good at it   oh, would you like it to be good?   See us   I know   Why did we think it would be wrong?   I do not know   We have no faith in ourselves   I knew this would be easier   This way, and then you turn   and then cross the center   like this   now it's going up   up   until 12 o'clock   12 noon   jaaa   and then you turn it over   oh no   oh no mark!   turn it over   cross over   Yes   Get it tighter   Turn   In to the middle   Push it   oh no wait!   We have it we have it!   let's try again   Again!   Okay now   I hold it   We have to tie a loop   I think I'll be under here   oh my god i'm so quiet   HIV tighter   Make a loop   HIV tighter, HIV tighter!   Okay mark   Now we must tighten them and collect our loops   We can   Okay, I have your loop   it draws you through the middle   Through there   Oh my God   tight   We did it!   Is not that nice?   Now we have to cut the ends   We just have to take care   done   I think we did really well   Yes, how quiet was I?   Almost as quiet as when you're hungry   when you enjoy your food   Yes, when I'm still eating   Success !!   Okay, are you ready to skip?   I think something is just broken   ooh, where are they from here?   We are wearing some embellishments   Oh my god, we die   I think we should move a little further   Something broke!   Was it you?   I do not know   3, 2, 1   Jaa   We did it!   We did it!   Come on, we're fine   3, 2, 1   It's okay, nothing broke down   but maybe we should just move them here   I've lost my end   Jaa   ohhh   Sorry, I slipped!   What happened?   I slipped   Off my foot   are you okay?   Yes   3, 2, 1   Yes   Oh my God   We did it   What happened?   What clicked?   Maybe we should stop before it ends up wrong   We did it!   Yes   This is a scarecrow challenge   It would be the perfect sweater if you would like to be sure you do not lose your friend   Yes!   We are done   How good do you think we were?   I think we are very good at packing the gift   Yes   And shipping - we had it at last   We found out after some attempts   It was the ugliest   We hope you all enjoyed the video   I want to put a link to where you can find the sweater.   If you want to toture yourself half past Christmas   or even want to try this challenge   It's funny! I would recommend it.   Give the video a tumbs up if you liked it   And remember to check Mark's channel   I will link it in the description box   We love you very much and see you very soon!   FARVEEEEL!  
[Music] hello everybody welcome back to my kitchen I know you love when I do baking I know you love it even more when I do quick and easy treats so today I'm going to show you how I created five very quick very easy things that you can do if you're having a Christmas party or you're having your friends round or you can pick and choose a couple of your favorites to treat yourself on a cold miserable winter's day so let's get started the first treat I'm going to be chatting you through are some chocolate orange cookies now I am using my lovely friend Tanya bear's recipe but instead of dime bars I am adding tiny little Terry's chocolate orange segments which are full of pin delicious first thing you're going to want to do is put 200 grams of unsalted butter at room temperature in a bowl next thing you want to add is 300 grams of caster sugar sounds like a lot is a lot obviously eat these in moderation and then using my trusty hand whisk I'm going to cream this together until it's really soft and fluffy next you need to crack in one medium sized egg and beat that in if you don't have a hand whisk ask for one for Christmas because it honestly is just the best thing now it's time to add in all your dry ingredients so we have 275 grams of self-raising flour and 75 grams of cocoa powder and then you also want to add a little bit of milk just until you feel like the consistency isn't as dry back to with now all your ingredients are combined and you have cookie dough it's time to add your chocolate I like to use milky bars I feel like if you're not the biggest fan of white chocolate it really doesn't matter in these because it just works generally I don't really eat white chocolate on its own but in these cookies it's amazing and then I'm going to add a little bit of Dairy Milk and then my little segment of Terry's chocolate orange this is essentially like a less four in a bowl these cookies are not for the faint-hearted okay it's all I'm saying once you combine everything together on your baking trays lined with some baking sheet you just want to grab a big old handful now I actually do put a lot into one cookie I'm not too sure if Tom was watching this she might say I make them too big but I quite like them like this and just going to shove a little orange segment in the top of that one all that's gonna be good in once you've got them all lined out on your baking tray depending on the size that you want to go for I've gone for quite big so I've got seven out of that but if you want to go smaller you'll get a couple more you want to pop them in a preheated oven at 200 degrees Celsius for ten to eleven minutes one thing that will confuse you a lot is that they won't look baked take them out it's absolutely fine and then leave them to set on the side the third two minutes before tucking into them the second treat are very easy very straightforward gingerbread truffles now I absolutely love gingerbread all year round but I feel like this video would not be a Christmas treats video if I didn't have some gingerbread in it first thing you are going to want to do is get an entire pack of ginger nut biscuits and using a blender or a processor or something that's going to crush these into very very fine breadcrumbs you're going to watch pop those all in this looks like it's sponsored by neutral color it isn't now that you have a bowl full of very fine gingerbread crumbs you need to get yourself some cream cheese and using a spoon you simply want to spoon in a generous dollop you want to mix this together until you reach the perfect consistency so you want it so that as you roll it it just forms a ball you don't want to make it too wet with the cream cheese so you have to be quite careful with this bit this is really messy and very sticky tastes delicious though you now want to bring together the mixture and make small balls like so and pop them down on a tray with a baking sheet feel free to make these any size you want by the way I like them kind of generously mouth sized so that you could pop the whole thing if you wanted to if you were feeling daring or you can bite it in half and then you've got more in one now you want to pop these in the freezer for 30 minutes just that they go hard now that your little cheesecake balls have hardened in the freezer it is time to dip them in melted white chocolate which I have just melted this isn't just something you can buy unfortunately we would all of that so using a cocktail stick you want to stick it into your ball as far as you can go but don't go too far because then it will come out the other end and you simply want to twist it in the chocolate making sure to coat every little bit once you've coated just tap it on the side of the bowl and gently spin it just to get off any excess chocolate and then place it down on the paper and you have to decorate it now because they've been frozen the chocolate sets quite quickly so I'm using some chocolate sprinkles and popping those on top so don't four of them with the chocolate sprinkles but the other remaining four I'm going to do slightly differently so I'm going to do what I did before and coat them in the chocolate and we're just going to leave them there now with the last four I am just going to use a squeezy tube of chocolate icing and I'm going to do some decorate it's like something from Thornton's and there you go that is your completed gingerbread cheesecake truffles these next treats are Christmas tree brownies which I saw on Pinterest and I just had to give them a go because they looked amazing first thing you need to do is pre-heat your oven to 170 degrees Celsius and grease and line a brownie tin so I have that ready also I'm using a brownie mix for a box which I know some people won't want to do and that's fine if you can find a recipe or you can make really kick-ass brownies then you can use your own but because I wanted to make this quite quick and easy and actually the fun is in the decorating I'm using trusty Betty Crocker today so you want to do the really hard task of emptying the bag into a bowl be careful this could go very wrong this is very now open the bag and it goes that we won't actually go through next thing you want to do is add three tablespoons of vegetable oil five tablespoons of water and one medium egg and then all that's left for you to do is mix that together then you literally want to pour this into your baking tin this then needs to go into the oven or 20 to 25 minutes once your brownie has completely cooled down oops you want to take out of your tin and peel it off if you want to cut your brownie into Christmas tree shaped triangles once you have cut out your triangles from your brownie it is time to make some very green Christmas tree icing then you can of course make this from scratch if you want to but because we're trying to do this really quick and easy and I've got all my guests arriving very soon I'm going to use some more Betty Crocker vanilla icing and no this video is not sponsored by Betty Crocker so I'm going to spin that into a bowl I'm then going to add some americolor electric green you can get green food coloring it's probably better to use a gel I really like these I got these on eBay just because I feel like the American colors are really actually very vibrant and that's exactly what we want and then using our trusty food bag we're going to spoon the icing in twist it for your mixture type bag and then snip off the corner now you can snip off quite a big bit if you want your Christmas tree swells to be quite wide and take up quite of the brownie or you can trim off a really tiny bit I'm going to go for a tiny bit on these ones and then you just want to start at the top and work your way down to the bottom so now you've done your little Christmas tree Wiggles it's time to decorate so I have these some gold and silver and white stars I'm going to sprinkle some of these on now this bit is quite fiddly you want some stalks for your Christmas trees so we're going to break some mini candy canes where they Bend because we don't need the best bit and we're going to stick it up the bottom of the Christmas tree and there we go your Christmas tree brownies for this next treat I'm going to show you how to make chocolate Rice Krispies Christmas puddings these are so cute the first thing you're gonna need to do is put 50 grams of unsalted butter into a saucepan and melt on lower heat you need to add 180 grams of marshmallows and continue to stir until the marshmallows have fully melted once the marshmallows have fully melted take them off the heat and add 100 grams of rice krispies and mix together leave that to the side and then in a bowl over boiling water you need to melt 200 grams of milk chocolate once you have your rice krispies and marshmallows and your motr chocolate you want to combine the two together all you want to do is simply roll them up into little balls and pop them on a lined baking tin now you just need to pop this in the fridge to chill for 10 minutes now that your rice krispies balls have cooled down in the fridge all you need is a freezer bag and some melted white chocolate and you just want to pull that down into the corner unless you have a lot of piping bags available but this is kind of a quick hack fold over the bag and just twist it as you would with a piping bag and then what you're going to want to do is just cut a very teeny piece of the corner of the bag and then because we want to make these look like little Christmas puddings you just want to do a little dollop of white chocolate on the top and don't worry it does run down the sides but that's what you want it to be so it doesn't need to be neat and the chocolate does set quite quickly for pieces of Holly I'm just using little tiny green tree sprinkles and I'm just going to stick two in side-by-side then for the red berries I'm going to use these tiny little red balls that are part of this very festive little pack of sprinkles and I'm going to pop two of those on her Christmas pudding that are for there you go those are your little mini Christmas pudding rice krispies balls you just want to leave these on the sides of the white chocolate can set or you can pop them back in the fridge and for the last treat we are doing some pretzel wreaths which is just a really fun very quick and very easy way to make pretzels a little bit more delicious first thing you're going to want to do is melt some white chocolate or if you prefer you can use milk chocolate or dark chocolate get yourself some salted pretzels and starting on the curly end you want to dip this in your white chocolate only halfway and you want to make this really cute little star effect then going back in with more pretzels but they time with the pointed end dip that halfway into the chocolate and pop that in between two of the pretzels that is your pretzel risk the only thing I'm going to do is to put a little bit of white chocolate just around it just to make sure it's cementing the pretzels together now you have your melted white chocolate that has formed your pretzel wreath you can decorate it however you like I have quite the selection of festive sprinkles that I'm going to go to town yes some of these on cute so there you go that is how you make pretzel wreaths you can then tie a little bit of string in them if you want to hang them like an actual wreath or you just eat them so I'm going to pop these in the fridge now to set and then I will get them out later to display for my fake party that I'm not really having even though it looks like I am and I probably should because I'm never going to eat all this myself so there we go this is my table of Christmas treats I am so happy with every single thing I have made today I feel like there's something for everybody but of course very chocolatey very sweet so make sure you're making these with in moderation so I really hope you guys enjoyed this video make sure if you create any of these to tag me on Twitter and Instagram so I can see them and let me know what you think give the video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and I will see you again tomorrow bye 
 Hello everybody   Today I want to try some different topics   Some topics I like to listen to   Is the way people press   Or shut down to enjoy your own private time   You all know that I have a few tips to encourage everyone to have a break   Or private time to charge yourself   This is why I took this video. Share my method   I have so many ways to suppress that I have been particularly busy all month   Or I found life too much and I believe everyone has experienced it   And I think a lot of time   Everyone has enough time to charge   I think when you are under extreme pressure   It is very important to learn how to apply pressure   And you must know how   Can calm you down and make you clearer   This is what I need to talk about charging time.   I divided my pressing method into three parts   The first is the environment   I don't know if you have heard this sentence   "The rooms are organized and the same"   I believed this sentence after I arrived at my own house   Now if things are not in their place   I think the Drainage Council has always influenced me in different ways   If everything around me is neat   I think everything becomes easier   What I mean is that you spend all your private time to organize your room   Because there are many people who really talk about it, it will be more stressful.   But sometimes I think the juice room can be pressed   But you have to be upset   What I want to talk about is if you have a clean and neat environment   Will make you think that life is more planned   All things must go where they belong   Every corner should be clean and change the sheets have the same effect   Every time I buy a new sheet I feel so happy   The new sheets that have been replaced after the fall are one of the most positive feelings   Instantly washing the sheets once a week and ironing them with an iron is a good choice   Because I’m the one I love the most.   And it will take you a lot of time   But the new sheets will have a good feeling   When it comes to new sheets I like to change sheets daily   I am currently using the fall series of sheets   I all like to buy a pillow like a cute home pattern   It makes me feel happy and relaxed   Very satisfied with the present life   candle   The candle is one of the most essential home comfort items for me   If I’m under stress today or I’m particularly nervous this week   I doubt that I will candle when I'm dark   Each room has   Candles can create a calm and comfortable atmosphere   Everyone loves the feeling of comfort   plant   The most common method   Or the most common   I don't think you need horticulture technology   Drainage Department of the microphone to speak? Gardener's horticulture   Gardening thumb is like   You don't need gardening... hands and feet   Take care of your plants   You may feel that plants will be killed by you   But it is like a stone lotus, cactus   Both are easy to care for plants   And I think that there are plants in the housing estate that are both wrong   I know there are a lot of people who have ties to grow plants   They are green, beautiful and full of vitality.   I love the feeling of plants in the house   Although each family may have a   But when you're living, you have a good time.   Another kind of candle can comfort me next to the wild   It is decorated with lamps and lanterns   Hanging on a lamp requires artistic talent   I can't live without these little lights   I’m super-inclined to light up early   Whether it is evening summer or winter   I like small lighting   The most positive is the small candles lighting   Forget about the existence of the lighting tube   The light is warm with soft light   And it's good   Draining me to pick up Christmas   And Christmas is the best holiday so   Lights remind me of Christmas   The second part is the ego and shutdown   I think this is something more difficult for most people to do   Because of the convenience of the phone, we are more difficult to shut down   You hold the phone all the time   Especially for me   Because of the work I did   I am surrounded by social media, emails and other electronic information   Shutdown is a bit difficult for me   I think you need to be passionate to do it.   But what matters with the phone and the computer?   Or other electronic products with wifi   Because I work for YouTube or other career   Sometimes someone asks me   "Hey, what do you do when you rest? What are your interests?"   But when it comes to filming, I am interested in both   So for some time I think   In the end I like to do it.   In addition to the left film clip design products with the book   I'm all good   My interest is in   So for me if I’m particularly nervous today   Or feel a bit anxious   I need private time. I need to turn off the 3c product line. Most things I will do   go for a walk   I think the most important thing   It's helpful to do some easy exercise when you're anxious   Promenade is a good thing   I live in a country with a seaside   So going to the beach is my favorite thing to do   Whether it is windy two sunny days or cold weather   Everything can completely stop me   Warm sweater   Sometimes take Nala together for a walk   I think at the beach is a very pressing matter   I like the sound of waves and I like the sound of seagulls   But when I don’t live on the beach, I’ll first pick the sound of the seagull   If the cries of the canal are the cause of my pressure   I really think when you stand on the sea and look at the sea   I think everything is going wrong   It's like you are immune to stress   Sometimes I can go to the beach   I will have a phone sound   If you can walk around the beach   Go to the country   Or go for a walk where you've never been to an unplaced place   I think that exploring the new environment is a good thing   It’s like people are talking more than a brain is awake   Breathing fresh air is better than brain waking   I know that shutting down is strictly speaking   But some apps don’t need a network   It's easy to use these apps   Like meditation that precipitates the mind or other relaxation   I like bedtime   Then listen to the precipitated apps   Sometimes I hear or train in the night   Even if it's a busy day, take 5 minutes to listen   Wear headphones and concentrate   I think it's good and effective and helpful   If I often do this, I think the better   I recommend a friend's approach   These apps have Relax Melodies   It's helpful to have an insomnia with your apps   Or you want to hear the sound of the waves   Basically, there are different music that can be calm   Headspace is easy to use   Music based on an app is good for meditation   Let the mind settle especially for your busy day   You can take a break for 5-10 minutes   Another one I have is Relax   This is a 28-30 minute blow app   When I feel particularly nervous   I will listen for half an hour   I remember every word   It's better than listening to you   I will not worry about doing it without worrying   But I often listen to this app   It’s like you can be self-affirming and you can squeeze your apps   This is the method I recommend than everyone   Because I found it really calm   make a list   I know not everyone has a plan   I all talk to myself as a person   But if I'm tired   Or have a nervous week   I found that I wrote down my heart   I feel relieved   So I like to list   I feel a little planning   Even if I don’t walk or break with the plan   It's always better to write down all the wild   I like to do it before going to bed   I just think that the list is really a good way to calm down   So if I have a lot of pressure this week   With you, I guarantee that there will be a lot of inventory   This relieving method is very common   But the script is really a good way to suppress   You can get a lot from books and stories   And I have always loved books   I absolutely love the script   I will be very excited to see the new book   Or I see wonderful places   But I will   I have to stay tomorrow.   I think when I write a book I can escape from reality   I think it feels good when I’m particularly stressed   But the last thing is to feel good   This seems to be the most common   But if you are under pressure   You may not have good sleep quality   or   If you do not sleep enough   It can also be a source of stress   These two things are closely related   Sleep is just as important as charging your body and mind   What I love to do to ensure the quality of my sleep   Bath   I mean very common   But the bath will relax   Not when you get out of the bath and you are sweating hot   Bathing can be very easy   I have several products that I like very much   There are many products that can help you sleep well   I have tried a lot   And I like to light candles while bathing   I actually found spa music on youtube on the phone   Some are even 6 hours long   I do not recommend that you bathe for 6 hours   Because you will become raisins   However, they are suitable for listening when bathing   Because it actually makes you relax   It's like you're doing your own spa   Feeling good   Aromatherapy Associates has a nice relaxing oil   Next is a tea that calms you   There are many different kinds of tea you can drink before going to bed   These help you to get better   I have chamomile tea   Mint tea   Mint tea is probably my most frequent tea   But chamomile tea is best for drinking before going to bed   It is good to relax   And I feel like enjoying time for myself   Then sit down and enjoy this cup of tea   Because it is very relaxed   Nothing is wrong   So I think   Any kind of tea   Or drink in the evening   Perfect for the end of the day   I have some sleep aid spray   I still have sleep aid balls   Can be rubbed   This is called   Point?   I mean I'm fine   I know that there is scientific basis   But psychologically   I think after spraying sleep aids on the pillow   I really get better   So sleep aid spray is worth everyone to try   I listened to the first 20 minutes   You should not touch technology products   TV   Or anything that can affect your mood   You can brewing your mind first   20 minutes before bedtime   Do something you can do before going to bed   Match tomorrow to wear shirts   Put on pajamas   Or drink your own tea   Or book   As long as it is not affecting my mood   This is a good choice   If you have a good day   You put on pajamas   Brush your teeth with 3 seconds and jump into bed   Only hand to play with the phone  睇 睇 twitter   Revisit Instagram   You will always have a good look   Take 20 to 30 minutes to completely calm down   No interference with technology products   Turn off the phone   But now nobody has shut down   Silence away from the channel   Put on the other side of the room to charge   You don’t need a mobile phone during this time   Sometimes I think if I have poor sleep quality   And my phone is next to   I will turn to call   Only the next few points   Then drop Twitter   Iga then Instagram   Then 2 hours passed   And now I'm sober   You need more than yourself   The best quality of sleep in your ability   You have to be stricter with yourself   Stay away from your phone   I really think   You can do the best thing   Although there are difficulties in implementation   But when you play early,   Have increased a little sense of expectation   Because you have been watching your department's phone message   So try it   Than I know how your results are   Stay away from the phone before you feel it   I dare to promise you   You will get better   I really hope you guys will like this video   If you haven’t heard of these tips and methods   You are welcome to try it   If you tried than I know   At the same time, leave a message and tell me that you will do something to suppress   If you like this video please click Like   If you like, don't forget to press subscription   I hope you have a happy day   I will see you soon   Goodbye

 Hello everyone, the video of today   is about festive drinks.   I'm going to three of you   very fast, easy   show drinks before Christmas,   and I love them, all three.   The first drink is cranberry ginger bubbles,   so you need Ginger Ale, of course.   You do not have to take a diet version,   but I have chosen that myself.   A few cranberries.   A little coin.   Glasses of your choice,   I have these from Kilner,   because I think they look very nice.   And of course, cranberry juice.   And some ice.   Grab a few ice cubes   and put them in your glasses.   Then you pour some cranberry juice   over your ice.   And next   give you some Ginger Ale with that.   Then you add some cranberries   with every glass.   This is especially for decoration.   Then a few sprigs of mint.   And then you can put some festive straws in it.   And then you have your cranberry ginger bubbles.   In my opinion, this drink is perfect for when a few friends come in the evening   and you do not want something solid or warm, but   something that just looks nice   and also gives a hint to Christmas by the cranberry and ginger.   Oh my god, it is so good!   It is also a very suitable alternative if you do not drink alcohol.   Like a nice fake cocktail.   The next drink that I'm going to show you   is a peppermint of white chocolate.   I really love hot chocolate   that this video would not be complete without one.   Everything you need here   is milk and white chocolate   that you fuse and then add peppermint.   But, if you feel a bit too lazy for that,   you can always use white chocolate powder   where you can also simply put your peppermint in it.   Grab your favorite chocolate   and break it   in a heat-resistant bowl.   Turn on your stove,   and pour your milk into your pan.   Heat the milk at a medium temperature   and you want to do that until you start to simmer milk.   When it comes to simmering, take it away from your fire,   and then pour it   over your white chocolate.   And then you beat it together with the chocolate,   so the chocolate will melt in the milk.   Now you need pepper extract   And then you add half a teaspoon.   But that depends entirely on how spicy you want your chocolate milk.   Let that stir.   It smells good!   With a serving spoon   I'm going to give this in my glass of choice.   Feels like I'm banging punch.   All you love your hot chocolate,   Then of course that is good,   but I think we can go a step further,   and whip up some whipped cream to top it off   On every glass a dollop of whipped cream ...   ... or maybe two.   And now it's time for decoration.   I'm going   these little candy sticks   on the side hooks.   Since it is ultimately a peppermint white chocolate milk.   And then I plan for some chocolate on top.   See you.   And there he is, your peppermint white chocolate   As a last drink   a cranberry pineapple punch,   what I find an excellent alternative to mulled wine.   It is warm,   you make it in a saucepan,   and there is no alcohol in it   but still tastes delicious.   Okay, you need 500 ml, so half a pack   pour cranberry juice into a saucepan,   and also a quarter of pineapple juice.   Then add a quarter of a teaspoon of pimento,   a teaspoon of cinnamon,   a little clove,   some star anise,   and a few cinnamon sticks.   I'll also add a few slices of orange,   making sure I keep a few about it,   for decoration.   -Omg, this is the strangest orange I've ever seen ...   It's a double orange!   I'm going to add two orange slices.   And stirring that a bit.   And then we bring it to the stove.   On low heat,   do you want it to simmer for 5 to 10 minutes.   But make sure it does not burn or boil.   When that is done, you have to be very careful,   and pouring everything through a sieve into a can,   to be able to serve it.   And you pour it through a sieve,   so you do not like things like clove,   and other great things,   get in your drink.   But I would keep the cinnamon sticks,   to decorate your drink.   Now you simply want to pour your drink into your cups   Put your cinnamon sticks in it.   Now I'm going to cut a piece of orange,   this by middle ...   ... and again through the middle.   And then you put your parts   in   the punch!   This is delicious!   This is basically Christmas in a copper mug.   So there, you have my three, quick, easy, festive drinks!   Hopefully there is something for everyone,   Let me know if you make any of this   Tweet me, or tag me on Instagram.   Give the video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it,   I will see you tomorrow!   Bye!!!  
so like I'm channeling my inner Bob from stranger things today is it the glasses I think it's the glasses was it the jump hmm I don't know also I wanted to wear these because I really like them and I think they're a great accessory to my outfit but how do you guys film with glasses like if you wear glasses how do you film videos because right now I just have two lights in my in my peripherals maybe they just do this oh I think I might have to scrap the glasses hello everybody today I am going to be doing a homework hall which I think are some of my favorite videos to a watch MV film it's Halloween and autumn and all things amazing and this means that the shops start getting quite festive I mean I like buying things my home January to August but I just feel like from September onwards the stuff you can buy for your home is just way better especially because I like to decorate and I quite like seasonal themes there is certainly a lot more to get around this time of year if you're going to be seasonal so over the last couple of weeks I have accumulated a fair amount of Halloween and autumn seemed goodness so I thought I would share them with you in this video I don't even know where to start maybe I should start like all to me let's do that I got this cushion actually and I even kept the tag on it so that I could show you it so after this video I'm going to rip the tag off but I got this and this is from Asda now Asda are great with seasonal home where I just feel like some shops get into the spirit of it and some don't and as there are a shop that do so they're like all to me homework is just the cutest this bedding is from um as this is from Asda the two throws I am sat on are from Asda there's just a lot of Asda going on in my house right now and it's just so affordable this is 7 pounds and the bedding I think was like 14 pounds which is so good and considering you'll probably only use it around this time of year unless like you like autumn themed bedding all year round which I don't see why not then it's like just it just works it's just a good amount of money to spend I also picked up this which is some more bedding this is the toadstools bedding and it is just so freakin cute I love it this was also 14 pounds and that's a king-size so I should imagine duvet duvet I should imagine duvet I should imagine the double and the sink or a lot cheaper I also have this throw this is one that I haven't untied yet because I wanted to show you but this goes with this bedding oh look so you've got the bedding and this is so autumnal it's like autumn patchwork it's amazing there's actually called woodshed patchwork and again that was 14 pounds I have to say like the quality of the material is not as nice it's a little bit like stiffer so if you're one of these people that can only really sleep in very soft sheets you won't like that but I'm not really too fast so I also got this throw which is like a quilted throw and that was 20 pounds I just have it all in this massive home sent back home scents Holi home scents there is so much stuff in home scents I if any of you don't know what HomeSense is it's essentially just the home section of TK Maxx and I know I've done videos where I've said that before but just for any of you that might be new or you've never seen any of my videos or you've never seen a homework haul that is what home senses and I just think it's one of my favorite shops around this time of year because they either have autumn themed things Halloween themed things or christmasing things in fact they have Christmas in there already and a half act of law all that Halloween in HomeSense this year was a whole other level and even the staff in there were like we have so much stuff this year like there was just shelves and shelves and shelves of all the coolest Halloween things you've ever seen I feel like here in the UK we don't do Halloween as big as some of you might in America whenever I see Halloween on American films TV shows documentaries I don't know American youtubers Halloween is such a huge thing and they go all out and it's the one time of year where I'm really jealous that I don't live in America HomeSense gets a lot of American brands in their stores so a lot of the things you can buy in home cents have been made in America which means that they're really like good the first thing I picked up with these hand towels yeah I know I'm like going all out in the house for Halloween this year so you've got one that's just black with orange spots and this one which is like a waffle texture if any of you are wondering if that's your ideal t-tell texture and that's just black and it says trick or treat I like them I also picked up these because they're so cute they had rails upon rails of different types of fake pumpkins I just thought I'm going to have real pumpkins in my house so I want something that's just purely decorative so I may as well get something slightly different so I picked up these two this one's kind of I guess this one's a little bit more Korean this one's white and they've just got glitter on them I honestly believe you could probably do this yourself to an actual pumpkin I was about to hit myself in the face of that if you painted it and I don't know got a bit DIY happy on a pumpkin you could make something like this but I wanted something that was going to last and like out next year as well so some pumpkins I feel like this is like Halloween chic it's like sophisticated Halloween which I mean from here on in is not that just an FYI basically if you're throwing a Halloween party which I encourage everybody to do just because it's fun why not they have just everything you would ever need to throw the best Halloween party like they even have table runners look so I've got this table runner which actually if you ask me is a bit pirate just like skull and crossbones but it's still a skull so it's Halloween I got these these are so cute these are paper love favor boxes now I have never heard of paper love I know Mary Mary which is a kind of like party stationery accessories brand I guess I'm not too sure what they would go under but I love Mary Mary stuff if any of you are throwing a party for any occasion check out Mary Mary paper love also looks really cool and they're just little tiny like treat boxes let me show you the look so you put sweets and treats in there and yeah I just it's really cute I don't know even if I don't use them this year I might use them next year ding I also picked up this which is essentially a box of wooden Halloween shapes when I was younger and my mom used to do house parties um all like festive parties that's where I get it from by the way she would always put things on the table like she would always put like sequins on the table or like star confetti at Christmas and I just used to remember thinking this looks really cool because it's like cute but it's so simple I don't know it just adds something to the table so I was like these are really cool granted they're a little bit bigger than like subtle table confetti but I just think they're called decorate anything with really and these were only $2.99 because I am planning to do a Halloween party this year just for like me and literally like three friends because why not um I went and got some like serving well at Halloween surfing where because why serve things in plain bowls when you can serve them in bowls with spiders as stands like this literally looks like something from Game of Thrones but how fun like popcorn crisps I just love it I just love it I'm gonna have to have like a box of Halloween themed things that I'm gonna have to like store away and don't next year because I'm not sure this will have the same effect in summer also for nibbles and Halloween treats I got this bowl which is silver and has little skulls on it I really like it I think it's cool and this was $12.99 speaking of Mary Mary yeah they have this in-home sense it's happy Halloween bunting I mean if you're throwing a party or you want a decade rout deco decorate your ring or you want to decorate your room you're gonna need some fun ting lads $3.99 can't go wrong and I really like it because it has like YouTube bats as well look speaking of bats some hanging back decorations something wicked again Mary Mary from home scents and these are 399 and it's eight hanging bat decorations have a lot fun with those I'm not sure if this is kind of on the crazy scale of you're taking this too far Zoey it's it's Halloween and yes a couple of decorations is cute but I picked up some hand towels and flannels in Halloween themed I I don't know they had them and I was like that's too cute not to have and also if we're having the party I can put these out and people can use them so $6.99 for this one and you get six and the hand towels which I have to say I like the softest things I've ever felt in my life oh it's by a brand called Casa FINA I heard of them before and these were $7.99 and yet too taking it back a notch to autumn they had so much of this amazing bakeware this year and this is by a brand called Nordic Ware made in the USA so I'm assuming this is a American brand and this is like a loaf tin but it has frickin pumpkins on it so when you do your bake it looks like that like how cool is that so I bought this one and I also bought a couple more with like smaller little pumpkin cake so you could do tiny little like pumpkin cupcakes and the quality of them is like really good this was $19.99 so it wasn't necessarily cheap but I'm really into my good quality bakeware and this seems like great quality and if you can't make a loaf which creates pumpkins on it then I mean is like worth really living to be honest also in home cents I picked up these which are drinking glasses with skeletons on them in this kind of like black sketchy print and these were $7.99 that's actually really good amazing so great for a party again I thought this is kind of key this was $5.99 and it is a little sign they had some really like out there cheesy like Halloweeny type things but I just really like this one this says ghosts and goblins spooks galore scary which is at your door jack-o'-lanterns shining bright wishing you a haunting night I love it I just think it's really cute I can't wait to have children so they can appreciate my Halloween efforts because right now it's just Alfie and Nala and I'm just not sure they really appreciate them that much also got some more bunting this is Mary Mary again and this is kind of like her do-it-yourself bunting so you've got all the letters to spell out happy Halloween and you've also got some like cardboard pumpkins witches spiders ghosts you've got the lot in here so that looks fabulous moving on to John Lewis who didn't have that much on their website but they did have a few things I really liked I liked the idea of having Halloween style baubles or just things you can hang from things so if you had like a little tree or I don't know something somewhere and you just wanted a tiny little like I like Halloween but I'm not gonna go that OTT you could get like a little hanging pumpkin which i think is the cutest thing I've ever seen he's glittery and smiling and he looks like he's lost teeth like he looks like a little like child pumpkin I like it and then also a sequin bat and I don't know I just really like those so I got a couple of each of those I don't know whether I'll put them on like a spooky little Halloween tree or something I haven't quite got that far and I also picked up these which are ginger a spooky spider paper straws because I mean why not going back to Asda but Halloween and Asda they have so many great crazy and slightly tacky Halloween decorations oh hello Nala you scared me so if you are looking for something a bit more on the cheap side and you want something to be like really out there go to Asda because they have so many things ok so what I mean by that is this will Alfie's choice um it's just a giant clown head and it does things like this Nalla hates it as you can imagine but yeah they have things like this which i think is that's the route you want to go down you should and then these are the bits I picked up so I got this little pack of skeletons which is a garland so it's like a little skeleton garland and that was literally two pounds I got these 10 LED grinning ghost lights how cute are they so you're just factory operated look ghost get these which are the same little battery-operated LED lights and they're tiny little pumpkins oh these are 5 pounds 5 pounds each Halloween is not Halloween especially if you're gonna throw a party without cobwebs my mom used to string these across our whole house when she did a Halloween party right there nala some look choke and they always just looked amazing so I got quite a few bags of these and I think this was like a pound more lights because I just think you need a lot of lights these were six pounds and oh how cute is this little sparkly pumpkin this was one pound and I did and then the last thing I picked up from Asda with these jelly spiders and fun fact the woman at the checkout who was serving me when I bought these she didn't want to touch the spiders she obviously had a fear of spiders that extended to even fake ones and so she asked me to pick them up and as I picked them up and so I had to like lean over her toe and like pick them up and pass them over she sucks scanned it with the scanner from like afar and I was like Oh bless her she must really hate this time of year give it a stir and they were a pound each I mean they do look pretty grim maybe it's like the way they move it is quite gross don't blame her right and I mean I'm not gonna lie I have four other things but I felt like these things were ones worth showing you that is going to be a video on this channel of all these things kind of being you used at our little Halloween party kind of like the picnic party that I did before so to see any of this in action in the house then subscribe thumbs up that should be coming

time I wash my hair so I'm going to keep those out something else that's generally stocked in space inkay and you can also get it on cult beauty and probably their own website but I don't normally I don't normally go on browsing websites isn't that weird I normally go to a site that sells multiple brands huh like does anyone buy they're like Rimmel makeup from the Rimmel website can you even do that so this is a Sunday Riley product and I believe this is fairly new this is the CEO C and E antioxidant protect and repair moisturizer and I actually bought the cleansing oil I want to say as well because I noticed that online and I thought it looked really good I haven't tried this one obviously because it's still in the box but I really like the sound of it so it says lusciously hydrating and scientifically advanced CEO is the smart for moisturizing guru for your thirsty skin whipped and luminizing CEO provides deep soothing but never greasy moisturization while it's technologically advanced formula expertly fights the five visible signs of environmental and microbe pollution induce skin damage federal I feel like I've just done like an exercise on my mouth I also received some of Kimberly Kardashian West contour kicks which I'm so excited to try I actually love this packaging so much it's like a little light okay it reminds me of um you know when you would get those little bags and you'd never know what was in there it reminds me of that but I obviously I haven't tried them yet but what have I got here I did have all four kits but I didn't need the dark ones so I've kept assuming I'd probably be light open light then you get this inside I feel like you've probably all seen this by now I feel like I'm a little bit late to the party I'm not gonna do a film review because there's so many great reviews of this but yeah how cool is that thank you so much Kim she's definitely watching this obviously excited to try those speaking of Kim I also literally got this

contour and highlights oh my god I love I love how she's displayed this like with the three and then the three brushes underneath I'm gonna get one out I want to see I love how like simple but effective her branding is Wow you actually get a lot of product on there those are like big so you've got like a slightly better contour color and then more of like a bronzy color a highlight and then kind of like a peachy highlight oh I love this and look at the size of the mirror that is amazing that you can actually do your highlight contour with the palette mirror normally I go to a different mirror to do that because the mirrors are generally quite small but that's actually fairly impressive I love this and then the brush for any of you that want to know is more of a dome on one side and then it has a slight angle on the other side so you can buff that and then highlight with that one that's just such a lovely surprise so again thanks Kim we also have a big old Marc Jacobs beauty package this seems to be a lot of big packages in this one lots of big cardboard packages I'm gonna love trying to recycle those oh my god guys there's couple of these things look look how cool some

hello everybody today I decided to do a makeup look now normally when I feel my makeups look I'll wait for my skin to look send me okay we all know I have problematic skin at the best of times but when I feel like I'm having a good skin day is usually the day I will decide to sit down and do a makeup video so when I looked in the mirror this morning and realize that today was not my lucky day and my skin had blessed me with its lovely problematic ways I didn't want to film the video and then I had a little sit-down with myself and I thought no I am going to film the video because a so many people have problematic skin whether that is acne or a reaction or hormonal breakout there are so many people across the world who will be watching this who will be having similar issues to me and I don't generally get very self-conscious about my skin because I'm aware that lots of other people have skin issues too but I felt particularly self-conscious today and I wasn't going to do it and then I thought I am going to do it because this is what I would do in order to cover up my skin today but this is me doing my makeup on a problematic skin day so this is the look I have done today irie hope you guys enjoy the video so the first thing I am going to do in my big fat bug burger truck my big bag of tricks is put on a little bit of the Elizabeth Arden 8 hour cream I have quite dry lips at the moment so this is the only thing that thoughts that out basically the taste and smell of this always reminds me of going on holiday because I always put this on on the plane since I've already washed prepped primed moisturize etc etc my skin it is time to start with my foundation the foundation that I like to wear when I'm having a bit of a troubled skin day or week or month is this which is the Kat Von D locket foundation this is 24-hour where full coverage transfer-resistant finish I've tried to be classic afraid of double wear but I personally don't get on with it as much as I know so many other people do so once i've tried there this was a complete lifesaver for me because I feel like the coverage of this is in same it's just what you need on days where you're not feeling as like skin constants and I am using a real techniques dissing brush to apply that I [Music] think this foundation is a smidgen on the light side for me as you can see I mean it matches neck to be fair but I generally like to be a little darker on the face so I am gonna bronze it up don't worry as you can see that's one pump I've still got so much on my hands that was like half a pump of that foundation it's really great I'm going to just put a tiny bit more on like the areas where I think I need it a bit more next I have a selection of concealers I haven't actually decided which ones I'm going to use yet I have two more of the Kat Von D concealers I also have the Urban Decay Naked concealer which is great it's really like full coverage perfect for kind of more spotty days and will do this under my eyes and the life that makes life so anyway I wrote on I feel like these might be slightly too light but let's try this one I'm just going to put a little bit of it on the back of my hand yeah that's quite light and then using this which is one of my all-time favorite Real Techniques brushes this is the setting brush don't use it for setting I use it for concealer rebel I'm just going to dip that on the concealer what I have some like problem areas I like to put computer on the back of my hand because I feel like dipping it on your face and then putting it back in the tube it's probably not the best for your skin so I make sure I have a clean brushes as possible this one was slowly that my makeups as clean as possible that my skin is as clean as possible but my hands are clean as possible and that you're not putting product straight from the tube onto your face it does make a lot of difference also changing your pillowcases so I'm just gonna pop this on some areas like Bronwyn move okay going to just put a tiny bit more on back of my hand am I going to mix it with a little bit of the Urban Decay Naked concealer that's slightly darker in shade and then blend them on my chin my chin is always my main problem area basically my chin hates me and I hate it okay I'm happy with that I'm just going to do a tiny bit more okay there we go now I'm going to pop this Bobbi Brown corrector under my eyes and I feel like it's fine to do this if it's under eye that's not where my spots are so it's going to step back under here my makeup artist uses this automate app shoot and every time she uses that I'm like oh I need to order that so I ordered it it's really great now I'm going to do a little bit of lasting perfection concealer I do definitely feel like when my skin is a bit more problematic I take a bit more time to make sure the base is perfect before doing anything else on top you can't build a house without the foundations and you can't do your makeup without a good foundation okay well I'm well and truly concealed conceal don't feel I am using the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD micro finishing is powder I don't want too much best because I feel like when my skin fat if I like to feel kind of jewy you know whoa whoa it's like going everywhere this is the Real Techniques point X X X L practice it's the softest brush I have ever felt and I love it I feel like the most important areas are the ones where you know your makeups going to come off first so for me again it's my trusty chin me and my chin need to learn how to get along I think cuz this ain't working there we go okay so we're powdered next thing I tend to do is my contour so this is my favourite Anastasia Beverly Hills contour palette and one I like use is this one in the middle it's kind of like a good in-between shade from the other two and I'm going to use this brush which is a sigma soft blend concealer brush which I use for contour [Music] what would you do for assistive art and then you're good I like this book then you want to blend it [Music] this is much real of a chiseled cheekbones it's much better blended and hot blenders I'm going to do a bit of bronzer I'm going to use this one which is the Marc Jacobs I'm going to get what's called Marc Jacobs tantrik 102 which is like my favorite matte bronzer right now still love it and I'm going to swirl my big XXL brush in it give it a bit of a shake because there's a lot product on there and then I'm just going to sweep here what did I decide for blush at all yes I'm going to use this which is the hourglass incandescent electric lighting blush and I am using my Charlotte Tilbury powder and sculpt brush I'm just gonna pop a bit of that on there give it a double [Music] and pop some of that on the tip of my cheeks and bring it up now because this already sort of has highlight in it I don't feel like I need to do much more with the highlight but I am going to just add a tiny bit because this highlights really beautiful and it is a becker moonstone highlight note this is opal and I'm going to pop a little bit of that in there tap it off oh look at if you're a little bit scared of putting highlighter over any spots you've covered or like bumps or anything because sometimes the highlighter can like accentuate it then I would just skip that part by with you I was certain for certain I certainly wouldn't be putting highlight on my chin which is where my problem area tends to be anyway so my cheeks for me are fine to put highlight on too but I know that some people can get a bit scared of highlight when it's over bumps that they've got because it does sort of accentuate it but you know what I just think highlights pretty nonetheless what else do I need to do here I wanted to keep my eyes fairly simple so I'm going to use the Charlotte Tilbury color chameleon bronze garnet pencil I love these pencils so much if you want to do very quick easy eyes you need these pencils they are fast so I'm just going to draw that on my eyelid and [Music] it doesn't matter if it looks terrifying now because they always find when you blended it Wow I'm going to do a tiny bit underneath do you actually mind if I messed up like this to 1/7 brush I am now going to blend this a lot [Music] [Music] now I'm going to do my eyebrows because I always feel like your eyes look crazy without having done your brows and your brows with crazy without having done your eyes I'm going to do it halfway before being finished with my eyes I'm using the new lip shape and define kit which actually comes with tiny tweezers and a tiny little brow comb which is quite cute and I'm also using my Mac 266 angled brush and I'm going to just dip a little bit in all of them this is actually a wax so I might do the powder bust and they're definitely works on top but my brow color is somewhere between these two so I just have dip it in both and then I'm just lightly filling in any of the really like obvious brow gaps that I have because even though I've been trying to grow my brow for like two years now they always like to grow down here but never where I need them to grow it isn't that just the eyebrow away one brow done [Music] okay there we go and then I have this really cute little Delilah brow shape defining brow gel which I just want to run through just a nice day in the right place back to my eyes okay I'm just going to add a little bit of definition to the overall light shadowing so I'm just going to put a slightly lighter color in the inner corner and that color is going to be this one which is called a Vermeer like a very light kind of pinky color and when the rocks on going to just use the same brush and I'm just going to blend tiny bit about just to give a bit of light to the inner corner [Music] well though that actually does make a huge difference and I'm gonna just use this dark brown matte shade just to blend in the crease and there we go now I'm going to do my fealty summit now I'm going to do my liquid liner this is the Stila stay all day waterproof liquid liner and a lot of it I always start this in the middle and go out done this ones away so I can't talk when I do it [Music] here we've got one going up higher than the other but I don't care good I ain't doing that again mascara time like my favorite time I am using my fav Maybelline lash sensational because I love it look at the difference creepy [Music] there we go mascara all done and I'm just going to put a little bit about on my bottom lashes as well there we go now all that's left is to do a lip now I am trying up whether or not to go for the Kylie Jenner velvet liquid lipstick in the colour charm or my stealer liquid lipstick in the colour Angelo admittedly they're both exactly the same but I still can't define let's go for a Coachella shall we hmm no it's that's to oranjee not feeling that way because I changed my mind I'm now going to put this on top which is Aquarius to which I have to say is not so dissimilar but less like peachy pinky I think this is the lip color I have been up there with hmm I was going to do a gloss but I actually don't think I want to do a gloss I think I'm happy with it just like there so take my funny little hair bubble out sort my hair out so there you go that is the finished look this is my makeup when I'm having a problem skin day I really hope you guys enjoyed this give it a thumbs up if you did even if it just reassured you that you're not the only one who will have bad skin days and when they strike this is how I deal with it and I will see you again very very soon ah 
hello everybody it is time for another monthly favorites Wow say woah Nullah it's finally September and also can we just take a moment to appreciate the fact that these fairy lights are back up on my wall behind the bed oh my god guys it felt so weird to be filming videos in here and not having those very lights behind the bed I was like it looks boring it looks rubbish I'm feeling much better about it now the lights are back I'm happy well I'm not happy with those the fact that all these cushions seem to be like on this side of the bed I just need to just sort that out okay happy with that you wanna come up this really is like being in the old house got a doggie he refuses to not be in the video sit down what's my plan so the first thing I am gonna share with you because I think Nana's gonna eat it it's this house plant I know it seems a bit weird to put a house plant in my favorites it's that weird I don't know but every time I look at this plant it gives me so much joy I had to share it annoyingly I can't actually tell you what this is I know this will be a lot of you that do know so if you do leave it in the comments so that other people know but I currently have this sitting on my dining room table and I just flippin love it it needs a name actually so if any of you have a name for this plant then do let me know tweet me leave a comment on my Instagram or you know leave a comment in this video giving my little plant a name I have a lot of houseplants in this house but this one I seem to have like a special attachment to and would be most sad if I wasn't able to keep this alive so if I've done a pretty good job I've had it for about a month and it's still going strong but you know what it kind of reminds me of like is it 90s when they had like the braided kind of long kind of floppy hair yeah it kind of reminds me of that but i abso actually love it and it is bringing me so much joy every time I see it so I had to put it in my favorites quite a few of these things in the Beauty category you may have already seen in my peer box video but obviously since I filmed that I have been testing out a lot of this stuff so a couple of the bits will have been featured in that just means I've been loving them first one is the Urban Decay Naked heat palette I mean I knew I would love this anyway so it shouldn't really come as a shock to any of you oh I peeled the plastic off this I have appeared the plastic of the mirror okay you can all join me in the satisfaction of peeling off oh I wonder if there's like a community of youtubers that just do satisfying things like peeling stickers of things there must be there's like there's a channel for everything these days these colors are all beautiful as you can see absolutely love all of them I can't wait to take these on holiday with me colors everywhere mostly our dirty talk scorched cayenne and Fuego ashes and ylim lumber lombre those are the cuts are basically half a pallet there's so many different looks you can do with it I do think it would be perfect for autumn and yeah I really love this palette I'm so glad they decided to do a palette like this because those sorts of colors were always the ones I was most drawn to in any of the other palettes anyway so loving that the next thing I have been loving is the k'kaw Beauty powder contour kit I've been using this every day since I received it and I really really like it I don't use it so much for the highlighter colors because you will see what I have been using but the contour shade here is absolutely perfect for my skin tone and it's so pigmented and it blends so beautifully and glides on and lasts really well and I've just been really really enjoying it I love how epically massive the mirror is in this as well because it actually is very very useful for my eyes I have been using these who together these are both by the brand Smith and Colt so I buy these on Colt beauty don't lik disgustin wants to hear that you really pick your moments Nullah and I know for a fact I have mentioned this in a favorites video somewhere along the line and it's the lash danced mascara this mascara is so flippin good if you don't like thick clumpy looking lashes which I know sounds weird because it sounds like no one should like that but I actually do like that I like a mascara that is really thick and with one coat you can run out the door and it looks like you've spent ages doing lots of different coats I like a mascara like that takes less time for the same kind of outcome so the Smith and Colt lash dance has been a favorite of mine for probably over a year now and I really really love it that and my Maybelline lash sensational I'd go between pretty often so I've been loving that but with it I have also been using the liquid liner so this is the smithing cult B line eye pen and along with the Stila waterproof one which I also absolutely love I don't have right now this is just amazing like it lasts really well it goes on lovely it's thick it's dark like the actual color comes out really well and it's just a really really nice eyeliner so I've kind of brought back the cat flick that I had no time for during summer and moving house so I'm quite happy about it I thought you wanted to come in here and sleep it's not playtime this is technically a blush and a highlighter but I had to mention it because I am obsessed with this product in fact I think this is my favorite product she has ever ever released and it is the Tanya burr cosmetics illuminating powder in peonies please Tanya sent this to me and I first started using it about three or four weeks ago and I I am obsessed with it so he's a bit of a story I don't know if she's mentioned this in any of her videos and I don't know whether it's like me that has completely inspired this product cuz I don't want to be that big-headed about it but ages and ages and ages ago there was a blush by Estee Lauder called tease and it was my absolute favorite blush in fact I'm not gonna lie I've still got it I'm too scared to use it because I don't have much of it left and they haven't brought her another one so went on started up her makeup range I said to her oh my god please create a product that is like Estee Lauder tease that I can use so I don't have to like use up a tease and when I text her saying oh my god this product is absolutely freaking amazing she said I did it because you said you wanted one that was like teased now it's like oh my god I feel like Tarn has literally created a product specifically just for me which obviously isn't the case because she wants everyone else to enjoy it and she's made multiple sure that just make one but I just thought that was so flippin cool and also just like I'm so happy that I have a product that's like teased and I absolutely love it I've been wearing this every single day since I've got it it gives a really beautiful subtle pinky glow that is kind of the way I would describe it is like it looks kind of healthy it looks like a healthy shine because it has that pink in it and I absolutely love it so I use this in place of a highlight and the blush so it's kind of like my kind of all-in-one and I just I'm obsessed with it it's my favorite thing she has ever ever ever brought out a lot of you have noticed in my vlogs that I've been wearing a certain like new dark nude color and that color is this this is the Coco by Kylie cosmetics matte liquid lipstick in the shade bunny I love this I love the Kylie Jenner lip kits I think they're amazing my favorite formula is the matte shades I just think matte lips look better on me I don't have anything against like gloss or what's the other kind it's like sat in like a satiny finish nothing against those but I just think mat suits me better I feel more comfortable in a matte shade I don't feel like it's gonna smear all over my teeth like once it's on I feel really kind of confident and like settled with the fact that it's there to stay for a really good while and you know I love my nudes so this is a nude that I have been reaching for pretty much every day that I am wearing a nude and I really really like it next up is actually one of my own products but I can't tell you how obsessed I've been with this for like the last three months obviously now I am allowed to share this with you and I have talked about this over on my second channel but my beauty gifting range this year is snow Ella and it is a very fresh crisp kind of smell like it's basically how I would describe my perfect scent and it was a scent that took a really really long time to perfect in fact it is the hardest thing I've ever had to do and it took a long time but with that I think this is my favorite scent that I have ever ever released I am just obsessed with it I basically spray it on myself all day everyday I know it might sound lame because it's my own product but I genuinely am obsessed with this smell and this fragrance and just everything about this this and the other things in the beauty range will be launching in super drugstores a little bit later on this month although I do think there are a few online for any early birds the next two products were also in my p.o box haul and I was really really excited to try these it's the shampoo and conditioner by the brand Windell and moody and I think you can get these in Space NK I've used these about four times already I don't wash my hair every day so four times it's over quite a large span it's not like I've washed use these for four days and gone these are going in my faves they are the ultra nourishing treatment shampoo and conditioner with white tea and monoi oil monoi oil I'm going I'm annoyed and I love this so as I was saying in my other favorites video when I was talking about the L'Oreal shampoo my hair felt very dry and I still use that shampoo and I still love it and I'm using like other shampoos and I used fees and again it just gave my hair like that instant like boost of D frizz and I really really like them another thing I really like about these are the scent it's a very different scent it's it's like a little bit floral and very light and a bit fresh and every now and then when I like move my hair or like go to tie my hair up I can smell it and it's just really nice it's very subtle left my hair feeling absolutely incredible so if any of you are looking for something for like a bit more moisture or your hairs a bit like dry or you color your hair then check these out rigored moving on to random things Marc recently went away on a cruise and he came back with this this is the Bath &amp; Body Works leaves candle this is actually the one for this year and I really I do actually quite like this this is very autumnal and it gives me all the autumn feels and these just like autumn stock images but it's so funny I've probably spoken not as snoring behind me babes that's like you know the time in a place I've probably talked about this candle a lot although when I went to pick this up I was like I don't know if people know this is my favorite one of all the Bath and Body Works candles ever ever ever this is my favorite leaves is my favorite if anyone said to me what does autumn smell like to you I would say leaves and here in the UK we've had some pretty like miserable cozy or terminal days and I've lit this and it just smells so good and it's made me so happy to have this candle lit and even unlit people walk in and they're like oh god what's that smell and like it's this candle so yeah leaves bloody lover this is a clothing item but again it's brought me a lot of joy this month and it is this jumper from Zara this is a big oversized cozy soft jumper with giant multicolored pom-poms on it all the way around it all over it I like a gimmicky jumper hence why have this one with a massive tiger on it I really like it gimmicky jumper I had that Easter one with all the multicolored pom-poms on like my jumper collection is something that I'm actually quite proud of adding this to my collection just made me so incredibly happy and this it's a lovely fit it wasn't too expensive it's from Zara by the way did I say that it's from Zara and every time I worn it I've had compliments on it and people asking me where it's from and yeah I just love it FYI there is a lot of great things in Sarah and my men sorry in advance so I was with a couple of the people that I worked with earlier and I was like oh I must remember in my September favorites to put fried onions and they were just like what it was just one of those moments where I realize how weird I am and how random my favourites are but guys fried onions I discovered fried onions and I mean like they've already not like fried onions like fresh fried onions on a saucepan like these have been fried a long time ago they're like crispy crispy onions tiny tiny little crumby crispy onions so I discovered these because Alfie really likes Waitrose sushi and there's a type of wait true sushi called crunchy salmon roll and it is a salmon roll rolled in crunchy onions and I tried it and I don't really like sushi but I was like I'll try it and I realized that the only part I actually liked of the sushi was the crunchy onions so whenever alfie would have sushi I would eat all the klephts over crunchy onions that he would leave in like the little dish then when we were on another shopping trip and Waitrose I realize they sell the onions that are on the sushi in their own little pot so these are all gone because I put them on everything I'm telling mom I left four crunchy fried and I scared you because you say you stole my sushi I did anyway fried onions these can go on anything I've finished these but thankfully poppy and Shawn brought us these back when they got back of holiday this was the president then poppy DeSean brought us back because they knew we would like it so Alfie things we put fried onions on go well normal people ie me sushi Zoey I think a lot of people will put fried onions on sushi yeah baked beans on toast baked beans on time Ariel no not safe house Hastur jacket potato baby no baby girl there's a few things are we just mix in a sandwich you know what have you told them enchiladas ah no let's tell them we discovered don't want to tell them because then they're gonna sell out another supermarket no it's fine we've got this this will last us a while so me and I'll be also discovered tiny little cocktail sausages bite at the end dip it in ketchup tomato sauce then you dip it in some crispy onions then you bite it and it tastes like like um like a cheap hot dog like the ones you can get from like stores in like car boot sales and things agree just taste that basically guys you can put these on every meal anyway I feel like I'd be talking about these longer than any other thing in my favourites I need to stop and the last thing this I feel like my favourites recently I've taken my weirdness to a whole other level and I feel like none of you are gonna carry on watching me or my videos if I continue down this path of being very honest about the things I've been enjoying anyway this isn't news isn't innovative I didn't invent this but melted marshmallows between digestive biscuits and I actually have one to show you because I made loads last night someone just left this on the side and I just found it when I was downstairs well perfect have you showing them in my favorites video take a digestive plane or with chocolate if you want to go for like the s'mores effect you melt a marshmallow in the microwave for about 10 to 15 seconds on a high heat you then place another digestive biscuit on top and you make a melty marshmallow digestive delicious snack not healthy in the slightest but delicious and I think if you consume these within reason it's fine I have yet to try it with a chocolate digestive but I feel like that would just be like delicious because it would be like a s'more and the chocolate would melt a little bit so I am gonna try that but I think it's it might be like the cozy kind of all terminal weather that's made me crave this but I'm really doing that this actually is one thing you can't really put crispy onions on okay that is everything I've been loving this month I really hope you guys have enjoyed this video as always I would love to know what you have been loving so make sure to leave a comment letting me and anyone else reading the comments now make sure to tweet me and or even tag me on a picture on Instagram take a little picture of everything you've been loving and tag me because I really like I like sharing in there like things we all love joy give the video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and I will see you again very very soon bye am I gonna hold the crispy onions up for my thumb now 
hello everybody today I am Nullah mother hello everybody it's favourites time it's that time of the month where I chat you through the things that I've been loving the most boom I've just looked down at my things and also realize I've left one over I always sit on one leg hang on oh I don't know whether I should cross my legs let's get comfy makeup-wise I have been really loving this which is the radiance reveal bourgeois concealer to illuminate Oh correct illuminates and 24-hour hydration I don't know if I've put this in a favourites before I don't think I have I think I put it in a whole video but I just I've never seen anyone talking about this and this concealer is so good it's definitely not as much coverage as the correction one which is why quite a lot of the time I will use the correction concealer under my eyes and also on blemishes because the coverage of that concealer is insane but this one for brightening under the eyes or you know halfway through the day when you feel a little bit like your concealer is failing you slightly or you're just getting more and more tired putting some of this on does you the world of good it honestly looks like you've had like ten hours sleep what a statement to make it also smells like DKNY be Delicious which is a perfume that I actually used to wear when I was like I don't know 1617 I also love that perfume um and not at the center of it is really anything to go by but it is a really lovely product it blends really nicely it does feel quite moisturizing moisturizing it does feel quite moisturizing under the eyes which i think is something that a lot of people look for because dry crusty eyes are never a good look and so if you're going for something to brighten and hydrate I feel like it looks a lot better and one thing that comes with high coverage is usually dryness the coverage of this is still really good I wouldn't say that it's not good coverage I'm just saying compared to collection which is another high-street concealer that i absolutely rave about this doesn't have the same coverage but it's not far off I have been dotting this and my eyes and blending it with a really soft brush to give the ultimate like I have bright eyes and I am so awake even when I'm not it's like the best like cheat to sleep ever moving on to Barry M these are two of the Barry M lip liners now I have gotten into lip liner a little bit more recently because I've been wearing quite a lot of nude lips and actually I found that using lip liners and just filling your lips in it gives a really lovely effect because I love matte lips and liners are always matte and they're just really easy and actually a lot of the time when I line my lips I end up filling them in anyway so the one I have been loving the most is this one which is number 17 I don't know the name of it all I know is that it's seventeen and it's it's really lovely kind of movie nude and this I've been wearing I've actually got it on today underneath the NYX liquid suede and it's just a really great color so if any of you are looking for a lip liner in a nude shade definitely check out Barry M and they're super good value for money and then the other one I've been really liking is this one which is number 15 which is slightly more on the pinky side so if you prefer baiji pinky nudes I think you'll really like this sticking with lips these which I featured in my pa box on opening and I knew I was going to end up loving them because I am obsessed with liquid lipsticks at the moment it's pretty much all I've been wearing they last really well and yes they can be a bit more drying on the lips and some people hate them for that fact but I don't really mind because they stay put and they do what they're supposed to do and they're super pigmented now when I go for a normal like moisturizing lipstick I'm like oh no I hate it it's sticky I feel like it's going to smudge across my face I feel like it comes off when I eat these just stay put and you really don't you top them up that much throughout the day I was very excited when I saw these smash book 1 smash book that I was really excited when I saw these smash book what I can't fake it so I was really excited when I saw these Smashbox ones in my PAP so this color is stepping out and it's just a really pretty nude pink so for those of you that prefer to have a pink tone in your nudes or for those of you that prefer to have a brown tone I feel that this covers both because it does have a slight pink and a slight Brown a kind of color way to it I'm not really sure how to describe it but I really like it what I think makes me like these a lot is the applicator the applicator is kind of like round and then it goes into a point and it's just really easy especially for like lining I think with a lot of them you have to be quite careful because if they're quite round you find lining the lips a little bit more difficult but because this one has a pointed tip I found it's really easy to apply without having already done a liquid liner not liquid liner a lip liner now I haven't worn this too much but the couple of times I have I've absolutely loved it it's this very deep red with a slight hint of berry tone to it and that's my favorite kind of red shade which if you've watched my videos for a while you will already know and this one is called misconduct you can get some really amazing results with these and the Smashbox I can't say Smashbox and the Smashbox ones are really really good next thing I have been absolutely loving was also featured in my PA box video which is this it's the Becca Jacqueline Hill champagne collection face palette firstly it's just beautiful but also it has the best mirror I've ever seen with a palette ever they are so pigmented I was actually quite like whoa it's not such a thing as a blusher that's actually too pigmented I don't know but the blush I've been using is this one which is the rosy spritz and it's a very pretty kind of coral peach with a gold shimmer running through it and then on top of that I have been highlighting with this one which is champagne pop I don't know if it's the consistency which I'm like super impressed with you honestly just do one really light swipe and the color payoff is incredible they're also very easy to blend and they last really well and I don't know just every about this I am obsessed with right now and it for sure makes me want to try out all the other Becca blushes because I've never known anything like that before the other thing that I quickly wanted to mention in beauty are some eyelashes that I've really really liked wearing and using so recently for a shoot I had these ones on and they are kiss looks so natural light and soft as a feather so you can get different variations and they've all got different names these ones are called hot and they have like slightly thicker darker lashes towards the end so that the outer part of your eyelashes looks slightly darker and thicker and more like fluttery and I wore these on a shoot and I posted some photos and a lot of you were like oh my god what eyelashes do you have on they were these ones so I have some more of these generally these are the eyelashes that I will have on for any photo shoot if I've used the makeup artists that I like to use quite often she always has these in her kicks I think the reason I like them is because you don't feel as though you're wearing them the minute they're on and they're dry you honestly forget you have them on and I could literally get two just before bed when I go to take my cap off and realize I've still got them on they're that good they just feel invisible and like it says on here they're really light so they don't feel heavy they don't feel way down and I think for those exact reasons a lot of people kind of stray away from wearing false lashes but actually um if you feel like you don't even have any on ah it makes wearing them and applying them a lot more enjoyable because it has reached that time of the year where everyone is kind of getting their fake tan out and trying to look somewhat summer ready I have been fake tanning now I feel like I may have mentioned this brand ages and ages ago but this is he-she which is a tanning brand aimed at both men and women it says for him and for her but this is the one hour rapid liquid tan and I have a fresh mitt here I do have one downstairs but it's brown and grubby and I thought you know what for this video I'm just gonna get one I haven't used yet so I still have this one in the rapper but you can buy any fake tan mitt it doesn't have to be a he-she one so the reason I like this is because it is a liquid I have tried many many fake tan consistencies what-you-call-it formulas I do not get on well with mousse I don't like it it clings to any dry skin I have on my body and it just doesn't ever look right I don't really like lotion because I feel that if I apply a lotion it's more likely to move around my skin so I don't know if I put top on or if I go to bed if I sweat like I just feel like lotion takes a lot longer to sink in and kind of leaves you with that whole keep your arms out need to get dry kind of feeling which I don't really like this one is a liquid they also have another one which is not the one our rapid tan which I also love and use which I think is the one that I may have put in this video before I just really like it I like the color that it makes my skin it's more of like an olivey with a hint of red so it actually does look like quite a natural tan I love how easy it is to apply I just sprinkle this on the fake tanning mitt and then I go over and because it's a liquid I find it dries really quickly but not in that same drying way of the mousse this is the most foolproof tan for me and I'm not the best applying fake tan I'm definitely no fake tan expert and yes I get it wrong sometimes but this has never been difficult for me and this is so straightforward and easy and also the one hour rapid means it dries a lot quicker but also the color shows up a lot quicker next thing I'm going to show you is a little bit more on the pricey side now I always feel like I need to say this just in case any of you watching I like oh my god that sounds amazing damn it why didn't she tell me this was more pricey I just feel like I need to warn you slightly when I say slightly on the pricey side it's not over 100 pounds but it's over 50 so there we go but also know that that's not that steep for some of you but it is for some of you I don't know it all varies doesn't it it's so dependent on the person watching so I'm just going to say now this is not High Street I got this on cult Beauty is by the brand Omar vixa or Maura vixa I can never say it properly it's it's a brand I struggle to to pronounce it is the deep cleansing mask it comes in this really beautiful little glass pot it smells like a spa ah this includes healing waters and mineral infused muds now I'm not a skincare expert so I don't really know what those two things mean what I can tell you though is the ingredients in this make for a pretty powerful face mask it even says on the directions not to use this before a big event the next day because essentially what it does is draws out all the crap that's in your skin and that's probably not the scientific way of explaining it so I mean don't quote me there but that's what it seems to appear to do to mine if I feel like I have a spot but it's not doing anything you're guaranteed then it's going to pop up and say hi after you've used this probably use this maybe once or twice a week I don't want to overdo it because I also feel like that's probably not the best for your skin but I just find that my skin has looked and felt a lot more clear and I haven't had as many issues with spots and if I have I feel like this has cleared them up really really quickly this is the embryo lease lotion micellar which is a soothing and cleansing makeup remover for your eyes face and lips no rinsing necessary for all skin types there is something quite nice about removing your makeup with a lotion and some cotton pads which i think is why micellar waters are so popular so many people love to do it I like to do this to remove my makeup at night and then I go on to do a second cleanse or I will use this in the morning just to kind of give my face like a bit of a refresh basically I think one of the main things I really like about this is the smell of it now I have no idea what this smells like but it smells like something I know it's like fresh flowers like white flowers I'm not sure but I really like what it smells like I also really like how easy it is to remove my makeup with this and just generally a great product the next thing I picked up was actually when I was doing a shop at Colby I noticed that Jen Atkin who is a celebrity hairstylist has released her new hair care range which is spelt oh you AI but apparently you pronounce it way I picked up the volume shampoo and the volume conditioner I really quite like the packaging I like it it's quite simple I also like that it has a teeny little bit of rose gold on there and I really like the cap I just think it's quite simple it looks quite nice just set on the side of the bath it's not too fussy etc except at first I was a bit like oh it doesn't foam up as much as my previous shampoo but then when I got used to it I was like oh I don't know what I was thinking this still foams this is absolutely fine it smells really nice it's not too fussy it's quite a nice kind of subtle scent and it leaves my hair feeling really clean really like sleek like there's none of that like frizziness about it and I have just been really enjoying these last up is a her spray this is by the company davon airs or davines I don't know again there's too many things we need to pronounce in this video I think it's davon Aires and it is the your hair assistant conceived and designed by Angelo seminar a perfecting hairspray natural and invisible hold this hairspray is so good there's none of that like Criss penis the hold is really good but it doesn't feel hard it doesn't feel I don't know I just really really like it Gavin Eze hair spray really really great moving on to random things okay so game a game I've been obsessed with is The Sims I feel like I've been obsessed with the sim since I was like 13 so it's not really anything new there it's just that I played it the other day with Alfie as you know we've had like a sim series like on and off on his gaming channel and uh one of the things I really love to do is watch other people's gameplay life simha is an amazing Sims gamer I absolutely love her Christina and also just playing it I really like playing it the other day someone said to me what do you like to do to relax I was like place in because I feel like it's the one time I'm not thinking about content projects being on Twitter being surrounded by social media I feel like it's the one time I'm actually concentrating on someone else's life instead of my own so I've been trying to watch more films recently because there are so many that I really want to see and there's not enough time in the day for me to see them but the other day I watched love Rosie with Alfie it's just one of those films that I've had on my list of films I really want to watch for quite a while so the other day me and Alfie sat down to watch a film and I decided to watch it much too Alfie's like dismay at first he was like oh I really want to watch this and I think he was like working or editing on his laptop but he would like stop and like get really into it and then we had a food delivery and he was like pause it pause it and I was like okay he's properly hooked in this film now and then we just ended up watching it together don't want to give too much away but it's essentially about a guy and a girl who have known each other since they were really young and it kind of follows them as they grow up and their relationship together and their friendship and it is just such a light-hearted fun cute romance it was so nice I can imagine some people would call it quite fluffy I don't even care because I sometimes love a fluffy romance and it was just so sweet it really tugged on your heartstrings and it was just the best and I was like I need to put that in my favourites because if any of you haven't seen it and you want to watch a film to just feel so like oh I loved that then watch it it made me fall in love with sam claflin all over again every time I watch him in a film I'm like oh my god I just love that guy he is just so dreamy but also Lily Collins is so amazing in this film and she's the cutest and so adorable and just I don't know I just loved everything about it so if you're looking for a romance to watch whether it's on your own or if you're going to force your partner to watch it with you then check it out I have rambled on now for far too long so I'm going to end this video here thank you very much for watching don't forget to give the video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it let me know as always you have been loving this month or if there's anything that you think I might like next month and I will see you again very very soon bye 
you you Oh hello everybody when spring starts rolling around and the Sun starts making a bit more of an appearance than usual we are living in the UK after all then I feel like picnics are the most exciting thing ever besides a barbecue which I am also accustomed to everyone loves a barbecue I feel like picnics are so fun and easy and I know I just really like a picnic so I decided to try and do the most epic picnic I have ever done now you guys know by now that I never do anything half-assed so when I decided that I wanted to do a picnic at the weekend I ramped up a little bit I scoured Pinterest for any cute ideas I looked at recipes food ideas decoration ideas and myself and poppy went to town obviously most of you may know a picnic as a blanket food and a field and I mean that is pretty much all you need in order to have a successful picnic you don't need to go as extreme as I did but we had so much fun setting up we had so much fun at the actual picnic and I honestly think it was one of my favorite days so far this year if you have a celebration coming up it's someone's birthday someone's graduated an end of exams party or you just know that there's a really sunny weekend coming up and lots of you and your friends are all free and you want to do something then I feel like it gives you the perfect excuse to go that little bit more crazy and creative with how you set your picnic up we decided we wanted to do a tree pea I've called it this I don't actually know if it's called a tree pea but it's a teepee suspended in a and all I did for that it looks really complicated but I promise you it was actually really easy I ordered 10 to 15 meters of plain white fabric from Amazon I guess it really depends on how thick the material is and what material you want to buy but it really wasn't that expensive and I can reuse this for multiple things to be honest you could also use bed sheets blankets you don't have to buy fabric especially to do this I mean it's kind of like making an adult day let's be honest you want to find a location that has a good tree if you want to do a tree P you need a decent tree some trees have like horizontal branch coming off of them which would be perfect because then you can just sling the fabric over the branch if it's not too high and kind of create your tepee from there the tree we had it it wasn't quite perfect enough for that so we actually just used a hollow pole and we fed string through it so we created like a loop and we tied the pole around the tree so it was kind of hanging and then we draped the fabric over the pole that sounds really complicated but there's lots and lots of pictures on my blog which I will obviously link below and where you can kind of see how that's created the shape you also don't need to do a tree P if you don't want to I just thought it looked really cool and after we've done that we decorated it we have out in fact I've got some things here because I'm a bit of a party fanatic ie I love to throw people parties not go to them necessarily I actually already have like a stash of like paper decorations and things like this came in so useful for the picnic because they're so easy to do they're so easy to set up and they're also really easy to attach in a tree making it look super super pretty and cute and of course if there's a theme to your picnics if it's someone's birthday party you can kind of tailor these a little bit more to the person maybe you could have some happy birthday bunting I feel like it's kind of all about personal preference really I decided I wanted to make this more of a picnic party because most picnics I feel like are an afternoon occasion I really love that kind of cozy element of like the candles and the fairy lights and the evening just kind of was more fitting for that day so we did our picnic from like started our picnic at about 5:00 or 6:00 p.m. and I really liked that time because you get the lovely like sunlight but you also get that really nice like ambient like sunset and then you have the darkness which if you're not scared of like being out in a field at night or you know out in right in the back of your garden then it doesn't really matter but make sure you take torches because we did not take torches setting up too thick in the daylight is fun and it's fine and it's easy trying to take apart a picnic in complete darkness was slightly more difficult so we took candles we took fairy lights obviously battery-operated fairy lights unless you have a power supply nearby in which case you could go fairy like crazy we had like candle lanterns and we just made it really kind of ambient and cozy and it looked really cool and it just felt so nice because the evening was warm however I would advise you to obviously take blankets to sit on inside your tree pee but I also took a couple of blankets that could be used as like cover-ups and Shores in case it got a little bit more chilly in the evenings always make sure you have a big enough picnic basket to be able to take food plastic cutlery glasses drinks plates any like serving ware I used some slate boards some wooden boards and things to sort of lay food out on sissors don't forget scissors because if you're opening all these packets and you have no way of actually tearing them open or cutting bits of like paper or cutting string you're screwed bin bags always remember to take bin bags to a picnic because there will be packaged in wrappers any leftover food that nobody wants to take home it's always important to take at least some form of rubbish bag because you also don't want to be leaving anything behind if you're doing this in a public space matches no point having candles if you don't have matches to light said candles the amount of times I've been to picnics or like garden parties and there's no way of lighting any candles and everyone just ends up sitting in the dark like using their phone torches like whoo you also might want to take with you some napkins and some wet wipes because you never know what might get spilt you might get sticky fingers and if you don't have access to a sink what you're gonna do when it came to food I feel like with a picnic a lot of the time if there's a big group of you going you can all decide who's bringing what and it really depends on what time of the day as well because if you're doing more of like a brunch picnic then obviously the food might be slightly different if you're doing a lunch picnic it could be different if you're doing a dinner picnic like we did it might also be slightly different I really wanted to do a cheese board because it was kind of like more of an evening time and we had things like her most like dips and I mean picnic food is um known as being cold and nibbly bits and things that are quite easy to kind of spoon and eat like pasta salads potato salads coleslaw quiches lots and lots of bits and pieces like that which you can prepare yourself of course but we didn't prepare everything ourselves we probably prepared quite a few bits she made two salads I made some fruit kebabs because they're super fun and super easy and poppy also made um some ice lollies make sure you've got freezer bag if you're planning on taking anything frozen but generally I feel like picnics are quite nibble a bit so we took a little trip to Marks &amp; Spencer and we basically just went round and took everything from that like new summer range didn't sponsored by M&amp;S by the way they just have a lot of really amazing picnic food in right now so we got like crisps and dips and fruit and just lots and lots of lovely little bits and pieces and it was just the most amazing spread of food you have ever seen and I just wanted to eat all of it our eyes were certainly bigger than our tummies and there wasn't quite enough of us to finish everything but we took empty Tupperware boxes with us so that we could take any food we couldn't eat home and you know eat it another time entertainmentwise now I know you don't really need any more entertainment than your friends because generally if you have good company then everyone's happy and you don't need anything else but one thing that I will say is vital for any picnic is a wireless Bluetooth speaker I don't know what make this one is it's an LG musicflow I got this on from John Lewis but there are so many that you can get and they're just the best thing ever I feel like a picnic isn't isn't as good as it could be without a little bit of music just to set the scene gives it a bit more revive and there's nothing worse especially if you're doing in the evening when it gets darker there's nothing worse than just no noise like no sound it kind of gets a little creepy and even with music on at one point we all got a little bit scared I can't remember why I think we were really all overthinking every noise we could hear but yeah music essential another thing I took along with me just for the memories and because I love it it's my little Fujifilm camera you can take instant snaps and I took a lot of really nice pictures that day and I really really loved them and it was just nice to have because lots of people were kind of using it and taking turns I also took a couple of like small compact like card games like there was I could guess the song I also took one game that I think was called awkward bag of note bag of awkward questions or something the sort of thing you see on YouTube challenges that was really fun as well and it just gives it a little bit more especially if it's for a party or something or a birthday and you want to add like an element of like games into it I think that that's that's also really fun if you're doing this big style and you've got quite a lot to take with you the decorations the cutlery the food you're going to need more than a picnic basket although it does depend how big your picnic basket is I guess but we also carried things in cardboard boxes and then we used those cardboard boxes as like tables to put drinks on to put things in we weren't using we always had something to put something in and I think that was really useful too we used one of the boxes as a main like table inside the teepee and that went down really really well I feel like you can even step this up a notch and do a barbecue like a portable barbecue at the picnic that would just be epic maybe when the Sun is really out when summers when summer is in full swing I think that definitely needs to be done I'm already like desperate to do this again it was so much fun I know we weren't kind of OTT but I don't do things in halves so going OTT it was the only option for me and I had so much fun and I'm so glad that we put so much effort into it and it turned out to be such a lovely evening Naomi came Marc came Shawn was there poppy was there and it was just so lovely so so nice and I definitely want to do it again I really hope this video has given you a little bit of picnic inspiration giving you some ideas make sure to check out my blog and also Poppy's blog she's in a blog post she also wrote up how she made her elderflower ice lollies which were absolutely delicious and I've written lots lots more about the picnic the setup the location everything you need to know about how we did the picnic over on the blog so I will link everything it down below I will also leave links to everything that you may have seen in the really cute little montage at the beginning the blankets the lanterns everything that I can find online I will leave in a link in the description box so make sure to check that out if you want to find out any more information and yeah this does a little bit of a different video for me but I kind of want to do these for like Halloween parties Christmas parties birthday parties I literally love doing things like this I love planning parties planning food for the parties planning the decorations I get really really into it and I know that my mum was exactly the same because mine and my brothers parties were always so much fun and she always put so much effort into it and I'm clearly taking after her in that sense because I even threw a party for my dog's first birthday so it's definitely gonna go downhill from here isn't it oh my kids that don't exist yet just don't know what they've got themselves in for so yeah if you want me to do these up for like I said Halloween Christmas I know that those things are quite far away but trust me these things take a little world to plan and you got to get on the Pinterest and start looking for some great ideas then give the video a thumbs up if you like this type of thing and let me know in the comments I would also absolutely love to see any of your pictures if any of you're planning on doing any picnics or going to any picnics or even if you do something slightly different that you think I might like then let me know and show me your pictures on Twitter and Instagram as always hope you've had an amazing weekend guys and I will see you very very soon bye whoops kick the tripod

 The first love item to introduce is   Orange pineapple juice concentrate   God is good   Hello everyone, welcome to my channel   Today's theme is April Love Sharing   It disappeared in April   The same is true in May.   How could I go so fast?   May already halfway   Then I haven't filmed in April to love videos   So I'm going to shoot now   However, I will also share some May love items   A little combined with the concept of May and May   I will still shoot love videos in May (no XD results)   Because I know many people love to watch   I am super happy   because   I used to have a lot of love videos in the past   I also know that the repeatability is very high   but!   You still love to watch and make me super happy   I haven’t applied makeup yet today   Finished makeup for hours, I hope now   I have more love to share   If you think my makeup is very durable   I will share with you the products used   You can hold makeup like me   The first love item is   I want to wear a Zara earring for a full movie   I love them   Super cool and very tropical   Looks like a turtle leaf   Or Cheese plant leaf is uncertain, I may be wrong   Hey, I wear earrings. I should take them off first.   The only thing that made me sad about this earring was   Well, by the way, this is what Zara bought   But what makes me sad about earrings is that   They are super heavy   If the material is lightweight metal   Or thin, how can you say it?   Basically it should be thinner   but   I'm still super love   However, they are really heavy   So I never wore it all day   I will take down the video after the filming   Basically, I love to wear this earring   But after a while I will take it off just in case   You see it for yourself   My ear lobes have been pulled down   But I just love it   I am walking in the tropical wind today   I should have coconut water in one hand and then bear pineapple on my head   Start with beauty   Okay... where did you start?   Start with skin related products   My skin condition has been very bad recently   Worse than usual   If I have a shooting job   Continuous meetings, or a particularly busy day   I'll wipe Kat Von D Ultra Long Lasting Liquid   It hides enough, and it can   Holding makeup all day   But recently   I have been using   bareMinerals SPF15 translucent mineral foundation   In fact this foundation is   After I bought it, I really used my full foundation   I mean   Before I only covered and then pushed   I remember when I was 16 or 17   One day I was watching TV with my mother   Then I saw this foundation, it was 2007   We have a big order for beauty of bare Escentuals   The rest will not have to say more   I love to die when my skin was not as bad as it is now   It’s good that I’m looking for good skin   But bare Escentuals and bare Minerals are really my first foundation in life.   A large number of buckets can be calculated   I remember mentioning this foundation a little bit when I first entered YouTube and blogging.   I used this foundation at the time   My super old blog article should mention this foundation   Other mineral series like bronze cake, blush, concealer   These products are great   I didn't use a better mineral makeup   So I want to say   This is the product I recently received in my email   I want to say   I will try to see   I am in the worst condition in history, so the concealment may not be enough   Forget it and let it go   I will still be on the Collection Concealer   Then on this honey foundation   I also love this brush   Sent along with foundation   Not sure if it comes with a foundation, but it is also a bale minerals brush   The name is perfect finish brush   There is a depression in the middle   The color number is fair ivory 02, this multi-color number optional   So there must be a suitable color   I also think   How do you say it?   You will feel that mineral foundation can not be. . .   (hiccups)   You will feel that mineral foundation is not enough   But the result is opposite   It makes the skin look healthy, translucent and shiny without pink feeling   See my makeup will know   Although there are bright and bronze   But I use this foundation today   Regain my love for bare Minirals   Another kind I love to use   Bobbie Brown Tirami Flying Pen   Not sure if you have any other video   Forgot where I mentioned it, maybe it's a makeup teaching video   My makeup artist used this to help me draw makeup   Every time he finished painting for me, I said "I must buy it!"   Because it makes my makeup feel bad   My dark circles are overweight   Always like this   I believe it will be the same in the future   I love to use many products with pearlescent and brighten eyes   Even if there is a concealer, it can bring different makeup feelings   and so   After I finish my concealer and makeup   Then wipe this product and push it evenly   Now it will be bright   It makes my eyes look   God is both healthy and I love it   It is a liquid concealer with a strong scent   Is a fragrance that should not be rubbed around the eyes   but I like it   I recently tried different eyebrow makeup   A product I have never heard of   My email receives Makeup Forever waterproof eyebrow glue   This is a tube type brown brow glue   I will squeeze a little bit on the back of the hand   Then apply eyebrow brush with eyebrow glue to start thrush   I really like it   Longer makeup results   I also feel more natural   You will feel that this is not natural because you are painting   But it's really natural and very easy to use   When I received this product, I felt   Too complicated product   I don’t use gels every time I use my eyebrows   . . . I thought I had to dye everyday like painting   It's easy to get dirty or paint wrong   I was wrong, this is super easy to use   And it can stay for a whole day   Very wearable and natural   This color is also amazing for me   and also. . . do not know   It makes me thrush   Now is not a good time for you to see   It also has a waterproof function, which is why it is easy to hold makeup.   The next product that I can hardly put down is  噢 This is a sample   There is no sign at all.   This is Estee Lauder Bronze Goddes (Summer Goddess)   I believe it is not for sale, or it will be listed soon   This is a new product   This will be the most beautiful you have ever seen   Gold glitter   Shining/Bronze products   When I just got it   I thought, "When will I use a powder with gold glitter?"   I only use bronze or brighten the product   Not sure if you will use this golden glitter   It is the metallic luster   However,   I am very helpful recently and I really like it   It gives the skin a feeling of solarization, translucent and shiny   Why did anyone press the doorbell for every video?   I love it, super beauty   Full of summer and translucent   I will take it with summer travel   Another love item is the Charlotte Tilbury makeup palette   Old swan, beauty to cry   The top is covered with my dirty handprints   There are three kinds of eye shadows   They are brightening, enhancing, smoking   Smoking   There is bronze, bright, and two colors   As you can see, I used it many times   I live by it everyday   I love this   Matte brown eye shadow, I will smudge the entire eyelid   Now I like matte brown smoke makeup   I also like the bronze inside   Take this block   Then on this bright pink   The last is to light up   Whole color makeup will be used   I love you   Thanks Charlotte Tilbury   I have a hunch that this will save a lot of people   Because you can go out with little cosmetics   This dish is enough   Makes my makeup bag lighter   Next, this is the cream sent to me by Cult Beauty.   thank you all   This is Brazilian bum bum cream from Sol de Janeiro.   First of all, I love its packaging   Again, I like the product name   Very eye-catching name, I like it   Bum bum cream Whoever came up, I like it   I'm not sure   This is an exclusive butt   Or body lotion   It was found that this was a whole body suitable   I already use half of it   One thing I rubbed body lotions was very annoying   It is a slight stickiness   Cause no way to dress   Otherwise the body will sweat slightly   Do you understand? Especially summer   Feeling completely absent   The lotion has been stuck there   This is a fast-absorbing body lotion   Cream and lotion mixed texture   It feels like a mixture of the two   But this is absorbed very quickly   amazing   I can just say   "You touch my arm! Immediately absorb!"   I wipe every day after taking a shower or bathing   And Alfie praised my skin for being tender   This also means   Alfie really sees the effect   Again, its taste   The first impression I heard was "I already have the same fragrance product"   What kind of product is so good   It smells like Laura Mercier cream   May be amber vanilla series   This is a very strong taste   After you wipe it, you can smell it on your body   I like this very much   Same body shower series   I love this very much recently   I don't often introduce shower gel in love   Because I just love shower gel   do not know. . . Is there a hard-to-use shower gel for me?   I can't do it   I love its aroma   Good enough to smell   This is Floral Memento Body Wash by &amp;Other Stories (H&amp;M's high-end Meibao brand)   I like the design of the pressure head   Very convenient for showering   It smells like heaven   (smell)   Garden-like taste   I am happy to wash this bottle every time   Because he gathered all the breath of spring and summer   And it is very moisturizing and it works well   Let me feel fresh   It also makes me very fragrant   So, I love to die   Last love item   Is my own product   I try not to over praise   Don't want to make you think "OK, so Le?"   But I really like to use this product   You are probably not too surprised   I just recently   run out   Completely empty   To replenish again   This is Scooper Dooper   Listed around the end of last year   Around September and October   This is bubble bath soap   The reason for designing the barrel   Because I like it   Put it under running water like this   Or like this with a hand   Digging the right amount of bubble bath soap   Then put it under running water   But honestly   I haven't used other products that can produce so many bubbles like this output   This super bubble   In fact recently   Compared to a colorful bubble bath, I'm quite used to bubble bath   The recent pursuit of bubble bath   Who knows me is in a bubble   This is why I use light to make a full bucket   Loved it, and its fragrance   Still the most loved fragrance I've developed   and   Bubble production is amazing   Fresh and easy to use, leaving skin super soft   I love it very much   This month I have love supplies?   You're right   I recently started watching the first episode of The Only Way Is Essex in the first season (British Album)   From the very beginning   I have forgotten   How funny is this   How addictive   How good is it?   So I look again this month   A few years ago this part was replayed   And someone is ringing   Why is it always right now?   (angry)   Before the doorbell rings again   I want to end the video quickly   I hope everyone likes   As usual, please leave a message to tell you your favorite this month   I like to read your message   Always makes me happy   Thank you for your support   Like this video please click Like and remember to subscribe   Please also turn on push notifications   We will meet you next time   BYE!  
 Hello all! Today I am going to do my July favorites   I know it's a bit late to do my favorites, but for the first time this year   I have not forgotten'   but I just wanted to, I do not know, upload other things.   And then many of you said 'Where is your July favorites video?'   And I was like 'Oh my God, I forgot to do a July favorites.'   So I'm going to do it today!   I never know if you like these kind of videos, I do not - I mean, I've been doing them for years.   Personally, I like to watch them because you can really see what other people like   and use. I'm just checking, do you still like them? Do not you still like them?   It feels strange not to upload one, I could not just leave it.   Even though I'm a bit late, I can not just leave it alone.   So I do not know, let me know what you think.   July feels so long ago, I do not know- * phone rings * AAAH!   Sorry. Where do I begin? Oh, I will start with facial care.   Item number one: these are First Aid Beauty Skin Rescue Blemish Patrol Pads.   That is quite a mouthful. Helps prevent pustules, remove excess oils and minimize the visibility of pores.   So these are about the same as acid wipes, you know that I love them.   I have tried to make them a staple of my facial care routine and I really notice the difference.   In essence an exfoliant, but in the form of a chemical cloth.   You just rub it on your face after you have cleaned and then you can continue using it   of your oil or your serum and then your moisturizer, and so on and so on.   I really like this, I have the feeling that these have really purified my skin in certain zones.   They smell a bit like 7up, left on the side, with a little bit of acid.   I have never used anything from the First Aid Skin Rescue series,   but I was really impressed and they also say that they are 'safe for sensitive skin'.   The next thing I love and what I use on my skin is this, which is a face mask   and it is the Yes To Tomatoes Combination Skin Detoxifying Charcoal Mud Mask.   I really like this Yes To series, I use quite a lot of their shower gels   and I put them in a few of my favorites videos.   Many of their products are based on very natural ingredients, so if that is something you are rather crazy about   then I think you'll really like this. So it says that 96% are natural ingredients, without parabens.   I like a good face mask, I have five that I use often   and it has made it into my most important face masks.   I love that it dries very hard on your face, it does that whole facial cracking   where you and your girlfriend have a face mask and you both start to * talk like this *   otherwise your face will just start peeling off.   If you like a good face mask, especially if you like a good charcoal face mask,   I think you'll really like this.   For the make-up, this I wear for a month and half on my eyes.   This is the Charlotte Tilbury Color Chameleon in Bronzed Garnet, which is actually meant for   green eyes, but what is on the packaging is not always how you should use it!   They do a lot of different series, specifically for different eye colors, to make them more or less stand out.   So this is essentially intended to make green eyes look beautiful and green.   There is also one that I have for blue eyes, but that is more of a kind   cooler tinted taupe-like color, I think. I have him upstairs, I just do not really use him as much as this one.   This one, I think the color is really beautiful, it is a beautiful one, it is almost a bronze-like berry color and   it is so beautiful. The only thing I'm going to say is that if you do this too quickly, air is caught under the cap   and it, and the cap goes off. So- I thought I had a spider on my arm, that is not the case.   I'm not sure what that was, but if you're in a hurry and you get this and you throw it in your bag, the cap   falls off, so you have to be aware of that because otherwise it will dry out.   As long as you keep grinding it, it's all good. I actually apply this on my eyelid,   up to the fold, a little underneath and I pick up a blending brush like the 217 from MAC   and I just blend it until I think it looks semi-okay.   And that's what I have on my eyes today. I have lived in it, it is so good for when you are in a hurry.   It is so fast, it is so easy and I think it looks beautiful.   Bronzer! I have a new bronzer that I really like, this is the YSL Bronzing Stones Sunkissed Glow Creator.   'Effortlessly blendable and undetectable powder.' It is essentially a bronzer, but I would lie if I did not   put in my favorites because I use it often. There is also another that has something   lighter color is, which I also use all the time, but I feel that this is something more beautiful for the summer   and it has a very subtle shine. I just think it blends very well,   they are not real, so pigmented that you do it up and think 'oh my god, okay now I need another one   take a brush to blot it out. ' It is actually the perfect amount and I feel that it gives a very nice depth   makes the face and the warmer and it is YSL so I just love the packaging.   So, a lip product that I love is this one, which is by Miss Tanya Burr and it is the   Martha Moo Matte Lip. I love this, I am so glad that Tan has released it while I have this one   love to have matte lip creams and matte lip lips - matte lip lipsticks - matte liquid lipsticks.   The consistency of this reminds me a bit more of that of Revlon, which feels rather light   and almost knocked and I really like that because it makes fitting very easy.   I feel that you should not be as precise with this as you would for a Colourpop, which is much more fluid   which is the reason why I have this in my handbag since I have it because it is just that easy to apply   It is a very nice color, I like that it is rather dark pink. I do not really have- I do not really have a tendency to wear a lot of roses   at the moment I like more nudes and neutral colors, but I feel that this is somewhere in the middle   which is the reason why I like it so much. So thanks T!   So this is an Alien perfume and Mark actually gave me this as a present simply because he was the nicest   person in the world. He gave it to me and he said "if you do not like it, I understand it completely bla bla bla   I know that smell is something, you know a preferred thing is' and Mark is almost the king of scents.   He knows his business just when it comes to smells, so I had absolutely no doubts that what he had chosen for me   anyway a good smell would be. When I sprayed it, I was from 'Holy crap, this smells like nothing I do   have ever smelled. " Alien scents can be quite strong and quite predominant, but I do not feel like that   this is one of them. This is going to be my autumn / winter scent. I have inhaled the net- it smells good.   It has an undertone, you can certainly smell the vanilla and the amber, it really is, it smells almost a bit   creamy, but it also has much deeper notes that make it a bit more of an evening, kind of autumnal perfume.   I really like it, so thanks to Mark!   Books! Here are two books that I wanted to put between my favorites because I read them when I went on vacation   and I had to talk about it because they were so good. The first book is Jennifer Nivens   Holding Up The Universe, which has not yet officially been released, but I think it will be released in October.   So you do not have to wait long. I love Jennifer Niven, I love her voice and her tone and I just become   completely sucked into her books. Love it. So this is about a girl named Libby who is known within the   community and online because a video has gone viral because she is the thickest girl in America and it's also about a boy   called Jack who prosopagnosia (I think that's how you pronounce it) has what the inability to   to recognize faces and it sounds like a very crazy story if you say so, but they two meet and it goes almost   through the journey of those who help each other. It was so good! I loved this so much that I did not want to   that it ended. I did that thing on vacation that I was almost at the end and I was' I do not want to read it, I just want to   enjoy.' It was so good and I strongly recommend that you read it when it suits.   The following is Gone Girl, of which so many people had said that I had to read it so I took it on vacation and I   thought, "Yep, you know what, I'm going to read it." I was addicted, this book is a page turner. I really wanted to   do not talk to anyone for about 3 days because I was so preoccupied with this book and I loved every second of it.   The pace was very fast, a lot happened. For those of you who do not know Gone Girl, it's about Nick Dunne, who   discovered that his wife is missing and it actually follows what happens next. I do not really want to   give something away. I think that for those of you who have not read or seen the movie, then you must   certainly read the book first. So I know that many people have very mixed opinions about the end and me   must say that I was a little disappointed with the end. I feel that the end is the most realistic   and I understand why the end is so, but I think I expected something different in my head and that   something else never happened so I was a bit of 'Ohh.' Anyway, it did not change how much I love the book and   After I had read it, I was immediately downloading Gone Girl on my laptop to watch in bed that night.   I really liked it and I really liked the film.   So this is a bit random, but I wanted to put it in my favorites because I still love it and I already wanted it   talking about it to you for a while. This is a dog shampoo, now, in my puppy video there were many   questions such as' What shampoo do you use? ',' Which toothpaste do you use? ',' Which sweets do you give   dog?' Bla bla bla bla. I have the feeling that I can make a whole other video about it, but one thing that I really wanted to talk about   talking, but had no time for that video was my love for this dog shampoo. I never had of it   the brand heard and they sent me a few of these to my PO box so that I would try them, of course no obligation   they were just friendly. So the brand is Scruffy Chops and what intrigued me quite a bit   this is to begin with that I really love the packaging, they are in a peg-like bag with a cap here.   Love it! I love the brand name: Scruffy Chops is so cute, but also the smells they have for dog shampoo   made me more enthusiastic than I should be for a shampoo for my dog. So I think she's me   Marshmallow, Chocolate have sent and something, I have forgotten, maybe grapefruit and then Are You Barking Mad?   or Are Rhubarking Mad? I love rhubarb, I love the smell of rhubarb. I do not really eat a lot of rhubarb, but I do   really like the smell of rhubarb. I have the feeling that I have said rhubarb many times, and it is also very natural, so it is one   natural mineral shampoo for dogs with a yummy touch of rhubarb, with dead sea and oatmeal facial care.   So that's all very good for your dog, nothing in it that calls a little- OOH! The last handful of times I   Nala I have washed it and I smell it every time because she smells so good after I have her   crops. I have to give her a bath then, so I'm going to use this, which is why I picked it up and   I was from 'I have never talked about it before!' But then, if you have a dog ... I mean everyone washes his dog once   sometimes. So you can do equally well with something that smells absolutely delicious! I love it for a moment   I am passionate about talking about a dog shampoo when I am talking about a lipstick.   So the other thing I'm really obsessed with is this, which is a Bath &amp; Body Works candle called Leaves.   Now, this is actually from last year, it was in a drawer here and we recently had a really miserable day   on which it was dark and gloomy, and I took this candle up and I lit it and suddenly became   my mood lifted by about 100%. It did not matter to me that it rained because I had my Leaves candle and it smells   like autumn and I'm so fricking excited! You know how much I love autumn, Halloween and Christmas.   It is my favorite time of the year, I love it when the leaves start to turn orange, I love it when it is   a little cooler in the air, I love autumn fashion, I love cosiness with candles and fires and I just love in general   of autumn. So on the whole miserable day when I was reminded that summer is almost over, I did not really think so   very. I am so ready for the fall and I know so many of you who live in the UK who are from 'No we have a few   had a very good day! Do not wish for summer! " The summer here in the United Kingdom is never really summer, it is summer   such a handful of days and then after that I am so ready for autumn. So this lighting just gave me the best mood   ever, but I have placed a small Bath &amp; Body Works order so I will do a lot of new Bath &amp; Body   Works candles very soon, which I am really looking forward to. But yes, Leaves, possibly one of my favorite autumn   scented Bath &amp; Body Works candles. Smells so good! Oh is that all? No! One more thing. I feel that most of you in the meantime   have already seen or are considering to see it or have heard so much about it   and are not interested and do not want to see it, but Stranger Things on Netflix is ​​so good!   It has everything I like: placed in a cool era, 80's, fantastic, very good soundtrack, I mean when it's placed in the   80s the soundtrack is going to be good because they are real 80s vibes, great actors and actresses,   Winona Ryder and the children who act in it are all so good, I love it and it is also pretty scary and you know how much   I love scary things, there were even a few episodes and a few moments in the series where   even I was a bit like 'I'm glad I'm not just watching this.' So without giving too much price, it's an eight-part   thriller series on Netflix and it's just that good. If you need a TV program to watch or maybe you do not need one, but   you know you're going to look at it in the end, I would definitely recommend Stranger Things. It was   really really great.

hello everyone so in today's video I am doing a little bit of a Christmas easy DIY home touches little things you can do that you might not have thought about video I don't think it's gonna be called that in the title but that is essentially what it is as you know Christmas is one of my most favorite times of the year in terms of content to watch everyone's moods decoration music films food it's basically just the best time of year and one of the things I also really love about Christmas is getting a bit crafty and making your space feel festive and putting your stamp on things and I have a few little things that I have done this year that I really really wanted to share with you one of the first things I am going to share with you is drying oranges now this is something that my mom always used to do and I remember the house smelling amazing it's so so simple as well and it's not only just the best to fill your home with the scent of like orange and like Christmas loveliness but it's also great to use for decoration all you will need are some oranges you can go for some big ones and some slightly smaller ones it's quite nice to have a bit of a variation and you just want to slice these then using kitchen roll or a kitchen towel or a tea towel or you can just leave them out if you have a little bit more time to do it you basically want to get as much of the orange juice out as possible because the whole idea is that you're drying out the oranges and so if you can take out a little bit of excess juice before you put them in the oven then that does make it a little bit easier so you just want to kind of like dab them and press the paper down don't push too hard like don't like completely mash them up but you just want to try and get rid of any of the juice you don't want to get a baking tray and a sheet of baking paper on the top and you just want to lay out your oranges ready to go into the oven I'm actually using my auger for this this is like the first thing I'm actually putting my auger and in the lowest temperature oven so it's not the warming oven but it's the one just above that I'm still learning how to use my auger if you don't have an auger basically you don't want to burn them you don't want them to go crispy so you need to set your oven to a very low temperature you don't want them to come out of the oven and look like weird orange crisps so very very low heat I would say like a hundred degrees centigrade or just a very low gas mark you basically want to leave them in there for a couple of hours you can keep on checking on them and seeing you know how they're getting on but that is basically it and then once they are done you just want to take them out leave them to cool down maybe to dry out a little bit more and then you can use them to your heart's content this kind of segues into my next little DIY fun section homey homey DIY section and that is styling up your mantelpiece there are so many different ways to do this and everyone has their own kind of decor style so this is just how I've done one of mine I have actually got multiple fireplaces and you bet I'm gonna decorate each one it's not gonna be any fireplace in my house that doesn't have something on it I like to start by buying like a garland so you can get these pretty much anywhere or you can make them yourself with real foliage or you can buy real foliage especially around the start of December they start selling them in the places where you buy your Christmas trees from and you can buy the stuff in like big old bundles so you can get things like holly ivy and also just bits of like Christmas tree and you can do it that way which I have done previous years it just doesn't seem to last as long and it starts to look quite limp quite quickly so it depends what kind of style you're going for does smell amazing though I have to say the smell of those is great I think closer to Christmas I will probably go and get some like cuttings and distribute those around the house but for now I thought it was best to stick with a garland that was not real so that it would actually last until Christmas this one I got from John Lewis and it has copper baubles on it acorns and it's really nice and festive and I really liked it but it is nice to personalize it and customize it a little bit more to fit with the rest of the room that you are putting it in I used these little gold fern leaves which I also got I'd get me some thyme nervous I think I did but you can buy like things like this from hobby craft garden centers you name it this time of year someone will have it and I just cut these up and place these amongst the garland I also used my dried oranges and popped these in as well just because they smell amazing and they look really fast 'iv and I think they give it like that little bit of Christmas touch I always think if you've got a mantelpiece you need some candles so I've got these candlesticks that I've popped on the end there's nothing like an authentic candle on a mantelpiece to really put you in a cozy mood and then these two little I think they're gnomes but at this time of year I think they pass as little father Christmas's we're actually a housewarming gift from a friend who made these herself and they are the cutest thing I've ever seen and they sat proudly on the other end of the mantelpiece I would absolutely love to see how you guys style up your mantel pieces at this time of year everyone has like a different theme some people keep it quite subtle some people go a bit more likes candy some people love like the whole shebang lights the biggest Garland's you've ever seen massive bull balls like I'd love to know what your style is also tag me in some pictures because I'd love to see the next fun little idea I had was to get a bit crafty with Christmas photos I'm hugely sentimental and I love photographs anyway and my phone is full of Christmas photos over the years that I've never really printed and done anything with because I kind of just like look at them every now and then when I'm like scrolling back through and I'm like oh memories so I thought it would be really nice as I am doing this video with HP who I actually talked about last year this is the HP sprocket and it is a little printer that you can print from an app from your phone print out these adorable little photos but this year they have this really cool limited edition gift box which would be the perfect gift since Christmas is coming inside it you get the actual sprocket which I have out because I've been using it this adorable little case so that you can keep it protected in your handbag this really cute little photo album so you can stick your photos in there and you also get the photo paper which I have used up you can also design your own personal skin that you can stick to the sprocket which i think is so cool you can personalize it you can use any photo you like and stick it on your actress pocket so using the sprocket I printed out lots of the photos on my camera roll it's super easy there's no ink required and I love this idea so you can either attach your Christmassy photos on a piece of string or a piece of tinsel if you're going to go for tinsel on your tree and you can just attach them randomly onto the tinsel or onto the string with some pegs I have these cute little father Christmas pegs which I think I got from Tiger but you can use like anything really or if that is not an option for you maybe you don't have as many that you can string on a garland you can just peg them straight on to your tree which I actually ended up doing because I thought this looked so cute and it's nice that all those photos have lovely Christmas memories for me so every time I look at that Christmas tree now it makes me feel more like 10 times more festive because I actually remember the Christmassy moments that are on the tree I feel like this is definitely something going forward I can keep adding to every year you can just keep adding the photos that you have of Christmas going it's great I love it and because these photos can also be used as stickers I thought it would be perfect for putting on presents so I do like getting quite crafty for Christmas presents and going like all out with different wrapping papers but there is something quite nice about just using brown paper and doodling with a sharpie I mean until I filmed this video I thought I wasn't okay like doodler turns out I suck so I would advise that you have some sort of plan of what you're gonna draw or maybe like repetition would be quite nice or maybe you're just like a much better drawer than I am but I really loved sticking on the photos so for Papi's present I used a photo of me and papi last year when we went to buy our Christmas tree and for Jose I put a picture of me Joe and Nala when we were visiting my dad last Christmas and then I just doodle over them and ruined it but I feel like your designs could be a lot cooler I think it's just a really nice interesting way of having that person know that that present is from you because you're also in the photo and you know that that present is a hundred percent for them but you don't have to like try and find like a tiny gift tag where someone's put like a P from Zed you know what I mean it's very visual like it's very like this is your present from me because here we are buying our Christmas tree last year I hope you like it I also just really like what this looks like I think it looks very sleek and it's very easily portable you can also get this in black and red but that is sold like individually the one in the gift box which personally I do think is the prettier one is is this one I feel like this is one of those gadgets where you're like you never know you needed it until you had it and then you will then you felt that everyone else should have one do you know what I mean I have persuaded so many friends to buy these in fact I bought one of these for Mark for Christmas last year so there you go the next thing that I thought was worth mentioning was also something that I love doing I love like making little personalizable things for friends and family and the first thing that I have done and this is because a lot of my friends are coming to stay it towards the end of November and we're having like a pre Christmas Christmas and I'm so excited about it we're doing Secret Santa so that's like one present per person but because they're coming to stay at my house I wanted to make it feel special and kind of like we were all actually having a Christmas so I really hope they don't watch this video as this is gonna really ruin the surprise oh well so what I have done is I bought these stockings you can buy cheaper stockings and then you can either stitch if you're like very like handy and you have like sewing machine and you love things like and you have a bit more time I would totally recommend either making the stocking from scratch it's a pretty simple template and you can get quite creative with which fabrics you want to use or you can buy a stocking and then stick on some lettering so last year although it was a year before two years ago myself and Alfie bought big red fluffy stockings for his family and we actually bought iron-on gold letters and we spent Christmas Eve ironing on everyone's names letter by letter and that was actually really fun and I like doing things like that because it gives it a really nice like personal touch this year I found personalized letter stockings on Matalin and they were only eight pounds so I was like oh that's actually a really good price I quite like the look at these so I picked up one for every initial of my friends and I started thinking about what I could put in there this is also a really great idea for a Secret Santa because if you know the person but you don't know too much about them and you have like a certain budget it's quite nice to buy like a couple of little things to put inside something like that so if you had a Secret Santa and the budget was twenty you could spend eight on the stocking and then fill it with lots of other little bits and pieces so for my friends I bought them a small bottle of Prosecco because nothing says Christmas like a little glass of bubbles and I also put some chocolate pennies in there I've just I just feel like you can't do a stocking without using chocolate coins I feel like that's like Christmas like sacrilege so chocolate coins went in then I also bought little selection packs now growing up I always had selection boxes in my sacks we always had sacks we never had stockings and those were like the first thing you pulled out and like all day you would keep going back to your selection box and being like which chocolate bar shall I eat next I don't know whether that's a thing with everyone but that's certainly like a thing with me so I thought I would share that joy I also bought five different Christmas lush bath bombs and I placed these in tiny little Christmas treat bags and sealed them with a sticker so that each person has a different bath bomb I also bought novelty hats I've remembered I bought some really funny novelty hats from Asda and I was gonna put a different one in each stocking also so that when people are going through their stockings they have something funny to put on and next year no doubt those are the photos that will be going up on the tree alongside all the other ones the next thing is staircases now I know not everybody decorates their staircase but for me I feel like this was always a very exciting part to decorate I just remember being a child and walking down the stairs on Christmas morning and like all the lights are twinkling on the stairs and you just would be so excited to walk into the living room and see what was underneath the Christmas tree and I don't know why but I just think the staircase is just a great place to decorate most years I've just put garlands on the staircase with fairy lights but last year I was reading a Christmas magazine it was after Christmas and there was a photo in it of a staircase a really like lovely grand staircase in like a Edwardian style property and they had huge big white paper decorations going up the banister and I remember thinking oh my god that looks amazing I wonder if I can do that in the new house when we have Christmas there what I stupidly didn't do is take a picture of it so I've kind of had to go from memory but I just love what it looks like it's quite out there I do feel like if you don't feel so brave you don't have to do as many or you could mix it up and use lots of different colors I did see one on Pinterest where they'd used black and green as well as white and that looked really cool especially if you have like a theme running through your house and also paper decorations are not too expensive you can even make some of them yourself if you have the time or if you have the skill I feel like it's a really easy quick way yet it looks really effective and it looks like someone's come into your house and done it for you and I really really like doing it I think it looks amazing I think this is the best my stairs have ever looked at Christmas time and that makes me really happy and last but by no means least is a Christmas Eve box ice so many people doing these mostly for their children but I think that there is scope to create adult ones for sure normally every Christmas Eve we have our tradition of matching pajamas slippers or cozy socks dressing gowns and I guess that's mostly where we get to but I thought it would be nice since we're doing Christmas at our house this year to lay out a box for each person with their pajamas with some cozy socks with a dressing-gown then I also thought about other things I could incorporate into that which were very like Christmas Eve so in this box I've also put the night before Christmas book which i think is very apt I'm not expecting Alfie's dad to whip that book out and sit there reading it but I think if you're creating this for one person and that works really nicely or if it's someone that's a bit younger putting that book in is really really cute then I think it is very important to have a Christmas mug and some form of hot chocolate you can buy the cute little sachets and if you know what someone's favorite hot chocolate is you can put those inside the mugs for each person and I also got some decorate your own gingerbread because who doesn't want to decorate a gingerbread man on Christmas Eve I feel like it's perfect whilst you are decorating your gingerbread man you could have a Christmas film on I want to try and get everyone's favorite Christmas film whether they get time to watch it that evening or not I think it would be nice for all of us to have a different one and for us to decide which one we watch or just for them to keep and have next year since I want to try and get people's favorite Christmas film I popped arthur christmas in mine because i think it is an amazing amazing film highly recommend seeing that if you haven't seen it yet Terry's chocolate orange like you it's not Christmas unless you've got a Terry's chocolate orange so I had to put one of those in there also some chocolate coins because again I don't feel like you can do a Christmas hamper or a Christmas stocking without adding chocolate coins and then last but by no means least I had this idea where everyone has like their top three four favorites from every select action of Christmas chocolates so we have celebrations miniature heroes quality streets and roses and those are like the top four that kind of most households will have at least one or two of these tins in that house of course I've gone overboard and I've bought all four but that is also because I really wanted to pick each person's favorite now it might require a little bit of like detective work or if you just know someone really really well I guess it's the ultimate test to know which ones are their favorites from each each tin so I've picked out a couple that I know someone would like and pop them in a little treat bag and sealed it with a sticker and also put that on there because there's also not enough chocolate in this box I just thought it would be nice to eat those whilst watching the Christmas film in our matching PJ's our comfy socks our dressing gowns I do feel like half the fun of Christmas is Christmas Eve so I really like making that a huge part of the whole Christmas experience and I think the Christmas Eve boxes just give it that like extra personal touch and I just really like them and that is everything that I wanted to share with you today I would absolutely love to know if there's anything that you do around Christmastime kind of like the box or the stockings or ways in which you bring Christmas into your home and get a little bit creative thank you so much for watching give this video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and I will see you again very soon

Merry Christmas oh my god 
hi Nana can't be in every video come on Sofia come on you still recording really for me what it is about people management no hello everybody first of all I want to start by saying happy Valentine's Day or happy Valentine's Day or Valentine's Day there's so many different variations of telling someone you love them today what else or if you're single it doesn't matter it's just a day I'm wearing my special Valentine shirt for the occasion and this video has nothing to do with Valentine's Day so if you click this thinking I'm so done with Valentines don't worry this actually has nothing to do with Valentine's Day at all just before I start this video I'm just going to throw it out there and say I feel like I look like a sack of poop today so we've gone for a bit more of a code the ambient I've which I actually quite like because this room is like one of the coziest rooms in the whole house and I absolutely love it so I quite like that we channeling more of a 25 but it is also to cover up the fact that I have a chin growing on my chin it's the biggest spot I've ever had in my entire life if I wasn't so like frustrated about it I would be proud of it and quite a while back I asked on Twitter what questions you would love me to answer that I have never answered before or that you would love to know and I saved them all for a special occasion it is definitely going to be a Q&amp;A that spans over a couple of videos because there was so many questions I was like how do you watch answer that and I've never asked that so I'm going to start going through them oh that one's cute I'll come here a sec do you mind just sitting in this second you are like on radio yeah because it's Valentine's Day I have just said this isn't about Valentine's Day it's actually a Q&amp;A but the first question I've gotten here is when did you realize you actually look alpha oh there you go what made it click and I was like you know what Fahrenheit Bay yes answer this together I think I realized I love Alfea when obviously before I moved here because me moving was actually a really big deal like I'd grown up in a tiny village I've never thought I would move so obviously I realized I loved you before that otherwise we would never have moved to Brighton I don't know I think just when I was always thinking about you and always wanted to talk to you because you had never loved anyone before so how did you know well maybe a Randleman gluon dumped me under it I don't know no no I did some trying to think of this answer tonight I'm just like so used to push me in there kind of there mmm let's go come on imagine living in a house without you live in there but then all that you don't have lived with somebody to love them so I don't know so your babies got used to me and thought wow my love and I've been too long now and car back out and stuck I quite like this question it was from Sharla and she said I don't know if anyone has asked it before I would like to know which dream of yours you remember the clearest when I was a teenager I used to have this dream that I was a witch my mum was a witch and my mum's month and my mam was a witch as well and it was so vivid and I used to have it so much and I really enjoyed it because in the dream we all had brooms and we could fly and I just remember dreaming it and feeling like I could actually fly and then waking up the next day being like if I really concentrate I think I can fly like it was the wig and a teenager at this point so I know I can't fly but it just felt so real and I have that dream so many times I've never had like repeat dreams apart from that one and also tsunamis which I guess is a nightmare but I used to dream that a lot like at least once a week I would dream that me my mum and my nan were witches and we were good witches not bad witches and we could fly on brooms and no one else knew and it was like this family secret that we had and it was just the best thing ever though Ivana said why don't you have your own gaming channel I actually do like gaming maybe not kind of more of like the console sense but I really like playing PC or Mac games things like Sims I could spend hours and hours on Sims I love watching Sims gaming and I play that without E but I did actually try and film my own gaming video and it didn't go down very well I was trying to a steam Hospital because it's one of my favorite games ever I just there's not very many people online mcplayer and i was like i'm going to try and i was going to upload it on my second channel or alby's gaming channel and I can't remember which but when I'm actually playing the game I'm not very good at commentating over it so because I concentrate so much on the game I don't actually speak so this whole episode that I filmed which must have been about 40 minutes long I feel like I didn't have much kind of charisma or character and I was like no one's going to watch this and I'm not being very entertaining and all I'm really doing is filming myself playing a game and not saying anything so that is why I don't have a gaming channel and I think if I was to film Sims without Alfie he wouldn't remind me to talk I would just get so into it but it's good that there's two of us in film it because he reminds me I need to actually talk Heather said if you could go back and change one thing that has happened to you what would it be I think this is quite deep question because even though there are certainly things in my life has not enjoyed or things that I sort of feel like I would do a little differently ultimately I do believe that everything happens for a reason and that bad things happen so good things can happen after it and that the bad things kind of show the value of the good things and when I think of it like that I think I wouldn't change anything but if we're getting like down to the nitty-gritty there are certainly things I'm like why didn't I do this or why did I part with that or why didn't I say this but then I'm like if I didn't would I be here today would I be sat in this video in my house in Brighton like I don't know Holly said what does it actually like to be reported about in the news about every little thing you do on the ground scheme of things I don't get written about as much as you know actual like celebrities and people that have like interesting life I don't know like if I've been completely honest I hate it if we're just going to strip this down and talk you know one to one I really don't like it I love being online I love having control over everything I can post I love you guys and everyone that watches and get involved and I like that I have built my own community and we could talk about what we wanted and I'm so fortunate in the sense that there are so many of you and it's kind of like we created our own little like I don't know I feel like youtubers and like the online space don't see traditional media in that same way we don't need traditional media to tell a story because we can do that ourselves and so I think sometimes when I'm trying to tell my story and they go oh this is kind of interesting let's worry about this and it doesn't always spin what I've said in a positive way just to get clicks it's really weird to get my head around because I think also a lot of people forget that when I started this there was no oh but if my channel grows to this size then the press will be interested and there'll be people stopping in the street and you'll go to signings and you'll do signatures and you could be sat in a restaurant with your family and someone will come up and ask you for a video message for the best friends like I didn't know what could ever be if that makes sense there was no one that was already experiencing all of this and if there was I wasn't aware of them so it was all very new I had to learn very quickly how to kind of balance that because ultimately all I really wanted to do was film videos for an audience of people online and it hadn't really occurred to me that if that audience grew on a much much larger scale that that would change the way I lived my life offline if that makes sense I feel like quite a lot of the time people will say you know I'll but you know it's just part of it it's part of it but when a lot of YouTube has started it wasn't part of it and it's something that people have had to learn to deal with and kind of learn to slot into they're like everyday lives and it is scary daunting unpredictable but there are also really amazing aspects of that as well because it means I get to actually meet you guys if 10 year old you could see you now how would she feel I don't know this one that hard one because I feel like I have pinch me moment all the time I don't take any of this for granted and it still surprises me on a weekly basis but I am doing the things that I'm doing and that my life has gone this way and so I don't even think 10 year old Zoe would ever think that 26 year-old Zoe would be doing all the things he's doing I don't know have any friends ever left you / judged you because of your career I think anyone that's ever had an issue with it or not understood it or kind of turned a blind eye or mocked it which I definitely did have when I first started doing this but it was all very indirect those people weren't ever really friends and then not my friends now if that makes sense like those kind of people I knew starting our relationship online is daunting and because of the size of the audience you are aware of people kind of judging your every move and kind of taking what they want from certain things and that's just what happens but so much of the time it's so focused on relationships when actually I think it can be just as difficult having friendships online especially if both other people aren't too sure about you know being online or being on camera or if they have channels themselves and they're not sure if they want to be in your videos or kind of what can come from that and it can be it can make me quite paranoid because I want people to be my friend for me not for anything else and I have disliked time where I was like no one's going to want to be my friend because they're not going to want to be on my channel like how daunting is that going to be or they're not going to want to hang out with me because they're going to think I'm a certain way when I'm not or I don't know it I honestly think I wish more people would like to talk about this a bit more because it is so like relationship focus like what's it like having a boyfriend that daily vlogs and what's it like you know having a relationship online but you don't really talk about kind of friendships or building friendships or not knowing if someone really wants to be your friend or dozen and that is like a whole thing in itself I'm like a super trusting person I basically just trust everybody and like welcome anyone with like open arms and I think at one point I was a bit like maybe I shouldn't be doing this I don't know I was really like questioning it and I was like what do people want from me I don't know but all the friends I have now are so supportive and so lovely whether they're youtube friends or non YouTube friends and I think some of them still find it kind of weird like I was with some of my friends recently actually was like last year and I was putting petrol in the car and someone was like screaming like so lraa my friend is like I find it so weird because come you're not zoella to me or just Zoey and it's kind of like that kind of clicking in and out of like oh yeah that's that's what you do and that's like your work thing but I know you have like Zoey when if you decide that you wanted to live on your own out of your family house and wonder if scary or an easy decision growing up I always thought I would live in my tiny village for the rest of my life I couldn't imagine ever moving away ever in fact me and my friend who we live quite close to one another we were always like oh we need to stay in this village forever and you know you'll have a house there and I'll have a house there and our kids will go to the same primary school and we'll stay here and pretty much all my family lives kind of like 10 minutes around me and I just thought that's where I would always be and I'm definitely a home comforts girl which you all know and I didn't really do a lot of traveling in fact before I did YouTube I think the only places i've ever visited was the maldives on a family holiday and portugal i have no desire to travel the world I just wasn't really interested in and I loved being at home I loved being on my family I loved my tiny little village life and I I think I couldn't imagine a different life to that if that make sense but when I started doing YouTube I massively grew in confidence even more so off camera than on camera I think like my parents will agree with me here that I started going to London to events and for me that was like terrifying I was getting the train to London I was making new people I was going to events and meetings and I was filming collabs with like markers in Bristol and I've never driven to Bristol on my own even though it wasn't that far away but I drove across Bristol to go and hang out with Marcus and Naomi and I filmed with Marcus and and then I started going to conventions in like Florida and LA and Milan and like all these different places and I think that made me see that the world was a lot bigger than just my village which I still absolutely love but when I met Alfie and I came to Brighton on the train I remember getting off the train just being like I love this city I instantly felt like I could live there and I've never felt like that about any other place I've ever visited in my life and the minute I got off a train I was like this is a really nice place I feel really comfortable here I really love it in fact the only other place I feel like I have felt like that is Edinburgh I'm not going to move to had a brother don't worry and obviously as me and Alfie were dating seeing each other going out whether I used to drive to see him like every week and that's like a two and a half hour drive and I was doing that like every week twice a week and every time I was in Brighton it just felt more and more comfortable and more and more like home and so eventually I was like I kind of want to be here like I love to see I love that there's the countryside and I've done this drive so often now it doesn't feel far if that makes sense like the more I've done it the more it didn't feel far away I knew obviously I wasn't going to be living with my dad and my brother for the rest of my life and I was starting to think about where do I want to move out and as I was kind of making these decisions I was listing writing a lot and I was like I think I just want to move to Brighton I didn't want to move straight in with Alfie because I think packing up your whole life and moving like two and half hours away is already like a big deal maybe not to everyone but it certainly was to like this country bumpkin um so I moved into my own place obviously at me and our fee for each other every single day and he may as well have lived with me but I still like that I made that step on my own and I was renting that place and it had all my things in and I think living there made me realize that this is where I want to be and then me and Alfie moved in together and the rest is history did that right I feel like one of them are there any youtubers that you hate or dislikes but don't want to say anything or hurt anyone's feelings I really could dish the dirt here but it's not my kind of vibe so all I'm going to say is yes there are some really not very nice people who make youtube videos who I would be more than happy to never see ever again or cross paths with but that's the same for everything in life if you work in an office you're not going to like everyone you work with and YouTube is a place for anyone to upload videos and there are hundreds and thousands of people don't make videos so I think it's only right that someone not the sort of people that I would like and the only people I don't like are people that have been rude or unnecessarily bully-ish towards me or my friends but don't ask just to same for anything there's people like that in school who are just not very nice it just so happens that some of those people have created YouTube channels but yeah I'm not going to say names because that's not my style but you never know Never Say Never how does it really feel to date someone almost four years younger than you I don't really think about it too much because I'll see it's actually quite a mature 23 year old c-23 I think I'll see is quite a mature 23 year old and I'm quite an immature 26 year old so I think somewhere we balance out and it's absolutely fine I never even think about the fact that he is younger than me in that sense and I think as we get older the gap kind of closes anyway the only time it's really obvious is when I'm going oh my god do you remember that program and he's like no I watched this and I'm like oh my god like I can't believe you were watching that when I was watching that because I feel like when you're much younger that age gap is much bigger but apart from that I don't really think about it if you're high metabolism were you ever bullied or had hate about it if so how do you deal with it I have a high metabolism - yes in answer to that I have had pretty much my whole life I've never been bullied wouldn't say I've ever been bullied about it but people make remark even now oh no I think up until the point I realized it wasn't okay and it was making me feel bad which must have been around 18 19 I didn't think too much about it I just used to laugh also be like family members or like friends or like people in school would say things like you're so skinny likewise you're skinny or you should put some meat on those bones or come on finish up you need to eat you you need more pies like you name it I've heard it actually both myself and Joe and my mom and dad are very like petite people I wouldn't say it completely changed the way I viewed myself because I was always quite happy with my body and it was only when people would make the remark that I would go oh like a mighty skinny do my collarbone stick out like am I too bony I want to see it I want to look how people think I should look it wasn't even about me it wasn't that I would look at myself and be like I think I'm too skinny it was that other people saying these things made me feel like I should put weight on for them I don't know I never have that same like view of myself that everybody else had so I felt like I needed to please them rather than pleasing myself I would say the only time I was very self-conscious about my body was when I got boobs and a bum but was like so skinny basically my boobs my bum came at the same time I've got the stretch marks to prove it because they didn't gradually go there they just was there and I had reached like my peak height but I was still really skinny and it just I think at that point I looked at myself and I was like my proportions don't feel right I don't feel comfortable like this and then as I got older I sort of like evened out a bit more but I do still get it in fact there was one time I was at a party and someone who was like an adult at the time I must have been about twenty-one twenty-two and I know I didn't really know them particularly well came up to me in front of everyone and was like why are you so skinny I was like okay have an art I don't I can't give you an answer to this because it's so uncomfortable and I was like what do you mean and this person was like just so you're too skinny you need to eat and it was really weird because I'd only really had comments like that as I was growing up and I felt like those people were kind of looking out for me or they were like teachers or like I don't know like people that I thought just wanted the best for me but when I'm a 22 year old woman grown woman and someone's still talking to me like that I was a bit like this is not okay like I don't like this this isn't this isn't helpful and this is you're embarrassing me in front of everybody I don't know what to say to you and I also felt like I wasn't entitled to feel like that because I knew people who really wanted to lose weight and I felt like I could have known for being smaller or skinnier I felt like I wasn't allowed to I felt almost like you should you should you you're not allowed to dislike what you look like because there are people who would love to lose weight so therefore you can but actually if you have some form of kind of body image issue or you don't feel very self-confident or there are certain things people say to you about your appearance that really get you you are allowed to feel down about it you're allowed to feel self-conscious about it you're allowed to feel those things because everybody has something that they wish they could change or they don't like or you know one day you might like it the other day you might not and even now I'm on 26 there are there are times I look in the mirror and go where are my tits gone or like why is my buns drooping or why is my skin so bad today like there's always something that someone feels more self-conscious about so you are allowed to have those days and I think I learnt that as an adult I just kind of learned not to care as well as you're happy and you're healthy no one else's opinions matter and I think that's really important to remember and I think I'm going to leave the Q&amp;A there because I've already rambled on for far too long I need to edit this and it's gonna take a while but I really hope you guys enjoyed this kind of more chilled too in a video I've got lots more questions to answer so I'm going to do another one of these quite soon because there are still some great questions that you guys had I really hope you had a lovely day however you sent it I love you anyway so I hope that cancels something and give the video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and I'll see you again very soon guys bye 
 Hello everyone I will show you some of what I do during an ideal evening for relaxation and self-indulgence   The first thing I try to do as part of the evening routine is to close the computer and leave work but it's hard because I work from home   What I will say now depends on how busy I am during the day but overall ...   Best finish at six   Then wear warm pajamas   And tie my hair   I like to put it in an chaotic hairstyle   Sometimes a "pineapple"   And sometimes I just toss it up   I would like to say that I would like to stay away from my way and enough   I love making the bedroom quite warm   So that when I go back to bed   Be welcoming and comfortable   And gives me a more sense of readiness to sleep   And gives me a more sense of readiness to sleep   Nothing worse than entering a dark and cool bedroom   I also think that "Alvi" would be grateful to have these things done to him   The next stage of the evening routine involves my stay running a large number of imaginary lights   Because it is resolved as you know that season again   Where the number of candles and lights doubled   And I do not complain because these things are the most beloved thing to me   My mood depends entirely on what surrounds me   So I like to make my house comfortable and warm during the evening   And if that means spending five minutes opening the lights and lighting the candles, I'll do it with pleasure   Do not you feel that everything is more relaxed when lighting candles and fairy lights?   Do not you feel that everything is more relaxed when lighting candles and fairy lights?   Then prepare myself a drink   In summer it is often lemon juice   But because the weather is cold and winter it is time to prepare herbal tea   I have a distinguished selection   I like Christmas approaching because that means I can take out the cup of the gentle snowman   I like Christmas approaching because that means I can take out the cup of the gentle snowman   In fact, it's the best thing I have   The tea I am currently obsessed with is the Bluebird Tea Company Snowball   Its taste is great   It contains its chocolate and marshmallow and I think it is a wonderful alternative   For those who do not want to drink regular tea and prefer a nice drink during the evening   Choosing an evening snooker depends on your mood or whether you are hungry or not   This evening I chose two pancakes of butter-dumplings   Because December I did not want to eat meat pies with tea?   No "Nala", this is me   He often joins the "Alfi" during this period of the evening   And sit on the couch with a drink and snack and switch our favorite TV programs   We follow what we missed or because that time of year I think it is right ...   Watch classic movies for holidays   One of my favorite movies at all is "The Grinch" and I do not lie ...   If I say I saw him for the eighth time this month   When I shoot these videos, you might think I forced my dog ​​to appear   But believe me, she follows me like a shadow   And you want to be with me wherever you are and so very nice   During or after the film is the time I follow the latest developments   This happens when I'm being harassed checking messages or Twitter   Or be sure to respond to those who need a response   It's the second quick look in the evening so I can stop   If you work from home you will know what I'm saying   It's a time when I'm also following some of my favorite utopians   Take a look at Twitter and the tweets   Or comments or respond to messages which I do a bit of online obligations   So while Nala tries to sit as close to me as possible   Then I removed my mike and I have to say that this is the best time of day for me   First use Clinique Take The Day Off oil   It's amazing to remove makeup and complete the first step of cleaning   This step comes either at the beginning of the evening   And either before going to the pool   And either before I go to sleep or if I feel tired and I'm in trouble   I go to sleep and the makeup residue on my face is stuck alive   I do not advise you to do so I would always recommend removing makeup but I will not lie sometimes I do not get it   Liz Earle Cleanse and Polish   It is a limited product with the smell of Christmas and I certainly love it   Remove it with a wet towel and then turn to "toner"   To do this I used the Sunday Riley's Martian, which I made in cotton fabric and smooth my face   After that, because it was the evening time, I loved completing the process with oil   I am currently using Sunday Riley UFO oil   Which looks scary because it's green but believe me it does not make the face look like a space creature   The next part of the day is something I really like to do when I enter the pool   Which is not surprising to any of you   Use the foam product Lush Magical Christmas bubble wand   And held it under the running water to cause a lot and a lot of bubbles   And because I can not do so, I also used Lush Mistletoe bath bomb   To add a bit of color as I found that it makes the body smell wonderful   Every time I took a bath I came to Nala and got up over my clothes   And that's the most nice thing. Is there someone else who does his dog that?   Then you sleep on my side while taking my bath that is impressive   During that I either read and either follow the videos of others   There is a lot to see now and I think I need a little time to follow   The best time to do that is the plunge   One of my favorite body lotions is Body Shop Spiced Apple   I definitely recommend this if you want something that smells like Christmas   After bathing I wear a pajama for the holidays   It is from Cath Kidston's store that I love completely, it's convenient   I brush my teeth   I think there's no need to explain this Put the putty on the brush and scattered   The next step is to enter the bedroom and remove the headrests and climb onto the bed   Which I am fascinated by now because we bought new mattresses and it seems like sleeping on a giant Marshal   Usually I and "2,000" go to sleep at the same time but I - as you can see - take a video   So I did not force him to wear the tummy and go to sleep   Because my dog ​​is a salt liquid, it follows me every step   Before I go to sleep I put lip balm   This is from the company "Omrvica" I do not know whether it is correct but it is a wonderful ointment   Now all that remains is to extinguish candles and lights   And try to get as good a sleep as possible to receive another busy day   I hope you enjoyed the video.

Do another one! - go on   What was the smell of my Sweet Inspirations collection?   Vanilla? Ginger bread? Marshmallow?   Meat   Uh chicken? Candyfloss?   Popcorn?   My arm is stuck in this position. -You are rubbing it all over my teeth   Rabbit?   The taste? What was the taste? -No the smell   Marzipan   You are very close! -Bakery? Cookies dough?

That is quite impressive. -Not had more since I was reed thatcher   Okay, come on   No, you're too yellow-so I look browner   Do you think someone ever realized how long our necks are   We can take part in the tribes, with those rings around their necks   I was going to say something but I forgot   Joe, you're a great brother, and I'm glad you're here   It now feels like my neck is longer   I can feel it   In my back. -You feel like I have to do this now   Can you give my phone, because that's where the questions are, and he's lying there   Thank you!

In the air, high five! 3 .. 2 .. 1  
hello everybody today I am going to be doing a Q&amp;A because you guys love them I love filming them and I think that makes for a great all-round video words use them I went to Twitter and I asked you guys to ask me lots of questions using the hashtag asked Sawalha as I always do and you gave me some lovely questions so I'm going to go through and answer them for you I have a twitchy eye apologies for the Twitter I will you ever grow your hair long again love you love you too don't know your name every time I watch back old vlogs I'm like oh I hate my long hair like I haven't really seen many pictures of me with long hair where I've actually thought it looked nice isn't that weird because I had it for so long and really liked it yeah when I look back at it now I'm like I just don't it doesn't look good you know so no I'm not planning on growing it I think if I ever want a day with long hair or I fancy having long hair for a bit I think extensions work wonders because they're so thick and lovely it doesn't have that same effect as actual natural hair that gets a bit thin and straggly at the bottom which is for sure what might look like so I think if I ever got bored of short hair I could just put extensions in and I think that that would probably look better than my hair ever did um but no I don't miss my long hair so I'm not planning on growing it anytime seen scroll down your camera roll three times and click on a random picture then explain the picture ok scroll down three times you mean scroll up Oh scroll down but the pictures go up 1 2 3 picture I'm tapping and nothing's happening oh it's just a selfie that's boring I'll do another one ah ok this is a photo I will insert it here this photo is from the other night when I was at poppy and Sean's house with Alfie and we were having like a film night and we got a takeaway and after your poppy fell asleep on me and Shawn took this photo of me underneath them loving life not being able to move do you have any tips on how to get more confident in situations where you have to be social with strangers see sometimes I'm good at this and sometimes I'm bad at this it completely depends on how I feel confidence wise if I'm feeling particularly confident that day I don't find it as difficult if I have a low self-esteem or I'm feeling quite insecure that day I shrivel up inside myself keep my head down and I don't want to speak to anyone I find everything awkward and uncomfortable so I think my first point would be if it's at a party or it's at a meeting or it's an interview or it's a place that you haven't been before or it's like you know an event situation I would say like really pamper yourself take a bit longer picking out your outfit like feel good in yourself I'm a well-put-together person I can do this I always say like makeup is amazing because it just gives people that little bit more confidence that they might not have had before and I feel like this kind of works in the same way just I don't know it just boosts your confidence a little bit so I think spend a little bit longer on you and do the things that you know will make you feel better about yourself and to make you feel more confident I think that will make everything just a little bit easier because oops because you will kind of own the room a little bit more another thing that I can sometimes find quite difficult when meeting new people or being in a room with lots of new people in it and a lot of the time when I'm in that situation a lot of people want to actually speak to me that sounds really big-headed but I just mean it in a way that like if it's an event or something people that I work with or they want to introduce me to people a lot of the time I know people are going to want to speak to me so I have had to kind of put these things into practice and I think I have this thing where I start to feel uncomfortable and I start to like I start to picture me having the conversation with somebody from like an outsider it's like I'm not really there it's like I'm watching it happen and it just feels awkward so I think being engaged in a conversation don't necessarily worry about the fact that this is a new person and don't worry about the judgment or what will they think of me I need to make sure I say the right things I think it's good to maybe have a couple of questions that you like to ask people or find out their interests just be a bit more involved in the conversation because a lot of the time if you're kind of holding back and it's very how you oh great heart yeah and you're kind of already thinking about how to find your friend because it's more comfortable you're never going to enjoy that conversation you really need to think of a couple of questions that you would find really interesting to find out about a new person getting to know new people it's a lovely thing to do and I think the more you kind of worry about it the more the more of like a bad connotation it has and I think trying to make the positive out of meeting new people is always the best way another thing I also think is quite good is if you take somebody that you feel comfortable with with you and talk as a three to start with as long as you challenge yourself a little bit and make sure you're asking questions too and you're not leaving it up to your friend and I think that way it's kind of a win-win for everyone because the new person is also meeting your friend your friend is also meeting the new person and the three of you are getting involved in a conversation and when you feel more comfortable with that you can then do that on your own will you ever do a video on why you don't drink alcohol and has it ever caused you a problem or could you say now cry laughing face I will say now I don't really mind and I don't really have a reason why I don't drink alcohol I just don't I've never really been into it I don't really like the taste of Eddie it kind of weirds me out the something you drink can change your behavior and a lot of the control you have over yourself and I think somewhere inside of me that's a really terrifying thing and it also is quite terrifying for me to watch that happen to other people I'm normally the sober one who makes sure everyone gets home okay and I don't know like I think for a while it was kind of intertwined with my anxiety so I kind of just haven't really ever done it I'm not opposed to a cocktail every now and then I'm not like super like anti alcohol I just don't really drink I much prefer a mocktail to be honest who's the last person you text and what does the text say the last text I sent was to my friend Jay and I said yes of course and then a little dis face and a heart I put sorry I thought I'd reply to you haha can't wait to see you I'm so bad with replying to people I literally went on he sent me a text today and I was like oh my god I thought I'd replied to his previous text turns out I had I'm terrible with communication I just can't do it call me up actually no even then I'm really bad answering my phone I also pretty much at the same time as that text mark a picture of my legs which I had faked hand and I put oops cry laughing faith because they look really Orange the good job you can see my legs right now if you could speak any other language what would it be I feel like I'm I've answered this already or maybe not I can't remember but I think it would either be French because I just feel like it's such a beautiful language and it sounds really beautiful and I've also I've also got a little bit of knowledge on French because I've done it in school and stuff or Italian because again it just sounds amazing when people speak Italian or any language to be honest it just sounds so good and I actually really hate myself a little bit for stopping my French lessons because I really enjoyed them and now if I went to France I feel like I would be able to understand a small fraction of what someone was saying to me I probably won't be able to communicate back and I sure would be able to fully reply which is so frustrating and sad because I did it from like the age of nine to the age of sixteen and I don't know where any of that knowledge has gone it's just gone although it is never too late to learn a language I like this one what is your least favorite thing in your house in terms of rooms the kitchen is probably my least favorite room because I feel like it has so many design flaws I'm getting way too like into this and I um the least favorite thing in my house I don't know I kind of love most of my house I guess hmm the fact that it has no storage and that every single small storage room was turned into a toilet before we moved in possibly I don't really know there's no like items in the house that I don't particularly like because I picked them all do you ever think that YouTube was a bad idea um no I never think it was a bad idea it enabled me to do so much just given me so many amazing opportunities it's led me to have an amazing audience amazing viewers and supporters and readers and I've never thought it was a bad idea at all never even though there are for sure been some things that I found pretty difficult and I never thought it would get to this point in a million years um I've never considered the fact that I probably shouldn't have done it ever Tom bees have barged into your room the thing on your left is your weapon what is it well a plant do you think that would go down well excuse me Nala stop packing yeah make eye contact no she doesn't listen to me she only listens to Alfea when I tell her off he's like okay can you call mark and pretend that you accidentally lost Nala and and you're afraid to tell Alfie he's not I mean I can try he's for sure not gonna believe me at all hello hello are you like aa slight issue can you talk or are you busy yeah I'm just heading out on getting home fun you're right uh not really knowledge like gone she ran out the door I know I don't know what to do like I don't know we've been looking for her we wait for it to come back like what am I gonna tell him jack and then just justify do you not think I would be like crying my eyes out I love Nala Oh bless you love oh my god oh my god divine and help you I'm gonna get you back you know okay all right II love you bye in all seriousness if not I actually did do that I would be sobbing I would be an absolute mess if she ran out the door because that is my biggest fear having a dog is that she is gonna run out into the road right that is enough of that I hope you guys have enjoyed this Q&amp;A give it a thumbs up if you did and if you enjoyed it and if you haven't a great week or a great week and I love you very much and I'll see you again very soon Oh 
[Music] hello today in my video I'm going to be doing a bar and Bodyworks Christmas haul I'm so excited about this and I know you guys really like my Bath and Body Works hauls I am sorry if you cannot get hold but the body works or if you're watching this in the UK and it just makes you really angry because you want them and there's no easy way of getting them but I love them and I can't not share these with you because I smell them for those of you who are confused as to how I get these delivered I've set up an account with a company that folds on packages from America which you can do there are multiple ones that you can choose you just have to kind of search it and find a good one but they basically give you an address in the States and then forward you anything that you order in the States that's how I've done it anyway so first thing is this this is the twisted peppermint scented candle and it has this little polar bear on it I really like the packaging in this one it has a kind of Christmas tree lid all my god smells like candy canes I love it cool peppermint sugared snow vanilla butter cream fresh balsam with a hint of musk oh my god so far so good because that is amazing next up is spiced gingerbread this is I love the packaging of these ones I think these ones are my favorite with the light little illustrations and again it has the silver tree on the top and this one says that it has a notes of spiced gingerbread vanilla icing sparkling cinnamon sugar and fresh ground nutmeg is this going to smell better than my gingerbread candle dies the question oh it's very similar I'll give you that this is kind of more spiced I think it's good though is really good the next one you might notice I've already burnt it I'm sorry I couldn't wait this is tis the season and again this packaging is lovely it has little like bull balls all the way around it I like it oh my goodness this smells like Christmas in a candle this has red apples freshly ground cinnamon and deep green pine it smells like an apple wreath it smells incredible next up we have marshmallow fireside now this isn't specific to Christmas they had this in the kind of more Ottoman sense however my candle fell down in my office and smashed everywhere so when I saw that they had like repackaged it in Christmas packaging I had to get it because I love this smell this has notes of toasted marshmallow smoldering words fire roasted vanilla and crystallized camper next up is a little Thanksgiving one now we don't celebrate Thanksgiving here in the UK but this just looked too cute and it is the sweet cinnamon scent which they seem to put into quite a lot I think some of the Halloween ones had that scent as well harvest pumpkin spiced clove Anila cream and brown sugar look has a turkey on the lid as well aiyaaa Thanksgiving 2016 it says on it cute that would be a lovely gift I mean Thanksgivings gone now so maybe next year I also picked up this one this is flannel now again this comes out in the more kind of autumnal range but I didn't get it this year for some reason and then I saw it in the Christmas packaging and I was like oh I haven't got that yet and I really liked it was Ricky oh it smells like fresh clean man basically notes of crisp winter air bergamot heirloom mahogany and soft musk this is such a fresh clean scent not necessarily one that I would put with Christmas if you're like me you like things to smell Christmasy like the clove and the cinnamon and all that goodness then you might not like this but it's good to burn any time of the year it's very fresh and clean next up is evergreen this has notes of crisp white fir needles forest cedar wood sweet evergreen SAP so I'm assuming this is going to smell like a Christmas tree ah it does smell like a Christmas tree oh that's good that's a good representation of a Christmas tree as well because I feel like that's such a hard smell to get right but that really does smell like it that's nice oh I'm excited about this one this is the hot cocoa and cream scented candle so this has notes of decadent milk chocolate fresh steamed milk and mini marshmallows mmm if you held this under my nose of my eyes shut I honestly would be able to tell the difference between an actual hot chocolate or this candle that's so good I love that okay I need to burn this off for this video I also love this packaging look it has like mittens and everything on it it's just like the cutest little winter scene this is called winter so this has notes of white words pine needles sparkling clementines and spiced clothes Oh oh my god this is my favorite one so far this smells like a garden center at Christmas where you have all the different Christmasy scents I think it's the orange and cloven s that I really love there is something about that more kind of citrusy Christmas smell that reminds me of like my childhood and I think it's because my mum used to dry oranges on the radiators I loved that but then I can also smell the pine needles that's my favorite on so far holy crap that is amazing next up we have maple cinnamon pancakes warm maple syrup fluffy buttermilk pancakes and fresh ground cinnamon I'm assuming this is gonna be quite sweet that might be just a smidgen too sweet for me oh my god very strong and scent though I think I'm going to burn it and see what it kind of smells like when I let it was it called air rate no just let smell circulate the house but actually sniffing it in here whoo if you like your sweet scent though you love that okay this next one is fresh balsam again I love this packaging look it's so pretty I wish I'd got more of these like Christmas presents now oops all okay what's this woodland balsam crisp eucalyptus fir branches and cedar wood this smells like a Christmas tree way more than evergreen if you want something that smells as close to a Christmas tree as possible I think you prefer this one that is a Christmas tree and a candle love that and the last candle is vanilla bean Noel has a little reindeer on it which I really like I love the color frosted glass and founders link sorry cool car this one doesn't really smell of anything this one doesn't smell is strong but it's a very light vanilla resent I think it's one of the those ones that you could light all year round and you wouldn't necessarily know it was Christmas Eve fresh vanilla bean warm caramel whipped cream snow kissed musk and sugar cookies oh it's like a sweet smell although a lot more discreet than the other one so if you prefer sweet smells but not in such a like high intensity you might like that okay so next I bought a lot of shower gels I really like Bath and Body Works shower gel I get through it quite quickly I like putting it in my guest bathrooms however I'm never going to get through all these and I am aware of that so I think some of these will be finding their way into people's stockings this Christmas but I want to show you which one they picked up anyway so we have snowflakes and Kashmir which I have no idea what this is going to smell like okay so this has cashmere cream shimmering vanilla frost Clementine golden amber and caramel walls Oh what does that remind me of it smells like a perfume I used to wear on lights-out oh my god I've just been transported to house parties when I would like sixteen this was amazing okay keeping that one for myself next up is vanilla bean Noel but in shower gel form so this says fashionably warm caramel cookies cookies whipped cream and Sunkist musk I like how the shower gels aren't an exact representation of the candles they always have like a musky undertone which makes them a little nicer to like wash with and have on your body not sure about that one it's very sweet not sure that might be in someone's knocking next up we have a gingerbread latte I'm very excited about this one oh yeah love that it smells more kind of fresh gingerbread next up is winter candy apple again this reminds me of something and I don't know what but it smells like something that I've used before it says it has key notes of red apple winter rose petals candied orange maple leaf and fresh cinnamon that is the great one next up is frosted coconut snowball which I really like sound off because I love coconut and I'm wondering how they can make coconut not summery key notes of frosted coconut North Pole vanilla winter freesia snow kissed woods and spun sugar oh my god okay you could use this in summer like that's quite a summery smell I'm going to use this in summer I love that next up we have twisted peppermint and since I absolutely loved the smell of the candle I feel like I'm gonna really like this yeah it's like a candy cane but one you can wash with and I am digging that last about my no means least in the way of shower gel we have fresh sparkling snow oh this has shear and vitamin E in it um keynotes iced pear frozen melon winter Apple snowdrop blossom and frosted musk that's not what I thought it would smell like it smells like a really fruity yogurt I quite like that mmm I then picked up a couple of the body creams I also got frosted coconut snowball in the body cream which after smelling the shower gel I'm really really happy I did that also got vanilla bean Noel in the body cream I got the gingerbread latte in the body cream I really like this packaging and I also got winter candy apple in the body cream as well and then the last thing I am going to show you was a little set of hand sanitizers so in there you got fresh sparkling snow which is like glittery it looks like ice is amazing snow kissed citrus frosted cranberry winter white woods what does that smell like Oh what is that and then sparkling mint blossom or way to smell this one as well oh my god I love that one so those are all bits and pieces that I picked up from Bath and Body Works I really hope you guys enjoyed this haul I'm gonna go and spread these candles around my house now and get lighting them give the video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and I will be seeing you again tomorrow also let me know if you're enjoying 24 days of zoella so far which has been your

Hello everybody in today's video, I thought I would share with you all the autumn Clothing bits and pieces. I have collected over the past month and a bit thankfully I Had a huge major clear out of my wardrobe not too long ago and I basically just got rid of anything that I Hadn't worn in a really long time or had over worn and it had washed funny, or it lost its shape or I was basically hanging on to it because I'm a crazy sentimental person, but that doesn't necessarily mean I would wear it and You guys know I am a complete High Street clothing junkie. I absolutely love Most fashion high street shops so a lot of these are like Topshop and H&amp;M and Zara And ASOS, so I don't really know where to start I've sort of made these into piles And I am also going to be filming me wearing the clothes which I will kind of insert as I'm talking about them I'm just gonna start with jumpers because I feel like That's where I may have gone slightly overboard including this one. I'm wearing actually. This is monkey, and it's this really nice like high-necked Rolled up sleeve jumper and I really like it and I got it on ASOS, and it's also quite cropped. It's pretty nice if I'm being completely honest jumpers are My favourite item of cut. Oh my gosh. There's an owl oh Wow there's an owl in the tree oh Or wait is that a pigeon Jumpers are definitely the item of clothing that I own the most of and that I love the most and that I wear the most So when autumn comes back around I do get very very excited about being able to update my jumper situation the first one I Have which I have actually worn already if you watch my vlogs you may have seen me wearing it Is this very chunky knit style Zara jumper It's really thick I'd seen it in so many different Zaras' like in the window and on the website And they just did not have any they didn't have any in stock on and every Zara I went into I was like Oh Where's this jumper, and I'd be like I don't think we have any left damn it And then I feel like because they don't have it you want it even more and then when I was with Poppy in Westfield I walked into that Zara And I found one which was like an extra-large So I asked the lady and I was like do you have any more of these in a smaller size? And she was like it's saying we have one so she like Searched the whole store and came back to me with her small and I was so happy it's like laces It's like black laces like woven in and then they come out the end and they tie But I just think in terms of like slouched ability this jumper is perfect that it's quite long It's really oversized and I love it. I picked this up from H&amp;M and It is this lovely cocky green and it says hi by on it Which I quite like I love a good slogan And this just made me like chuckle, and then what's very different about it so at the front It just looks like a normal Jumper, but then on the back you've got some ribbon that feeds through these huge little eyelets all the way up the sleeves all the way across the back and then all the way down this sleeve as well and I Just really really liked that. I thought it was really cool. So the next jump I actually picked up in two different colors because I couldn't decide which one I loved more and so Yeah, it's this one. It's from Miss, Selfridge, and it is navy blue And it just has these roses on and so I picked up the navy blue one. Oh, and the sleeves are quite like balloony which are quite liked and I also picked up a Pink one I think I'm more drawn to the pink personally I Just love the sleeves look how pretty they are this next jumper is quite out there and not necessarily an autumnal Color but I loved it too much not to get it and it is this bright yellow Very chunky knit style jumper, which is actually from boohoo. I think I've got it on ASOS and it has a high neck and Very big chunky long sleeves. I don't know. I just have this thing about yellow. I just love yellow and I don't see why everything has to be mustard in autumn. I think you could be just as colorful so yeah, love that now if any of you have been in any high street shops recently you may notice that red seems to be a Very key color this autumn so it might come as no surprise to you that I have a few red items in this haul first is this jumper which has a high neck again and is cropped and Long sleeves. It's just a really nice style again. Again it's quite slouchy This is from Topshop, and I like that it's more of like an orangey --red This one is actually a little more slouchy I know you're probably thinking of holding up the same jumper But this one's a little more orangey than the other one and it's like this really soft Material and this is from Poland bear this one is not cropped and it has this nice kind of crochet Effect to it. Sorry if the lighting keeps changing. It's one of those days where a cloud comes over and Completely darkens the whole room and then the cloud disappears and all of a sudden is bright again So right now We're tackling with a bit of brightness another red jumper is this one which is actually quite a different style So this is a tight jumper and it is cropped and it has long Fluted sleeves which I really liked look at these I've not worn sleeves on a top like this since I was like 12 I Used to own a white one sleeve t-shirt with sleeve like this on the end and I thought I was the coolest person in the world this is from Miss Selfridge and I just thought it was quite a nice little Number I thought this is worth sharing although this is a lot thinner than I anticipated it being this is from ASOS and It's a slouchy red cardigan It's kind of cropped but the sleeves are nice and big and baggy and I just thought it would be kind of a nice thing to throw on in this more kind of Transitional weather where it's not like so cold and every now and then it's quite muggy But you don't leave the house without something in case you get cold. I thought this would be perfect, but it is Quite thin I also picked up this because I do feel like everyone should own a jumper like this it has this huge roll neck and it's big and Slouchy and gray and soft, and I just think this is amazing This is the sort of thing that I find myself Living in and reaching for because I also think they're very flattering on a lot of people Especially with a pair of like skinny jeans and boots. I just think you can't go wrong this is from Zara Going back to Topshop. I picked up this jumper which is not knitted I think this is like part from the H&amp;M one at the beginning. This is the first like non knitted style I liked this because I thought it was a bit more smart. It's a jumper that has Slits down the sleeves which are joined by these gold bars and with little gold balls on the end and I don't know I just thought oh that's quite cool and edgy and Some things that I think would look quite nice. This is from H&amp;M, and it is a white round neck Very very soft jumper with normal sleeves looks very normal from the front, but on the back it says get off my back and I just liked this mostly just because as I said, I love a good slogan But also just this is the style of jump over again Is soft and slouchy and you can roll up the sleeves and like wear it with mum jeans and you're good to go I actually wore Tanya's Tanya had this and she came at the weekend And I borrowed her her one of these and I loved it and I was like yes I feel that everyone needs something like this in their wardrobe. It's just a big chunky knit cardigan That you can throw on roll the sleeves up goes with everything and that is from ASOS this is from ASOS, and it is by oasis and it's just a black jumper with frills on the shoulders and then little frills on the sleeves by the cuffs, and I just thought that was really cute and I think things like this are so easy to wear with like everything especially if you're going to get them in quite Plain colors my other two jumpers are also from ASOS. This is by a brand called willow and Paige Which I hadn't ever heard of before, but it's a really lovely soft Jumper with this kind of like leopard print on it, and it's like at this lovely mustard color and I just fell in love with that and This one which kind of reminds me of some like abstract wasp, but I really liked it. It's kind of like giant dog tooth pattern quite abstract quite cool and again that was from ASOS And I just think that would look really nice With most things last two jumpers are from Topshop and these to me just screamed autumn So it would have been rude not to get them I think And it's these it has like a slipped neck at the top, and it's in this lovely mustard color and it has these huge big kind of tortoise shell buttons down at the shoulder and it has them on this side as well and then you've just got some like baggy sleeves and Yeah, I liked these I thought they were Really nice easy to throw on jumpers So I got it in the mustard color and then again because I didn't know which color I preferred I also got it in the Burgundy color as you can see I haven't taken any of the tags off any of these apart from the zara jumper Which i've already worn because I want to try them all on and decide Whether I actually do like all of these so if you have any preferences or you think some look better on than others, then do let me know in the comments because I Think it's always much more helpful to be trying things on with other people's opinions moving on to t-shirts I only have two to show you both from Topshop, and they're stripy and they're not necessarily autumnal But I just really liked them, and they were available now, so it's this one which has red Navy and white stripes And it's literally just a short sleeve t-shirt. I just really like that. I also got this one from Topshop It's just this red and white striped It just says romantic in the middle which I thought was quite nice this t-shirt actually feels a little bit thicker. It's really nice quality Next up we have trousers now. I definitely need to try these on and decide which ones of these. I want to keep because There are quite a few and I'm not sure how these will look the first ones are from Topshop And they are these kind of high-waisted Black grey and white checked and they have these little free Bits on the bottom, we shall see these were from Topshop I just think smart trousers like this looks so nice with like you two jumpers. I also picked up these These were from Miss Selfridge these are very long Flared trousers that you can have around your waist and then obviously they have a little tie here. I like things like this because They feel quite smart and dressy but I think they can also be worn quite casually and I walk quite a lot of this style of trouser in the summer and I just think they're very flattering and an alternative to long dresses or maxi dresses Or maxi skirts those were Miss Selfridge They're actually quite thick too Which is why I thought they would be quite nice for this time of year next up are these Trousers from ASOS now these are like knitted qalaat And I love these I have been living in clots this year through summer So I was a little bit sad thinking about the fact that I had to not really wear them anymore Until I discovered knitted stretchy ones which will still be warm And I'll still be able to wear them so Loved the idea of those. I also picked up these trousers on ASOS Which are very out there and very autumnal! And I wasn't sure about them And then I thought I'll try them on and see what they look like but they are this kind of autumney orange shade that actually go very well with my earrings and They are 3/4 length kind of cigarette trouser style they feel very thick and really lovely quality then From River Island I picked up these These are skinny jeans with Little frilly bits at the end you can see there's quite a trend with the frills I've never really tried jeans with frills on the end before so I'm interested to see what these look like Another thing I picked up from ASOS which is by a brand called Vera Moda. I actually love this brand They have so many great things on there. You should really check it out. This kind of faux leather pleated skirt I Love this I feel like This is the sort of thing that I would wear a lot with some tights and boots and just any of the jumpers I've already shown But the next thing I have which doesn't really have its own category of anything is this dress which I got on ASOS by again the brand Vera Moda and It's a v-neck dress and it has Long sleeves, and it's very very long I don't know if it's maxi or if it's 3/4 length But the reason I'm showing this is because I have loved wearing dresses I bought a Zara one which I have posted on a vlog and on my Instagram And I've really loved wearing dresses with boots and leather jackets and kind of styling them out a little bit more autumn winter So that I've also picked up moving on to jackets I Have picked up a fair few jackets the first one is just a rain Mac And it is this one from Zara, and it's completely clear which are kind of like and it has red blue I think it's just red and blue oh and yellow stitching on it, and I just fell in love with this it also has a hood which is what you need and it's long enough has pockets I Think I just really liked that it was see-through so it doesn't really matter what your outfit is because it will go and also It's waterproof which is What you need really here in the UK rain is very unpredictable in fact. It was supposed to rain today now the sun is out You just never know so a rain mac is kind of vital now. I picked this up in Topshop because I Love the color of it, and I'm not too sure about the style. It's very boxy, but it has This kind of teddy bear Effect to it I'm not too short the formal name is But this is also quite a big trend this autumn winter and I liked that it was pink And I liked that it have black buttons the only thing is I need to try it on and see what this boxy style looks like because Generally, I'm not too sure if that's a style that suits me, but I guess it depends. What kind of outfit you have on Also from Topshop I picked up this this is a denim jacket, and it has the kind of faux fur on the inside these are the sorts of jackets when it starts to get very very cold that are a lifesaver because It they're just so flippin warm I Love these things I have one That's like really really old from Topshop But I thought it was time to like update it and that one's also a much lighter denim, and I quite liked this very blue denim style back to the teddy bear I picked up this on ASOS from new look and it is a Long teddy bear style Coat it has these little like panel bits on the arms. It has lovely pockets here I just I wanted to see what this would look like I love the color I think this kind of color goes with so much, and you can't really go wrong with it And I also think this would be so warm this I got on ASOS. I feel like this is Vera Moda again Oh it is And let me just undo it. It is a velvet green like a jacket OMG. I love this so much and I just love that it's in this green which is like the green from my lifestyle range the green that I am obsessed with the Green that. I am wearing on my jumper actually and Yeah, I really really really like that and then last but by no means least I have this jacket which is by bershka, and I bought it on ASOS and It is this Kind of what is the name of this it's just a Czech kind of brown Tweedy style Long jacket and again these are very in this season And I'm very happy that I found this Berger one because there are quite a few but This one I liked style of the most I probably won't wear this done up so I will undo the buttons But yeah very happy with this time excited to try that on as well So that is everything in my autumn clothing haul I really hope you guys enjoyed this video make sure to give it a thumbs up and to subscribe If you haven't already oh my god That reminds me.

 Hi every one! Today I am going to make a décor of a décor.   I think maybe these are my favorite videos to see   because I'm obsessed with all such things like home decor.   I think   One of the things I was most looking forward to as a child   was having my own house so I could decorate it just as I wanted it   and that's also one of the main reasons I was a little obsessed with sims when I was younger   because you could just build and do what you wanted.   so that means when I go shopping now   then I find small things and stuff I can put in the house   and I thought I would share it with you   because there are many things that I really love   The first place I visited was actually 'urban outfitters''   but 'urban outfitters'' are best known for   their clothes and so on   clothes and shoes..   but actually their decorating section is some nice thing   The first thing I bought was these balloons   I love them as much as others   You know they come in all sorts of different kinds   to represent this time of year.   and I just think this one was really cool   because you do not need helium. You can just breathe them up   and they have a string, so you can just hang them.   really easy and fast!   so I really like them. I think it was really nice to save it for someone's birthday.   This is a drink dunk and it says' I'm taking uber to the gym '' on it   Me and Alfie actually had one in mind that we would give it to but ..   Alife is the person who would take an uber to the gym.   so if we do not give it to the person we would give it to,   so I feel it would suit Alfie.   I'm not actually in Fitness,   so nobody gives it to me.   But it's a really cool water dunk.   I love that saying, I think it's so funny!   And it has a small bag inside.   Wait, what's the bag for? To put the water bottle in?   Yes, okay to take the bottle.   I slept strangely on my neck yesterday, so I can not turn my head this way   I also bought a package of safety matches.   I discovered that we did not have any in our house.   So I tried to turn on light with a gas burner which is probably too dangerous.   They are quite good and very big, which I like.   I hate when matches are small because one can only turn on one light.   and oh, yes   ... they are just really sweet!   It's a box of matches .. what can I say more ?!   I also have a record player upstairs, in my office where I put my makeup and other things   and I have a few LPs   Some of my favorite CDs and some of my favorite songs.   So it would only be right if I bought Adeles '25' on LP so I can also listen to it.   Surely one of my favorite albums in 2016   ....already.   The next thing that I bought I'm so in love with   that it almost hurts.   And that's this cup it's amazing   It's such a real leatherpiece.   and it's an elephant.   and it's just so cute.   and most of the time you know, I do not really drink traditional tea   You drink most herbal tea or fruit tea   so you have this little pocket   where you can take the bag out and put it in there   in the elephant's head   where you can take the tea bag out and put it in there   which I think is so useful, because quite often  
[Music] hello everybody today I am going to be showing you how I do my corkscrew curls which is something I've been wearing and loving a lot recently and so many of you have been asking me to do this video to show you how I do it now it's not difficult it is essentially just curling your hair but I have a few little tips and ways I like to do it so that it looks like this and not like this so I really hope you guys find this useful let's get started it's the first thing I tend to do is simply brush my hair where did I put my brush oh this is a whole lot easier to do if you don't have any knots for some reason my hair gets extremely naughty I feel like you don't have to have a side parting to do this but I do feel like it gives it that little bit more of an 80s vibe because of the whole like 80 side fringe so it's completely up to you if you prefer to have your hair and a center parting leave it in a center parting but if you are feeling a little bit daring I would suggest to go for a bit of a side parting because I just think it looks quite cool I like to use a scrunchie to separate my hair because when I use a regular hair tie it leaves um like a dent in my hair so I always use a scrunchie and because I have quite thick hair I do this in layers and I work my way up out the way the tongues I'm using these ones these are the Lee Stafford ones which look like I don't know like a squished pole they're not rounded they are flat but it's like it's basically a teeny tiny little like flat curling wand you can get so many different varieties of ones that will give you corkscrew curls my hairdresser actually used tight like a really long thin round one on the shoot I did with Jo which was what completely inspired me to start curling my hair like this and that worked really well also so it's completely up to you so I feel like the sections of hair that you take is completely dependent on how curly and big you want your hair to be if you have quite thick hair you might want to take slightly bigger sections because you could end up with an actual afro around your head and it also is very dependent on how long you leave your hair on the tongs these get very hot so if you want more of a relaxed corkscrew curl you don't want to leave it on for too long I generally take pieces about that big because I feel like if I go too small it looks a bit crazy taking the tongs facedown away from your face obviously being very careful I have burnt myself a few times on these and you want to get as close to the end as possible I don't leave this on for very long at all in fact in three two one I'm done there you go there's number one and feel free to go in opposite directions [Music] and then curling it round slightly making it tighter to your head see that one I left on a bit too long and it's now like half the size of the other one I think it's quite nice to be a bit irregular so taking bits and going one way then taking another bit and going a completely different way I think it makes it certainly more interesting I [Music] think a lot of people assume that this takes quite a long time one of our most asked questions is how long did that take you and I think that's because the curls are so small it is like you're taking the tiniest bits of hair every time but you really don't have to do that and honestly I think this takes me the same amount of time to curl my hair like this as it does with a regular curling wand [Music] they firstly are done onto the second layer [Music] next layer this is a great look huh and you're done imagine this as a hairstyle like curly underneath straight on top cute little top knot okay now on to the last layer which is the fringe now although we're doing a side fringe I actually think it's good to curl out of a side fringe and then flip it over I'm not sure why I've just found that to look the best [Music] at this point your hair looks like this which is never how I leave it because I just think this is a little bit much so I will run my fingers through the curls and sort of pull them out a little bit [Music] I then use a little bit of this which is the davon s O I or oi oil this stuff is incredible so I just squirt a couple of pumps of that into my hand rub it in and then I take that through the curls because I just feel like it gives them a little bit more shine and definition and they look less fried so there you go that is my extremely highly requested corkscrew curl hair tutorial it's definitely not rocket science but I hope there were a few little useful tips and tricks in there which will enable you to live out your inner 80s fantasies I also think these curls look amazing on the second day so once they've sort of like dropped a little bit they also look really great so kind of leave it like this go to bed wake up the next day and pop in a little bit more oil just to kind of style up a bit do not brush it that's my one tip do not brush this otherwise it will look like like out here and it won't look it's like defined and I don't know it just doesn't look as good - trust me give it a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and I'll see you again tomorrow for another video bye guys [Music] 
this video is all about you got your back to the audience that's not helpful hello everybody today I am going to be making a video all about getting a puppy which is something that I know a little bit about considering I have one of my own even though she's almost 2 I wanted to make this video when I felt as though I could impart a little bit of wisdom and although I don't want you to take everything I say as fact as I am NOT a dog expert and I feel like with animals and pets and things it is quite a lot of a personal opinion but I wanted to shed light on some of the things I've learned in order to help any of you who are trying to make an informed decision on getting a puppy or any of you who have just got a puppy and are going oh my goodness help me what have I done so I asked you on Twitter if you had any questions that you'd like me to kind of talk through or address in the video so I've got big old list of things to go through what did you consider before having a puppy the things that you need to consider before having a puppy are whether you want to adopt or buy from AKC registered breeder I know that lots of people have different opinions on this I think both are great options I think it completely depends on what it is that you want we wanted a puppy so we look for AKC registered breeder you have to make sure you're getting from somebody who knows what they're doing that is very important it's also very important to look really hard don't just go for the first puppy that you find don't just go for the first breeder you need to do a lot of research if you are going down that route or you can adopt again you need to do a lot of research you need to make sure the dog that you want to adopt is right for you etc etc even though we didn't adopt this time it's definitely something that I want to do in the future at some point when the time comes that we decide we want any more animals but again it's a personal opinion and before deciding which route you want to go down you have to do a lot of research you also have to consider space and where you live if you're living in a tiny flat is getting a Labrador the best thing for you or for the dog No so you want to make sure you have the right space and the right living environment for a dog have you got a big garden have you got small garden things like that time time is really important because if you are in a full-time job from 8 a.m. until 8 p.m. is having a dog really fair unless of course you can arrange for care for your dog throughout the day no let's just seen a butterfly I'm not sure if she's seen one of those before oh do you have the money for a dog money is also a big factor another question that I got asked was does having a dog cost a lot of money and the answer is yes of course because a dog is essentially a very large part of your family and they require things all the time they require food they require toys they require beds they require blankets they require shampoos toothpaste toothbrushes poo bags the list is endless and of course depending on how much you want to treat your dog and how much you want to spend on your dog it also depends largely on which dog you go for if you get a Great Dane you are going to spend a lot of money on food because that dog needs to eat a lot more than a chihuahua let's say if you have a pug who are known to have certain health issues the insurance is going to be more when you insure your dog so there's all these different factors which when you look at different breeds you can kind of take into consideration where you can when it comes to how much money you might have to spend but yes getting your dog is costly okay so the next thing that you need to consider is which breed this for me was the most important part of getting a puppy because all puppies are cute and all puppies are adorable but you have to make sure that you are going for a breed that is right for you and your partner and all those other things that I've just told you about to take into consideration so money your house your garden all these things are quite dependent on what we do you want to go for there are so many amazing places you can research different breeds we spoke to friends who had different breeds you could go to crafts which i think is a great place to go because there are so many different types of dog you can ask vets you can ask dog behaviorist so you can go to puppy classes you can ask your friends and your family and you can also do a lot of research online another huge factor to consider before getting a dog is is it good timing you know have you reached a point in your career where you're happy are you and you'll have you and your partner being together for a substantial amount of time um you know are you happy together can you see a dog fitting into your lifestyle you know how busy are you do you have children already are you thinking of having children a year you have to think about your life and whether or not it's the it's a good time to bring another member of the family in essentially that again is a really really important one what made you select a pug for us after doing our research a pug seemed like the perfect breed to fit in with our lifestyle there are quite a lot of other breeds but we liked that pugs have such character but we're also so loving and needed and you know their main aim is to please you and essentially they're a lap dog you know they don't need too much mental stimulation they don't need too much exercise and because of the lifestyle that Alfie and I have we wanted to make sure we didn't have a dog that required three hours of walking a day just in case we couldn't give it that you know we didn't want to have a dog that we couldn't give it the best that it could have that's not to say that at some point in the future we could get a husky or something that requires a bit more walking but right now we wanted a dog that would fit easily into our lifestyle and hugg seemed perfect neither is so friendly so funny in character they have like their crazy moments and then they have their like sleeping all day moments they're small they don't shed too much hair um she doesn't smell she doesn't draw there were a lot of different things that um we're kind of plus sides for me so what happens when you actually have your puppy we brought Nala home one chilly but very sunny November morning and I don't think I quite knew at that point how much a puppy would change my life in two hours time our life is going to change forever Ishi is another I was so excited and he had everything ready we'd gone out we bought her crate which we decided to do crate training which I think personally worked wonders for Nala she really took to that very well we bought her bed we got her the puppy pads we basically spent a small fortune and pets at home and we felt like we had everything ready for her when we got here it was almost like it didn't really sink in for a good month it was a real life adjustment things that I found to be essential when having a puppy was a small collection of toys puppies and dogs do get bored of toys quite quickly depending on how many they have now has a lot of toys and she'll definitely only really play with certain ones but it is important to keep changing toys up so that you keep them mentally quite stimulated a small dog bed you don't want anything to feel too big and drowning you can grow a dog bed with a dog so we kept like we had a really small round one to start with and she used to curl up in it and it was just the cutest thing ever other essentials this this is the simple solution platinum urine blaster uh toilet training Nala was really hard I feel like she only really got it down a year old if a dog pees on the floor on the rug whether if you leave it or you just kind of like mop it up with a bit of tissue the smell stays and the dog will forever think that is where it should pee so you need to do everything you can to remove the smell of pee from anywhere they've been and this and multiple others were an absolute lifesaver I feel like I could do a whole video on like puppy essential so I'm just gonna leave it - those bits for now vet visits and puppy classes this is something that I didn't really know a lot about obviously I knew we would have a vet I did not know the vet offered a puppy sessions so you can take your dog I think it was every three months then it became every six months for checkups which I think is really important we got Nala microchipped straight away because it's just the safest thing and I like to think that if she ever got lost or if someone stole her we can track her down and it's also just the best source of information how much should you be feeding your dog how much weight should your dog put on from being a puppy to an adult what's the best thing for your dog to eat what's the best diet what's the best thing they can have for their coat how often should you brush their teeth how often you know vets are the best people to go to for all this information and I learned so much from the regular vet visits so I would highly recommend looking into whether or not your vet has a puppy program and signing up to it it really wasn't that expensive and I found it so useful puppy classes I recommend puppy classes to everyone I know who has got a puppy or is who is getting a puppy we learn how to train a dog basic tricks your dog should know when it's best to train your dog you know how old they should be what is bad behavior and what is good behavior how is it best to react to bad behavior we did a lot of positive reinforcement every time she went to the toilet outside we cheered and hooted like we'd won the lottery the dog poo lottery dogs and pugs I found are very food focused so we were treating left right and center whilst also being very careful not to over treat her because pugs can put weight on very very easily which is something that I learned at the vets so there you go when you first got Nala did you feel overwhelmed how did you deal with it as I touched on a little bit before yes it was very overwhelming I felt like someone had handed me a toddler with no nappy because she was running around and she was putting things in her mouth and she was you know peeing on the floor pooing on the floor like she wouldn't leave our side it was like we couldn't take our eyes off her for at least three weeks and it kind of put everything else to a stop and it was like whoa how I did not expect it to be like this once she kind of settled more into life and she could do things like tackle the stairs and we knew she could do the step and she started going outside and when things became a bit more structured and we kind of found the balance it became a lot easier but yes it's hard work and it was quite overwhelming but I honestly would not change it for the world and I would do it again a hundred percent what has been the hardest thing to train Nala to do the hardest thing to train Allah to do was toileting outside that honestly just felt like a hurdle we were never gonna jump over and walking well on a lead those are her two things that I mean she's got the toileting down now but what's gonna lead she's still it depends if she's having an excited day she's useless if she is just desperate to sniff everything find a dog I mean I would if I accidentally drop the lead she would be gone and that like terrifies me someone said what is your biggest fear with Nala her running off has she done any damage to your house the one thing that she has done which was very strange Anna and she hasn't ever done it since but when she was about six months old she started Naurang on the corner of our wall and I don't know whether it's because it was cold or she liked the plaster but we now have little teeth marks on one corner rubble when you can see the mess all of the structure of our house where she used to just chew it down and it was for like a week and then after actually stopped it was the weirdest thing best training treats okay so tiny little bits of cooked chicken work wonders obviously making sure that you if you're using a lot of cooked chicken you have to take out some of the kind of food that you would be feeding at like mealtimes because otherwise that's like food overload venison and liver just these tiny little things we use those for treats where she was smaller and you can also get tiny little chicken squares I don't know the brand name but we've given her those basically something small but delicious which i think is why chicken is just the best thing what tricks does Nala know okay so obviously she can do sit she can do down which took a really long time to do she can do high-five she can do hor I once watched a video online where someone trained their dog to ring a bell for a treat and I was like I'm gonna do that I am for sure going to train my dog to ring a bell for a tree which is completely unnecessary definitely isn't needed for everyday life doesn't make my life easier but it's something fun and I wanted to give myself a challenge so she can ring a bell for a tree which I quite like ring yeah yeah we've also recently taught her to wait for her food I wanted to teach her a word wait because um for things like being near a road or not running through a door or um you know when she gets a bit excited I want I wanted her to wait for things any tips for bath time okay so things I've learned if you're going to use an actual bath which i think is probably better for larger dogs you want to use a non-slip bath mat definitely makes it easier Anna a showerhead attachment I actually found that Nala was a bit more scared in the bath I think because the bath is quite big she's sort of used to kind of freeze up so we actually use the kitchen sink now because it's quite an industrial sink it's like metal it has one of those like Hosey attachments and you know it regularly gets cleaned so we decided to do it in that instead because it was smaller and she much much professor how do you get your dog to stop putting on a lead is a harness better a hundred percent get a harness for your dog they are much more comfortable for your dog to wear personally I think not like nah I can actually tell me but um I just found to be a lot more effective so when she was smaller she had this one another one which is really good for if your dog is pulling badly is this which is a rough wear so you can stop them from pulling on the front and on the top this is the best thing for if you have a really Tuggy dog her kind of more everyday harness at the moment is this one which this just goes over her head and this bit goes up either side and you can select how tight or how loose you want it which i think is really good and you have that little bit of space before the lead and I just found that this stopped her pulling as much too so and I think I've got this one and pets at home you can get this one online and this one was from Arthur what shampoo do you use on Nala at the moment I'm Curie using this one which is scruffy chops and it's rhubarb King Mad natural mineral shampoo for dogs are the yummy whiff of rhubarb and custard it smells so good what is knowledge favourite toy I would say at the moment she is loving this llama we got her this for Christmas I feel like he may have had a Christmas hat the Christmas hat is gone piggy this was the original piggy um that doesn't actually make a proper noise anymore so I went online in a massive search to find the same pig and I managed to find one although he is a different shade of pink and I still think Nala knows the difference between original piggy and new piggy but she still loves these pigs and I don't know what it is this was her first toy this is what we call Mingo which is the Flamingo oh and this was her first toy that we ever got her and although she doesn't really play with it as much because I'm assuming she just got really bored of it every now and then I do see her with this so I think she does secretly love it a type of toy that Nala is obsessed with is flat crunch choice so this is mr. elf that she got the Christmas and this one has had its fair share of love it's got little squeakers no the squeakers a dead she also has this Hedgehog which she as well don't you lastly what is the most rewarding thing about having a dog it's just the best thing ever although you have to really carefully consider getting a dog or getting a puppy it's honestly like I don't know what I would do now if I didn't have knowledge I don't really know what my life would be like it's like she's the missing puzzle piece that I never knew is missing and she's just become such a massive and important part of like our house life our family life and my life really she has all these little characteristics that just make her the best dog ever and I honestly love her so so much and I would never change her it's just the best thing ever when you're just the best doggie and you let me pick

bye 
got barely any battery ah oh my battery's running out hell no I have one here but what are the chances that this is also dead let's find out let's get this show on the freakin mother frickin Road hello everybody welcome back to my channel that's my phone let me turn off ah shut up man today I'm going to be chatting you through my may favorites and it actually kind of scares me how quickly this year has gone already I don't know if it's just because I'm more busy than like ever or because I'm getting older like what's the deal here I don't know but it's terrifying I've got quite the selection of things to get through for you as always and so I'm gonna get started first thing I'm going to show you is a little bit of shameless self promo and it is these a well a Beauty Sweet Inspirations rage if you are subscribed to my second channel you may have already seen that I posted a video chatting you through all the new items that have come out for zoella Beauty this month they are now available online or Sony drop that on Nala on super drug and feel unique website and they will be in store from next week the 6th of June so there you go I'm not going to chat too much about them because I have done a whole video chatting you through each product so I will make sure I leave that in the description box so make sure you go on over and check it out and if you've ordered anything already and it's arrived and you tried it please let me know what you think I'm just super excited about it the next thing which is quite a new thing that I've been enjoying is this which is the Anastasia Beverly Hills at Anastasio I'm not really too sure a lot of people say it differently contour kit light to medium and this is the powder contour kit I believe there is one that is a cream one also but this is the one I have been loving I haven't really used the you highlight shades because it's very very subtle and I'm not about that subtle highlight life I like to really full-on go for it and these just don't they're not as full-on as I would like them but if you like to highlight more for shape rather than like a sheen I think you'll like these however the thing I have been using are these three contour shades because they are perfect but you've got a really good variation of different Brown shades they are all mapped and I just find contouring with these an absolute dream with my little Charlotte Tilbury contour brush and I've been really enjoying it I think the color I use the most is the one in the middle I feel like it's their most ashy I have been really thoroughly enjoying using this palette I got it on cult Beauty the next thing I've used a lot this month is this I was in the shop and I was picking up the it's the liquid version of this the makeup remover I was picking that up and I also have the oil as well which I really really like too and it was three for two so I bought all three in the range including this and it is the chamomile sumptuous cleansing butter with community fair trade can well all skin types it doesn't really feel like a bomb it definitely feels as it as I've just said it feels like a butter I realize take my hand in it but I really don't you can kind of see where I've like gouged out it smells so fresh and subtle and gorgeous and I just find this really easy to use I mostly use it as a second cleanse so once I've already removed my makeup with an oil I will then use this to just cleanse my skin but also it does work really well as a makeup remover too and I don't feel like I'm really tugging at my eyes I don't feel like it's difficult to use so I would HIGHLY highly recommend this the actual consistency of it is what I think makes me love it so much because as it says on here it's like butter and it's it's really not a consistency of any other product I've used before and it just feels really indulgent and soft it leaves my skin feeling so soft and you almost just want to be like I'll never touch your skin with your hands dirt hands dirty face clean not great mixture but my skin was really really soft it's really inexpensive really easy to get hold of and I also feel like it's a really good amount like this is pretty compact for travel it's not as big and bulky as my Emma Hardy bomb perfect for travel really easy to use really easy to wipe away leaves the skin feeling amazing and it's for all skin types I have two Body Shop favorites in this month's video the next thing is this now this is a new range by the body shop and I was possibly be most excited for this Center and then I have been for a body shop release since the Mohito range and it is the body shop penita colada fresh body sorbet with pineapple and coconut extracts from the Caribbean I freaking love pineapple scents and coconut sense especially in summer coconut sense just reminded me of summer because of suntan lotion and just being in the Sun and going on holiday so when this came out I was so excited because it is one of my favorite scents oh it smells like a pina colada and if you like pina coladas and getting caught in the rain you're going to freaking love this sorry I had to a hat to the sorbets I have actually put in a favorites before quite a while ago so sorbet is a really different feel to a normal moisturizer it's light it's fresh it feels cooling on the skin it still moisturizes but it does it in what I feel is a different way if you have really really dry skin I just don't think you're going to like this if you like to just kind of top-up with moisturizer and moisturizing your body is a bit of a chore I know there's so many of you out there that are gonna agree with me that it is because I freaking hate moisturizing my body this will be your new best friend because it doesn't have that same feeling as a moisturizer as like a lotion or a butter it's really light and it's really fresh and it sinks in super quickly but I don't think gives the same feeling of moisturizing as a lotion or a butter so it completely depends on the sort of thing you like I know so many people who probably wouldn't like this because they love that feeling of their skin feeling really quenched and hydrated next thing I have been loving are these these are the Barry M molten metal nail paints the one I've actually had on my nails I can't find because I've obviously been applying it and leaving it around the house but this is a new addition to Barry M I haven't seen these before and they are so beautiful and they literally look like molten metal on your nails I love them there's this gold one and this one which is a really deep copper and then there's one that's more of a rose gold which is the one that I have been wearing on my nails I really like Barry MS formulation they don't last as long as some other kind of more expensive formulations of nail polish like OPI or or se but for the price which is flippin good really inexpensive these are brilliant like you just can't go wrong with a Barry M nail polish and now that they have molten metal shades I'm just so happy I love these next up is an NYX liquid suede now you guys know that I found a NYX counter and n works counter in my local boots and it was huge and the next time I went in it was like bees around a honeypot there was so many people around the NYX counter but I was like oh crap it's all going to be gone damn it um but I managed to like wet Wingull my wet bangle my away in Wingull my way in weave my way in what did I weigh in I managed to wiggle my way in maybe I think that's what I'm going for and I noticed that they had a line of these these are the NYX liquid suede 's essentially a liquid lipstick now you guys know how much I love my colour-pop liquid lipsticks I have actually ordered some Kylie Jenner ones but I ordered them in April and I still don't have them so I don't really know what's happened there so I can't compare them to the Kylie Jenner lip liquid lipsticks but I flip in love a liquid lipstick so it was only common sense to me to try these ones I really love the consistency of these they go on really creamy but they set quite matte and they don't feel heavy or really dry on your lips which i think is one thing that possibly puts quite a lot of people off of a liquid lipstick because they do kind of crack and they are quite heavy and I just feel like this is not heavy at all and I think it's the formulation so it says it's a cream lipstick rather than a liquid lipstick but it still has that same matte effect and I can still layer it and it doesn't crack off and it comes off nicely and it wears nicely and I really like the color so I've got it on now and it is the color 0 7 moving on to food I have quite a lot of food in this one I don't normally but I appear to have collected a little pile of things I've got my really not that healthy to my a lot healthier bounties I feel like there's a bit of a coconut vibe going on in this video I've always loved bounties it's just that my love for them has been rekindled for any of you that are watching and you don't know what a bounty is it's essentially really creamy coconut with a chocolate shell that's it really it's a bar of coconut with chocolate on it and I've been obsessed with them so I just thought I would put them in this video another thing I've been obsessed with are these and they are the McVitie's digestive nibbles these are the caramel ones that they also have dark chocolate double chocolate and milk chocolate and it's really lame that I know that isn't it and that just goes to show how many bags of these I've eaten in the last month or so they're essentially little balls of digestive biscuit with the coating around the outside but they're so easy to eat you're just sat there you just pop one in pop one and it's not like eating a biscuit it doesn't make as much mess there's no crumb ease in the bed which everyone hates crumb ease in the bed and they're just I don't know genius I love them great for on-the-go as well slightly healthier I really like these these are the urban fruit just fruit gently baked perfect pineapple no messing so these are just pineapples just the pineapples with a sprinkling of rice flour to prevent stickiness little bits of pineapple there is a lot of pineapple and coconut in this video we got some of these in sourced box last month so I reordered them coconut slightly healthier than bounty I also have been really enjoying toasted coconut chips these ones are with sea salt but I I don't know I've just been really oppressive coconut this month can I just say coconut my may favorites is coconut really nice again great as a snack any time of day healthy delicious not if you don't like coconut though two other things I have been loving before I end the video the first one is Zara I love Zara is a great shop they always have some great things in there but at the moment it is jam-packed with too many things that I really want to buy so I just thought I would mention that to you because there's always that kind of awkward time in shops where there's a bit of like ultimi wintry and there's like bikinis and it's and it's kind of like I don't really know if I want to be buying for like winter or if want to be buying for spring and summer and you guys aren't making it any easier here but I feel like Zara have got it spot-on it's just there's just some really amazing things in there and I've had a few shops in there recently this top is actually from Zara it's really pretty I like it and the last thing I want to chat you about is an app but I am super obsessed with what's it actually called I think it's just called one second everyday yes so it's called one second everyday and it's an app that my friend Maddie introduced me to about four weeks ago and you basically record a second every single day and you upload it into this app and it kind of plays it through for you kind of like a visual diary and I really like that it only captures one second out of a whole day even though I do things like vlogging and snapchat and everything else that documents my life it's quite nice to just have all these little tiny snippets of a day I'm super excited after a year to watch it back and I'm thinking of even making it into a video at the end of the year or something just for you guys to watch put it to a bit of music and it's also just a really nice diary really so I am really really enjoying that app I do it every single day I haven't missed a day yet and it's been like four week four and a half weeks and I'm really proud of myself because I can never normally keep things like this up and I have I will leave links to everything I have mentioned in the description box thank you so much for watching as always I love you guys a lot a lot a lot and let me know what you've been loving this month let me know if you've purchased anything in the Sweet Inspirations range and I will see you again very very soon oh give it a video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it as always makes me happy thank you 
ah you're okay I'm just last time you showered why add fruit more be your air or your add another wind no no no oh wind spins ahead fringe a shrink I'm in no earthly twins where you know can you imagine that one day in your life you'll actually be a male well I you could be gone by when lifeless would never die I dreamed that God would be for giving cuz they tell your whole ah I need a water I need a water filter oh set youp on yours oh hello Oh shiny Oh guys look over his favorite Hey hi everybody today I'm going to be doing my favorites it's a little bit light but I've been super busy hence why I've decided to film this video in the only spare chance I've got with Mark and out fides I think not farted that's marker yeah love is our club come here so this is gonna be a bit of a crazy favorites probably a little bit all over the place but I figured that you guys wouldn't mind because there's one of these every month and as long as I show you the things I've been loving we can all have a little bit fun yeah this is by the brand Maria Neela have you ever heard my favorite no I'm don't take this the wrong way be numbers vassal yeah it smells like an airplane toilet though no I quite like the smell because they are clean smells smell this does this one smell the same oh it's yes it's purple oh no that's nice I like that smell yeah but that smells like you know those little toilets in the airplanes I like that but this is for colored hair which is why ever you liked it and it has color guard complex sulfate and paraben free and it's 100% vegan produced in Sweden hmm Wow and I also think that because it's for color-treated hair and the conditioner is silver it makes my hair really blonde mmm I like it remember when you have blond hair yeah that wasn't even that long ago oh is this like last month we've lost in Alfie deyes the attention span of a 3 year old so I do I have used another one of these I bought two and I used it and I absolutely freakin loved it I bought it on the lush website and I've never seen it before and it's called physiotherapy and it's I'm going to read it to you and I think it'll drop into the bath and feel the stimulating and warming effect from ginger powder cinnamon leaf oil and clove bud oil this is like Christmas in a bar phizzer but I think it's only a website exclusive yeah once it's so small I don't know but I love it oh yeah Oh see there's none of that the other day no that is lovely oh that's how they died forget it ah see I am all about those Christmassy cinnamon clove smells I said evening sir yeah I love it so I've got one more of those by am gonna have to place another order because I really enjoyed those even though we're technically almost halfway through September and this is my August base this did come out this month so it's technically like a middle-of-the-road fave but it's been a favor of mine for a long time I just haven't been able to share it with you and you like it - I love it you haven't got a bath though so you use it in the shower are you something I take a nice little dollop slap it on rub around with the zoella flannel ah and then shower so this is the scooper duper foaming bath soap you guys know how much of a bubble bath I've pretty much been having bubble baths like every other night I love them especially like when it starts getting orderly yeah this is one of the new things that came out as an additive to the core range and I just really liked what I did send it I still really love the original sin I who like I like it so much more now my god not saying I didn't like it and start but to fruit has always been my fave yeah you love the tutti fruity - yeah I've been using that I'm very happy that I can actually now tell you I've been using it um and also two things from Bath &amp; Body Works because I placed the order that was the candles and I might placed another cheek a little order of a lot of the bath and shower stuff because for some reason I just didn't buy any I don't know what I was thinking um so I've got the altered you call it an orchard I say orchid orchid where's the eye orchard so when you go to prom oh I got you an orchid it's that way read that word or chart hahahahahahaha oh okay okay when the eye what would you say oh oh oh  you know what our differences between an orchid in an orchard yeah I thought it was the same thing well let you put on your wrist at prom the girls put on limits to the prom do you know one saying kids on your wrist it from yeah I don't but the girl says no oh watch it is where apples grow oh oh like a like a vine yard yeah but like an orchard this is orchard leaves and blue sky you have this matter I know you oh my god it smells like my crisps morning air hand sanitizer I like um that it smells quite fresh and a little bit masculine and I like that I can also smell it on me lingers like in the morning up until the afternoon it sort of lingers a little bit but not too much because you don't want it to do that because then you can't put you know aftershave on you can even lay in yes well I live orchids the other thing that I also love is this which is the pumpkin marshmallow latte sheer and sugar body scrub but it's like it's it's a bit more like runny in texture so I feel like there's kind of two types of body scrub you've got like the ones you kind of scoop out they're a bit harder which is kind of like the one I've got that I brought out or there's this type which is a lot more like it's like squeezy but yes like you could like I don't know like a mr. whippy yeah it's more like um like look it's quite like oh yeah guy but it's like smell the whole it says keynotes a pumpkin latte toasted marshmallow creamy sandalwood white ginger and prale I pray line must Fraulein Crowley beautiful yeah I also really like that it also phone oh yeah I'll leave it in the shower so you can use it tomorrow whatever it's like it it's it's not as um etosha scrub as ones you can kind of scoop but it's like foamy it's like a wash with bits of scrub in it and I really really like it it's very good and you've got the candle that to Matt and I do have the candle lit right now to match it is one of my favorite suppose BSS I think what out the whole bud both Molly works alright well it's just very like subtle but it's just the right amount of sweet for me you know I'd use all year round yeah another thing I've been really loving is this this is the origins ginseng energy boosting moisturizer so there have you used this before hi smells like a tin of Christmas chalk like chocolate creams like the quality Street oh yeah the cream inside the chalk yeah yeah yeah yeah don't be a what to say about this apart from that I just bloody love it it's tightening it yeah it smells good and it oh this is not what I thought what you can also get this for under eyes as well that's what I've used so this is all over the face yes the moisturizer oh okay yeah really good I've only ever used the ginseng under your eyes I love this although I'm not normally a massive fan of like fake orange smells but I don't mind this it's like it's grown on me I find it it it just makes my makeup go on really nicely and I haven't had any problems of this and it's just generally a really nice moisturizer like I get excited to put it on and I think my skin is very thankful for it mm-hmm so I've been really loving that energy boosting how many of you are loving my autumnal background right now do you love my autumnal background I love stay home and snuggle and I love the Fox pillow is cute isn't it okay another thing I've been really loving you know how much I love my liquid like lipstick yeah that turn Matt these are the two faced melted matte liquid matte long well it sticks as a mouthful and these are new additions to my makeup collection because they very kindly sent me some not a hashtag spawn just a hashtag brick in all of it I hate myself no don't change it don't change I've been really really tough you need to justify everywhere oh I'm starving sobbing I've been showering film with me in this crappy food oh my geez they're just amazing also I really love the packaging you okay in a minute the color in particular that I have been loving which I have on right now is this one which is cool girl is still morphing so I'm in trouble why do I know did I spit again no I did I just remember things oh cool girl I start again that's right what's up good night it's not forget if you've just got loose lips today oh cool girl I really like it it's a really great one in all seriousness to face is great just lay okay hashtag I freaking love it yes King King committin hair another thing I have been obsessed with is the Kat Von D locket foundation oh yeah so this is 24-hour where full coverage transfer-resistant matte finish it's everything but I feel like a lot of people would be a bit terrified to wear like 24 hour full coverage matte but I love it like I really didn't think I would love it but yeah the packaging is so cool and she has every shade covered as well which i think is so good there's so many so many different variations of skin shade it's quite thick it's always like um to see it wow yeah it's like a gel almost I don't know but somehow it really blends into your skin really nicely and the only thing I will say is make sure you have a very well moisturized face if you don't have oily skin if you have oily skin scan Skype your voice can I feel like you're really like this if you're a little bit more on the dry side just make sure you're wearing a super thick moisturizer before you put it on because I put this on the other day when I forgot to moisturize and I was like oh my god my skin looks weird and I couldn't work out why then I remembered I didn't moisturize I didn't use my ginseng moisturizing is really one of those now yeah what moisturizer do simple and Nippon fab I also use serums as well yeah I've moved on to serums a little bit more than moisturizer these days oh you going up in the world apparently so I took my father super the other day and now I'm using serum serum ah what is it serum serum of serum it's wrong hey yeah Kat Von D foundation check it out if you need a fuller coverage foundation another thing I love is my hand cream it's a bit like Lane I'm putting my own products in my favorite no because I do genuinely love them it's all I've been using for like how many months have I been using this for literally since I had a sample of it I've been using it I've got one in my office one next to my bed one in my makeup bag and one in my bathroom hungry hands hand cream which is now available in super drug ding ding and it's a good size it's a really good size like you're not gonna run out

famished I missed ah ginger bread just works oh yeah by the way it's ginger bread sent it oh yeah it just works I want to eat it oh my god this just so Christmassy and festive and I love it one more

hello puppy you are so needy why are you so cute who's that you can't stop here I'm about different a video you can't serve here good go don't give me those no puppy dog laughs hello everybody today I am gonna be doing an a sauce whore and I'm actually going to be trying the clothes on in this video because I don't really know why I've never fully done this before I think just because I don't do clothes hauls that often but when I watch them I find it really useful to see what it looks like on so therefore for this video I'm gonna make it like a try on Tryon session and also just because it's one of those things you do when you get your like girlfriends around and you're sat around and you've been shopping and you actually do put things on for kind of a second opinion so I want you guys to be my second opinion here even though by the time this goes up I probably will have already made up my mind but still I just thought it would be a little bit more firm so the reason for this a sauce haul is because I am going on holiday next week or this week depending on what you're watching this video not that I really needed any new bits and pieces but there is something quite nice about going away with like new clothes and being so excited to put them on and just because a lot of the summer things that I did have were from like last year in the year before and when I did my massive wardrobe clear out the other day I did get rid of quite a lot of things so there were many bags that went off to the charity shop with all my other summer things in so that other people can enjoy them but I did mean that I had quite a gap in my wardrobe for more summery items hence a bit of late night shopping on ASOS and the damage is pretty bad a sauce it came in a freaking box and that's how you know you've ordered too much because normally it comes in a bag but yeah I'm gonna get started I'm gonna pull things out and I'm going to show them to you and insert little clips of me trying them on first thing I've got in here is actually a nightshirt and I fell in love with this because I don't know if any of you remember I have this really old kind of 80s inspired Barbie jumper that I've had for a really really long time and then when I saw this one which is like I think this is 70s Barbie I loved this it's just a really big night t-shirt and this isn't an extra-small I picked up this bomber by Palin bear is quite a long one which I don't think I have any long ones of these I am so into bomber jackets right now I am really starting to get quite the collection and I just really loved the colors in this look at this it's beautiful I'm all about that like leaf print especially when it's with pink leaf and pink I'm obsessed with right now and I've got that in a small yeah in a small definitely don't think I would wear this with this outfit I think this would look really cool with denim jeans I quite like the length of this it's actually really comfortable it's not too thick either it's really nice thin fabric so I think this is nice just for general summertime but also really nice just for holiday I think this next dress is by denim and supply and it's by Ralph Lauren and it's just this really beautiful white cotton dress with floaty sleeves I just think it's really pretty it was a little bit more on the pricey side but I really love all the detail plus white just looks lovely with a tan and a little summer hat and some sandals oh and I got that in an extra small I like the sleeves and I like how it feels I'm just not sure if it's quite see-through I don't know whether this could be like an everyday dress or whether this would have to be like a bikini throw over but I really like it I think it's quite nice no I also picked up this which is just an Asus throw on over bikini type dress but I thought it was really cute and it had this little V here and although it is quite sheer which i think is why it's meant to be like over a bikini or I guess over a bandeau or a little pair of short I just thought it was a really nice link and I really liked the short sleeves on it so I'm excited to see what that looks like this is actually a size 4 but I know with a sauce if there's a 4 and a 6 I always go for the smallest one because their sizes can kind of vary depending on what it is and I think this is supposed to be quite baggy so we shall see what that looks like okay I / bikini on for this one just so you know I had the appropriate swimwear on underneath but this is really cute too I really like this just to throw one at the beach this is also something just to throw on over a bikini or going down to breakfast when we go to breakfast in the mornings and it's this adorable white play suit with very strappy straps do you see that do you see that the only thing is that so much of this comes quite creased like this is really creased I'm gonna have to do a huge ironing session before I go on holiday but yeah I just thought that that would be really nice and really simple and also just really easy throw on at the beach or by the pool etc etc and I've got that in a size 6 well this is for sure see-through um where are the straps I'm not sure about this I mean you wouldn't be able to wear it without a bikini like this is definitely a bikini throw over I'm not sure about this one next up is this really pretty denim kind of Bardot style dress it's that really thin very cottony denim which I quite like especially if you're going somewhere very hot because then you're not like too hot and it's just very light and easy to wear so I picked this up this is actually a brand this is pinky collection pinky and I got that in a small um this fits quite freely but it kind of covers your boobs so it's all good yeah I like that next up is a little stripy bodycon dress now I I mean I don't know what you do on your holidays but in the evenings most of the time we go out for dinner or we go down to I don't know the beach or we just kind of we just make a bit more effort in the evenings per bit of makeup on because we won't have been wearing it all day and I just felt like I didn't really have anything that was a bit more evening where there was a lot of beach wear pull wear bikinis when I was like oh wait what am I going to well we actually go out to dinner so I looked quite a few bodycon dresses because I really like body con dresses I would say it's kind of MIDI length I like that it has short sleeves so I'm not going to get too hot I just think with a pair of sandals that it will look really nice that is in size 4 you can't really see and I'm scared I'm gonna bash my head but I like this I think this is nice I like that the neck is high yeah I like this one think that a sauce sizes are usually quite true obviously there are a lot of different brands within a sauce and I can't speak for them necessarily but sometimes you do get the odd garment that you're like wait they do that in a size 2 which generally is a size 6 I normally just go for the smallest sizes especially with things like body con dresses because I just want them to be actually figure hugging and body con oh my god that was really weird like a petal just flew up my skylight window like a look fairy if you're a similar size to me a sauce is is the place and always just go for the smaller sizes but generally a six is a six which is good I also got this one which is slightly different because it has more of like a off-the-shoulder and cut and it has these tiny little sleeves and again it's stripy but it's it's that stripe that's quite flattering I think because it's coming into the middle and then there's a little band and then it's just diagonal stripes with a little slit at the side and that is also a size four very figure hugging but I quite like this this is nice it feels really comfortable to know I didn't necessarily buy these for holiday I kind of just got these for like summertime in the UK because here in the UK our summer is not a very consistent shall we say so some days it's hot some days it's near and on the myth days I just wanted some dungarees like I live in degrees I freaking loved ungreased so I thought these looked quite cool I just really liked the color I also really liked the fact that they were skinny like at the bottom like their skinny ones so I'm really interested to see what these are going to look like because I have no idea and these are the Brandon liquor and poker which I have never bought anything from before and these are a size six so we shall see this is like trying to put jeans on without any zip pull on bottom okay I'm in I thought they would fit me around the legs and round the bottom but I did not think they would fit me like here which I guess is I mean it could have been a no I think if it was tighter you'd have could have possibly had a case of the old camel toe so I think this is about time you're gonna get I feel like these I don't know why I didn't think they would actually look alright there you go they go to my ankle this is actually a misguided dress on ASOS and it's technically a t-shirt dress and it's just a metallic and this was one of those things that I was like for night time I think this is going to be super cool I love that the sleeves are slightly longer so they'll hang quite low down um and I don't know I don't know what this will look like on I think it will either make me look like I've got shiny Barbie boobies do you know what I mean by that no like see how my elbow looks like this and it goes shiny yeah that's why I means oh I think it'll look really cool I'm not sure I feel like I don't know I'm not sure about this one I don't know if I love it or if I just think it's okay I mean it's not that expensive and I probably would wear I mean it would look great with more of a tag wouldn't it let me know what you think of this one because I am undecided got these in a 6 these are like beach trousers I have never owned anything like this before but they have huge slits at the front and they're just super flared again I just really loved this color it's like a terra cotta kind of orangey pink and I really liked those and they're like stretchy so they'll be nice and comfy or I could look like I am part of the Bee Gees tribute band I think this is one of my favorite things you guys this is by a brand called surf gypsy and it's the size small and it's just this little top it's a little crop top and it's just lacy but look at the back the back is so pretty it has three little buttons and then like a big gaping hole but I just thought that would be so pretty with shorts or you know to throw over the top of a bikini and I'm very happy with that very very happy with that I probably would have wear these two things together I would probably just have these trousers with I know like a tighter top I think I think this works well with like shorts or something so I probably wouldn't wear the two together but I like both oh no you guys I like too much of this okay I'm not sure how I'm going to be able to show this because it's extremely see-through but again I wanted something for the beach and by the pool so I ordered this peach dress which just ties over your shoulders like this and then flows all the way down and it just looks really pretty it's just a very lovely color and again I just think with the tan this looks so nice and it's just so easy I just feel like when you're on holiday and you want to throw something on and you know quickly cover up things like this a brilliant I decided but swimming costume on and show you this one which is as I thought it would be sheer and peach but so pretty and if any of you are wondering where this swimsuit is from it has a cat on it I don't know if you can see the cat it's got like a criss cross back this is from Lady Oh but yeah I quite like I quite like this it's so cute how cute are these shots oh they have these cute little tassels and they're just freely and they're high-waisted and I just think these will be amazing for holiday very airy and light and again you can just throw them on top of bikinis and just you're all good and I got those in a for it so I've put a body on to wear under this but as you can see these are quite see-through I think these are definitely like bikini shorts but they're really cute I really like them I got this again to throw on top of a bikini just because I really liked this it has two little slits down the side this is the brand evil twin never heard of it but it looks quite cool I got this in a small and it's completely see-through so again I probably won't show you what this looks like on but you can kind of see the sort of thing it is it's just again to throw on over the top of stuff this is South gypsy again and this is a playsuit very floaty very pretty the button that does up at the top or you can leave it undone which will be very revealing so it's completely up to you I kind of wish the button was maybe a little bit further down but the pattern is really really pretty but then over a bikini it will probably be fine it is quite cute next up are these cute little short dungarees playsuit thing and this is actually by boohoo on ASOS and these are size six and these are just really cute look at these little shorts I have know if these all fit either they look quite small but we shall soon find out I just thought they were quite nice for summer weather on holiday or not I put a little stripy top on I've got and with this outfit the only thing I will say is I for sure need to adjust these straps because it got bevor from wedge going on it's very bottom II like without flashing you my entire bum cheeks it is a little bit um short I don't know I think it's actually alright and the last item of clothing is this place OOP with this really pretty pattern on it and there are some like long sleeves and it's buying a brand choice show and this is in a size small and it has like little tassels on the front I really like this I think it's really pretty Oh something ripped this one's so cute I love this yeah I am loving this I love that you can tie this like this or let it down onto accessories I picked up this beautiful necklace look at that it's so pretty it has little circles half moons and half circles oh it's full moon half moon full moon half moon and toenail me I also bought this which is actually from new look and it's an arm cuff now I've never worn an arm cuff before or maybe I have when I was really young and I have quite little skinny arms definitely need to work out more so I don't know if this will fit or not but it's so pretty and I guess the only way of you finding out is to cut it off but then I don't know if I can return it if I do cut it off so but it's really pretty it has like a dream catcher on it and then lots of little leaves so we shall see if that fit and then another thing I actually have one for a really long time is an anklet do you remember the good old days of anklets I feel like I used to wear them all the time that and toe rings but this was just a really pretty one again this is new look and there's a lot going on here and my ankles are pretty skinny so we'll see how this looks but if there's any placing get away with wearing an anklet I feel like it's on holiday although to be honest if I did get away with wearing anklets any day of the week I so would on to shoes okay so the first pair of picked up were these I am NOT the biggest lover of flip-flops but I like something that's really easy to slip on and off at the pool or on the beach because I hate like fiddling around with buckles or tie up straps etc etc and these look perfect because you can literally slip your foot in slip your foot out they're metallic which is great and I don't remember how much these were but these are just a sauce I think I don't really wear heels on holiday mainly because a lot of the like little towns and places that you visit are quite cobbled but there's not a lot of flat streets so I have gone for a tiny heel and also I'm loving this whole like espadrille type vibe but I don't know that I really like espadrilles so I feel like I've got a little bit of the espadrille nurse with this roping around the side but actually all they are is like the tiniest little wedge sandals with buckles so and also they're so light like so like I don't even feel like you'll feel as though you're wearing chunkier shoes so I just thought they were whoa so I just thought they would be quite nice for the evening or if I wanted a tiny bit of added height without wearing shoes because I read on to break my neck on holiday I also picked up these which I think will be really nice for the evening too you have a little toe section a lot of people don't like things between their toes which I feel you sometimes like I get it I sometimes I don't either but these were so pretty and these are ones that tie up your leg so you tie these there you go like that and then they tie up your leg and I just thought they would be quite pretty with shorts for going out in the evening I don't know they were just recal and then these last shoes were kind of an impulse buy and I can like here most people like reeling in horror at them because they're quite out there I guess but I have this thing with shoes where it me now and then I like to wear a pair of shoes that aren't just an ordinary pair of shoes and I feel like these go quite nicely into that category their little unicorn shoes look how cute these are but yeah uh how cute are they thank you that is everything I picked up from a sauce but let me know in the comments which things were your favorite and I will also leave links to everything I have mentioned where possible in the description box so if you liked any of this then check out the links give this video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and if you prefer to see me trying things on and I will see you again very very soon bye 
 Hello, everyone, teach you how to finish this look on my face today.   This makeup is the makeup that I will draw on a daily basis this winter.   Not much to say, my winter makeup tutorial started right away and I hope you like it   In terms of foundation, the most recent favorite is YSL Touche Eclat Le Teint number BR20.   I like this one, but I will mix it with Nars sheer glow mont blanc   Because I think my skin looks white when using YSL alone   So basically I'll use a two-click YSL foundation and press twice NARS foundation and then mix   Do not lie to you, I really use them directly from the cosmetic bag   I didn't wash or clean before. These brushes were used yesterday.   Although they are a little dirty, don't you mind? In fact, your brushes are actually dirty, right?   By the way, the brush used here is Sigma F82   Next is the concealer   The concealer under the eyes I use is Bourjois Radiance Reveal Concealer   I mentioned this many times before. It is one of my favorite concealers.   It is suitable for eye concealer, I love it   Put it under the eyes, and when I used Concealer it was really not polite   Especially the fundus concealer, I would rather use a little more   What's more, how can the eyelid concealer be excessive?   I will use the Collection Lasting Perfection Concealer color number Fair which is also very good   And cheap   Also well controlled   Here's the same brush to use to open up the concealer   When I only need to finish my makeup in 20 minutes, I will make this makeup   Ok Now I look like a ghost horse, and then go to loose powder steps   I'm using Pixie Powder, which is actually a complexion powder   I only use it in the T zone and on the cheeks, which is where it's easier to get oil   This is really a good powder, if you have less skin, then you want to use only a little powder.   A: You are fortunate (do you mean very little skin?) B: I think you like this, it's really good   Sometimes you will want a little more luster, especially if the weather is cloudy and cloudy in winter, the skin will look three-dimensional.   So I will use the highlighter, this is what I use throughout the summer   It is Hour Glass Ambient Lighting Powder shade Luminous Light   Only use a little bit   In the position I want to light up   You will feel that this powder really deepens the skin   I can't be sure...   ...tell it where it is, but it's really good   The brush used just now is Sigma F92   Next to repair   I still love to use Anastasia Beverly Hills Contour Kit   These are all powdery, with tinted colors and highlight colors   They are completely matte, so I like it very much   The brush in the repair is my very dilapidated...   MAC   Really wish I knew what this is, is it 263?   169?   168?168!   I think I should add a new brush to my Christmas gift wish   Alfie (boyfriend's name), if you are watching...   This angled brush will be great!   I usually use this color in the middle, then stick it on the brush   Do not know how to turn TT like zoe did   This looks terrible on the lens   Oh, it's not good.   I don't really know how to repair it   But I do think it has a look that makes it look different   Then I want to modify the double chin   Before you say I don’t have a double chin, if I don’t believe it, I can show you my double chin   There are some angles I seem to have double chin   I hope to give you some makeup suggestions in these videos   But I just showed you how I made up   And then it doesn't mean that this is the method that is right for you   But for me it's right now   Then with Charlotte Tilbury Blusher Brush, I'm going to come up with a little...   Marc Jacobs's Blush, T/C Tantric 102   I also love being very obsessed with this   Then come gently on   I think contouring is my favorite part of the entire makeup process.   Because you will immediately look more life   Do you know what I want to say?   And then go back and use Mac168's brush and decided to call it because the number has been worn out.   Then come Becca Jaqueline Hill Champagne Collection Face Pallete   I'm still using this repair disk. It has been used since summer and is still used now.   This is reflected in its versatility and how much I love it.   This is easy to color   So be careful when using   Smile slightly   Then come a little high light   Dip a bit of this color   The color number is Champagne Pop   Then at the position of the cheekbone   Love it!   Basic finish finish   Now come on eye shadow   The bottom part I like to use Urban Decay eye shadow   The one I use is anti-aging   Because I'm going to be 27 soon and wrinkles around the eyes will soon come out.   Since wrinkles always appear, then you have this primer   How much wrinkles should be prevented   Why not use it?   The last one is on this side, the last one is on the other side   Do you know, I really use the eye to make a   I know many people will skip this step   But I think it will make the whole thing different   If you look closely, wrinkles are not on the eyelids   There are some under the eyelids   So it may be really useful   Or wrinkles around my eyes. For me, I'm still too young   This month's super love is basically the eye shadow that is used every day is Kylie Jenner Burgundy eye shadow tray   Oh my God   Look at these colors are so beautiful   The brushes used are very dirty Mac239   Eye shadow brush   Then click some of this   Shake off the extra powder   I will also put some color on the lower eyelid   Then use this Sigma E35 blooming brush   The colors to use are this, this, and this   Basically mix these three colors   Look at this color, wow   Then smudge it in the outer corner of the eye   After the location is drawn, it still looks a bit scary   So continue to smudge   This is the same brush, but for another, because it is relatively clean   Then come to bloom   All right   Then use the same color to draw the position of the lower eyeline   Bonding the gold on the eyelids   It looks like it's pretty autumn   But this is the makeup I've been painting all winter   and so...   Then in order to add a little brightness   Inside the eyelids   Use this color in the upper right corner   It should be called Naked   Next eyebrows   I think no eyebrows now look too strange   For the part of the eyebrows I'll mix two Mac eye shadows to use   The first one is carbon brown (Charcoal Brown)   The second is Mystery   Use Mac 266 brush to fill color   Also will use a benefic brow glue   To give them a fixed position   I think that makeup will look very weird until you get good mascara   The part of the eyelashes I use is Smith and Cult called the dance of eyelashes.   I really love it   But if you don’t like thick, full lashes   Then you should hate this because it is thick and has a massive feeling   It looks like that   Six months of mascara over there   So, it will do very quickly and I have spent one month   Then I already need to buy a new one, but I still love it   With this branch does not need to be on many levels   Lower eyelashes  嗒哒  At last   To use this Tarte Tartiest lip glaze   Bestie, I loved this one in November.   Because I really love this one   Like its texture color and durability   Super fans   All right   Well, this is my daily makeup in the last winter.   I hope everyone will find this video useful   Remember to like me   If you guys like this video   Then we will see you tomorrow. There will be a Christmas 24-day Zoella video tomorrow!   Goodbye!  
 Can I wear glasses in this video?   No you can see the ring lamp.   Hello everyone and welcome back to my channel!   Today I am going to make a favorite video   I'm not going to lie, this is probably   the most random assortment of items   that I once   have shown in a favorites video.   Where shall I begin?   I will start with the more normal stuff I think.   The first items I've loved lately have on my lips   there are actually only two   the first is from EM cosmetics   which I think is Michelle Phan's makeup line.   I'm not entirely sure. I should actually know that.   You are probably all screaming   to the television or the device on which you are watching this.   But yes, this is a favorite   It is a liquid lipstick that will not be a surprise for you   because that is almost the only thing I wear on my lips.   Besides my other favorite then.   It is called "French nude" and it is the most beautiful,   brownish, taupe nude color. It is the same as all the other nudes I wear on my lips.   It has a bit of a brown undertone   I think that's why I like it so much,   it gives you a 90s look.   It is very easy to apply, it smells good and lasts for a long time,   it is not too dry on the lips.   Whenever I find a brand that meets all my requirements,   do I have to share it with you,   because you have to know because these are the kind of liquid lipsticks you should wear.   So yes .. I am very happy with this.   The next product is a Tanya Burr lipstick.   I am so proud of my friend Tanya because she makes products that are really great,   so I'm actually just her number one fan.   But when she launched it, I knew I would be obsessed   with this lipstick in special   because the color fitted so well with me.   And the color is "bear hug".   It's this very beautiful,   kind of,   how would you describe this?   Pinkish, skin-colored   coloring. It is pink and it is skin-colored   just like any other lipstick I have in my collection.   Except for the color I have on today, because I have a red lipstick once.   I love it, I love it so much. Tan, well done!   Now that we're talking about Tan,   in terms of smells I am in love with the "coutesey of tan".   It is the "by rado super cedar" eau de parfum.   She carried this fragrance   when I saw her for my birthday.   When she entered the room, I smelled her and asked her which fragrance she was wearing. I have to buy it.   It smells like .. it is not fruity,   it is not floral, it is a fresh scent and I love fresh scents.   Those are the smells I always grab.   Very euh   musky and I think a little unisex.   I would not think about it when a man would wear it.   I think it's a very nice smell.   So I have worn this fragrance for the last two months   and also these.   This is the - discusses -   Diptyque l'ombre dans l'eau   I hate to speak beautiful French words in a non-French accent,   because it just sounds bad.   Again it is a very fresh smell.   Sometimes I mix these two together   if I feel very mad (risky).   Euhm but yes, if you like fresh scents   and very nice bottles   then I think you're going to like it very much.   I definitely recommend these two   if you like fresh   smells.   I do not know how to describe them differently.   It is not fruity, it is not floral it is not sweet .. it is fresh.   And that's all I can say.   I have the ..... shampoo and conditioner every time   that I washed my hair in the past year.   I made up so many bottles of that stuff.   I could build my own house.   But recently I thought my hair was ready for change.   I got this is my mailbox and they looked interesting, so I tried them.   I also think that my hair has to get used to the other kind of water that is here where we live now.   The water is slightly harder   what I was used to when I was in Wiltshire.   We had quite hard water there.   At least that's what I think. My father or mother could see this and say, "No, we did not."   But I'm almost certain that it was,   because the limescale was very different there.   And I think that's hard water.   Or is that soft water?   And when I moved here   my hair thought what is this?   Fluffy, weird hair.   I had not had such hair for a long time.   I thought something was wrong with me, my hair was like that   dry and fluffy.   In my whole locomotive.   Today I have blown my hair   and therefore it is not so fluffy today.   But my lock was so fluffy. It was either the water or   the mix of water and the extremely hot weather that we had when we moved here.   But I did not like it.   So I used masks   and well taken care of my hair,   what I probably should have done before.   But we all know that that's easier said than done.   But well, long story short. My hair became fluffy and I changed my shampoo.   To see what happened.   Use this! It is fantastic, I love it!   It is for dry hair   and it's the 'botanicals fresh care range'   from L'Oréal Paris and it is the 'Safflower Rich Infusion' shampoo and conditioner.   Oeee, I've already used a lot of this.   I use more conditioner than shampoo, so maybe this ratio is not the ideal ratio.   There are no silicones, parabens or dyes.   It brings back the softness.   I think my hair liked this very much.   It also smells so good!   It is a fresh scent.   It is a fresh scent.   It almost smells like mint, I can not explain it.   Maybe that safflower smells so.   I have honestly never heard of safflower, but yes, I love these things.   If you watch my vlogs, you may have noticed that Mark and I went to Boots   and have bought super.   That gave so much satisfaction.   I like to go in there every now and then   and throwing things in your basket that you have never tried before.   And this   was a recommendation from Mark, he said that I would really like this.   He was right. It is as if he is one of my best friends and knows me very well.   He just knew that I would like it.   It is the Imperial Leather Foam Burst   Luxurious Body Wash '   with nourishing shea butter and orange blossom.   I thought it might make my skin dry, so   I was not too enthusiastic, but when I finally used it   Oh my Goodness,   it is awesome! It's so   thick and foamy.   You would probably wash your whole body with a pump here.   He's almost done, so that's not what I do,   but it could be.   I'm always a bit too happy of that pumped.   So yes,   Thanks for that Mark.   In the field of skin care have not done much else, except   that I really really   have minimized.   I take everything off, I clean it and I moisturise.   And that's it. And I think my skin is actually very happy with that.   So I used several cleansers to remove my make-up,   but the second cleanser I use now is the   '' Oskia London Renesance Cleansing Gel '',   that I have already used and liked very much,   but I completely forgot him until I went to Anna and Lily's   podcast listened, which is called '' at home with ''   which I really liked the last two months.   You must definitely listen to that, I place a link in the information box.   Together with the links to all products.   She interviewed a lady who   eh   the founder of   from '' Ozkia Beauty ''. And I really enjoyed listening to that   and to learn more about her and the brand.   And it reminded me of this again   to use and I and I did   think it's really great.   I have had a lot of fun using it and I think my skin finds it too.   Something from the more random things.   And I have to do this first, because it is melting   and that's a big hint,   Mars Bars ice creams   Oh my god.   I like Mars bars, they are great,   but Martian ice creams are like Mars bars,   but ten times as good through the ice.   The caramel is sticky,   and they are less nauseating and they are great.   I actually did this every day during the past month.   I mean, there are worse things I could eat,   probably not much worse things, but   these are tasty, great.   If you are new to my favorites,   I often do random food products in the video that I really liked.   Most people think that they are #spon or #ad (sponsored), but they are not.   I just love it with you   to share the snacks that I like very much.   More snacks that I like very much,   are the Nature Valley's 'Crunchy Cereal Bars'.   Eh, de, my favorite is the 'Canadian Maple Syrup'   my second favorite is the '' Honey &amp; Oats '', '' Oats &amp; Honey ''   My third favorite is the '' Gingernut '' and my fourth favorite is the '' Cinnamon '' '.   I have a nice assortment.   I only have this to show, because I have already created all those,   but I do not eat it for breakfast, I want to say that.   I have a nice, good breakfast.   I eat it around 11 o'clock.   So you've had your breakfast and it's not a lunchtime yet, so   You do not want your lunch yet, but you want a little snack.   Just to give you energy.   Then I eat this. Not every day, only if I feel like it.   This one is also very tasty,   these are the Belvita breakfast biscuits.   They are super tasty. This is the milk variant and is not my favorite.   I like the chocolate variety very much,   but the milk variant is also fine.   Ehm ...   So yes breakfast bars / cakes,   namely the Nature Valley and the Belvita.   A kind of fashion favorite,   loafers. Yes, loafers.   Do you remember the Primark Haul video in which I bought a few loafers?   This one, and I thought hmmm I do not know.   I do not think I'm cool enough for this.   I do not know what to wear.   And I asked you to send me pictures of people they were carrying and rocking.   And you did that and I was inspired,   but also ... er ... one of the main reasons why me   loafers much more am going to wear is because   we walked a lot inside and outside, especially during the move,   dragging a few boxes back and forth,   and leave Nala in the garden and then go back inside.   Our kitchen is adjacent to the garden so we often have to go from the kitchen to the garden to the kitchen.   And loafers are perfect for that,   because   you just put your feet in and go.   I have become rather lazy   and I wear them with everything. These two are from New Look.   I just bought them.   To see from the fact that I only removed the sticker from one foot.   Who would have thought, even my slippers are loafers.   I want comfort.   I'm really looking forward to autumn, but   I do not feel like I might not be able to handle it,   maybe that's too cold.   These items may make you think that I have become a household queen,   what,   maybe it is.   These, I find these things really great.   This seems like a #spon again, but it is not.   I know people who have #spon ads with these things, because I've seen them there.   And Louise told me that I should buy it, because she had also seen a #spon advertisement about these things.   And it smells incredibly tasty.   This is my new favorite. This is my second bottle in about a month.   This is the '' Method Anti-Bac All Purpose Cleaner '',   with rhubarb, hmmmmm!   hmmmmm   It smells so good!   I probably would not have to suck all-purpose cleaner straight from the bottle,   low times ....   And something else that I love and actually always recommend to everyone   and it's weird that I have never put it in a favorites video, because   I always tell all my family and friends that they should take this and this kind in particular.   These are the '' Dettol Power &amp; Fresh Advanced Multipurpose 'wipes.   They do the same as the spray, you can do things with it, it's very easy.   I just love wipes, they are handy.   And these are the ...   And this is the pomegranate and lime scent   and yes, they smell as good as it sounds.   Oh, love!   So my kitchen always smells like pomegranate and rhubarb and I am very happy with it.   One more thing that I think is at the top of the list of best things I've ever put into a favorites video   My vacuum cleaner!   Oops, I should have just emptied him before I recorded this video.   Well, at least it shows how much it can store and that I really use it.   We have two in house.   These are the wireless Dyson vacuum cleaners.   I think they are fantastic. This is my pink for in the office.   This is so strange, I put a vacuum cleaner in my favorite video.   Well, whoee!   You charge them on the wall, there are several   ends that you can use.   It collects here and you empty it.   You have two positions, you have max and even stronger.   So the max and the power power.   If you have it on the highest level,   you can do a disappointing short time.   That's why I thought maybe I should not put it in my favorites,   but on the other stand   it still sucks everything up   and you can really do a long time with it.   And I am very happy with that, because I am   hate threads.   And it is light and I can lift it up and down the stairs and hold it heavy   or to use. And it is pink and I love it.   I love this vacuum cleaner!   If you are looking for a new vacuum cleaner   you can really consider this.   Before I go I thought it would be fun to name something that is so exciting.   And I do not think I talked about it. I have tweeted about it   and I put it on instagram stories, but I think you should know about it   and now have to buy a ticket before it is sold out.   Me and many of my friends and many others   great creators are all working on a new,   cool, live event.   It's called "Hello World" and maybe you've already heard other people talking about it,   but it is not like something that has ever been before.   I'm probably not the best person to explain this, but   I put the link to the website in the information box.   And I will do my best to explain it to a time when you understand it well.   But it is not a traditional meet &amp; greet situation.   It is more that we are all chilling out there.   And Hello World is something that has not been done before.   And it gives us the opportunity to chill in a more normal way and environment.   All information is linked below, but it is in Birmingham,   it is on 28 &amp; 29 October.   I believe there are still a number of tickets available.   Which means you can still meet us by the way.   Many people think that it is only for VIPs, no, no, no!   We will walk around,   there will be fashion shows,   cooking stages.   I would like to have a Zoë zone   or a Zoë-chill tent,   where people can have a bit of silence,   because for me personally   with the experience of meet &amp; greets   and knowing that some of you, my followers, suffer from anxiety disorders,   and such situations can be a bit overwhelming.   So I want that there is such a place where someone can go to relax.   And give them the feeling that there is a space they might not have on other, traditional meet &amp; greets.   So I am very happy to be part of that.   I am here and many of my friends are there, as I said.   There is one big main stage and that is one   big house.   It really gets too crazy and I'm so excited about it!   And I really want you to be part of the first edition.   Of course we hope that a lot more will come,   but I think you really want to be at the first edition and want to participate.   And I believe the tickets are for sale in two different places.   So I leave the links to the tickets in the information box.   So be sure to look at that.   There will also be things like live performances and live podcasts.   Bins, pranks,   ehm, just that much happens.   Believe me, you have to be there,   you have to get a ticket before they are sold out.   And I'm really looking forward to seeing you all there!   So yes, that's Hello World. Look at it   and now I'm done!   These were my favorites.   I really hope you enjoyed it. It feels good   to be back and talk about things that I like   whether that is Mars ice cream or my vacuum cleaner.   As always, I like to find out what you liked this month. Thanks for looking,   thanks for watching, give the video a thumbs up if you liked it   I see you again very soon! Bye!   As always, I would love to find out tffff ...   I want to make a thumbnail with my vacuum cleaner in it.   Okay, okay. This is going to look like   I do not know, it's going to be very random, is not it?   The Mars ice cream, au!   Okay, oooh!   How can I hold that vacuum cleaner and the Mars ice cream?   I do not think I can.   I want to eat this.   No actually not. I do not know.  
hello everybody I hope you are having a fantastic start to the week today I'm going to take you through some of my February favorites which actually for once I have quite a lot of beauty items I've been using a lot of product I've made it my goal this year to mix up my makeup bag a lot more frequently so I'm fruit Chloe but they're really weird so that I'm trying different products therefore I will find favorites more quickly and I won't stick to what I know and love all the time the first thing I have been absolutely loving is the pixie and Caroline Hiram's double cleanse cleanser I actually have two of these on the go at the moment I don't know how I ended up with two but I am very thankful basically if you don't know you Caroline hirings is she is my friend and also I talk about her across all my social channels for years because she's my go-to person for skincare anything skincare related her blog is amazing I will leave a link to it down below there's so much useful information about skincare products and skincare in general but I find personally extremely helpful so I think you will too and when I knew she was bringing out the cleanser I instantly knew I could trust it because I trust her opinion a hundred percent so I don't think it's any surprise to anyone that I've thought in love it on one side you've got the solid oil and on the other side you've got the cream and you do the oil side first I only normally take like a tiny bit and this melts your makeup off so well like honestly I just have to put a tiny bit on my eye and all my eye makeup has gone and then after that you do the cream cleanse just to kind of remove the oil and remove anything that's left on your face and my skin has been loving it it's not scented it doesn't have anything in it that would irritate your skin and I think that is why I've got on so well with it because it's just a really good no-nonsense product and I'm obsessed the next thing I've been really liking is this which was actually on Poppy's recommendation and it is the pharmacy with an F rise and shine daily moisture lock with echinacea green envy this I got on cult beauty and it's a brand I haven't really ever heard of before but pop you mentioned it to me I really like their packaging it's amazing it's got a little wooden lid you want to come out boy that's not because surprise anyone is it it's like she always knows when I'm filming a body videos and so I ordered one of these because I've been absolutely loving my Charlotte Tilbury moisturizer but I do feel like using it every day it can become quite heavy so I wanted something that was a little bit light that I could use on kind of alternate days or what have you I absolutely love it I don't know how to explain the texture of this is kind of it's obviously it's like creamy and it's like this really light kind of cocky green color it does have quite a like different smell as well like I've been really trying to get used to this but the consistency is kind of like creamy elasticy I can't explain it but I have oh I just scuff it up my nail I said well I haven't had any kind of oily or dry patches throughout the day and yeah this is holding up really really well I also find that makeup sit three nicely on top of it as well next up is a whopping huge hand cream this is buy it lots of time I hate when you have to like pronounce something in French without it being like a French sentence like I've done French since I was really little so I would say if I'm trying to actually sound French I do an okay accent but when I'm trying to read like a beauty product off of a pass off of the packaging it just never found right very dry skin intensive hand balm oh my goodness January or February for my hand has been absolute torture I get really cold hands and with that my skin also cracks to the point where my hands are like bleeding because they're cracking so much of itself absolutely vile but that's just the way it goes and so my hands have been like terrible this year I don't know why but they're like the worst they'd be in a really really long time so I needed something that was way more heavy-duty than my hands were ever used to and I got this in my pa box and I was like this sounds good intensive hand balm for very dry skin I like the sound of that so I've been putting this on my hands every evening or when I feel like my hands are really dry throughout the day and it is amazing if you suffer with really dry skin maybe on like your elbows or your knees or like on your feet or anywhere that you get dry skin you should really try this especially just like slathering it on overnight when you wake up in the morning you're like oh my gosh my hand can breathe it's such a thick it's more like ourselves than like a cream but I really really like it have two items in hair the first of which is the daven and I mean this just doesn't really have a name it just is going out this is a medium hair spray this is a medium hair spray it's a workable shiny look and that's it more in size maybe it's the more inside 1000's more inside I don't know but it's a debonair hairspray and daven s is one of my favorite hair care brands I'm obsessed with their shampoo and their conditioner it basically might go to and I was going to shoot recently and my hairdresser used this on my hair and I was like what is that hair spray it smells insane it smells so good I can't even describe what that smell is it's like sweetly floral I can't explain it but it smells so good and also I just really like the whole so because it's medium and it's workable you can sort of add as much as you want but then you can also brush it out or brush it into a certain look which I really like because I'm not the biggest fan of crispy hairspray so this is incredible and then she was kind enough to let me have dessert for the shoot because I was like I need to write this down where did you get it she was like you have this one so I've been using this like every day since I got it the next thing I've also been really loving is this this is actually a travel size but it's the way haircare dry shampoo I don't know what it is about this dry shampoo but I really like it there's no like white residue in the hair it's also I think it's because it's the only dry shampoo I've really used where it feels like you don't have dry shampoo in your hair which I know for some people they want because dry shampoo can add quite a lot of texture and make it slightly easier for you to spoil your hair but when you brush this through it genuinely feels like you could have just washed your hair like it still has that very kind of like lightweight kind of you can run your fingers quite easily through your hair feel and I haven't really found that with any other dry shampoo so I really like this is just my little travel version and I took away with me it's like half empty and it nearly gone so I do need to get a full sized moving on to makeup I think quite a few people talked about this palette but I hadn't really considered purchasing it because I knew I already had quite a lot of eyeshadow palettes with very similar colors and I thought no Zoe be a bit more self restrained you don't need to get this palette and then loads of people were tweeting about it like oh my god this is the best part of ever use and I was like do it now I need to order it and it's the modern renaissance anastasia beverly hills palette firstly the packaging is lovely it's got like this felt casing and then you open up and you've got a nice mirror and i'm actually quite a nice brush which i have used to be fair normally i throw away two three brushes because i don't use them i don't really like that it's double ended i don't know what it is but I don't like double ended brushes I don't know why it makes sense but I don't like them and these are the beautiful colors which yes they're quite autumnal but I don't care I've never used Anastasia I had aged before but my god they blend beautifully they're so creamy and they're so pigmented ma what you doing they're beautiful but they also really blend nicely together which are quite like so yes beautiful eyeshadows in gorgeous berry tones and everything you could ever need even like this one what is a matte shade which I do find like creamy colors in a matte shade you don't really see on your eyes look at that can you see that that's like insane pigment and then not chalky they're found the color payoff really really good Oh lost my double-ended brush the next thing I've been really loving is this which is the Too Faced past I don't peach blush which comes in this cute packaging you may have seen it in my Pierre box video and it smells of peaches which isn't necessary because it doesn't mean you're going to love the product but I love the product so the fact it's multi cheese is just kind of like an added bonus I love it it can packaging because I feel like it laughs really really well in my makeup bag really easy to clean sturdy but I also just love the pigmentation the color this color is beautiful and it has like a slight highlighting Sheen to it which i think is also why I've been really enjoying it because you don't necessarily need a highlighter when you put this on it gives you quite like a healthy glow and I've been using this every single day since I received it so definitely have to teach it into my face another thing I wanted to mention which I think I have already mentioned before in a video I've been loving it and actually like verbally recommending it to everyone who I've been with in like the last couple of months is the naked skin concealer by Urban Decay this concealer on spots or blemishes is the best thing ever it's a liquid concealer it blends really well it lasts really well and the coverage is insane so if you haven't already checked this out I would really recommend it they do really good range of different colors as well and yeah it's incredible last thing in beauty of these nails now you guys know I'm not very good at nails I never look after my nails it's the one thing I suck at wear my new year's resolutions was to take better care of myself like physically I've been getting spray tan I've been moisturizing my body and doing my nails and one thing that has made life so much easier when it comes to nails are these these are the nailin 200 for cover nails in petite square I don't have to do anything to these nails I get the glue I stick them on and because I have really tiny little nail beds I sometimes struggle with a really pretty ones that come in like two sizes because they don't all fit I mean I can make them sort of fit but I end up like filing them down and it takes a really long time and then by the end of it and they thought I've just painted my actual nails but these I think are like perfect they don't look like I'm really wearing any false nails because there are really good size and shape for my nails and I love them they come in many different sizes you've got one two three four five six so twelve different sizes and these will last you so long because there's so many each size and it comes with the nail glue and it comes with a little nail file as well so if you did want to file them down a little bit you can but I don't find out ever need to do that and then I can just paint them in whatever color I like and I would say these last four days without one of them pinging off depends like how much you use your hands though but I've had these on for like four days there's no problem on the fifth day I might lose one but then you've got the glues you can stick it back on or you can stick on a new one just paint one nail and yeah I've just found that I've looked after my nails a bit more because I've got these my natural nails are just not great and one thing I'm really bad at is that I pick and chip off my nail polish and then I may as well have not done it so having false nails which you can't peel the nail polish off of and they don't chip is amazing and also just my nails in general don't grow and they're not very strong so the only way I'm going to ever have nice-looking the nails is with falsies so I really really like them one other thing I thought was worth mentioning was broad Church I am so excited that broad church has started again it's the Serie three I actually binge watch series one and two again a couple of months ago with alfie just to kind of get caught up on it but it was without a doubt my favorite TV series in a really really long time when that came out so when they said they were doing a series three oh so excited and that started so I just thought I was worth mentioning there because most of February I was excited for broad church and then it finally started if you haven't seen it before watch it on I think they have on Sky box set and they might have it online I'm not too sure but you can also buy the DVDs but I would definitely recommend watching series 1 and 2 before you start on series 3 and so far there's only been one episode so you don't have you're not like missing out on too much of series 3 so far but the first episode was in saying I can't wait for more like the soundtrack the way they film it the actors and actresses just everything about it I absolutely love oh and I didn't actually explain what it is so it it's kind of like a crime drama kind of thing like it's all very like whodunit which is like my favorite thing to watch on TV so love it anyway I really hope you guys have enjoyed this video and let me know in the comments as always what things you've been loving or if there's anything else you think that I will love I have actually read comments in past videos where you've all told me different TV series I should be watching so I have made a list of those not I have any time right now to be starting on new TV series but I do take your recommendations into account so thank you for that give the video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and I will see you again next week for another video [Music] 
hello everybody today I am going to be showing you my current makeup storage and collection I'm not going to bother doing a disclaimer because as you guys know I get sent a fair few things which is so so lovely and also I buy too much so that is why I have a lot of makeup this video has been really highly requested since my last one which I believe was around two years ago now maybe yeah two years ago so I think it is very overdue I'm going to be taking you through all my makeup drawers and sharing with you some of my favorite bits and pieces and I hope you enjoy it first thing you'll notice is the set of drawers I feel like everyone and their mum has these drawers I know so many people who love them and use them and these are actually from Urban Outfitters you can get a lot in there but not too much and you don't kind of get over flooded with makeup items which are quite like them first drawer we have here is foundations not going to lie this is the messiest drawer I have because I find foundations really hard to organize there's just no good way of doing it some are too tall some are an odd shape some don't stand up at all so at the moment I've just thrown them all in but I will talk you through a couple of my favorites first favorite is this one which is Tarte rainforests of the sea I absolutely love this foundation its water-based and it just gives a really nice coverage I also really like that the way to apply it is with a really huge dropper it's just really good another of my favorites which is better if you're on a budget is the Rimmel match perfection you guys know how much I love this foundation it's kind of my go-to if I'm not really loving the foundation that I'm wearing I'll always go back to this one and because it's such a good price you can't go wrong another favorite that I have a backup of because I am always running out it's my trusty NARS sheer glow I don't have anything more to say on it because I feel like I've bored you all with the reasons that I love it so it's just a really great foundation so I feel like I have a really good mixture of shades coverages for summer for winter different effects whether it's kind of more glowy or a bit more matte are pretty much for everything here but I could ever need and more next one is one that I love so much this is I palette specifically smaller eye palettes so have two for palettes because I just have so many and I'm going to say palettes one more time palette these ones are kind of smaller more handbag size travel size friendly all two really big ones that won't fit in here I've got the NYX or NYX ultimate shadow palette a really nice selection of Tanya burr palettes in fact I think I have all of Tanya's eye palettes I love them this is my NARS duo in is old which are some of the most beautiful shades for autumn a little bit gross because I've had it's so long oh I love these these are the Too Faced palettes this one which is one of my absolute favorites this is the peanut butter and jelly palette which is beautiful and it smells of peanut butter and jelly because why not and then this one which I use a lot which is natural eyes just has some really nice very neutral shades in it I reach for that one quite a lot the next drawer is also a drawer but I am obsessed with because it houses my liquid lipstick so you guys know how much I'm obsessed with liquid lipsticks I feel like I've loved them for a while but this year there's been a lot a lot of different brands bringing out a lot of amazing new ones so this is where they all live as you can see this is completely full of different brands and different colors I do have some form of structure to this this is generally the side where I keep my kind of more pinks and nudes I have some Tanya burr matte lips this is in Martha mu which is one of my faves I love it I also absolutely love these these are the Too Faced melted matte liquefied matte long-wear lipstick which is like the biggest tongue twister in the world these are amazing I pretty much live in these so this one is in sell out I also have where are all my others probably in my handbag another brand that absolutely got for liquid lipsticks is color pop I could rave about these all flippin day I absolutely love them they're just really long-lasting they're not too drying and they have some really amazing colors I also absolutely love these which are the NYX liquid suede lipsticks these are great they're not as long-lasting but they're also not as drying and I just feel like they have a really nice consistency so I've got quite a few of those and I've got a couple of lip glosses at the back I've got a Kylie gloss in so cute very milky and I've got some Tanya burr lip glosses in the top left hand corner I also have some metallic lip colors I've not been able to pull these off successfully yet or have I I think they look really cool but I'm still a little bit undecided so I've just got a little corner for those because I can't bear to throw them away just yet these are my big eye palette so I have quite a selection we've got Urban Decay Naked palette it's some Too Faced palettes this is one of my personal faves is the Too Faced sweet peach palette really nice shades I also have my Mac palette I have two this one is completely full and this one I still have two more to fill and I don't know how I haven't filled it yet but I don't really reach for these as much as I used to I feel like I fallen in love with other eyeshadows more than Mac ones but I can't bear to part with these because there are still days when I need a Mac would winked on my eye I have a couple of steal of palette actually this one I've had for a while this is just the natural eyes eye shadow palette but I really love Stila eyes shadows especially kitten which is this one I actually have it on today they're just very soft and very creamy and very easy to blend so if you're looking for something like that stealer has some really great ones this is also a stealer palette little bit of an upgrade I think they decided that the cardboard packaging was not very long-lasting but again just really lovely neutral shades you'll notice within my makeup collection that I don't tend to steer away from neutral eyeshadows all that much I do have a couple of palettes that have some more kind of out there colors like some of the Urban Decay palettes are amazing for like really bright vibrant colors but I don't tend to use them as much though I stick to what I know and love which is generally a brown or a beige or a taupe I also have a NARS palette NARS eyeshadows again are some of my favorites I absolutely love them this is a narcissist palette it has a really nice array of oh my goodness neutral shades also worth noting Too Faced chocolate bar palettes are amazing they smell chocolate and have some really nice pretty shades in there as well lipsticks embarassingly this is not where I house all my lipsticks most of my lipsticks are in my vanity but this is where I like to keep my lipstick crayons mostly color pot now as I mentioned color pop do amazing liquid lipsticks they also do really amazing lipstick crayons or as they like to call them lippie stix handbag friendly looks like a highlighter really long lasting really amazing and they have them in every single shade you could possibly imagine which I seem to have in this drawer all tiny little handbag sized ones but are the cutest thing I have ever seen you have on one side a tiny little lip liner and on the other side the actual lipstick crayon also on this side I have some other brands I have this one which you guys know I absolutely love through the summer which is the word about beauty lip pencil duo in Fionna loved that again it has a lip pencil on one side and then the lip crater on the other NARS do amazing lip crayons this one is in the shade dragongirl which is a really gorgeous red I also have a new range actually by sleek which are their power plump lip crayons in lots of different shades this one looks pretty very burst ooh I like the sound of him got couple of Burberry ones in there as well for if you love high-end goes on and on next draw is highlighters and contour kits all this one's heavy there is a lot of contour and highlight goodness in here mineralize skinfinish soft and gentle classic highlighter very pretty I've used this a lot I feel like this could be my third one or really pretty bronze goddess highlighter which I actually haven't used possibly forgot this existed through the summer but let's tell you that it's pretty got some here contour and highlight sticks by color part and these ones are Becca hourglass do the most amazing highlighters you will ever see this one's incandescent strobe light this just looks amazing on your cheekbones Becca also do some really nice highlights this one's actually a cream one I'm still undecided on whether I really like cream products whether that's cream blush cream bronzer or cream highlighter but I do have a couple but you will notice I really don't have a lot of cream products in here this is basically what I've been living in it's my Becca Jaclyn hill palette you've all seen it before amazing we've got the Anastasia contour kit which I love I also use this pretty much daily I like to use these two colors here bit of contour on the old cheekbones that's what I've gone for today Kiko James Reed hourglass again so beaut look at that oh this is the ambient lightning edit all tap does anyone remember how much I used to use this this is amazing look at those highlighting powders they're so pretty love that I feel like I've got a really great selection of everything you'd need to contour and highlight in their blushes so this looks a little bit more organized we have some benefit this is actually a Christmas collection a while back actually cheeky sweet spot is a little tin house which is just the cutest thing ever and it has all the benefit blushes in it so very useful and it means I don't have to have them all individually NORs again amazing blushes in palette got kind of all the ones that most people like and they're these are my favorite packaging of all time and these are the Too Faced blushes and they remind me of little Polly Pockets and I think that's why I love them so much even if I didn't like one of the shades I couldn't get rid of it because all of them together just looks cute I wish more packaging look like this they have tiny little rabbits on them and they look so cute also really liked these baked ones by Too Faced they're kind of more of a highlighter and a blusher all-in-one but they're also very pretty some jooa some Kiko Charlotte Tilbury Urban Decay an hourglass love these ones but again they're a bit more on the shimmery side though it completely depends on what you liked one cream shadows this draw is actually not really that soul I mean it's full enough but I thought it would be a bit more RAM pack I've got some really brightly colored color pop ones which I'm not really too sure what I'm going to need them for but it's that sort of product where if you're doing like a Halloween look or you're going to a fancy dress you're going to be like where's my bright orange and the answer is in the cream shadow draw alongside the blue the purple the yellow the green and the white and also some more wearable shades like this one which is get paid and that's a really pretty kind of coppery shimmery color which is very nice if you're going to use it for a base under eye shadow also have quite a few of the by Terry ombre black star shadow sticks this is one of my faves this is brown perfection I have used this so many times in videos and just generally day to day I like these when I'm trying to be really quick so I'll just smear this all over my eye and blend with a two and seven by Mack and I think it looks like you've made a lot of effort when you haven't got a couple of Burberry ones in there as well I also really like the Charlotte Tilbury color chameleons they're great they target these two specific eye colors which i think is really cool although I use ones for all the different eye shades and I don't think it really matters too much I've also got some estee lauder parts some Charlotte Tilbury and I have two little pots of glitter in case I fancy going all out with a bit of glitter onto the bronzes a little bit more organized got big ones at the back like this one which is by Marc Jacobs which I just think looks amazing actually haven't used this yet but I'm very excited to I have really of the Clarins summer ones I love when they bring these out I think they're amazing they're so pretty inside and also I find Clarins get the colour of bronzer really spot-on I also have quite a lot of the two-faced bronzers because they are matte and although it's quite nice and so much have a bit of Sheen and a bit of gold shimmer in your bronzer it is nice also to have some matte alternatives and I find that two-faced have quite a good range of different matte bronzer shades so I think I've got about three in here hourglass this is ute I lived in this in the summer this is radiant bronze in light and it's so pretty we've got a benefit some wire sell and my trusty L'Oreal on two primers now this looks a bit of a mess too but you're just kind of throwing it all in there I don't tend to use primer too much which kind of is a bit baffling considering I have so many in here I also have some like CC creams and things in here as well we've got two-faced hangover primer benefit Porefessional which I know is a hit with quite a lot of people lots and lots of primers false nails I mean what is there to say about false nails apart from that these are the ones that I have for emergencies or when I feel like I hate my nails so I can either put some plain ones on I like these ones elegant touch totally bare square and then I can paint them any color I want I also keep my top coats and like base coats in here as well and a viewer actually sent me these which are Christmas nail sweets it says Christmas nail sweets so I can string these up by Dale's how cute lay extras I really don't have much in here I've got a bourgeois nail polish remover which actually is amazing you kind of stick your finger in it and rub it around and then your nail polish comes off it also seemed to have some glow-in-the-dark body paint with a tiny little torch I mean if the occasion occurs I also have some henna tattoos and some of these by Lottie London festival gems that you can put above your eyebrows which i think is so cool and that's it in the extra-strong I've got more space nails I actually recently organized my nail drawer I think you'll be quite impressed we've got some neons by nails ink and any nail polish where the lid was upright I couldn't necessary see the colour unless I was going to kind of go down I've put a little bit of the nail polish on a white sticky label and stuck it on top so I can really easily see what I want and grab it without having to kind of route through too much useful little tip a couple of my faves this one Smith and Colt beautiful glitter oh my god is amazing it's called Vegas got some Opie eyes this is called no doubt about it very bright very cool we've got some nice nudes this one is by models own and it's called dare to bear very pretty that's my nail polish draw lashes it's just what it says it is it's them lashes we got some Tanya burr individuals the lower lashes Euler Ardell I actually really like our doll false lashes I also really like the ardell demi whispies as well they're really great kiss lashes are also some of my faves RiRi like those and there's some kind of more fun ones and flicky ones and your eyelash glue last one brushes and odd bits and pieces so you've got some extra large cotton wall pads these are the best thing you could ever buy never buy small ones never buy cotton wall balls always go to the baby section and buy the extra large ones because just trust me they're the best got some nail files and this is where I keep all my spare brushes so these ones are all clean and it means that if I need to clean my brushes I can come here and get clean ones this is my vanity unit or makeup table if you will this is actually a G plan I've got this on eBay I believe I just wanted something that looked a bit more retro and I really really loved it much to Alfie's absolute dismay because I don't think he's the biggest fan of it but I love it and it houses a lot more of my makeup and this is where I actually do my makeup I've got my makeup brushes here I brushes in one face brushes in the other and another little mirror for up close with some hand sanitizer and hand cream a little candle this top drawer houses all my lipsticks and all my lip liners there are a lot of things in here as you can see lipstick is my complete weakness I have a lot of it not even sorry about it I've done the same thing that I did with my nail polish and I put little swatches of the lipstick colors on top and I like to see what I've got when I'm trying to decide what lip color to have that day got quite a selection of different brands of lipsticks that I really like I really like Urban Decay Smashbox Rimmel got some YSL Charlotte Tilbury and couple of Mac my Mac collection has shrunk quite massively over the years I've got quite a selection of different lip balms in here and then some lip oils and lip treatments at the back and then I've got my lip liners colour-pop liners are amazing as our REM really liked their lip liners they're really great basically anything you need for your lips is in this drawer this one has everything for my eyes and eyebrows so we've got a little tray of mascaras my absolute favorite is the Maybelline lash sensational I flip in love this mascara so much I have some of these new ones by YSL this one's like a glittery navy blue it's really really pretty I don't know what I'm gonna wear it but I quite like it I've got some new ones I haven't tried yet so I've got this crk one which is called Wonder wand also love this one which is the l'oreal false lash sculpt this is a really great mascara in the next tray I have my liquid liners so I have L'Oreal Too Faced tart and then just a couple of gels I don't tend to use gel liner much but I have an urban decay one and a new one in there all these are back here are color pop single eyeshadows really like them this one is called Hot Tamale glow it in this one I've got everything for my brows so we've got a benefit browsing my Mac quad which to be honest is what I tend to reach for I mix these two together to form the correct shade my brows maybe brow drama Anastasia brow pomade this looks good I haven't tried this year and just a selection or pencils down the side as well I've also got another couple of kind of individual shadows around here and my eyeshadow primer we've got too faced shadow insurance and the Urban Decay primer potion these are my go-to eyeshadow primers also have all my pencils in here pencils that is that drawer okay love straw is this one the one underneath to be honest is full of empty makeup bags and no one wants to see that so this one has my powders and my concealers and correctors I've got my infamous NARS sheer glow absolutely love this foundation as I mentioned I also have all my concealers down the side I tend to collect concealers because I'm still the hunt for the perfect under-eye concealer I think I've come close with the radiance revealed by Bourjois this is amazing under your eyes I absolutely love it but also my trusty lasting perfection by collection is just brilliant absolutely love it the blemishes though Urban Decay Naked skin is so good if you've got a spot or blemish or a scar or you've got something that you want to cover up this will 100% do it it's really really good so I would highly recommend that I also have some other brands like Kat Von D NARS Charlotte Tilbury but these are the ones I tend to reach for the most we have some correctors got the Bobbi Brown corrector this is in the shade extra light bisque and we also have a pixie one as well haven't used this one yet but it looks really really nice then there's a couple of the Urban Decay color correctors I don't really know how to correct my skin tone well when I try and use these I legit look green so I have quite mastered that yet but one day I've got them in case anybody else comes to use my makeup and knows how to use them anyway what quite a selection of powders I love the hourglass powders this is the ambient lighting powder in luminous light often mistaken for a highlighter the it is quite glowy but I really really like that also got this quite recently this is the Kat Von D translucent setting powder this stuff is amazing I highly recommend that I quite like mineral setting powder I think for a lot of people it's a bit messy in a bit kind of all over the place I really like it I do also have some compact ones I have this one by Charlotte Tilbury which I really really like this is the airbrush flawless skin in number one fair and that's pretty much it in this drawer I kept it basically concealer and powder and then we've got a little tangle teezer just in case so there we go that is my makeup collection I really hope you guys enjoyed this video make sure to give it a thumbs up if you did and subscribe if you haven't already and I'll see you again very soon bye 
Hello everybody in today's video I wanted to do a get ready with me Starting from wet hair to this look. This for me is probably more of an everyday look because I don't mind rocking a bright red lip and Having a little bit of a sheen to my cheeks but if this is a bit out there for you then maybe you could consider doing this for a Christmas party or a Night out or to something a little bit more special this time of year This is a look that I will pretty much be sporting every single day, so I really wanted to do this video with you So you can see from start to finish how I did this So I hope you enjoy it! So the first thing I did was wash and blow-dry my hair. To wash my hair I use the pure ology hydrate shampoo and conditioner I've been really enjoying using this the conditioner has menthol in it, so it's really nice to use in the morning It's very refreshing and It makes your head feel very like Fresh kind of like when you go to the salon and someone else washes your hair for you That's what this feels like and I'm really enjoying it. It says It's for dry color-treated hair Which essentially is what I have so this has been working a treat. The next thing I did before I applied any heat to my hair was I put the Davines OI all-in-one milk all over my hair and just gave that a little brush through. I love this product I've talked about this before it's been in my favorites It's a multi-benefit beauty treatment with ruku oil, so I just gave that little spritz before a blow-dried I just find that it makes my hair easier to style and leaves it a little bit softer Then once my hair was dried I put a little bit of the OUAI hair oil Kind of just running it through my hair, mostly concentrating on the ends because obviously those are the drier parts of my hair, and I absolutely love this I love the smell of it It's great. Especially if you have colour-treated hair. And oil, I feel, is a must. Before I start styling my hair, I'm gonna put my Skincare products on now just so they've got a little bit of time to sink in before I start with my makeup So the first thing I'm gonna do is put on this serum. This is the Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo. I love this so much I've been using this every morning underneath my moisturizer and every evening before I go to bed And I think my skin is very appreciative of it. Okay, now that that is applied, I'm going to put on my moisturizer. This is the Tata Harper Clarifying Moisturiser for blemish-prone skin. I don't actually have much left of this, so hopefully it will come out... Please! There we go Face done! Okay, now I'm going to start on my hair. I am one of these people that always does my hair before I do my makeup I don't know why, because I feel like most of my friends do it the other way around And they do their makeup with their hair wet, and then they do their hair afterwards but I don't like to think that my wet hair will go on my makeup. I don't know - which order do you do it? I would love to know. I'm gonna curl my hair today because so many of you ask me how I curl my hair, what I use and which technique I use also, so I thought now would be a great time to show you, because I feel like, kind of party festive season, I tend to go with more of a -- like a curly look because I think it looks more done? And also, if you're anything like me and you don't wash your hair everyday, if you curl your hair, your hair looks better for longer, I think. So the tong that I currently use is the NuMe 5-in-1, which I have had for years and there's no, like, clamp or anything. It's just... the wand. I don't know the size of this. I think this is a one inch, maybe, but I find that this heats up very quickly it gets very very hot Therefore I think it makes the curls last a lot longer, and it also gives them more definition But it does mean you have to be very careful I have burnt myself a number of times because I haven't used the glove, so... It does come with a glove, I just, I don't know where mine is, I've lost it. First thing I do is, I section my hair because I have the thickest hair ever And it takes me a long time So I try and section it as much as I can because you don't want to take pieces that are too thick so I used a Scrunchie because a scrunchie is not as tight as a normal hair bobble, so it doesn't leave a kink. Well, it shouldn't, anyway. I try not to leave it in one section for too long. Then I just take one section that's about this big, and... Any pieces near my face I will do away like this. And then I leave it on there for about 20 seconds 20-ish seconds Then you let go Tada! Curl number one Take another piece of hair that is of a similar size And I'm gonna go the opposite way to the way I just went I also like to leave a tiny bit at the end because I think it looks more, like, beachy, if you leave a tiny bit of hair at the end like this, and it also gives you something to hold on to, especially if you're using a wand. There we go Do excuse Nala snoring in the background. She's obviously had a hectic night Once you have finished that layer, it's time to let loose and do another one. Again, any bits around your face take them away from your face Whenever I do this, I just have visions of me leaving it on for sightly too long, trying to take the wand away and it just breaking all my hair off like those horrible viral videos. Phew! Okay. And, once you have curled every little bit of your hair, you're gonna want to just run your fingers through it because it's very, like, static curly, at the mo. It's a bit prom curly, I like to say. And then I'm just going to use a little bit of this which is the OUAI Texturising Hairspray And I'm just gonna spritz that all over so that it gives it a little bit more definition and holds the curls a bit better. Very voluminous. Now it is time to start on the makeup, which is obviously my favourite bit. First thing I'm gonna do is put my foundation on. The foundation I'm currently loving and using is the Fenty Beauty Soft Matte Long-Wear Foundation in the shade 170. I think I might have to go down to the 160 soon because... my tan literally has "famooshed", but I'm making it work, and actually it does make me look a little bit more healthy, so I'm not opposed to that. I'm also using my Fenty foundation brush as well, which I still absolutely love. Foundation DONE! Next thing I'm going to use is - surprise, surprise! - the Collection Lasting Perfection Concealer because it's the best of the best, and although I try so many other concealers, this is the one I always find I go back to. Using the same brush, I'm going to blend that in. Or dab it in. Is this blending or dabbing? I think it's a bit of both. Now my base is done, I'm gonna go in with contour/bronzer, and for that I am using the Benefit Hoola because I think this colour... you can't really go wrong with this for a bronzer or a contour, I love it. And I'm using a Spectrum X Mean Girls brush. This one says, "You can't sit with us." It's just a really good little, like: Get it on the brush, give it a little tap. Although it's, like, wintery and this is more of, like, a festive look, I don't think you can go wrong with a bit of bronzer, really. Now I have two products that I want to use on my cheeks, although I don't know if this is gonna... be a bit of an overload, but this Fenty Beauty highlighter/blusher is so beautiful. It's called... which one is this? Chic Freak, and it's so pretty I'm talking about this one here because this one is slightly more shimmery. But then I also have this Hourglass one which is the Incandescent Electra Ambient Lighting Blush, and this is also very beautiful. Unless I put a little bit of this on it a little bit of this on top. Maybe I'll do that. Let's try that, see how that goes. I'm gonna use the same brush. That's definitely added some color as well, so that's quite pretty. I like that I think I am gonna go on top of it with a little bit of this, though. I think this is what's gonna take this look from, like, your daytime, festive look to your night out, Christmas party look, to be honest. Maybe, if you wanted, you could just leave it like this, but I'm not gonna go subtle. Whoa. Middle of the forehead, down the centre... Little bit on the chin. I like that, I think that's really, really pretty. Now I've completely done my face, it's time to move on to brows and eyes, which I think always bring a look completely together. When I think of brows, I mostly think of Benefit because I feel like they are the ruler of the eyebrows. They have like 10 products, 6 different shades. There's something for everybody. I've got a handful of products I never know which ones to go for because I love Brow Zings, Brow Zings is one of my favourites because you guys know how much I like to add in a powder, because I feel like it's really easy to give shape. I also always use this. This is the 24-hour brow setter. Love that, but I also have the "precisely" pencil, so I don't know whether to go for Brow Zings or the pencil, or maybe a little bit of both. I think I'm going to start with the pencil and do some very, like, fine hairs, and then I think I'm gonna go back over with the wax that comes in the Brow Zings which you can see I've, like, majorly dented. Right, I'm gonna use the little brush first. This is their little spoolie. I feel like spoolies are essential because you can... brush out the brows and see exactly where you stand. You guys know, whenever I'm giving beauty advice, it's always: get your brows done. By someone else. Banish the tweezers and go get them done. As well as all their products, Benefit actually do do eyebrows and they are amazing at it, so if you're not sure, go to Benefit and they can, like, sort your brows out. You will never look back, having someone else do your brows. The shade I'm using, by the way, is 4 because my brows are slightly more ashy in colour, so 4 is perfect for me. One brow done. I'm gonna do this one now. Using the wax on this side - again, this is in a 4, and this is also a little Benefit eyebrow brush - I'm just gonna put a little bit of the wax in the little sections where I'm trying to grow my brows, just so that it really holds the pencil in place, and I don't end up smudging it away. Now I'm going to use the 24-hour brow setter just to go over it and really lock them in place. So this is literally just a gel that you can brush through your brows, it's clear so it has no colour in it, and it just keeps them exactly where you want them. Okay, now brows are done, I'm going to move on to my eyes. I'm gonna pop a little bit of the Too Faced Shadow Insurance on my eyelids before putting on any... eyeshadow. The brushes I'm gonna use for my eyeshadow are the Clover brushes. They've got little, like, copper bases. I have four of them. I probably won't need four. But I am gonna start with this one to put down my first colour. And the palette I'm going to be using is this Too Faced palette. This is the... What palette is this, is it the Clover palette? "Inspired by their mini Chihuahua mascot, this limited edition eyeshadow collection features 18 brand new matte and shimmer shades in exclusive Clover packaging." So this is-- OW This is the Clover palette. There are some quite bright colours in here, which I'm probably gonna steer clear of. Not too sure about this yellow. But I'm mostly going to be focusing on these shades, I think, because I'm gonna go for a festive red lip, I don't want anything too wild on the eyelids. So, the colour I'm gonna pop all over my lid is this one, which is called Cuteness Overload. It's a very pretty, kind of, champagne-y pink. I am gonna put a little bit of this white, shimmery one called Puppy Eyes just on the very inner corner because it looks quite glittery, so I'm just gonna pop that there, just to open up the eye a little bit. Now, using a tapered blending brush, I am going to go in with this shade, which is called Paw Print. It's a matte, and I'm gonna go in the crease with this one. I might put a tiny bit of this darker colour called Cuddle Buddy in the crease, just the very outer. And I'm gonna do a little bit of this super highlight colour just under my brow bone, just to give it a highlight. Ooooh, beautiful. Using this slightly skinnier brush, I'm gonna take that same darker color, and I'm just gonna go a little bit under the eye. Those are the eyes at the moment. I am gonna go in with a bit of black liner. The liner that I am gonna use is the Stila Stay All Day waterproof liquid eyeliner. Okay, this one is way better than this one. Why does this always happen? Now it's time for mascara. The mascara I'm using is the Smith &amp; Cult Lash Dance mascara. Little bit on the lower lashes. This is actually quite a clumpy mascara, so if you don't like clump, you won't like that, but I like a bit of clump, so. Okay, and now there's only one thing left for me to do, and that is the old red festive lip. So, we have the ColourPop Ultra Matte Lip in the shade... Creeper. I use this quite a lot. I do like it. And there we go, that is my... festive party, pretty much everyday, like I would wear this every day myself, like you will probably find that I will be wearing this through most of December. I absolutely love it. It feels very festive, very glowy, and that is exactly what you want this time of year.

hi long time no see it actually does feel like a really really long time since I have like properly sat down and made a like talking to camera video because even in my Christmas videos a lot of those are pre filmed and they were filmed with people or they were baking videos so I feel like I haven't like sat down on this bed in a while but this is my first video back in 2018 I hope you all had an amazing new year and a great start to January I know we're on like the latter end of January but I hope it's been a great start so far for you I have been very busy working on lots of exciting things that are coming up this year and also just like taking a bit of a breather and trying to get my video making mojo back I do think it's important to give yourself a bit of space to kind of re-evaluate what you want to film and the type of content that you want to do and what it is that people want to see because so often it's like week on week you just you don't even think about it so that's kind of what I did at the start of January and now I'm feeling fresh and feeling good and I'm excited to make videos I've got a really long list of things I really want to film for you but if any of you have any suggestions things that I might not have done before I don't know maybe some slightly different avenues things that you've never seen you make a video about before or topics that you're interested in please let me know in the comments here or over on Instagram I would love to hear from you I do already have my list so I'm gonna make my way through that and then go through some of your suggestions and see if there's anything oh and see if there's anything else that I really want to film start off with I thought it would be nice to do a rundown of all my favorite beauty and makeup items of 2017 because that actually were quite a few and I've really enjoyed watching everyone else's videos of this and I just think it's a really nice testament to the products that you use and love because anything that you can sit in this video and say that you wholeheartedly adored through a whole year it's a product that I think should be on a fair few wish lists which is why when I've watched them I'm like this is definitely a product they really really loved because there are favorites videos and everything in a favorites video is like that monthly fave but anything that can like withstand the month and is something that ends up in like a yearly roundup is a product that is very highly recommended so yeah I've really enjoyed watching those and I'm gonna get started on a lot of the things that I have loved through the year and I will continue to love through 2018 I'm sure I'm gonna start with this because I do feel like did I use this in 2016 I don't know I think some of these items might have been featured in previous years but I've heavily used them this year so that is why they're being featured because that is the purpose of the video first item is the Smith &amp; Colt lash dance mascara I'm not gonna go on too much about this because I have talked about this an awful lot it's the sort of mascara that when you buy it new and you first use it it almost feels like a mascara at the end of its life if that makes any sense it's very thick it grabs every single lash it gives your eyes this really dramatic smoky lengthening thickening voluminous look and I absolutely love it it's kind of like a quick and easy clumpy looks like you've got four coats you've only got one type of mascara and for me that's perfect you'll have to excuse the fact I have a nail missing I'm not gonna give you the finger but as I was saying up for this video it pinged off so or was most to devastate it ah there's me thinking I was gonna be so put together first video back no it's me I should have known better next thing is the fancy beauty foundation this is a soft matte long way foundation and it is part of Rihanna's new makeup line that she released in 2017 and I ordered this online on a bit of a whim lots of people have been doing their reviews and I thought you know what I'll try it give it my two cents absolutely freaking love it it an amazing formulation I tend to steer away from map foundations because I like to have a bit of a Jew igloo and normally I just think matte foundations make me look a little bit 2d or a bit like sallow and tired I just I don't think they do much for my complexion so I was a bit hesitant about this didn't need to be because it's amazing it lasts really well it's not like matte matte and it gives a really good coverage so I really liked that also so many different shades if there is not a shade of this foundation for you I would be very surprised sticking with like skin this duo basically got me through the summer I wasn't really wearing any foundation when we moved into this house it was like the hottest two weeks of the year we were unpacking boxes and running up and down flights of stairs and mostly just enjoying the weather in the garden so I didn't really do much kind of full face of makeup there for what I was doing was using the urban decay I can never say this urban decay concealer with my trusty collection lasting perfection concealer I combined the two I put this on any like blemishes or scarring on my face and I used this under my eyes and then I blended it out with bare minerals foundation this was one of the first foundations I ever used when I was 17 years old myself and my mum placed an order on QVC and I bought this and I wore it in school and in six form and I absolutely loved it I've definitely gone through phases of my more adult life where I've loved it and used it and been obsessed with it and then when I felt like my skin needed a bit more coverage I've sort of popped this back on the shelf and this year during summer I was just using this on top of these concealers and I really liked how kind of healthy and glowy my face felt and I really loved it it made me fall back in love with bare minerals so this is now firmly back in my makeup bag this got a whole lot of love from this year this is the Charlotte Tilbury is it on the go palette or what's it called instant look palette it's a little bit grubby and we've hit pan ladies and gentlemen we've hit pan I used this palette so much this year I'd forgotten it and when we moved I was putting my makeup out and I was like ah that palette is just a dream it has like everything you would need it has really lovely neutral shades bit of shimmer and a matte brown for going in the crease which is perfect it's it's basically my everyday go-to I and then the sculpt part of the sculpt and highlight is the perfect shade blends beautifully and I absolutely love it as you can see this blush is also gorgeous this one which is slightly deeper color I also used it's much nicer for evenings this color or when I had a tan after I've been on holiday I use that and then the highlighter on the other end it's one of those palettes that I just think has everything you need in it if you are after any of those things separately I would advise you get it all together in this and just take this everywhere you go with you two more cheek products this this will probably come as no shock to you because I've pretty much used in every makeup look for the past six months it's the Tanya burr cosmetics peonies please blush sash highlight is actually called an illuminating powder I love this I've got it on now it gives a really pretty Juhi highlight and the pink is very subtle and very pretty and it's just my go-to if I want to look a little bit more glowy another item that I used this year a lot for glow but in a more kind of bronzy sense kind of holiday post holiday was this this is the Estee Lauder doesn't have the name on the back and I should have googled it before I did this video but it came out in summer and it's this gorgeous kind of Goldy highlight I don't even know if you can get this anymore as part of the bronze God s collection but it wouldn't have been a true video if I didn't include this because it's beautiful and I loved it this year for brows there was definitely one product that I reached for over everything else and something that I had never used before and that is the Makeup Forever aqua brow when I received this in my PO Box I very nearly almost immediately when that seems fiddly and time-consuming for eyebrows I am much more of a powder or pencil girl and I almost just put it straight in the charity file I don't know why I didn't I must have just thought ah it's a kind of interesting concept I'll see what it's like and then I think I was having like a makeup bag reshuffle and I dropped it in there and one of the reasons I think this works really well is because it is waterproof so once you put this in your brows and I use an angled brush it really stays where you put it I feel like it gives my eyebrows that like just tinted look and it's quite I mean sometimes it looks quite natural depending on like how much time I have sometimes it looks quite block heavy but I guess it's completely down to you how much you want to use and kind of what technique you have to apply it but I have really really enjoyed using this lip product I'm just going to show one lip product otherwise I could be here for like 20 minutes talking about every lip color that I enjoyed wearing through 2017 so I'm just gonna show the one I wore the most and I know this because it went in like every handbag and it was my go-to nude and that is the M cosmetics in French nude and this is a liquid lipstick I love the formulation of this it's kind of mousse like it doesn't feel very heavy on the lips but it lasts really well it's a really flattering color for my skintone I think and that's why I really liked it I have it on today I also have a lip gloss on top which is why it's shiny and not matte usually it's matte but yeah this was definitely my most worn lip product of 2017 I wanted to feature eyeshadows but again I use so many different brands of eyeshadows and I've loved so many different ones but I do feel like a real standout for me this year was Kylie Jenner eyeshadows I think they are really pigmented they blend really well they stay on my eyes all day and I really really enjoy using them this palette particularly which is the burgundy palette got a lot of love from me for the majority of the first half of the year and actually through the autumn months as well so a lot of love for Kylie eyeshadows moving on to fragrance this one was quite easy actually I really enjoyed looking at all my fragrances and like deciphering which ones I used the most because I am one of these people that has all my like top fragrances out and every morning like depending on my mood I'll be like oh I'll use this one today so there were a lot of contenders but I have to say these were definitely the top 3 so number one this is the deke and Voltaire this is her perfume and I don't know if I feature this in a favourites I must have done because I've been using it for like 7 months it's amazing this smells this is a smell that I cannot put into words at all like I find this impossible to explain and describe and actually I find scents quite impossible to explain and describe anyway but I find this one really hard because it just smells like nothing else I own its see I would say it's probably more of an evening scent for quite a few people because it's very like all I can say to you is it's quite a sweet smell and I'm not the biggest fan of very sweet scents but there's like so many layers to this when you first put it on it's quite sweet then it like mellows down to something completely different and it's also one of those scents that when someone else is wearing this I know it's this I just love it I really really love it I get so many compliments when I wear it and yeah I reach for this a lot the next one I absolutely loved and use all the time is the clean reserved warm cotton this is definitely a scent that is very unique and I think something that is lovely to layer with other scents clean scents are my favorite fresh clean fragrances are generally the genre of fragrance I'll usually go for and this kind of encompasses all those things in one it straight-up smells like fresh laundry and this is such a lovely scent to wear in spring and summer but I wore it the other day so not opposed to a bit of warm cotton in the winter days either and then last but by no means least on the fragrance front it's the by Rado super cedar odor path bomb this again is an entirely different scent to the other two in fact all three of these scents are really different this I bought back in March because Tanya was wearing it on my birthday and I remember saying to her you smell incredible what is it you're wearing and she said it was this and I immediately ordered it it's kind of musky a little bit woody but also very fresh and a bit like molecule oh one it has like a I always say that I always describe things as a molecule no one but if you're watching this and you have no idea what molecule no one is that's really not very helpful it's it's a bit more of a grown-up smell I would say but it is the sort of smell that how do you describe this it is a fresh scent it's fresh a little bit woody very grown-up could also be a unisex scent I think but I love that body now we all know I am NOT the best at moisturizing my body in fact I suck at it and every year I tell myself moisturize your body this year Zoe because it's very important when you start getting wrinkly and saggy you're gonna wish you did it but one product that I did love and use a lots of during 2017 was the sole addition arrow Brazilian bum cream or is it brazilian Brazilian bum bum cream this cream is lovely it has a slight shimmer to it which means in the summer months when you put it on it makes your skin look all glowy and healthy but the one thing I love the most about it was a descent and be how rich it felt but how quickly it sunk into your skin you imagine because this is quite a thick consistency that it would take a really long time to sink into your skin but it doesn't it's magic you put it on and it just disappears it's so good so thoroughly enjoyed that skin care the glossy a milky jelly cleanser conditioning face wash I love this stuff I love what it smells like I love how it feels on the skin I love how clean my skin feels when I use this I use this as my second cleanser so once I've removed my makeup I will use this just to relieve my skin feeling a lot more clean and I really really enjoyed using this product a lot the products that I have been using to take off my makeup is actually a product I've been using for years and years and years but for some reason I've been trying other products or loving other makeup removers and I just kind of left this one on the Shelf a bit and forgotten about it which I think tends to happen quite a bit with skincare and beauty products but it is the ever-so-popular Liz Earle cleanse and polish there's not a lot I can say about this that everyone else hasn't already said I love it I love it it's not too thick it doesn't leave any residue on my skin and it does the job very well I also feel like this is a lot more gentle on my skin and my skin likes when I use this so yeah a rediscovery of that I've been loving that and using that a lot hair these are from my shower so they're a bit wet davin s oi shampoo and conditioner I think I have got through at least eight bottles of this this year is that kind of normal or is that like a bit excessive I guess that could be normal I don't actually know I have saved a year of empties so I'll be doing a video on that soon where we will find out how many of these I actually use through the year but I've raved about these so much they leave my hair feeling amazing they smell amazing there are actually a really good price tag for the quality of the product and I just it's my go-to shampoo and conditioner what more can I say shampoo and conditioner that I've been loving more recently but again have gotten through a lot of bottles of this is the Windell and moody shampoo and conditioner I love this again it leaves my hair feeling so like nourished and shiny and healthy and that is what you want from bleached hair so yeah absolutely loved this this year so that is everything beauty and skincare and makeup wise that I have been loving through 2017 if you go back through any of my favorites there might be a couple of more in-depth reviews if you want to go find those but apart from that I hope you guys enjoyed this video and it's so great to be back thank you for all your love and support make sure you subscribe if you haven't subscribed already and hit the notification bell so you always know when I'm going to upload a video and I will see you again very very soon bye guys 
hello everybody today I'm going to be doing something that could potentially leave me hugely embarrassed but because I'm just nice like that I'm going to do it for your entertainment I have multiple boxes around me that you can't actually see right now full of all of my past memories it's basically my memory boxes and I have a lot of them because I'm a very sentimental mushy person I like to keep everything that has some significance to my life at that moment so even though half of this has no significance to my life anymore I'm really glad I've kept it OEE ex-boyfriend letters I keep everything so Alfie if you're watching this and you screw me over I've got your two cards that you've sent me in the last four years to keep forever I'm joking I'm not really yeah that she only really ever given me like too sentimental cards past boyfriends have gone to town so even though I don't read these things back and go oh my heart I can't believe that this ended this way and these words he spoke to me in 2007 never happened I still love to keep these things because they were of huge significance at the time and I know how those things made me feel at the time and that is what is important however if you are an ex-boyfriend watching this video don't panic I'm not going to read out your love letters well I might not so I'm just going to get stuck in I haven't looked through this in a really long time I don't know what's here I don't know what I could be sharing with you but I think this is going to be really fun do any of you remember when I interviewed one direction in 2013 I have to say right now that was one of the most terrifying days I've ever had I crapped my pants not actually I mean I know the idea of you crapping my pants is pretty disgusting nala but you don't need to bark at me and actually crap my pants but I was so no I've got like all my cue cards I tried to learn the question so that I wasn't looking down too much but I also didn't want to like stare into their soul that was Rena wrecking day when I was in Harry Potter after we finished filming we received these which is a signed photograph by the one and only Daniel Radcliffe I remember when I received this this was like pure gold in my bedroom I had this up on my door I showed everyone that came round I was like he signed it he actually signed this it's a print it's not actually signed it's his signature but he didn't actually sign it thanks Daniel oh my god here's a note I've kept from obviously a lesson that me and my friends were in we used to write each other note all

mobile phone a Barbie treasure plank Val and the last one a puppy that comes back when you say that's me and Joe's bunk beds a card here which one of my friends did for me and six warm would you believe doesn't look like someone who was 17 did this but they did and it says happy birthday fellow p-head just to show you that even in school I was being called a pea head by my friends one of my boyfriend's made me a card out of a picture of a Polly Pocket on a piece of like chopped tomatoes thing this is what it says in it happy birthday I'm sorry everything is crap I'll make up to you the sentiment of this is too much kind of sums up the kind of guy he was what's really surprising is the one that made the most effort besides Alfie obviously and who who I have the most cards here from I actually still still speak to and he's a really nice guy and I think that's really nice although he would die of embarrassment if I read any of these out so I'm not gonna do that this is my old art book so I was oh s8 so I was 12 here's my drawing of a beanie baby and a box of matchmakers oh my gosh love those this is my sunset picture yeah for a piece of art I use an actual digestive biscuit and stuck it on with glue I use the chocolate biscuit to do a collage of a chocolate digestive it does look quite messy and it takes ages to dry I won't use this in the test you can't get different shades or tones and it looks quite gross it does look quite effective but I don't like it very much twelve years on I'm thinking that probably wasn't the best idea this is the most secret thing I own it is full of basically everything I ever thought about anyone from the ages of 10 to the age of 20 I used to have this double padlocks when I lived with people now only with Alfie have anything about him in here so I really wouldn't care if you read this it doesn't have a padlock on it anymore Here I am with my guinea pigs at the time it came with a rollerball of glitter who remembers rollerball the glitter so good this is like my version of a burn book what a little bitch I am actually you know what it's not all bad it's some really good stuff in there as well awesome is my best mate she is perfect at being a maid blossom is never horrible and it's never annoying we go shopping together and we giggle all the time she's called giggle one and I'm giggle two in brackets cool or what oh my god this is so funny in EastEnders I really fancy Jamie in brackets Jack Ryder and I think he's gorgeous and so hunky I also think that Ashley cotton is quite sweet he's got lush eyes as long eyelashes and he's got dot well he's just cute I used to think that Martin was all right too but now I'm not so sure Ashley is not like his dad every time Ashley's on telly I get this crush in my stomach and when he cries I feel really sorry for him I love him even more then the same for Jack Ryder - he's fat okay so then I decided to create my own language oh my god okay so bear in mind I am 11 okay I'm still in primary school we had this friend so there's like this friendship group and we had this one friend who none of us really liked that much I don't know why we were kids and we've put here we hate Lily we have broken up with her for good she is so horrible Tina is gonna send her a text to say that she's a cow and a slimeball she is such a liar so she spreads rumors and then I put in massive letters ah then I've drawn a picture of her and I've put in a speech bubble I'm a oh my god was either Regina George of my primary school No do you know what I would never mean to anyone's face I just wrote it in here which is probably worse to be fair Oh today in the library me and my friends were looking through the shot magazine it says something about best features so I said to Sarah what's my best feature and then everyone was saying what my best feature was then Jamie says I think your best feature is your eyes and then the whole of the group when Oh and today we in brackets the boys and the girls from the tude group went down to the field and they were playing truth or dare people had to hug and kiss others ooh I actually remember like this happening and feeling so like excited and nervous at the same time Chloe was going to get someone to ask someone out for her for a joke so Sarah went over to him and said will you go out with Chloe he said no and they kept on asking him and then my other friend being really annoying said we go out with Zoey and he said maybe I could have killed her so I hope he doesn't think I'm serious while I'm on the subject of Charlie I think he likes to flirt with me in art because he talks to me all the time and when he left the table on Thursday when he finished his mark he said to me see you later and I thought okay I have some well big news but I have to get ready for school right now so I'll tell you when I get back ciao for now y'all right well I'm 16 now whoo I should really be putting pictures in this book I will do soon anyway it was my birthday last Tuesday 20th of March and now I'm 16 ah I honestly just I'm dying a little bit inside because these are things I've said I couldn't imagine my life without him and I know that this is cheesy as hell I don't care I've been with him for almost 11 months and I couldn't be any any happier he makes me someone all of a sudden very hot in here it's so weird to read this back because like I've written in it and then I've gone back and like any little thoughts that I had the years before I've gone back and gone yes this was completely true such as such turned out to be doing such and such and oh my god it's just the drama I'm not going out with insert boy's name anymore stuff just got odd and I just didn't feel like I liked him anymore although we were together for about a year and a half overall I'd like to say we're still friends but clearly we're not because he turned into a prick and is being really weird huh oh my god how sad is this in the last entry I ever put in this diary was when I was 18 so not 2018 oh this is so sad open maybe he isn't bothered and if he's not then is he worth hanging on to I don't really know what to think about at the moment but I do know I'm probably not worth keeping never have been I thought it would be different with insert names but I don't feel like he really admires me anymore sadface hey ho that's the last bit of my diary so it starts on I'm 10 and it ends at of 18 there's a massive chunk of my life missing from this but I feel like it's quite funny that when I stopped writing in this I started a blog not that my blog was ever really as personal as best but yeah that's kind of weird oh my god this is from the back of my school planner did anybody else stick these on their planners you used to go on a website and like download them and stick their like I love these things oh I got a picture of Alfie in here onion Jim's wedding in by I just keep everything a friend came around today and then I babysat until midnight even though I felt very ill I got 15 pounds oh look okay so this is a picture I put in here awards night orthodontist appointment I have my braces off yay so this was Thursday the 15th of January 2004 I have my braces off now I look like this yay straight teeth I also won an award for history yay this is me and my cousin look what my hair used to be like but this is hilarious this is a picture of me as a baby eating a banana my mum trying to teach me to walk this is me looking very unimpressed in the bar this is me wearing a somewhat questionable outfit with my Miss Piggy no this is me when I was a baby with a little toy phone I felt like everyone had that phone here's me like laughing at something I actually love this picture I think my mum took this I don't know what I'm doing but I am laughing at something it's really cute here's one of me slightly older with the thickest eyebrows you ever did see look at those brows okay I feel like that is everything that I could possibly go through in this video Nyla's dropped off so you're still watching this then Thanks if you like this video and you want me to do another one because I do have a lot of different things that I can go through then give the video a thumbs up and I will be sure to do that it would be quite funny to sit and go through some of this stuff with Jo or maybe Alfie I don't know leave your suggestions below and I really hope you have had a lovely weekend and that you will have an awesome week bye 
hello everybody for today's video I wanted to do something I haven't actually ever done before but I thought it would be very useful for you watching and also I haven't done the makeup yet today so I thought it would be nice to film this it's been a while since I've done a big old boot shop so I went into boots the other day with poppy and I had a proper look through all the different beauty counters generally around beauty shopping I'm in a rush or i nip in to grab some tampons awesome shower gel and I don't necessarily actually look at everything that I really want to look at so I actually made the time and probably had a look at the beauty counters and I had so much fun it really likes bark joy within me and reminded me exactly why I love beauty and makeup chirping so I'm going to chat through all the bits and pieces that I bought and try them out for the first time on camera see it first thing I picked up were some Real Techniques brushes I love salmon expresses they're incredible and I specifically like this one which you could only get in this kit it's the contour brush I slip in love it so I'm going to open these because I'm actually going to use some of them to do my makeup I loved having new brushes I went a little bit overboard in foundation because I had a bit of a declutter through my makeup collection the other day because I was watching back my makeup collection video and I was like it's definitely time for me to clear some of that out so as I was doing that I decided to throw away some of my older foundations because I don't know how long have happened for and I'm quite aware that it's a liquid product that has an expiry date so although the Western Foundation dinner that I absolutely loved I thought I would replace them because I couldn't be too sure how long I had them for and I wonder no I don't want to put in any like dirty grotty bacterial film gone off foundation on my face and I feel like expiry dates on products is something that you're not generally very aware of because you're just kind of going to your drawers every day and like pulling out whatever it is you need so I picked up two of my favorite high street foundations and those are the Rimmel match perfection I am shade true ivory at the moment because I'm very pale and also the Rimmel lasting finish foundation and I'm ivory in this one don't know why I picked up two three different colors maybe I wasn't really choose your which show though was it absolutely love wool save always from that another absolutely love both of these foundations they are by far my favorite foundations to get in boots and Superdrug well I just find they blend really nicely they have great coverage they don't feel too heavy and they last really well on me but make me look kind of healthy this one is better for kind of everyday use this one is a little bit more heavy duty so maybe like nights out or if you have a really long day this one would be a great one to try another foundation that I have been loving at the moment is this which is a Revlon Colorstay normal to dry in the color ivory it was 24 hour wear it's a really great foundation I'm really enjoying using it and I picked up another one because I was using the old one from my foundation drawer and again I was like I don't know how long I've had this for so I'm going to go out and replace them turns out they've now put pumps on these I don't know how long we've had pumps for but I was really very happy with that when I saw it because like yeah it is a pump because before we have to kind of pour it out so very happy about that think I may have picked up a color that's way too like me but I also bought another one which I've been using as well which is slightly darker the foundation that I'm excited to try in this video though is the NYX HD studio photogenic foundation which I've not seen anyone try I just saw it on the stand and I was like all this looks interesting it says it had light diffusing ingredients that blur skin imperfections and create the appearance of smooth flawless skin and I pick this up in the shade 101 nude doesn't say anything about the coverage on the packaging though so we'll soon find out something smells weird I don't know if it's a mixture of the foundation on a new brush or not as a whole but something smells weird okay this is quite light coverage I'm having to build this up quite a lot although it is buildable I am able to build it hmm this is hard because I like more recovery than this and I feel like if I was having a day of running errands or nipping out I would be really happy with this coverage on my skin because although it's not covering imperfections like I would normally like all that I'm normally comfortable with it it's still very like glowy and it does look healthy and I honestly think it's a little sort of person that doesn't need a lot of coverage you might really really like this I know that might be some of you like you don't need to put any more on but I just you know when you just know you know now I'm you're going to put a little bit on just to kind of cover over a tiny bit more okay now I've put a little bit of Rimmel much reflection on top I'm feeling a little bit more covered the next thing I bought was a crap ton of concealers because I am a concealer hoarder I get through a lot of concealers it's that one product that I love trying and finding new favorites and so what I was looking in Boots I was like hmm okay and as I feel I haven't tried before so I'm going to give them a go I also picked up a few that I already know and love which is the collection lasting perfection concealer this stuff is incredible if you do not have any of this I would highly recommend trying it it comes in I think like four different shades I picked up fare and I also picked up court medium I then also picked up my favorite concealer for under the eyes which is the bourgeois radiance reveal concealer which corrects illuminates and gives you 24-hour hydration I got that in ot beige I also though picked up all of these so I've got the Rimmel lasting finish concealer corrector high coverage because I love the foundation it hadn't really ever occurred to me to try the corresponding concealer and if I'm completely honest I never use concealers that come in like a hard kind of pop form I more than likely reach for a liquid concealer just because I find they blend into my skin a little bit easier I also picked up the corresponding a concealer with my other favourite foundation which was the master section so I got this one which is in ivory in it because two in one skin tone adapting concealer and highlighter contains vitamin C and E wears up to 13 hours of quite claim so I feel like Spanish signs of fatigue and illuminate the eye area oh I love the sound of this I also picked up two Revlon Nana she is snoring so loudly oh I'm sorry disappointed look you got a little pain another concealer I picked up with this one which is the bourgeois concealer stick blurs and corrects in ivory again I don't really use sticks I use liquid this reminds me of like the first concealer I ever bought which was like in a stick form like this and yet as I was saying I've got the Revlon Colorstay concealers but these look like such funny colors I don't know if you're going to be able to do that they have like a really weird kind of like grey to them but yes that is our book two of the same color for the purpose of this video I'm going to try this one on my face and this one under my eyes this feels really weird to be like doing it like this okay now I've done that I'm going to blend it apart I look funny Pat it in okay I've done that I actually think that that's quite good I quite like it like you can't really see where I put it and it is a really high coverage and very easy to blend I'm quite impressed with that I have to say I am extremely fussy with under-eye concealers and I already kind of don't like that this has a brush which I just didn't realize I don't think I quite comprehend is that it would have a brush going on the nice color under the eyes actually okay I look mental oh I hate you what's brush I'm going to use this one this is the one I love to blend concealer with this is the Real Techniques contour brush great for contour also great for blending concealer I don't feel like the coverage is as good as the collection but it's definitely brightening like it's definitely bright and underneath my eyes I'm just going to put a little bit of this here I think the collection one works really well because it's slightly pinky in tone which works great against the darkness under your eyes but I feel like those two together probably make for a really great combination for under your eyes I'm quite impressed with that I bought my trusty Rimmel stay matte long-lasting pressed powder in transparent because I really like this powder my other one just got really old and cracked and broken so I bought a new one which I use kind of on the regular if I'm feeling particularly oily I feel like I reached this a lot more in summer next up I'm very excited about this I picked this up this is the NYX highlight and contour pro palette it reminded me a little bit of the palette that I already have which is the Anastasia contour kit obviously this one is pricier but I mean the difference is not a lot so I thought I would give it a go which color should I go for all there's some really good like kind of earthy contour colors I might go for this one actually okay I'm really impressed if they're ah I love it okay I like that that's good I'm going to do a little bit of blusher which I didn't actually buy any blusher from the drugstore so I'm just going to use my Becca one using the highlighter and I'm going to put that on my cheekbones oh it looks very shimmery Oh a little bit more you can never have too much highlight new down the nose on forehead or the forage as my man likes to say yeah I'm really happy with that I rate this palette a solid like 9 out of 10 I think the only thing that could make it a little bit better is quicker color payoff like you have to quite you kind of have to do a lot of swirling but actually not that much whirling so 9 after the next thing I picked up was a new bronzer because I mean and then and you can stop kind of justifying every purchase I make I bought it because it looked nice and I wanted it this is the bourgeois maxi delight bronzer which does have a little bit of shimmer so I'm going to kind of do this sparingly oh I definitely just stuck my nose in that hopefully it will we look a little bit more sunkissed because doesn't everyone want to look some kissed in July July its January I meant to say January okay yay I really like it that's nice love I picked up this which is the Rimmel brow this way a brow scope to make it well cute I don't know if this is possibly too dark for me Oh dark brown right okay do i do wax first or like shall I do wax or powder videos some wax see how this goes I have to say I absolutely love that I really like it I've just the wax and put any of the powder end I always hold my breath when I do my eyebrows huh and I don't realize until I'm like why can't I breathe oh yeah I'm holding my breath I really like that it reminds me of when I first get my eyebrows Kim kick and I feel like I don't have to do anything to them because there's that kind of background color but I really really like that whack holy crap I'm going to see like how long it lasts through the day but I just feel like it makes my brows look a lot more natural I mean I know they're darker but I don't know up close they look so much more natural than they do when I refill them with powder so I really like that next up for eyes I picked up this which is the bourgeois color band ombre eyeshadow and liner for 24-hour concert waterproof non transferring and smudge proof this is like everything proof to be honest and I thought this would be a nice like face so I shadowed honestly it looks like I don't have anything on my eyelids that's so disappointing I thought it's going to be such a pretty color I don't know you can see but that's literally done nothing if not put I mean there's a tiny gold Sheen if you look closely but I feel like that can be mistaken for like a consumer to be honest not loving that at all they do have it in other colors but judging from the packaging I thought this is going to be a reread for like bronzy gold okay fine wouldn't recommend that maybe try a different color though maybe because it's really light like maybe this would look so beautiful on darker skin tones but for me this is just look like my skin color with a tiny bit of gold Sheen I'm gonna carry on doing my eye shadow I didn't buy any eyeshadows this came around from the drugstore but I'm going to use my morphe palette more feedmore which I got from cult beauty I saw a pin I love this palette it's beautiful I think it's the falling to the forest palette I'm just going to put some shadow on nothing too fancy boom next up I bought myself a liner this is Z scandalize precision micro eyeliner by Rimmel I feel like it it's good the only I mean it does 24-hour wear so I can test that the only thing I would say is that I feel like I love how short the nib is because it feels like you can get closer to the line and it feels like you have more control over it however it does feel I don't know how to explain it but when you feel like it's drying up before you've even gotten to finish one eye because it's going over the eye shadow I don't know if you know what I mean by that but like it just feels a little bit like it drags the eye and you have to keep going over a little bit to get that color and it's not like super light liquidy if that makes sense which also makes the flicks look not as defined because it kind of looks a little bit dry I don't know whether I've picked up a dry one because it didn't have any like color tape or anything on it so but the lines look a bit fuzzy I don't know about that I'm currently using estilo one and it's amazing so I feel like I've been completely spoilt by that going back to this I picked up two L'Oreal mascaras because I just love them this is the L'Oreal false lash sculpt which I've used and loved and raved about so I can't have another one of those but this is new I believe this is the L'Oreal Paris for Flash superstar X fiber so I'm excited to try this it's a step one is this side I'm assuming this is the actual mascara it quite defining like it regrets every lash now for step two right this is kind of like a curved brush I don't know which step adds the fibers okay I don't know if you can see that but my lashes are quite big yeah do you know what my lashes actually look pretty big and pretty curly that's quite cool the only thing I really don't like is having two steps who's got time for two steps do you know what I mean honestly I like it because my eyelashes do look big and like separated and voluminous the only thing I just don't like is having to do two layers like two steps I'm just not about that I'm actually looking at my eyelashes they don't look like anything I can't achieve with a mascara that I might already use in like just one step okay the next thing I picked up were two lip stick clip liquid lipsticks not that I need any more of these but I absolutely love the NYX ones and I haven't seen these before these are lip lingerie NYX in two very beautiful colors I picked up the push-up and embellishment and now I don't know which one I'm going to put on for this video by the crack at this one this video for over an hour you would never know because there's no way you're watching an hour's worth of footage but just let you know okay so I'm going to put on a push-up feels kind of moosie in texture but then it dries matte which I really like oh I like I really like that I have to say as you apply it it does show up every bit of dry skin on your lips so you might have to give your lips a bit of scrub before you use these but yeah I really like that and the last thing I picked up was this the NYX dewy finish long-lasting setting spray okay it's a very fine mist I'm happy with that does anyone else get like mist anxiety when you have to spray and mist on your face Oh God bro okay I've sprayed hmmm oh it is quite chewy I like it um and then just because I'm going to show you everything else they bought from boots that I'm not putting on my face I picked up a few set of lashes now I love these ones but Fleur have with aiyla they're Lee petit Fleur and Fleur these are all 3/4 length lashes because my eyes are quite small whenever I put false lashes on I have to cut them like I have to take a tiny bit off the end with these though you're like good to go and you never get like that annoying bit that just doesn't stick on the inside of your lash because you only have to put them on the outer third of your eyelashes so these are brilliant I also got some of my ultimate favorite lashes in the entire world these are be my favorites 40 years and they are the ardell demi wispies again I feel like these are as big and they don't feel as heavy on my eyes as well or other lashes do so I really really like these they're very pretty and every fluttery I do have to chop a tiny little bit off the end but they're just really really great and these all come with free geoblue I got some soft and gentle two-in-one shower and shave mousse oh the other day I was having a conversation with someone I don't remember who it was actually and we were talking about shaping legs and I was like oh I just shaved my legs no like sorry what up you just you don't put anything on your legs before you shave my face now sometimes I use a shower gel sometimes I'm just in the bath and I just think oh I should probably shave my legs so I shaved my legs now like wow I know I used to use a shower gel and a shower mousse and I don't anymore I don't know where it is I need buy one so I went out and bought one because I have to say it does make a whole lot of difference when you shave your legs with something on them like a cream or even if it's like a bit of hair conditioner you should have something to clean your legs when you shave them other way they under I and like you could like a match on them literally this is also pH balanced for intimate skin gynecologists approved and up to 14 uses per can is this may leave a souvenir our perfect for bikini line shaving too will there you go while we're speaking of bikini lines and vaginas I got some tampons how many of you are during these are the ones they use I don't know I just find these the best ones it's my counsel of choice Oh hair removal again this is the Nair nourish natural argan oil ultra precision upper lip kit you know that little like fuzzy like she massage yeah sometimes I don't notice it sometimes I'm doing makeup in the Sun I'm like holy crap you could plot that I thought I had better use some hair removal cream and I do find that hair removal cream is much better if I use a wax on my top lip I get box all like bump so something like this is much much better and this is for sensitive skin so winner and the last thing I got are some blonde hair fans now I'm blonde and brunette there's like a two-tone thing going on here so sometimes my brown hair balls are absolutely fine and sometimes I forget that the majority of my hair is blonde so I had to get the blonde one which seems so weird but any time I gonna shoot they will use the blonde ones and I'm like oh yeah because the majority of my hair is blonde that makes complete sense so I got some bigger ones and then some skinnier one so everything I got from my massive message for and I really hope you guys enjoyed this done a video let me know

 Tell me if I get something on my teeth, right?   Thanks.   Hello everyone, today I will answer all your Christmas questions.   - in this very celebrated, very festive Christmas Q &amp; A.   I love a good Q &amp; A and I just thought it would be nice and relaxed -   - and we just wanted to sit here in front of the Christmas tree and talk -   about everything possible Christmas.   Which is one of the best things I know.   Amy asks:   "Is your Christmas tree simple and organized, or messy and fun?"   This year I feel I have both.   Up in my office I have a little 120cm Christmas tree there ...   Some may think it's organized.   I do not quite know what counts like a messy Christmas tree.   But I have such colorful pom-pom guirlandes all over the tree.   - and so such different-colored light chains and colored Christmas balls.   So it's quite festive and not so good -   - It's quite so messy.   But I generally like to have a very organized, nice tree with a color theme   But, I think when I even get children, I would love them to choose -   - special 'baubles' or 'ornaments', as you say in America, we call them 'baubles'. (Christmas decorations)   I want them to choose - or maybe they can get one each year.   So they can build their own collection of Christmas decorations.   And I think that's pretty sweet.   I know that there are many people who have a sense of meaning for each and every piece they hang on the tree.   and I think that is quite meaningful, and although it is not color-coordinated -   - and it does not necessarily look so nice -   - I think it's so sweet.   I do not really have any that matters to me so ...   Yes, I do not have any of them, so I'm just following a different color theme every year -   - and then the tree decorates it.   Blondine asks: "Do you always have an idea for gifts for Alfie?"   No, Alfie is the hardest person to buy gifts for -   - If you follow his other channel, or see his vlogs -   - then you know that if there is something he thinks is cool, he buys it.   Because he is so fond of dizziness and something like that.   So there's never anything I can give him -   - as he A) has not already bought himself, or B) actually wants.   So yes, every year, every Christmas, every birthday, every anniversary -   I do not know what to give Alfie.   And I'll probably run out of ideas soon.   So if you have any suggestions, feel free to tell me about them.   Sammy asks: "What's the best of Christmas?"   I feel a bit like all families make Christmas a little different.   And some people have some things and some have something else.   But personally -   - beyond the turkey, I really love mashed potatoes.   I do not know as the big surprise for most of you -   - but the mashed potatoes are just amazing.   And when you have mashed potatoes for your Christmas dinner, that's the best.   And also 'Yorkshire puddings', which I do not know quite a few of you know   - if you are watching from another country.   But 'Yorkshire puddings', oh dear, they are so hard to describe -   - It's such a kind of dough in a small cup.   And you can put different things in, but you're usually just sleeping in.   Shanny asked, "What is your favorite Christmas reminder this year?"   I love this question, because there are some really good ones.   Of course I loved John Lewis's advertisement, it had a slightly different style this year.   It does not matter to me, though I'm right, like something that brings a little more into the heartbreaks -   - which is why I'm totally crazy about the M &amp; S advertising.   I think because I'm an older sibling with a little brother that I was like "no where is it cute".   It focused a little more on a sibling relationship.   And I think that was so cute, it actually made me cry.   I also really love the Waitrose commercial.   I have not really heard any talk about it, but I love it.   It is about a reddish milk fly to the other end of the country to grab a mince pie -   - only to give it to another reddish milk.   And I think that's so sweet and so beautifully made, so it's also one I loved.   And yes, so there are so many amazing.   I feel that they are getting better each year.   Another one I really think is fat is 'Kevin the Carrot' -   - which is Aldi, I'm pretty sure it's Aldi Christmas Reunion.   I loved it.   I do not quite know if it's so cute, but it's quite comical and I like it.   Who knew that you could talk so long about Christmas presents.   Amy asked, "Was there a special toy that you plagued your parents as a child?"   Yes. And I never got it -   Thank you Mother and Father.   I remember that every year I went through the Argos catalog and wrote a wish list for Santa Claus -   - of course, I did not get everything on the banknote, and I never expected that either -   - but I had to be absolutely sure that I wrote everything that I wanted.   And at the top of the list for most years stood a doll called 'BabyBorn'. I think it was a baby boy doll.   It was just a plastic doll, but at that point it was such a bit the most popular doll.   That was the doll everyone had.   And it had diapers and spoons and weeping and you could give it food -   And it had little sweet set of clothes that you could buy -   - and such a bathtub that came with and a highchair -   - It had it all.   And I never got it. And I wanted it for so long and then I grew up and did not want it anymore.   But my parents bought lots of other lovely gifts for me so that's okay.   Louise asked: "Do you open gifts before or after breakfast?"   We open most of our presents before dinner and then we eat lunch this afternoon -   - and then we open more packages after that.   We just try to make them last all day.   Taylor asks: "Who is your favorite person to give gifts to?"   It's hard because I love giving gifts.   I would honestly do not care if it was Christmas Day and I did not have to open any of my packages -   - As long as I could see all the others open their presents, I would be so happy.   I love to buy gifts for Mark because he- I think   Maybe because we have not been friends for so long and we have not really celebrated so many Christmas and birthdays yet -   - but there are so many things I'm where I'm. "I want to give that to him   for this birthday or this Christmas "   I already have a huge list of things I know he would love -   because we only know each other so well.   Poppy, I love to buy Christmas presents too -   - Again, I know her so well, I know what she likes. Hopefully.   She could see this and be such "Friend, the gifts you gave me last year were terrible"   Poppy, Mark.   Friends like Louise, Tanya and Niomi love I-   I really just love to buy small things and things -   - as I think my friends would love.   I do not know I just like it.   My mother too, I love to buy gifts for my mother.   Joe is quite hard to buy for.   I just think generally boys hard to find gifts for, other than Mark.   Supports all men in my family, I think it's really hard to buy gifts for.   Sarah asked:   "Are there any traditions from when you and Joe were small as you want to carry on when you get children?"   Yes.   Me and Joe used to get bags, it was just pillow cases.   It was never a sock, it was a bag.   And I always remember to do not care if my friends had socks, because the bags were bigger.   So my friend would be like that "Oh, I have my Christmas boil over the wood stove" -   - and I was so "But I just have a pillow case full of packages"   Such I do not know, a bag was just a lot more exciting.   Santa Claus came in and put the bags at the end of our bed -   - while we were sleeping, when we woke up, a bag would suddenly be dugged up.   And it was just the most magical, wonderful ever.   Andy asks: "What is your favorite Christmas song? My is 'Driving Home for Christmas'.   That, Andy, is a classic. And I have to agree with you. It is fantastic -   - especially when driving around Christmas.   You just have to hear that song.   My biggest favorite song ever is Shakin 'Stevens -' Merry Christmas Everyone '.   I love that. Also, 'All I Want For Christmas Is You' - Mariah Carey.   What else? WHAM! - 'Last Christmas',   'Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday', it's so Christmas.   I like this, because it's so simple, but I love to know this about people;   Mini Bambi asks: "Warm or cold light chains?"   As you can see, all the lights I have are warm.   Such, I think that warm light radiates cosiness and Christmas.   Cold light died - no thanks, they are not me.   They look for, iced and blue out. I do not know. I'm a little light chain-crazy.   Uh, this one I like.   Rebecca asked, "What did you do to Santa and his reindeer when you were younger?"   Funny enough, it was my father's idea to put a beer out to Santa.   I have no idea why.   But yes, we used to put beer and some mince pies next to the reindeer, or a carrot -   - and that's what I think. A carrot, some 'mince pies' and a beer.   So my dad always locked up on Christmas Eve.   These were all the questions I answer, in this Q &amp; A -   - Otherwise I would stay here until Christmas Eve.   And we all have things we're going to reach so it would not be so convenient.   Give the video a thumbs up if you liked it,   let me hear some of your own answers to any of these questions below -   Do you like warmth, do you like cold lights?   I need to know such things.   Thank you for watching, and see you again tomorrow.   Goodbye!  
 *sneeze*   Hello, everyone! I hope you all have a wonderful weekend   Today's video, I will review the previous old photos again   Once again embarrass yourself   You all like my last year's review video so I want to take another shot   I'm crazy~~   My laptop is here, but it's dirty enough, okay!   And I still have...   All my external hard drives, most of the old photos are there   I am a very emotional person, so I almost never deleted   Even if I take pictures in my embarrassing and embarrassing life stage, I still feel that it is an important memory   In this way, you can   Looking back at the past imprints of different stages of life, you will be more able to accept the past by creating yourself now. Maybe you didn't like that period of time   But it is important to look back at these things and accept these. This is also why I save...   All the photos I’ve ever taken and actually, I’m glad I’ve done this because   These photos always bring laughs   There are also funny videos, so oh, this is the theme of today.   OK, let's take a look at the photos!   Oh my God!!!!   OK, these are a little ....   My blog's...   Photos I mean, take a look at this picture. Does anyone remember?   just like..   I look like a punk rock   I painted eye makeup and I used a tripod and a box to hold the camera at the restaurant   This picture is taken like this, my hair is so dark!!   My God, this is a photo of me and Joe long ago   It should be taken at Christmas 2012   What is that necklace to express? I am serious, what is that ghost?   The necklace appeared in many films. I used to really love it.   God, does anyone remember this?   I think this is...   This is,   Wherever possible, this photo will appear   Look at my hair!!   The hair is long and it's rough!   Hey! My God! This is my first time..   And Louise   Alfie meets Marcus   It's so cute! It was taken in their hotel room before an event was held.   Really cute~~~   Take a look at this photo   My hair is much blacker!   Oh, no..   This is too bad..   Hey, this is another one..   I remember this series seems to have been used on the website often! This is this   Hey, I've put these photos and I used to put these   Let me see if it makes me even more unbearable   Hey! My God! Check this out   *laughing out loud*   Even my arms are in the mirror. MySpace style   This is the (YouTube) first cover photo   Hey God, this is what it was before the film   I remember this period   I remember this is London Fashion Week and about Rimmel (UK Makeup Brand)   And I'm nervous. This is my first time going to London myself.   I'm very impressed! It's a funny picture taken before going to London   Oh, this is actually what I asked my dad to help me take   OK, we need to review it:   Earlier, come on!   ㄜ....   These are ex-boyfriends..   It's disgusting!   Oh, no!   A long time ago it was really before   This is my first photo with special effects   I love this! My friend Jenny was in her room and I used...   An editing software and choosing a color to create the contrast of colors   I used every color to edit the style of Andy Warhol ~~   Hey! Look at this!   I'm plucking my eyebrows!!   It's a bit too much...   And look at my white earrings and hair bands..   Oh God!   look at me   Look at my friend's room! I love it ~~   Wait, how old was I when I was 14 years old?   I am wearing...   God, what brand of hooded jacket is it? Is Gold Digger?   I forgot, but I'm wearing that piece and there's Orlando Blue on the wall!!   At that time, they will go out with friends   There are still some digital cameras used by my parents.   And it will put photos on MSN or Facebook   I hate this photo   Extremely nasty!!!!!   This has not been completely repaired   Look at my face I look like a passerby...   Is this a little melancholy?   Oh god, I remember that vest   There are comic totems on the top of the brand like TK Maxx.   This is not too different from me now   I still often make such expressions   But... my eyebrows...   Where has my eyebrow gone??! And my eyes are so stiff..   Hey ~~ my .... days!!   Can you pause??   My little boobs!   and,   My muppet pajamas (the puppet of Sesame Street Bridge) I should feel at that time   "This will be a very powerful photo later." My God and I used to cut my hair very often.   In fact, I think it is obvious that I can cut it myself...   What is this?!   What is this?!   why??   why???!!!   Oh, my dear   Fortunately, these photos did not flow everywhere until today!!!!   I have a photo album called "boys"   Inside are boys photos   For example, there were students who had previously spoken at school or were former schoolmates.   There is also talk in MSN   They are all in this album   check it out   Oh, my God   Take a look at this photo   This is the best photo I have ever seen   I tell you an interesting story   I won't show this photo because   My friend will never accept that we lift the clothes up, leaving only underwear   And my underwear is too small   So the photo can see the nipple   But because it was so funny, I passed it to my friend   Just want to say, "God, this photo is so funny," but we didn't let the photos go out.   And, I must draw   The state of underwear   To cover in my nipples   I forgot where this photo was taken   However, I should be trying to express that I am driving   That was my previous chair was a heart-shaped chair, the back of the chair was heart-shaped, and the cushion was round   Does anyone have a similar chair? I feel that many people have ~~~   White vest again I like to wear a white vest!   This photo is called "I like my queen's head?"   Isn't it? The Queen's Head! Zoe   Oh, my god, this picture is simply embarrassing to me!   This is called "Come on!"   And I think it's appropriate to do this posture   What are you doing in life??!!!   This is definitely the most embarrassing picture of my life and I choose to share it with you.   But what is this? This is called "Like my underwear?"   Ladies and gentlemen, I did not miss these photos before.   But was it head mounting at that time?   Why is this 14-year-old Zoe?   Hey, wearing a train driving hat, it's fine.   Why 14-year-old Zoe wants to pose in this position?   I want to declare that my friends have also taken this photo   Emma, ​​I didn't mean to give you embarrassment but one day we have to sit down and review these photos together because it's so classic!!!   Hey, my God, I remember this, I will cut off Emma but I really remember   And I still remember when I thought I was good-looking at that time, I had a bronzed skin and often had yellow earrings.   Tied with side pony tails, plus a little perspiration on underwear   A picture of my ex-boyfriend   He put the title: "Zoe's secret to maintaining long-distance love," "Zoe Sugg talks about his new boyfriend."   "10 Tips for How to Smile Like Zoe," "How did she make teeth so bright?"   This is Kompodan (magazine)!! Can you pause it? It's fun!   Because I'm on the cover of the Komengbodan magazine now!   I am curious he has not seen?   These photos are really fun~~~   This album is called "Fred's Rave"   Why do I need to be 15 when I do this?   But obviously this is not the style of rave   Oh my God, I remember that night   I remember very impressive   This is another party but I don’t know what I’m doing with my friend.   Have a nice day!  喔~~ A little brown tone "lovin* sing*"   Super Love Jack Johnson   I found a photo album called "My Webcam"   Oh!!!!   God...   This is called "I love apple juice"   This one is called ""shiny stock""   I don’t know why but it’s like this~~~   What is this?   * Feeling unhappy and regretful*   Seeing this I'm speechless   I don't know why I have to touch a doll a bit weird.....   *Sing *It's terrible..   I was very fascinated before... but it looks good...   This is what I looked like before wearing a braces   Let's look at this because this is normal   My off-the-shoulder striped tops, pink stockings, and white-pointed red shoes, and beaded jewelry   Hey ~ there are earrings and hair accessories. I obviously wear all my jewelry....   And this was taken in my town   I don’t know how to call this place but I’m going to throw the drunk here.   This is really early. That's why I would have a bed in this place (drunk) and everyone will sleep!   There are hundreds of photos in it, so it may be possible to put a few more for you to entertain every year.   In fact, I really enjoyed the feeling of retrospective photos, because it was so funny and I mostly remember the time when these photos were taken.   It's weird, I know   And you should also participate in such things as you can tweet to give you some pictures of adolescence   I think I will like it and it will make me feel better   To tweet to me, my account is @zoella, if you want to put it in instagram, you can also tag me in instagram   My twitter account is @zoella, and I really hope you guys like this video. Give me a thumbs up. We will meet again soon.  
[Music] twenty-four days of weather I'm going to be testing some Christmas Pinterest ideas I like getting crafty it's something that I always did with my mum and I see some of the most insane and amazingly festive ideas over on Pinterest Pinterest is basically the best so I've got three things I wanted to try out which I have not done prior to filming this video so we're going to see how it goes the first being salt dough shapes now I feel like most people have probably done this at some point in their lives you can make decorations but I've seen some really cute ones with tiny little stars used to decorate presents so you can make tiny little star bunting and then you can use it as a present wrap which I quite like so to make salt dough you need 2 cups of flour 1 cup of salt and 1 cup of water so it's basically 2 1 1 essentially you need to mix it together so I'm going to add flour and I'm going to add the salt now I need to get a spoon thank you Mark you're welcome so my little helper is easy we're gonna stir this although I do believe it quite quickly forms a dough look at it see that's a dough now isn't it doe a deer okay this looks so disgusting but I think it's it's work because it's all come together so now you simply wanna get it out oh look at it I feel like this would be a really fun thing to do with kids look at that perfect okay with a rolling pin roll out the salt dough you can use any shapes but I actually got a little bit little pack free with a Christmas magazine and they're like the perfect size because they're small okay I'm gonna get my little star think you need a bit more flour so I'm just gonna lightly dust and my only problem is I could have probably done with dusting underneath so I'm going to quickly gust underling and then we roll we roll this is better get my little cutter I'm gonna do a star pop him out on a baking tray ah cute once you've done all your little stars or Christmas trees or whatever else you want to do I think you can either glue these once they're set you can put them in the oven for like three hours on a really low heat to dry out or you just sort of leave them out to harden and you can make a little hole in them now or glue them to a piece of string and use them around a prison which i think is such a cool idea and I can't stop I just put them on the tree as decoration yeah you can paint them you can do bigger ones you can paint them you can put and put them on your tree as a decoration like Alfie did mark what did you do with salt dough I painted them painted yeah I used I painted them then put like a varnish on it so it was always very shiny why do they look so cute okay they look like I'm little salt dough lucky stars magic stars okay that's enough just one more okay oh wow oh we've got a lot of salt go left okay get a safest so that mark and Alfie can do their very own salt dough shapes but I'm going to pop these in the oven just to harden they look so cute the next thing that I saw on Pinterest that I really wanted to make work the hot cocoa Christmas cookies these look adorable and actually not too difficult to make the only thing I couldn't find was the little cookies they use but I think you can use any cookies so I'm just going to use Oreos like this little Oreo so following the instructions you want to take your little round biscuit your marshmallows these ones are jet paths which I think it's an American brand but I've got these on a card oh so they weren't that difficult to find okay and you want to make them because this is going to be your little mug so you want to use the ones that aren't as squished like that's a good one that's a good one and using a squirty like chocolate I'm going to glue that to the Oreo whoa like so I'm going to do that three times and that's one next you want to make this look like a little hot chocolate so you're going to use the chocolate to make it look like a mug is both flowing like that there we go so that's the actual hot chocolate in the mug then you want to sprinkle on some tiny micro marshmallows I think you can find these in like the baking section I'm going to use the white ones now this is the bit where I feel like it could get tricky tiny little candy cane do you need to snap this off where it meets the top of the candy cane to create Oh like that to create a handle wow it's gonna be a big old handle okay Brady's use your rolling pin do it Oh Owen very low smaller handle oh yeah that's better using your chocolate you want to put a little bit on there a little bit on there this is your glue and you want to stick that to your marshmallow that is not going to stay oh I think it is thank you our feet here's another stick that on oh I think these are really cute so far perfect little handle thanks Alfie okay suppose our mugs with their handles now you want to just decorate the front of your mug so I've got some Christmas tree sprinkles I'm just gonna pop it on the front I'm going to do a little dot and then I'm going to stick a Christmas tree on there like that and I'm going to the same with the others but a little dark and a little Christmas tree oh I lost a handle let's take that back on in a minute here we go the handle back on I feel like apart from the handles not really saying on I think they're quite cute Oh thieving they're so cute I think it makes an Oreo far more exciting but yeah there you go tiny hot chocolate cookies would anyone like to try one come on try one me how do i how all-in-one the third and final Pinterest craft that I new attempt to make is sock snowman very excited to try this so I believe you can either use your old socks or you can buy some new ones if you're going to make lots and you're feeling very creative I'm not really too sure I can only really see pictures so I'm not sure of the stages so I'm going to try and guess you also need some right so I'm going to open the rice now you've open the rice it's gone everywhere open it pour it in oh or just bring another bottle for the ball all right lass get a glass this is harder than I thought it would be okay thank you mark welcome a glamorous assistant easiest way to get rice into a sock is to use a glass a funnel ie piece of paper and pour your rice in it's fine don't even worry there we go okay your glass full of rice get stuck place your sock over said rice turn your right now you have a long bag then you want to put your rice down to the bottom of the sock okay you want to secure the top with your first elastic band so the rice doesn't come out like so and then create a little head and using your second elastic band you want to secure lap around his head you can make the head whatever size you want you can make the body whatever size you want you can even do a huge one and have it like three you know like a classic snowman I'm going to just go for two okay now you have something that looks like this you want to chop off the excess like that and then you want to use this as out so I'm just going to pop that on there ah cute and you can even use another elastic at the back or stitch that together to make it like a proper little like pointy snowman hat I'm then going to cut this gray sock to give the Snowman a scarf we've all seen the John Lewis advert snowmen need scarves here we go Oh cute okay now after this you can use pins and pop them in for eyes or you could use buttons and stitch them or glue them down here I have none of those things today which I just think I would but I'm not that much of a crafty person I do however have a sharpie so I'm just going to draw on two little eyes like that and I'm going to draw on the buttons and there you have your little rice snowman do you like in okay what should we call him Oh Chris why Chris mark because it's the name of one of our favorite Christmas songs sing is driving home for Christmas by Chris Rhea and it also has purses in Christmas Chris and Christmas yeah I like it Chris the Snowman not very snowman name but I think it's it's M I actually think this is so cute this would make a lovely gift realize decoration a fun thing to do with kids or if you're bored I don't even think you need to be a kid to do this you could use stripey socks for the Hat you could get like really creative so if you do happen to make any of these I would love to see them and as I'm sure the people who created these or came up with this idea would also love to see them you could make like a family of them you could have a small one a medium-sized one and then a huge one depending I guess on how big your feet are there we go I like that you can do that look lightly proper sorry Chris yeah burn about oh he's kind of it wide just prop you up a bit there we go so those were the three Pinterest DIYs that I really wants to give a go I really hope you guys enjoyed this obviously I had a practiced and I probably could have done with some buttons but if you do

entire world it's mark faris hello Zoe and viewers oh yeah what we just updated yeah nah you may notice I have a different makeup look today and that is because my makeup has been done courtesy of ma hey you can go on over on watch after this video on his channel is my makeup again you all liked it last time so we thought it would do like a refresh yeah like the summer summer vibe yeah yeah I actually think you did a bloody great job I've only known each and a few bits anyway in today's video I thought it'd be fun for us to do be most likely to challenge challenge quiz yeah I can't do this quite a lot with lots of my friends and it's something we haven't done yet I know and I feel like if something that people would want to know oh yeah ah so we've got our card okay ready question one I'm excited I'm minute hardly takes really seriously most likely to leave a show or the cinema if they are not enjoying it Oh hard you know me yeah I feel like the only reason I'd ever leave a cinema or a show people around me was speaking to me but not if you weren't enjoying the filler yeah yeah I could finally I would think I would leave like if I'm if I've got the theater and it's got to that halftime I really wasn't enjoying it I'd be like hey I think I would stay I just bite the bullet and to see weapons yeah but generally generally speaking I've never have done yeah it's very rare isn't it I'm going to happen but on the off chance because also when you're watching a film you think oh it will get back a minute I have left it was the hateful eight are useless it was so long I just left and I left my friends and I said no because it was their sort of film is Quentin Tarantino to have nothing get to him I love Lee films but it was so thinking and chatty and so much dialogue and I was like I'm not in the right headspace I left most likely to tweet something that supposed to text ha ha ha ha ha that's why I'm like wow oh yeah of all the things I could have texted you I'm glad it was that oh yeah yeah even though it's still a bit like who a couple you've just does such a bizarre thing from what to tweet I can really treat that to me I was like you want meant to tweet up yeah are you meant to text that everyone sorry I figured some country with tweeted back a ball and texting as well yeah and I felt confused Oh who's who would be most likely to get lost on the Underground see I said that because obviously I'm from London but I do get lost I find I gonna say you really and I am so meticulous about following rules and directions yeah but I don't I've never got lost on the Underground even when I didn't understand the underground because I'm so like right I'm going to make a plan I'm going to write down in my notes yeah I know exactly where to get off exactly it like so I couldn't get lost but you're a bit more like arms John policy so getting an uber like tonight because I'm just like I'm not going to be able to find even though I've lived it even though I've lived Neyland and Driver feel while you ever know oh who is most likely to end up an A&amp;E in another country I'm going to say you babe I'll be disowned tell you wouldn't know you'd slip or you'd walk into something yeah or get into like a kerfuffle when I say so yeah it's your people who is most likely to to be sent to prison for 24 hours or held held in jail for 24 hours I'm gonna say three to one I'm going to say you but it will just be something so innocently you don't realize yeah because again I like to follow rules I would be very surprised if I got put in prison for 24 hours I can't even imagine what you get away for I think if it was me it would be being in the wrong place at the wrong time yeah there would be something else happening and I get caught up in it yeah if it would you like to sing with me yeah on a night owl but I can't be the peacemaker of something going on and I'd be the one most likely to slap someone by accident something I'm going to say me oh really I have like a fez Wow let me call it some drama that I can't make it better mom Baba realistically I'm not sure either of us could ever slap anybody no we don't find this so now I'll be nice got some I know that like I'm on my way to get acting career Wow how's the boss Oh because of your eyes today most likely to join a club oh oh damn you say you move I'm not good at clubs no never having done a few club things yeah I thought that you'd join a club you join a club like picking up litter I'll worry about what to do well like environmental stuff is that we mean no no no like an art club or a bike lane or like or like yoga flow I are a bit scared of clubs why I don't like being in an environment that I'm not familiar with this with people are not familiar with what small groups so if you're there for like the whole thing Oh even if thought it makes makes us feel like that really so like if you're if you're going to a yoga class and you know that all the people there are just to go to the yoga I would never go on my own till class no no mm-hmm maybe I see me one day I do this year a photography club which would be really interesting or like a calligraphy club or a course wouldn't harm I can't do it and I've been like it my whole life like my mum would drop me off as a kid to like the kids club and I would just take it oh I can't feel comfortable unless I had like you

were in it together we both get you most likely to bungee jump got the you in at my yeah no no longer would you actually bungee jump yeah would you in a way bungee jump yeah Millison I would never what about indoor skydiving yeah I do that I do you want to skydive sometime in my life yeah I don't want a bungee jump like I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything if I don't like to jump is it the risk of death no oh I'm just a bit worried that I feel anxious in the plane on the way up about one day jump in there oh no I do know what is about bungee jumping ah it's so 50/50 there's people that will say it was the worst thing I've ever done I would never do it again why do I even do it and those people are like oh I love it I've been a time you're wrong I'm just like how can anyone row themself off yeah when you do a skydive you're in a plane you're attached to someone else you don't even know someone no with someone but on a bungee jump you have to be the one to do it or if you have someone push a I don't think you can I don't think that's safe when you fall funny I bought a thornbush mate in the right way it was lucky but I think I do it's just that can I come with you and you do it yeah yeah definitely wear anything if you get winded oh that's why we do yeah is it when I hit the thing of the bows that's just with that you when you get to the bottom of it and it looks you up with your life if you like jump in and then it's like stop and the string goes like that and you're like ah who is most likely to not shower for a week hahaha it's hard I love I love the old bar yeah I've got shower every day Marc is like super clean okay I shower every day can I just point out but if it's funny I've always got to get ready and I yeah I'm always getting ready do you think

always be like to enhance why I have it wouldn't be like not that I'm against it obviously but like it would never be something so drastic it would change my whole entire life we just be like little nip and tuck anything when I'm also injection yeah one good job would you not be I would let you if it was real if I had a cut if I did it it could be muscle yeah well this woman ran out of money so she started injecting and cooking oil into her face and her face blew up I'm not laughing you did dog why would you do that because you just got addicted to the search oh gosh most likely to fart in

like you know what honestly dude I was in a queue at a bank and I find it was loud okay is that you know when you trip on a curb and you look at the curb like yeah I like it like you look behind you fallen on anytime I trip on the Carbonite I look down on another annoying the floral I don't know where you come from most likely to be told off I'm gonna say yes I'm gonna say both of us yeah my thing is very because I like to abide by the rules yeah like in school being told off with like really scared of being told off unforgettable authority figures anyone older than me I don't know if you ever tell me off never I encourage it most likely to go on holiday on their own Laura take a little trip away on their right or go to our hotel on their own oh I thought you can say you know know what was doing would you have liked go to Alexander house for the night oh my oh yeah we're gonna do I was going to plan something like that for me tomorrow and I just a night away for myself why don't you want to do some one spicy open air I'm not used to all that space like very enclosed where we're from the way yeah mark listen Akane yeah whenever he can whenever I can get out when have you ever known me to be fully on my own ever without Nala without anyone never exactly what would I do well like you go to a really nice hotel suite all during sitting address the gal put Netflix on cover bar chill relax open the window some cups of hot chocolate but what it's like I don't know the person working there was a viewer and they were like my celery I'm feel weird just like going out the door oh if it's right it's just the person with the food I thought I would see who is most likely to sell all their worldly even thought of it it's like sending you into like of course I get I think me I think one day I have a mental breakdown w-wha everything I own and I'll going to do you kiddo do you know what there's some kind of do you feel a little bit like well I might just like get rid of everything oh well you know sometimes you meet people and I have nothing yeah I know like that's really sad and you're so happy you don't have everything I have and it really opened Rises getting really deep now it really opens your eyes to how much you don't need things yeah that's what they say money can't buy happiness or money does not buy you happiness a million Merced No hell no I kind of my happiest times before I had money I've had happy times when I've had money too but it's not anyhow it's not any happier because they have money hmm interesting so yeah I think I would I think I'm not planning to yeah I'm planning to do but a litter box when you see people that are so happy with a tenth of why I own unlike oat needleless yo you so much don't that gal who's okay oh here we go who's most likely to say something to a close friend if they've annoyed them oh really I think if we've never done that to each other no but I am too if someone's annoyed me yeah I have to tell them not I'm upset or annoyed me I can't leave can't leave it not good always oh boy because if you value that friendship yeah it's worth keeping what resolve it would you do it there and then on the spot or would you let it simmer down Oh jazz the last well we're different I feel like I do it straight away I don't like confrontation I don't like face-to-face confrontation because I I don't have constant this sounds really weird I don't have confidence in my hmm to say the right thing but in my head I know what I want to say but it never comes out properly I'm getting a lot better at it it's the same in meetings because I'll feel like I have to have all conversations in my like role with what I do there are conversations I find really uncomfortable and there are times when I have to say if I don't like something and I would also love it so I feel like maybe I could obviously I do without it if he said something to me I don't like I'll be like I don't like that but I think I'm more of like a sit on it think about it because I also think sometimes it's bad to action anger mm yeah and I can't I can't fully trust it I'll say the right thing if I'm very angry so I get angry a lot but if I'm really upset and my emotions are very raw I worry that I'll say something wrong and it might make it worse so I sort of sit on it I breed a bit and then are either like message and I'll ring them yeah I think that's very different where I get myself into sticky situations by saying don't like that straightaway you know just be like I don't know send that but I think every pencil situation does matter yeah I feel like if someone's like mugging someone off in the group I'd be like no I don't like that because it's not fair or something like that but obviously if it's butter is different but or if someone was bitching about someone that I really cared about I'd have to say something now and then yeah I I don't know I well I'm quite like it so much that I don't agree with I'll say I don't do that yeah I don't necessarily get into like an argument but I'd be like agree with that yeah I don't think that's right right like the blog right right who is most likely to go to the toilet

hi everybody in today's video I am going to be doing my everyday winter makeup there's nothing that's too different from normal although I am using some slightly different products which I thought would be nice to share with you and also I've been really loving a more pinky nude lip so that's the like slight adjustment also I do think in winter it's nice to try and get more of like a jewy healthy lit from within look which usually skin doesn't tend to have during the winter months so that's also what I'm adding into this makeup look naturally I've got a cold sore as I'm filming this because when do I ever not have a cold sore when I want to film a makeup video putting on a little bit of lip balm to start with so that by the time it comes to me doing my lips they're not so chapped the first thing I've done is washed my skin I've then used the rough as a effaclar duo and the glossy a rich moisturizer on top because it's winter you're going from like cold to warm in quite extreme temperatures so that does tend to usually take its toll on my skin so a rich moisturizer is usually the way to go tomi hair up get that out of the way and now look like bam bam need a little bone in my hair primer I am using the Clarins SOS primer boost radiance I don't often use primers but something that's going to boost my radiance at this time of year is something that I am interested in okay foundation wise I have been using the Fenty beauty and my bare minerals foundation kind of on and off or sometimes together but more recently I have ventured back to my trusty NARS sheer glow in the shade Mont Blanc just because I love this foundation and although I go through phases where I really like other foundations this is the one I always come back to and you can never go wrong with this to be honest in my opinion in terms of a foundation brush I don't know which brush to use I might use this one this is the Real Techniques brush well there was me thinking I'm so super pale so this foundation will completely match I actually think my skin is not this pale right now I do think I'm like probably one shade darker than this in reality but I feel like it's better to bronze up than to start to dark I've got all the songs from the greatest showmen stuck in my head on repeat okay based on face base done I've actually been loving and using using and loving the Kylie Jenner skin concealers this shade is in the color bone which is a slightly pinky tone so it goes really nicely into the eyes but also is quite a good match for my skin so I'm just slapping it on like tribal paint not how you do concealer typically I'm gonna use this bareMinerals brush to blend that I do love me a liquid concealer I always think stick one looks so great and they offer really great coverage as well but I just can't get on with a stick concealer I just find them very drying what are your thoughts let me know I'm gonna put a tiny bit of the collection lasting perfection right in the corners of my eyes I'm addicted to this stuff I can't like not use it it's so weird I feel like until I put this on even if I have my foundation done and other concealers on I just don't feel like it's I don't know I just don't feel like my eyes are as bright as they could look as they do when I have this on speaking of collection last infection I actually believe they're getting more shades of this which is great very great now that I've done like all the liquid I do like to do a little bit of the bare minerals on top as a bit of like a setting powder it is technically a foundation and in summer I actually wore this on top of concealer which I really really enjoyed but I just yeah I prefer to kind of set it a little bit with a tiny bit of this I'm going to use this beautiful spectrum brush to blend it in I also just find it just gives a really nice finish there we go all done next thing I'm going to do is add a little bit of bronzer I am using this Marc Jacobs bronzer in tantastic in 104 and I'm gonna use this lightly because I think this is probably for summer when you actually have a tan because it is quite dark but I really like it I like that it has like a bit of warmth to it so it feels a bit more natural and it's matte and the brush I'm using for this is a Kylie Jenner brush in number three I've also been using those here they are in my little brush holder I really really like them a couple of them do shed a little bit at first but I found that the more I've use them the less it's done that so take a little bit down the neck because if you're gonna tan your face you have to remember that this is also visible and mine is twice as long as the average neck I'm sure so I feel like I'm having to put more on I don't know if it's possible for someone's neck to like grow more but I do feel like the older I'm getting the longer my neck is oh gosh done okay happy with that for my blusher I am going to use this this is the Bobbi Brown highlighting a powder in opal glow it is beautiful I love it and I'm gonna use this little brush it's the Kylie Jenner number eight which I have found is like the perfect size to get like the apples of your cheeks or to do highlight on your cheekbones I love that you guys know how much I love a pinky highlight I actually think it's like my favorite kind of highlight because it gives a very like healthy look because that touch of pink in it take a little bit down the nose and pop like the remnants on your forehead it's so pretty love that okay finished with that I'm now going to move on to eyes and eyebrows I'm gonna start with a primer if I'm in a rush I don't tend to do this but if I have a little bit more time then I will because it does make a little bit more of a difference on how long your eyeshadow last but also like the quality of the eyeshadow always looks much better if you use a base also if you get oily eyelids I'm afraid it's a must or if you've used quite a lot of product like obviously I put concealer around my eyes but not everybody does that if you're blessed with beautiful under eyes you don't always have to put concealer on your eyes or if you don't have very blue eyelids you don't have to either but I was not blessed with non blue eyelids so using something to like neutralize that but also kind of become like a bit of a glue for your eye shadow is always much better I'm gonna zoom you in a bit now because we're gonna be all up here I have three products here that I'm gonna use my eyebrows one is the Makeup Forever aqua brow again a product that I always kind of flit in and out of using the spectrum a17 brush which is just a angled brush which is perfect for eyebrows and then the benefit 24-hour brow setter don't go anywhere without this especially because I'm growing my brows they can become quite unruly so I put a little dollop of the gel on the back of my hand and then I just dip my brush in it and kind of tap it on it's the closest I've come to painting since sixth form actually I kind of like it it's like painting in your brows right I don't know if you can see but I have a few bits here that just won't grow I'm trying really hard but I do have a couple of gaps this one is much better this one is far more goofy so I really just use it to fill in any gaps and give it a bit more shape that already looks a lot better this is my favorite brow to fill in I feel like there's always a favorite brow this one is my best brow but this is my best side so that's annoying isn't it oh excuse you I'm happy with them they're quite bold you don't have to make them this bold if you don't want to I generally do but then when I comb them through with this it doesn't look so stark I am gonna be using this this is the color pop all I see is magic shadow palette I've already got it dirty I'm very sad about that cardboard so unless you're very clean and careful with your makeup which I am sometimes then that might not happen but sadly it has happened this has some really beautiful colors in it I am going to be using this very light peach and this very light these very light colors here I'm gonna make a very subtle I'm gonna start with this very light kind of peachy nude and I'm gonna just pop that all over my eyelid I literally just like whack this on if I'm in a rush okay that is all over the eyelid now I am going to take this like very pretty peachy color which has a tiny bit of shimmer on it which is quite like and I'm just gonna again go all in I'm gonna use this little spectrum brush this is the a12 and I'm gonna use that same like peachy color and just go a little bit under the eye just to tie it in a bit now I is very subtle like this is quite subtle for me normally I'm like all about the dark in the outer corner and under the eye but I quite like that this is a bit more simple okay that's pretty much all I want to do to my eyes I am going to put a bit of brown liquid liner on it's still a very dark brown so I think unless you're looking very closely at someone's are you probably wouldn't notice but I quite like using Brown as an eyeliner color I think black is a very like popular go-to shade you should consider a dark brown because I think it just looks a little more subtle I don't know I just I like the dark brown at the my bomb I've got so caught up in telling you about brown eyeliner I didn't say the one I'm using it's the you a kitten liner paraben free and long wear it's now time for mascara and it might be no surprise to you that I am using the Smith &amp; Colt lush dance mascara I love my eyes switching oh my god do you ever get a twitchy eye and then you go to someone look how much my eyes twitching and then it stops honestly it's twitching so much I bet you can't see it probably not there we go lips yes so I have two options for a pinky nude I've got my trusty Rimmel Kate Moss in 38 and then I have this one which is a newer addition to my lipstick collection and it is the Marc Jacobs sonic truth and I think this is the first tutorial tutorial for a while where I've not used a liquid lipstick I know I might go for the Marc Jacobs actually they're very similar in color but that's so lovely and creamy I love it and that is essentially everything I've been doing over the past couple of weeks really I've just really enjoyed focusing a bit more on making my skin look more alive and a bit more dewy and a bit more healthy and things like the primer and the foundation you use and the highlight and blush actually make a lot of difference and then I've kept my eyes pretty basic just like a little tiny wash of color and then the eyeliner and the mascara kind of does more of the talking and then a very kind of more pretty subdued pinky nude lip I really hope you guys enjoyed this makeup look be sure

some days I forget to do this I just look Rubby and thank you so much for watching I'll see you soon bye 
hello everyone today I am going to be chatting you through my April favorites firstly I want to say two things it's actually really hot today so I have the window open so I do apologize if you hear dogs barking kids screaming or men banging hammers second thing I want to apologize for is if you catch a glimpse of my orange armpit I have a little bit of a fake tan mishap going on in my pit region and I just thought it would be the best day to wear a top that does this and shows my armpit like this one's fine this one mm not so much so I have it orange armpit so if you catch sight of that which you probably wouldn't have noticed if I hadn't have pointed out to you but now that you have noticed it I apologize for the orange jumper first thing is this which is the Clinique take the day off cleansing oil I have tried the Khaliq take the day off balm and I didn't get on with it as well I really wanted to like it because I've heard so many amazing things from a lot of different people about it I'm very used to using something like the Emma bar Emma bar me Emma Hardy cleansing balm which I feel like is a lot softer in consistency so I didn't find myself rubbing my eyes too much with that one but when I use the Clinique one it is a slightly firmer texture so I found that I was rubbing too hard so I just think my eyes didn't like it just didn't get on with it since I'd been using the tatah Harper cleansing oil to remove makeup I've basically fallen in love with using oils to take my makeup off at the end of the day so I wanted to give this one a try I can't remember when I ordered this possibly January February time from the John Lewis website actually and I love it I am obsessed with it I use this every single night to remove my makeup I find it really easy to use the makeup literally just melts away and I don't know I've just really enjoyed it really really liked it it just makes it so easy and for me taking my makeup off isn't my favorite part of my skincare regime so anything that makes it that little bit more enjoyable or that little bit nicer is a bonus I've been trying to convert people to this so that then extends to you guys because it's just a really good product really really good product on to make up I feel like you guys will have seen a half of this already because I have been vlogging a lot and using these products and I've mentioned two of these products in a couple of videos but the first thing is this it's the Too Faced is it called sweet yeah sweet peach color I've just been using this like every single day since I've had it I love pretty much every color in here there's so many variations it smells of peaches there's nothing not to love about this palette and I have seen this actually in debenhams so if you have a Debenhams near you and you want to try and grab this I've seen loads in stock well place sure have them in the devlins in the Brighton store anyway so but I just I don't know I just love to face a shadows they blend well they last well the colors are gorgeous really vibrant I just have no complaints absolutely no complaints and as I said in a previous video I will be taking this on my holidays with me another thing by Too Faced is this which I've also shown in a video and on my vlog channel and it is the Too Faced sparkling Bellini blush this is just gorgeous it makes you look like you have this really healthy sunkissed kind of glow to your cheeks I'm wearing it today I really like it blends beautifully um it's it's kind of three different shades but I kind of just swirl my brush around in that and kind of just pop it on my cheekbone but yeah love it love it another thing I've also mentioned and I even think in the videos like this is for sure gonna end up in my favourites because I could just tell is this which is the urban decay afterglow highlighter which says it lasts for eight hours I can't say I've actually tested that theory I mean I put it on in a day but I don't I'm not one of these people that kind of checks checks my makeup throughout the day once I've done it I kind of just leave it and then I'll mostly just catch that myself in like a reflection or in a mirror in a shop and I'm like oh my god I need to sort my makeup out but I don't know whether this last eight hours basically moral of the story and it is in the color fireball and it's just so full stuck a finger in it it's just so pretty again I have it on today it looks peachy in the pan but actually it has this really gorgeous iridescent pink tone to it which really accentuates your cheekbones and reminds me of my all-time faves Dale oddities blush so if you love that or you really like a very baby pink iridescent highlighters on your cheekbones then I would for sure give this a try I guess it's not really very natural to have pink as a highlighter shade and I can see why some people wouldn't want to do that but I personally really like it it's pretty much like a highlighter and a blush in one to be honest next thing that I've been wearing quite a lot and a lot of you have been asking me what it is that I've been wearing on my lips so much I don't actually have it on today but I have been wearing it a lot is the Clarins lip liner in the color Oh - nude beige I've just been wearing that oh it's completely blunt I've just been wearing this over my entire lips so lining my lips and then completely filling them in and leaving it and I love it I think it's just this shade I'm going to sneeze oh no it's like tickling in the back of my nose but I don't know if I'm gonna actually sneeze come on nope sneezes gone it's kind of like a nudey Brown and I have for sure come to realize that I'm much prefer before I'm much before I much prefer matte shades on my lips whether that's a bright color or a nude I much prefer something to be matte I just think it suits me better and it also lasts longer um and yeah I've just been really really loving this it's a really lovely color and it's a really lovely consistency lasts really well and I don't feel like I have just a lip line on my lips because lip liners can be quite drying I just don't find that this is that drying so definitely check that out if you are after a newly brown shade for your lips two more lip items what why do I have so many lip items today I've been really in like really enlightening I've been really and liking you I've been really enjoying the Knicks or NYX soft matte lip creams now if you do watch my vlogs sorry I'm plugging my vlog so much I will leave a link in the description box if any of you don't watch them but I was recently shopping in my local boots in Brighton and they had this huge NYX stand which I swear hasn't always been there and if it has I'm blind but they had so many things when whenever I watch any American youtubers who have really easy access to NYX I'm so jealous because the products look so cool and so exciting and it's just that typical thing of you really want what you can't have so when I saw the NYX counter I was so excited slightly frustrating though because I did actually leave my purse at home and me and poppy were shopping with Shaun poppy is Alfie sister in case you're confused and Shaun is her boyfriend I have to keep remembering that not everybody that watches these videos knows the complete ins and outs of my life um and Shaun was the only one who had his wallet so he was like don't worry I'll get it and you could pay me back but I was completely like restrained and I was like no no I'll just get two I'll just get two of these I'm gonna have to go back and have another look but I picked up this one which is the shade Copenhagen which is a really beautiful dark kind of purply brown colour the colour that you guys know I absolutely love and I also picked one up that was pink as well I have no idea where that is it's living life in the bottom of my handbag somewhere but these are so cool I really really like them I love the consistency and I love the feel of them they don't feel like a liquid lipstick they feel very similar in consistency to these Revlon Ultra HD matte lip colors they sort of feel like like like air like you're putting a mousse on your lips and I really like it it doesn't feel heavy which I think quite a lot of liquid lipsticks can feel obviously they are not as pigmented and opaque and they don't last as long I have found these don't last as long but they also wear really well they don't leave your lips looking patchy or flakey they kind of just fade quite nicely in color so I really really rate these and I'm going to have to go back and find some more for sure this next thing is something that I have been wanting to put in a favourites for like the past three months and I keep forgetting and it is the first aid ultra Repair intensive lip balm this stuff has saved my lips II I would say it's most similar consistency to the NYX lip lip balm lip treatment um it's it's very thick so if you hate thick lip balm or lip salve or lip treatment then you won't like this but I have found this to be really great I put it on just before I go to bed and I wake up in the morning and it's still on my lips and my lips feel ten times better than they did 12 hours prior so I I don't know I just really like it I've used quite a lot actually I've made I've made quite a dent I'm not saying something because bombs like this very rarely ever look like they've been used I guess the only thing I will say is if you really hate putting your finger into a lip product and putting it on your lips you probably won't like this but I just kind of rub it in I just feel like it I don't know it's so thick and like moisturizing but it doesn't really bother me so much it's not sticky it's just balmy you know I actually have two cents today two cents sounds like I have to in America two cents I have two fragrances that I really want to share with you this month both on very opposite sides of the spectrum on the slightly lower end or much much lower end is my zoella beauty let's it's fav favorites fragrance body mist I can't speak today I do apologize I have been using this pretty much the past two months because I just I freaking love it like if any of you haven't smelt this yet please do I really really like it obviously otherwise I wouldn't sell it like I I do find for me the hardest part of doing any new beauty range is picking the fragrance I feel like I'm quite picky with fragrances and it means a lot but I like it and that you guys are going to like it but this one just I don't know I think I've been wearing it a lot more recently because it was being developed and made this time last year it was kind of ready to come out and it reminds me of summer last year and it just brings back so many amazing memories and all the like exciting meetings and it's also really strongly scented for a mist generally mists are a lot weaker in scent than a perfume or an Eau de Toilette but this is a mist and it's super strong smells really like fresh and fruity and I love it in case you aren't familiar this came out with a range called tutti frutti and there's a scrub and a body lotion and a shower gel and lots of other bits and pieces and they will be gradually being replaced by a new and very exciting launch that I have coming up super soon in brackets stay tuned and all my social media for like sneak peeks and little bits and pieces because I'm so excited to share that with you but I am keeping tight-lipped for now but that new collection will slowly be kind of taking over the tutti-frutti range so if you do love the tutti frutti range go out and grab your favorite bits and pieces now because from this from the end of this month onwards it will be it will be leaving the shelves and it will be being replaced by a new and exciting one but still I know that a lot of you have your heart really set on the tutti fruitti range so I would hate for you to just walk in though under and be like where's that scrub gun get it now get it now however this will be staying if you love the scent and you love the mist which I know a lot of you do you will still be able to purchase this so don't fret too much it's just mostly the body stuff that you'll have to grab now if you still want it the next fragrance is a Joe Malone fragrance now I know these are a little out of some people's price range but they are very very luxury amazing quality perfumes this one is the mimosa and cardamom I recently went on a little shopping trip and I was in the Jo Malone store in blue water and a really lovely lady was helping us I've forgotten her name now which makes me feel so bad because I think there's nothing nicer than complimenting somebody on their customer service because all too often and having worked in retail myself it's very easy for people to complain when they aren't happy with something but not enough people praise and compliment it is frustrating that people are so quick to talk about the things they hate all the things that they didn't like but not all too often they will compliment somebody on their customer service or a great experience in retail so do that more often guys I want you to all try at least at least do that once Alfie's really good at that actually really good at that anyway we had a lovely lady in Joe Malone who I've forgotten her name when that really annoyed me I'm half tempted to see if I can rummage through my bag and find the receipt but they were all really lovely in there and she was kind of telling me a little bit more about Joe Malone and how you can mix sense because I already own quite a few Joe Malone cents because they are beautiful and they also last a really long time and I feel like they're really like ageless I mean my nan loves them I love them and everyone in between loves them and they're also very timeless and classic and they have a really great variety of scents and there's I feel like there's always something for everybody I generally really like the fruity and the fresh scents um but I wanted to get something different I wanted to try some of the other ones because it's quite easy to walk into a Jo Malone store and feel a little but overwhelmed there's a lot of bottles there's a lot of different scents there's a lot of different ingredients and sometimes you end up sitting something and going I think I like it I'm not really too sure there's too much choice so if you do go and speak to somebody because they are super lovely and very very helpful and we were talking about the ones that I already have a love which is blackberry and Bay and English pear and freesia and those are my like two favorite and I wanted something that was different to those but there could also be layered with them so I picked up this which is the mimosa and cardamom and this smells so good I feel like this could be a summer scent or a winter scent and it's quite warm and it's quite like vanilla and like fresh at the same time like I feel like it has a little bit of everything I love in a fragrance which is why I've been obsessed with it I also think it works really well as a daytime and nighttime scent just gonna throw that out there another thing I've been loving this month which I don't have anything to physically show you I did have the box on the side and somewhere along the way someone's tidied it away and recycled it so um I can't actually show it to you but it is sourced box which is my friend Marcus and Naomi's joint-venture and it is a healthy subscription service so you guys know that I am probably not the healthiest however I am probably the healthiest right now than I have ever been so there you go at first I was like oh my god it's this sounds like an amazing idea maybe it's not something for me personally because I am a sort of person that would go for a full fat amazing gooey chocolate brownie as opposed to a kind of gluten-free vegan made of beetroot kind of really healthy brownie and that's just more a mind-state I think because I just think that was going to taste better so why would I eat that one however I received the first box complimentary by Markus anomie and I loved it I'm gonna admit that not everything in it is for me but I've tried every single thing in every single box and I have found at least like six different things that I have repurchased and actually bought and eaten as snacks I think I love it because it is making me try new things and they're healthy and it's made me discover so many amazing brands so many amazing ingredients so many things that I would never have even taken a second glance at had I been in a supermarket or in a healthy food store so I absolutely love it I would highly recommend it to any of you that are eating healthily who are vegan who are vegetarian who might just want a slightly healthier snack throughout the day or even if you just want to find new brands and new things to eat it's just a really great box and it's always jam-packed full of things I've never seen before and I'm not just saying that because I love Marcus and Naomi I actually subscribed to their subscription box myself so that I received them every month I get so excited when the postman knocks on my door with it I've genuinely found a really good handful of healthy snacks that I would not have found before just trying to think if there's only like music or any TV shows or films I've seen recently that I really love but this month I've mostly just been reading April was the month for reading I read a lot of books in preparation for the WH Smith book club but I am going to be doing a video all about the books that I've read that I want to recommend to you so I'm not going to do that in this video um tell you one TV show that I have really enjoyed the island by Bear Grylls it has had me on the edge of my seat every single episode it's basically about a group of men and a group of women who are taken to a deserted island and they have to survive and they get given nothing and I really enjoyed that it's literally just come to an end but I'm pretty sure you can watch it online I don't want to forget something because there's a whole month until I can talk about another thing I feel like that's it I feel like that might be everything I don't know I cut I kind of really want to get into a new TV series to be honest Bates Motel I've been really enjoying I started watching that with Tanya and Jim and I really like that but yeah if you have any recommendations for any TV series nah but I actually have time to get stuck into a TV series right now but if you have any that you think I would really like let me know in the comments so yes that is everything I have been loving as always let me know what you've been loving this month in the comments and give the video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and I will see you again very very soon sure ah I wish everyone said tora tora tora lo love it i 
hello everybody today I am here with one of my best friends tiny bird we are going to film at the most likely - so I've written our names on pieces of paper that Jim kindly gave us so both got a ton and we've both got a Zoey so we have Jim wrote most of these and and so we have someone her phone I'm going to read them out we want to backtrack promptly though Oh read out some most likely to statements and we simply have to say which one applies to either of us the list first one sort of really scary part and straight off and other businesses there's the car destroyed passed and a man was in the back he looked really scary and he was pressing side okay it's a windows do you think exactly occasion he do you look just anyone be driving around here in little today which he and we just saw the place as well didn't see or maybe that's what the police were looking for most likely to get fired from a job three feet one I'm gonna put me because yeah oh yeah being fired from a job well you know the only reason they were actually setting when I worked at Starbucks that was a hard worker yeah and I really put my wall into it but they used to put your dishwasher duty because I wasn't fast enough to keep up the pace of making the drinks and then I would get really bored and be like please let me have a go at the drinks that I would slow down there'd be a massive queue but because I was nice and friendly they liked having me around but then people just got no TV accessories that there was three different Starbucks in Norwich at the time and they used to share me on Saturdays in particular people would take it in turns to have that trying owner so on a Saturday because we will have a little Oh and it just used to really get to me until the manager said he was like well if you weren't so lovely we would have probably got rid of you so that was a conference my personality yeah you were just being wasted in style yeah and then the other the other job where I will make a couple more amassing which I really loved working there but Jim was working the art department up in the third floor and I spent most of my time up there yeah nice get me naughty girl who is most likely to lose their dog sorry my sis Barry I need me just because Mallory's yeah though uh no media with the outside world and you have to be so careful we actually thought with lost niala earlier because the door was open and I said to Zoe we were up in the office getting the tripod and I said just after half it's after your Nala and I was like no I think you might think I've got Darla and we were like oh god she's probably gone doing it so my god she goes up my door I'll never see her again ever so yeah it was gonna happen it's gonna be me at least Marvel young man who is most likely to do something illegal and come clean straight away son my biggest fear is prison so if you did something illegal would you go to police station and say I've done something right I would want to go right for it to actually know if I did something illegal I wouldn't be able to not have Jen's I have to tell Jim yeah I'd have to but I never would steal I've never know actually I've stolen victim not a whole bag of picking mix should I say some camera I'm in this pink and blue fizzy um 27 the police are on their way you've done this year yeah we just did a shot when you decide for the Shockers at all have one of those who is most likely to use a Hall Pass if the opportunity came up that's hard well the hard thing for me and this is I reach easy but I don't have a full pass at the moment someone we always talk about it yeah then I married ones who will settle who to all pass be and I was with my friends in LA and we were discussing and I can think of anyone but I think is better than Jim and I'm gonna say neither of us need that I genuinely don't like our boyfriend's beliefs Apple has been a boy forever exact downstairs just being like guys wrong with them I would be sure to ink up my damn ass we love you guys ah would you like our answer I told they both of their stories angles Jim I don't think you would use yours Alfie I'll fix it I'm saying your end is most likely to have children first oh we were just discussing this this morning yeah we want them at the same time well we do really do because we both want a good few years before we even start trying to get spend away yeah so we could potentially try at the same time make them feel crap yeah I really were okay we might end up having them first I feel like maybe oh absolutely really yeah because I'm so sure you're the enemies and wife that you're far more pretty than me yeah and quite breeding and I'm so adamant I want but in the reason I give you is because Jim if you think I'm greedy or my chair is like no that level so I've yeah he's going to be doing some like taking away your contraception and sneaking putting sugar pills in and said oh yeah I'm going to do that in that old TV show footballs wives today and then we go men most likely to kill their partner I feel like if it was an accident it would probably be you by accident but then I would be so terrified going to prison I think my way there's a reoccurring theme in this most like most likely to go to prison tomorrow don't over I'll have nightmares works you may be me what's that I put the questions did you imagine if it was me like I like plotted some like crazy death about me that would be really scary would you still be my friend I'm taking our depends if you really like mentally ill awesome then you wouldn't know a word you were if you were just evil I know I would have your friend would you visit me in prison no I'll come visit you in prison because almost scared of prisons and OPIC deal to you but coming I was trying to say I'll come and visit you when you go cuz of the suite no I'm not going most likely to break out into song in public I feel like we're so similarly on is the freely arms I first of all for you because you're really good at singing you sing a lot no I'm going to say Who okay I'm gonna say me as well a lot of the time I don't realize how much I'm saying yeah like it doesn't it's almost like when I'm thinking I'm singing it born and spent are most likely to get into a fight like what like a physical fight with another person yeah I've been learning a little bit of martial arts recently I wouldn't actually fight everyone I'm gonna see you remotely find you one either no I'm the only reason I'm going to say you is your you're much more like you don't really mind constipation life someone was annoying you like that bill next door you as I know you and have no problem being like you need to shut up ya know if some we'd wish my freak out I've run the opposite if someone pushed me i brough hydras rum we're so similar like I are going to go high today yeah if someone hurt me I wouldn't do anything on I think that how he stepped it might also be so scared they would like punch my
