it up and make sure you have or never hello have cereal in my teeth good morning today is day one of three days of filming in a row like back to back so I've been preparing for this for a while I've been like oh my god it's been a lot it's been a lot coming up to this point and I actually was even supposed to filmed it I just put spare here I wasn't even supposed to film today but I picked up this like last-minute thing I had a fitting poured on Sunday and then I I today's Tuesday day one of this shoot and then I have another shoot of other things that I got there's a lot there's a lot going on I got my cereals and I'm ready to go I'm just like just I got like 20 minutes I'm just chilling I'm gonna relax and get ready and I think I'm gonna do I like didn't really want to because I felt like I don't know I don't know why I don't know why but I feel like it maybe it's coming to a point where it's like I have to just do a video I was like where the hell have I been what the hell am i doing is my channel dead I've been working on so many other things everyone's like do you even do anything anymore it's like yeah I'm getting up at 6 a.m. to do filming for three days in a row get out of here a little more detail probably when I do that video if I do that video if you guys want me to do that video I'll probably go into more detail if slash when I make that video but I've been doing a lot of filming I've said it a bunch of times I've been more like more trying to go towards we're acting and like doing commercial work and doing stuff like that maybe more hosting may be working on show like stuff like that like that's what I found that I'm really passionate about and then I'm really really enjoying so I'm like throwing myself into that and doing everything I can to like build skills around it and just do stuff like that but I wanted to make it clear that like I'm never like quitting twitch I'm not quitting YouTube whether I do it often or not I'm never I mean at least for mice foreseeable future I'm not just gonna abandon my channel I'm still gonna stream when I when I think the most important part is I want to stream when I feel like it I was feeling like and again I'm gonna go into more detail later but like I feeling like it was a job and I was like obligated to and at some points I was because I needed you know financially I needed to support myself and it just it what I loved and what I enjoyed a lot was becoming work which is cool which is awesome to a point cuz then I didn't enjoy it anymore and all my god the Sun just came out and I just got real like oh no cool I'm like blend into a shirt anyway there's so many things that I want to like talk to you about just so you guys can understand like where I'm coming from and what I'm doing and also just like mental health wise and just like being healthy like taking a step back from doing twitch in YouTube full time like made such a huge difference it made such a huge difference because it was definitely a big yeah I hate just be like oh it's stressing me out but land because people aren't gonna understand that I mean a lot of you do but some of you guys don't understand what goes into what content creators do not just me but people like I don't know how people like God and like Vic Starr and like oh my god so many people josh OG like everybody they stream so much and they work so hard to do so much you you don't realize you know even off camera how much else goes into it and it's it's so much and everyone's like please video game for going no it's there's a lot more who's a lot more to it like managing your brain of a well but look there's just so much to it it was just becoming a lot so taking a step back from like having to be on all the time I think that was my biggest but now I'm just making the video now I'm not even I'm not even just talking with the video and warm just making the video having to be like on all the time especially for like me when I have I have depression it was a lot it got hard to fake it got hard to fake being happy all the time and I got hard cuz nobody's happy all the time nobody's happy on a percent of the time and of course there's been streams that I've been down you guys have definitely helped and made me feel so much better so thank you so much not having to force myself to be on camera all the time and not having to like put my face out there all the time when I'm when I'm feeling sad and when I just want to like do nothing it's definitely made a huge difference it's made me a lot happier and I've just been enjoying everything so much more so again I've got I've got so many things that I want to talk about in so many things this is gonna be a whole separate video I know I just did five minutes of 35 seconds of just rambling about this but it's clear that I have a lot to say about it and I know that you guys have a lot of questions too so actually put them in the comments put them in your put them in here what if you have any questions of like what the hell I've been doing or like what's been up or like I would just a life in general just post them in the comments and I'm gonna I'm gonna do a video on that entire day I also have a couple other videos I'm gonna be working on that I like been wanting to do but I just keep putting off and then now I'm not gonna be able to for a little bit because I have three days of filming it's a lot so when you're like Sonia what are you doing a lot like Paulo I going on of course besides filming there's like a bunch of other projects I've been working on it really awesome so anyway I need to I end up my cereals like mush because I got into this vlogging thing so imma eat my cereals and I'm gonna start heading over there I've got today is day one it's something that I haven't been talking about it's the same thing I was filming in Atlanta so I do have footage from that it's just I can't share it yet because it's it's a thing you'll see yeah and again it sucks because a lot of the stuff people are like what are you doing I don't see you doing anything it's because I'm Phil all the stuff but it doesn't come out for like you know a month from now you know what I mean like there's stuff that I'm working on and it's awesome and it's great but it's just you're not gonna see it for like a month so it seems like I'm not doing a lot but there's there's a lot going on I promise you look like a cute oh good morning we've got a got another long day today what I'm vlogging but now I'm not now I stopped I look weird I have nothing on my eyes you guys don't often see me you've seen me a lot without like foundation recently but you don't see me without I stuff it look okay just I don't have eyelashes eyelashes but do you have any wise words for the world of YouTube Satan cat cafe my babies look around just want in on this action this is the only place I needed to be today this is it this is all I needed all right guys made

did it marches loot crate we're going to check it out today also please ignore my life like a closet which is like bursting at the sea I'm totally not hiding like six mountains of laundry please disregard that entirely I feel like at any moment just panties are gonna come personally if you have never seen my little creative videos what I do is I open it up and I don't look and I try to grab them and feel them and that sounds really uh really bad actually now that I it's not back on that I touch things in the bots not much better I open it and feel the rat okay I just just watch the other ones you'll get it if you actually have never heard of loot crate I don't know where you've been because I've been doing these videos for like two years but check it out here Luke Raycom / OMG its Firefox and if you want to order it which is should because they're awesome save a cup of dollar dollars right there I was open now I'm going to read it up there we go right here fox fo XX is going to save you a couple dollars if you decide to order this month's theme is primal so have good luck with that let's get into it do the fittings and open it up I feel a shirt so we're going to start with a shirt usually where I like to start to get to make sure turn it around hold on I feel that I feel the thing on that's whatever anyway it feels really soft by the way oh my god oh my god was spend the rest of my life in this shirt so primal um the only things i could think of our like jumbled steh I don't like the Far Cry primal uh ah I just did I just put the old man logan skits I mean Wolverines kind of primal right sorta okay uh primal primal I don't know I felt like it might have been like beetlejuice if I just say three times I might I might like get ideas in my head but I it's not gonna work like that I'm going to open my eyes let's go actually no wait um I'm gonna get FarCry tribal shirt I don't know I don't know oh okay all right you know what I guess I forgot about look at the gorilla okay that makes it our sorry Winston Winston we got Winston here and also something I say every single time they do it but shouts out for the lady kutsher's we got different arms than you boys okay then she boys so I'm glad that they have it in over and um you know ladies cut official overwatch huge crate Winston shirt this is cute I like it and next we got okay I can't lose this giant box we're just go what we're going right in it ready ah so as always these things are never going to give me any sort of indication because it's in a box the only thing I can guess is like figurine okay what else is primal either maybe it's like a I never actually played Far Cry primal I so I don't know is there like a main animal in that is maybe it's like a cheetah is it a chief all right I'm going cheetah or what did they say before wolverine wolverine what else is probable I feel like there's probably a million million answers and everybody's yelling at me a primal video game hoping something came to mind nothing else okay you know what uh cheetah for some reason and Wolverine that might be a stretch but we'll see Oh like oh my god I got it too okay I need to stand up I need to can i get like it like somebody please applaud please thank thank you thank you thank you oh what the hell oh my god I never guessed some especially where their boxes oh my god I'm so happy so medals oh my god it's a hundred percent diecast metal so I was like why is this thing so heavy that would make a lot of sense Sonia and it is a Logan to Wolverine I just did a skit where I played I played x-23 so that was pretty cool maybe that's not the only reason why I was in my head and we did it guys we did it I think this is my trophy this is like my trophy for finally guessing one I just wanna I just want to thank me and I want it and I want to thank everything internet and Justin Trudeau in my neck / highlights and everyone who brought me here Vicki okay I think this is a yeah this has got to be the pit if it's not well spoiler no it's been uh oh that's actually a super dope too I like this so every month they come out with different pins you can collect based on the theme and this one is of course primal so March 1017 primal pin and I actually really like that and this is sharp out this is ok all right ok it's got to be is it a belt buckle I feel like this is making it a belt buckle watch I'm way off no no it's gotta be a better or like a bottle open now it's a belt buckle okay all right listen listen boys and girls I have no flippin a key uh it is sharp and it is spiky maybe it's a face of a wildcat it is a face of a Jaguar I got bamboozled I thought it was for sure gonna be a belt buckle and I even like for a second for a second thought it might have been a bottle opener but nope nope should have went with my gut it is a predator bottle opener and I got bamboozled ok i was riding off my high of getting the flipping the the die casting and I've got cocky okay I got cocky alright last but certainly not least where is it oh there we go okay so this is is is solid I think it's metal it honestly feels like a license plate like it feels license plate in density not like I'm a like a license plate ologist and I know the density of license plates but it feels like the makeup of a license plate or like a serving platter it could be a platter I don't know maybe it's something maybe it is like I was just like a little mini platter a little mini beat up survival primal platter with Wildcats sorry let's just open my eyes let's go ah for Jurassic world or that was an option too I guess warning do not touch the fence electrified fence through the park a Jurassic world there's a sign not anything that I i said previously but it's actually really cool it's interesting to see them do different things in and have like metal signs and stuff I don't know it's cool I think nope I think that's it it is and of course as always you can like tear open the box and do some things but ever since the great cardboard incident of 2015 probably I haven't been ballsy enough to actually open so you can make you could make a cool Raptor dude and pulled together and do stuff but up not me not today I like to wrap up my loot crate videos by asking you guys which a favorite thing in the crate was and talking about my mind has got to be the shirt well okay you know what I it's hard to it's hard to decide this is the one that I guessed I was very happy about that and it feels like a little trophy for me but ultimately I like the shirt mostly because it's like hella soft and I want to wrap up in a blanket burrito of this entire thing and and I like overwatch a lot so this is my favorite thing what was yours in the great let me know in the comment and again

what at Fox fam I know this is a little late going up but I got December's are new to create DX so this is only like maybe second or third time that I've gotten one so I'm not quite sure I think the theme still follows the same blue Krait theme so it should be revolution we'll find out as we go if you have no idea what the heck loot crate is it's a monthly box subscription thing that you can get with cool nerdy stuff this is the gene X so it's like mega crate and it has like cooler stuff even cooler stuff if you would like some more information you can check out this linger loot crate calm / OMG it's Firefox and if you decide to order you want to save a couple dollars right here fox fo x x is the code that you can use thank you very much you've never seen my loot crate unboxing as i basically try to show you guys first and then i guess what it is although I'm really really bad at it and also I'm not a hundred percent on the theme I'm pretty sure it follows the regular blue crate so it'll be quite a day so I got wet er perhaps a towel it could be a towel or a a muumuu or a scarf or a large hat I don't know it feels knitted but here let me take let me open it oh that's sweater or scarf that's some sweater or scarf material which you know I need both of those in LA so okay so we're gonna follow the same format as the previous crate you're only two that I can think of that it might be is assassin's creed or watchdogs or the animal movie so I'm gonna go assassin's creed because that's the only thing I got oh all right so can we figure is this a scarf it is I was I was unraveling and I'm like is it a very is it like tights is it I don't know but no it's a scarf although I'm already boiling so this is a highly uncomfortable but I thought I had to showcase it for you [Music] we've got whatever the heck this is I'm trying to dig deep and think of like any other sort of pop culture things recently that are like revolution but I've been so not up with everything that I've so um last great hi to mr. robots up in it I've never seen mr. robot but you know what thrown in the mix it's something mr. robots not it's from gears of all the things I've all the things I would have not have guessed gears but this is hella cool it's just like a it's like a figurine you can color it says color tops and it's blank so and on the back it's not it's all colored so putting my puzzle pieces together got all my Blue's Clues I'm pretty sure it's something you can color it that's kind of cool that's different I like that Wow I fell I don't even know what this is supposed to fall I don't know are these together or they are these related and these things related I don't know one fell off of the other oh jeez oh boy alright well I don't know what this is we're gonna open it up what this is it a collar look like giving out collars I'm not judging I'm just curious that feels like a belt buckle hey Knight have you sitting here thinking of revolution Plus belt buckle maybe could it be like McCree like from overwash it just says like BAM we have something like that you use it like that not quite but I was kind of close to the guest not McCree but Luke Cage they're close right this is a hat if I know hats boy I know hats uh this particular hat actually my favorite hat that I own I try to wear it everywhere I go it's really it's it's something that you know sort of represents Who I am and what I'm about thousands Crean I'm ready to the disasters Creed all the time let's go the one time I guess mr. robot of course is not mr. robot the one time I don't guess it some kind of mr. robot mr. robot hat here even if it if okay so this I'm gonna have nothing to go off of because it's in a box uh I guess ok so I'm trying thinks we got Luke Cage we have mr. robot and we have Assassin's Creed damn it some kind of little mini mini thing ah all right I'm just gonna look okay so what is this a scream but Assassin's Creed what this shock causes and today is the day that Sonia will no longer have to drink her vodka straight in the bottle I think that is it besides the pin in the book into the pin we have a mr. robot I'm assuming a little revolution in yes great

Fagin I think it's just packaging is just a trick I have trust issues now right oh ok heavy yes heavy I think it's that I think it's a mug it's got like the size and weight of a of a heavy Mike a really waited mug either that or I'll weapon it feels really heavy although again it's in a square I have no flipping idea we're just gonna open it okay see I got it I got a half got it I didn't get it as good as the other one from the other video but it is a is a king kong a ceramic mug so let's open it up Oh recipes for romance what year is it it is a little why did they come out with this like last year it is a if they King Kong a ceramic mug which and yeah they're really waited they're very heavy is a really good quality so i have got it I got mugged I didn't I didn't get Kong mugs can happen and again something that I'm gonna have no Direction whatsoever a big comic of source let's ok so let's get um Far Cry primal book I said it like I was chanting some crazy like no animal man well that's pretty appropriate that's a very appropriate calming for this straight up animal man yeah I'm about it sure I dig it yep all she wrote oh that's almost all she wrote of course you got your PIN get your pin for the crate and there's a there's Martian a 17 primal loot crate DX great words got him out of a mouth and then there's there's a book the info on what's in it oh oh cool okay yeah there we go I love how they do the inside of the box to make a mess I like to wrap up my loot crate videos by talking about what my favorite thing in the crate was and talk about yours as well mine has got to be the badass reactors low Godzilla because how could that not be your favorite thing it is super cool and not what I expected and I'm excited I want to make a blanket for it and have it in there it's going to glow a little cool and I'm five years old let me know your favorite thing in the crate is from this crate and or other crazy i don't care whatever do what you want in the comments like I can police it any way you do your own thing and if you don't know what Luke rate is and you've never heard of it before I will enlighten you Luke Reid calm / LMGs firefox and if you want to order right here fox fo XX will get you some dollars off and save dollars like I just said in weird today I'm gonna wrap it up I will see you guys next month play

what back Sam so again apologies look on being late with the loot crate videos like I said my last video I hid them in my room and how does that out of us and I just did the regular look in unboxing and it was hella cool now we got the loot courage did he act sauce extreme probably not what a stand for but I'm assuming it's following the same theme and everything as the regular crate so origins is what we got to look for everyone no idea what the heck lucrative had to hear Luke Reid accomplished home just Firefox in air or use that code I keep making weirder and weirder sound effects but you let code box fo XX us to save some downloads so I'm actually super duper excited for this because i think i've only got maybe three DX's and they've always been really really hella good and based on the normal crate which had like Captain America's OG shield there's like real metal and a little like Kiki was a golf kinky teen even ninja turtle thing I opened it and it was glass like you're like ceramic so it was like really really good quality and the shirt was dope I know my magic sauce extra I can't imagine how much extra in extreme and this one's gonna be a raise go oh that's a long please I'll need that in California origins again I don't have any good guesses would just oh gee like Atari stuff like and yes stuff that's really all I got oh it's like it's like Optimus Prime's a little schematic snare it says a 1984 so that's pretty cool an OG schematic next ooh there is a really big really big thing and it's holy heck okay so I've got to be like a big figure is it like an OG Batmobile or like an OG a the Jarvis or like an ode like I don't know um I'm trying to think more comic books maybe it's not more college cool thrown upon of them I have no idea was open it oh ok ok I was like I knew that has got to be some kind of like big or just something I mean obviously but oh that's cool so it's like that it's like Batman oh gee we got Robin we got the whole crew that's cool the classic TV series and their bendable okay uh let's see oh there's a book oh wait no this is like metal oh no we're doing this this is like it's like a license plate what's the heck it was feel like a really weirdly shaped license plate is this like a Back to the Future license plate or something like I don't know I'm trying to think oh gee oh oh it's not oh that's actually really cool though instead of that's like metal so the comic book that we got in the first loop create the one with the first appearance of Superman is now like at this metal uh like something to hang up on the wall that's actually really cool I think that this guy kind of symbolizes how I feel about my entire life in the world right now so maybe that's what I relate to the most I dig it and this was a book in here that I skipped over and but again it's gonna have absolutely not it's too simple I can't help myself so we're up told my god damn it you know why I was actually gonna guess like some kind of although I wasn't gonna say art I was going to say some kind of like she booked for Atari games or like nes games but it's actually art of Atari dude so cool it's literally just talking about different different Atari games and like showing their art and just like little notes on it and stuff like that really I think those are the only things that are less oh no I lied ok so there's another since we figured out what the first one was I'm just know we'll get it there's another one so this one I don't know the backstory behind this one is I mean I'm assuming the first the first appears of Batman but it's another one of the metal a little helping youth and again it feels it a license plate it's like really good quality metal and I just feel it's like sticking out interesting

this is such a weird camera it's the g7x mark two colliding the worlds right now I am currently what a weird colliding a world's here I know so I know you can't see a whole lot but I'm at my old college which is wild and can I say a little bit out there I look a little bit around but I am like at my old at college I'm running into people already so it's just like I'm at college again they're just getting into collegiate eSports and they started this whole ridiculously awesome sea sports arena area I'm gonna show you guys in a second but I am like so they look like tiny TTI's in there better than my setup bull said I'm gonna go rub some pump G and I'll show you guys around I'm pretty sure that I would have absolutely lived here if this was here when I was here maybe it's a good thing maybe it's a good thing that this wasn't here when I was here because this is would have been like the only thing I would have done like I would have lived here I lived here so maybe I'm glad maybe I'm glad it was dude I can't even explain you guys what a weird colliding of worlds this is especially like I went here I took crazy crazy and stuff like that but College [Music] not only for 30 years major man what is this intention to for our college to go in the strategic direction I have to say that the eSports industry has embraced us it's actually been quite incredible the degree to which we would have been able to pick up the phone and get direction and advice on where we should take this today marks the first open tryouts as well for eSports and our bursty team and this team will be held to the same academic standards as every other varsity team at our school and this allows us to reach a whole new demographic a student and they'll be able to enjoy some of the things our sports teams have enjoyed in the past the camaraderie the teamwork and the the school pride that comes with being committed to a new sport here than in college so I'm like touring around my old my old college and stuff like that not only is this the the LAT well there it is is that the lab that I I took C pro in but I ran into two of my old teachers which is crazy hello I mean how I was teaching me it was over how do you how is teaching it was uh it was he was yeah what a crazy experience it's so surreal to be back at like I'm still in my parking lot this is where I parked and I thought people forgot tank parking spots it's so surreal to be back and wearing a nice fancy sweater in my college doing a panel and hanging out for the launch of like a nice wash so crazy my worlds are colliding it's so fun though in like I'm you know I've probably picked on my cousin bunch but like it's so it it's so cool to have like this this little this little college that I went to a being like a leader in collegiate sports in Canada and like just having this arena and supporting it's so crazy it's so crazy that it just so happens to be at the college that I went to and like this is my things the gaming thing will maybe I know I'll do gaming videos shut the hell up don't even use it I do is it their own thing it God God dang it anyways it's hot I'm gonna do my typical thing I'm gonna get some Timmy yeah I'm gonna go to Toronto okay I made it to Toronto but I'm missing something okay we good okay I'm panceliss somebody be careful but this is the reason why I like cannot stay at any other hotel whenever I come to Toronto I wish this was sponsored because this place is super expensive but shangri-la please sponsor me please give me free hotels please look at this they put goddamn flowers and goodies and there's more goodies in there and welcome notes and like to welcome notes cuz why the not and they add some wine ready and out of everything we could place them but there's a there's a mirror right there : where's my well I'm doing this very carefully is that my buy it you're almost Summa but not to mention I am like a big bathroom person and look at this look at his fish I'm just gonna even need water in this tub I don't even what this is this is a waterless tub I don't need it I don't need it's so good I don't even need water I'm just gonna lounge in this cold fast tub so I'm just here for the one nights Arnie was crazy that was a crazy cool experience to see like my old college being this like on the forefront of eSports and it's just cool it's really cool to have that it's surreal that that's the thing and I love being in Toronto this is like one of my favorite cities and I love the shangri-la so I am a happy lady on top of just being happy in life in general and happy with with things and people and what's going on and you guys just just being happy life is happy right now I am in a freezing cold tub about to drink a bottle of Pinot Grigio alone and curl up in bed alone and I'm kidding it's fine life is good I'm just really happy and I feel like I definitely am this is I've kind of taken a little bit of a break from doing a hardcore twee

this time but I hope you will like the little things I made for you I miss your crafting streams it was nice to do my own crafting while watching you doing your own crafting my solution is Cecilia PS the flowers are from you love very Paris they bloom in May oh well you know what it's almost May when I'm opening this right so by the time I upload this it might be May so this is perfect timing see it was meant to be open to now you know I do miss crafting streams - I actually bought an extra camera so I need to unpack my perler stuff the only problem is that like now that I'm in a like a one-bedroom apartment I don't have a lot of space so I've already run out of space for everything that I have and all my perler stuff is packed away because I have nowhere to put the giant shelves I might be able to put them like over here but there's just like so much like I I don't know I'm gonna try to make it work because I actually do really miss doing perler streams they're very like therapeutic oh my god oh it's a bracelet and it's got a blur little space invaders oh dude oh my god you made these these are insane oh my god are these little chicken are these little chicken legs oh no the foxtail for like a split I see now that it's it's like you know what I would have been equally as happy either way but since it cut it kind of did look like a like a chicken leg at first look but now I see it is a little fox tail that is so cute oh my god I kept like you made these these are so cool ah and this is going immediately immediately on my keys it's a keychain and it's this family and it's got a focus on it this is so sweet dude Cecilia this is amazing I can't believe that you made these you're very talented and this is so cool ah thank you so much oh my god I can't wait to be doing crafting streams again and then we can hang out and crafts together this one um I don't actually know it says it's from China I have no idea so unless somebody ordered me something online or I sent myself something I don't know but we'll find out but it's from China how do pretty-pretty have to do ah it's emoji stickers oh my god these are amazing is there any note there's no note or anything some kind anonymous stranger just sent me emoji stickers dude these are actually amazing I love these oh my god ah okay so I've actually uh-oh I forgot I forgot this is the thing so I ordered something because my issue is that I have so many stickers and you guys know that I love dhikr so everybody sends these stickers and I love it please don't stop but the problem is I don't know there's they mean so much to me and I don't know what to do with them there's nothing of like this much value it's so weird to put stickers at this high of a value I know it's bug and weird there's nothing that means that much to me that I want to put all these stickers on like you know people put stickers on their laptop but I'm like I'm probably going to a new laptop or you know stuff like I want something I can't keep so I actually ordered something I'm not going to tell you what it is but it's cool and I hope it's big enough because I'm going to be putting all my stickers on it so it's a cool idea it just might take forever to get here so I've been saving the stickers from the last like three years it sounds psychotic but I've been doing it I would state I've been saving all your stickers and I'm going to be putting them on this thing that I get so I will be saving these I'll be putting a couple of them and I'll be using them for my own personal usage as well thank you very much do two quick little letters here this one just says Firefox there's actually nothing and nothing else do it just fire fun how did this even get in the mail uh oh my goodness okay this is a long this is a long message oh my god it is nerdy panda thank you so much baby haha this is it's a long story and it gets very personal so again I don't want to share it I'll read it off camera but hi Sonia how are you hello I am excellent how are you it's very panda here and just sending a little something that I've been meaning to send for a while but money was tight with bills and all that being a dog sucks sometimes uh sometimes yeah you can although I know my writing sucks I think that you're very cool and I'm glad that I discovered Tom Tucker Jordan and you Amaya Knight one day on YouTube YouTube because you guys are some of the funniest coolest youtubers I've ever kata juta it gets a little personal but nerdy panda thank you I know you've been around for for a long time so thank you thank you baby and I enjoy your little drawings at the bottom here I'll try and not share any personal stuff but look the little socks our little boy Shane this is so sweet and I will read this I will read this off-camera this just save personal stuff thank you and this one this one is from Robert and it's just it's just a message thing although it's got like a little something some in it so let's open it up Oh Oh their guitar pick I'm going to read them in a second I think they have something on them or they make me oh there's more hold on well wait there's more oh my god there's a bunch oh my god I might actually cry because you know that means something to me Oh God and the Blastoise that broke me god damn it this was a little bit long but I'll try and skim through so most of it oh my god you're Sonya I was feeling that this will show up late but whether it does or not happy birthday I'm opening it very late I'm so sorry I was thinking back to your Pokemon pack opening remember your story no that one is so cute it's so nice and now I don't deserve you guys I was I remember - your story about your Blastoise I was hoping for another one well I've been holding on to a holographic one for about 13 years and after gathering dust for so long I figured that it would make a great gift just make sure your dad doesn't sell it I haven't had a yard sale like all my other cars yes because I am lame and I have trouble keeping up with your twisted twitch schedule dude I don't even I mean I have a schedule anymore oh my god look you got a chair you got it you got a a mascara filled tear oh I'm not really sure if anyone else had the idea to send you a Blastoise or if you did get one in another booster pack it didn't open on camera then just in case for good measure I added some dick pics and their pics and they have dick on even know what to say also I'm kind of new to your channel I first heard of you when you did less let's make mistakes together with selenium which means I started to wash around that time that you had big changes in your life but I'll try to keep this note from becoming too personal I mostly just wanted to say thank you for the lulz I hope your 2017 is better than your 2016 was no Phi ever find myself in California it'd be nice to meet you at Comic Con or pecs or more realistically catch you in a csgo match one day once again happy birthday and I hope for 2017 goes great best wishes from Rob or aka event hosted Stein at which I always say her name wrong I'm so sorry happy birthday hope you like the Blastoise and the dick pics I don't even know what to say so if you guys weren't around to that story I basically there was a little shop called a future pastimes in Sarnia where I grew up and I used to go there all the time when I was a kid and they had this wheel you could spin and we could win like pokemon cards and win stuff like that and I kept trying for so long and I like I would never ever get anything and then one time I went in and I hit the big bite the big bucks I got a holographic Blastoise and I was so so happy that I got it and had all my pokemon cards together in ball blob and then eventually my dad ended up selling them at a at the garage there at a garage sale that we had so I missed it this like this is like I don't deserve I don't deserve you guys but this is unbelievably thoughtful and so sweet and I'm not going to cry again dicken thank you so much for that and also I get to show you guys too well but they all just say dick oh thank you for the dick pics as well this is this is so nice thank you oh my god oh I don't deserve these people okay whoa that was a doozy um this one is actually from Amazon so somebody got something from Amazon and sent it to my am to my P o box so I am equally as interested and confused as probably you guys are let's open this up all right I don't think I'm doing this right so um I think it has it won't have a name yet just as Amazon Fulfillment what is this what well I was like it I want to read this real quick just say uh hello Sonia I hope you enjoyed this gift from Jesse or JN d or JN dogs to SS on Twitter and most social media oh thank you Horace but

started watching you it was a bad time and between your streams and videos I got to forget about everything for a little bit I think I found you because of Maya night or Trinity Island and it was my architecture class and my teacher didn't care because I was a senior and wanted to do our big class project in Minecraft I was watching sprinkles do his game and get his ideas mostly but one of them you had or one of them had you and I'm like shaking school I want to check out her stuff and I'm glad that I did it gets a little personal but thank you oh he says I remember I do your logo and it came out like crap because I can't draw it's funny how many people send me something like I can't draw but they're actually really good so when I get the money I'm going to sub to you even though I may not be I would still consider myself per the Fox name of course you are of course you are this is from John so from John Harvey 37 thank you so much can I do a PSM after that well I'm gonna do it

I need to like make my own salsa I need to shred the cheese I need to cut lettuce I need to cut up this need to do this there's so many different parts maybe did time and all right because if you like cut up the cheese too early and then it sits out on the counter and then it gets kinda like weird and then like you're the lettuce starts like getting gross there's like so many things that have to go into tacos make them perfect I mean if I had like unlimited time I would take unlimited time and just make the perfect talk and I would do and binge watch Netflix while learning Japanese what about you have you ever had any other cat other than gonzo yes so my first cat and I got was my first cast okay so as a kid we had a cat named meow very original wait a cat named meow and that was my mom's cab and then as I got a bit older when I the first when I first moved out when I was 17 I got a cat it was a little tiny fluffy like brown kiddin I was like a long-haired tabby looking thing his name was martini but he had our martini had a had leukemia which we didn't know which I didn't know when I when I got it and it passed away like very quickly like within a couple months so martini wasn't with us very long and then I ended up getting a two cat so I had a gray one and an orange one the grey one was named Sammy because my drink of choice at the time was silent Sam vodka as I named her Oh Sammy and then I had an orange tabby and his name was tan G so I had Sammy and tan G and then my mom ended up taking over those cats and had a cat named week which I named the big fat cow looking cat when I when my mom took those two cats I ended up getting gonzo and then the rest is history Oh for a quick moment I also had an orange cat with one of my ex-boyfriends called Evie so what cats in my life holy heck but this is so sweet thank you so much and he gave me a little it did break it broke I'm so sad but I'm going to glue it back together but it's a little it's a little like wooden clock

[Music] hey I'm a zombie of Firefox and we're at Ubisoft today again the behind the scenes look at one of the first Triple A titles to make their way to VR Star Trek bridge group let's go check it out all right oh my god forbid water lovely all right you got your back good we're out here I'm glad that fire is not spreading electrical fire wow so much to see all right are we our shields damaged archers old whatever is here hey according that's okay there one X is - yeah good we got him job heck yeah we mean we even celebratory raising of the roof I would if I can request [Music] hey guys I'm here with David patiska he's the creative director of this awesome game so I just got to play a little bit of it I did the prologue and I'm not going to toot my own horn but I think so did I think I did a pretty good help based on what I heard about your guide to performance I've added almost set a record in it and I want to find what yeah describe yeah so we did we did pretty good I want to give us a little overview of the game sure so the game is essentially what the title says it was about being in Star Trek as a bridge crew there's four different stations captain helm engineering and tactical and each of them have individual responsibilities but we've designed them to rely upon each other so really the end goal is to allow players to come into Star Trek beyond the bridge and operated the crew together but you've never really been able to properly do before with LCR so we're pretty excited about it and we're cool to have you guys here to play today but that's that's the essential to what the game is all about yeah I feel like even if from my own experiences cooperation is is key is very key it's important yeah so it's a Red Storm they're you know very respected in industry they've had contributions and games like like division and far cry so with great performance come great power so I just want to know how you guys utilize it intel core i7 processor right so install is an awesome partner for us I mean the idea is if you buy an i7 with the game you get all sorts of cool additional effects like the physics when you're flying through an asteroid field asteroids have a lot more physicality in motion when they hit the shift of all break apart the bridge destruction is like tons of sparks and fires and it's like way more intense and reflection of the i7 and then like flying through a nebula with their cool weights behind it you know stuff you don't get on the lower end processors it's pretty sweet it's worth having it so being one of the first triple-a titles to make their way into the VR space is huge do you feel any pressure well what we really want to offer the players is lots of ways to play the game lots of replay value and I feel like that's what we're trying to do across several different areas so we have a story campaign where you basically go on your own Star Trek story and being your own Star Trek episodes we have a random mission generator so you play different mission types but they have randomized elements so we want to really add replay value and that's why it's called ongoing voyages right and and there's four different stations they all play really differently and two different breaks with bridges so the aegis and the original bridge which is a pretty different experience it's kind of like using an original foot phone versus a touchscreen smartphone yeah and that's the one thing that you know that I really appreciate is just the replayability you know there's hours and hours and hours of gameplay and I think the coolest part is having the procedurally generated mission you know your experience is never going to be the same right so essentially the format is mission templates with random elements so like the number of enemies will change the types of images change the locations will change and what different locations come different anomalies that might affect your ship so the same mission shouldn't be the same really you know twice so there's just so much to play and I'm really excited for this to come out and thank you for your time thank you thank you all right yeah Wow okay sold tire track bridge crew is awesome I hope you guys enjoyed our tour and you got to check out all the different aspects as a game if you want more intel streamers bootcamp videos check out the links at the end of this video and check out my channel too I want to have some more videos coming out code you 
there was a lights and Internet and walls will ooze green slime oh wait they always do that well uh Merry Christmas like god damn it there is a leak somewhere and there was a huge puddle over here this hasn't stopped like I thought it stopped but it looks like it's still like actively leaking it's coming over here but the problem is that it's going in my closet sorry there's cat litter everywhere by the way this is not cat shit I am gonna point out this is not cat shit it's this bitch's there pellets but it's like soaking my boxes that are in here and I'm pretty sure I've got some like pretty important shit in there so I don't really know what to do also it's actively linking from my light switch which is probably not that good cuz electricity and water I bet is not a good combination huh I guess the leak was a little worse than we originally thought because this is in my bedroom now and shit it ended up getting my mattress like all in this corner and like up the sides and stuff so I mean it's not terrible but like dude and I goddamn leave tomorrow I don't even know what to say gonzo what do we do all right what do we do in this old building I don't say leave tomorrow and damn it a mix the sound sound sound of deep sound damn it damn it damn it damn it damn it damn

it's just flopping I actually I think it's just the wires or something that's probably holding it on so that oh my god oh my god oh I'm gonna have to get that repaired now or something oh god damn it I mean told this gray dog doll isn't so bad I'm a little earlier up here this late and Laurel is like this hot so nice out it's a little gray emojis I'm a little early for once I think jardín get stuck in traffic and I don't know who else is coming so I'm just going to chill here and wait although I made another up I'm so sorry I was so excited to like have my GoPro I brought my GoPro so excited to like mounted on the front and blah blah maybe I don't know there's a way I can still do it I'm sure I could find something I don't know but um I I like brought I brought this which looks inappropriate but I brought it so I could like mail my camera and stuff to my - but then I realized that oh man I can just bring my GoPro and I just swap it out when we meet up here in blah blah well I'm here and I realized that for some reason I don't use my Gober often for some reason I assumed that they had like a little screw hole thing in the bottom but it does not and I don't have the I don't have the casing for it on me so this thing is you so right now unless I like I could just I'm gonna film like that I'm gonna sound like that and then I'm gonna hit a break and choke and die on my GoPro that's it you know what doesn't even died via GoPro not because of like the activities that they were doing because of the GoPro like a crazy Sports but like or whatever people did with GoPro like choked on a GoPro or like been knocked out like anyone died that way I might be the first uh well I guess I'll wait for jarred on ok listen it's not dumb if it works right great oh my god I found some tape in my in my trunk and you know what I we'll see about this where's my phone where is my phone what is it it is Sunday July 30th at 8:50 4:00 in the morning and I would like to mark today as the day that I have had to wait on marathon I am always late and I have made him wait for everything so this is like the one time that I finally am early and I'm finally like I am on waiting on Jordan I've been here ten minutes I have been I have been waiting so there that's my alarm to wake up god it looks so dumb I thought I saw Mike listen that's a little buddy you do a little better how do you feel about so I feel like Jar Don's always first turns over here first I've been here 10 minutes I don't believe now we're waiting on Jordan yeah weird feeling oh boy oh that's nice well that's a little hottest like turnoff noise right well look who decided to join us she was here first what yeah one oh my god it's got teeth mister I get ten million subscribers and I'm too cool to show up on time now yeah oh my goodness I'm in play button and then you just you cool good for us is that what it is if you try to tell my in it and solo I oh my god it doesn't end write a blog lots of blog there's a real prime location for youtubers wait [Music] alright alright blog is super quiet at night serene location oh there we go no way is not the last one it's not the last one Ian there's still one there's still one oh yeah the manual -

this is looking wild what's going on oh hello oh my goodness oh good morning I just wanted to make this clear I'm still like it just it won't go away it's just right here I just congested like I don't have a sore throat and I might try copying spine everything's fine it's just like right in here I am convinced that it is like allergies or something it's gotta be allergies or something I just sound stuffy all the time now regardless I am feeling not like a hot pile of garbage now so that's great I just wanted to say that today's route to and Sunday driving times in here ahead of Jordan he just showed up just showed up yes I beat Jordan I was early again [Music] I'm pretty stoked all right so I didn't actually film anything from our drive but I did get to give her a bath so she's super clean oh she looks so good look at the look at that I've actually got something I'm gonna tell you to know the second I start vlogging someone's just gonna like pop around the corner something so bitch I knew it so hello no wake up greasy gross face hot disgusting garbage mess I'm talking about gone so how are you baby disrespect very unimpressed with everything what's up so I don't know when but I do want to get like some cool shots in my car and finally show you guys like the rap like in full I did sort of like the reveal thing but I want to get like a good video of the car now that it's wrapped and now that everything's dude it's the car I look forward to that like kind of maybe soon I was actually supposed to film that today but the road that we were gonna go on it was closed so Mike I'm just gonna do my Sunday Drive oh my god also so I have this I mentioned it a handful of times and I have this thing that I've been working on it involves my tub and then it involves people and it's gonna be an ongoing thing and I've kind of I don't know why I've had this weird like it there I have like a you know six episodes done of it and they're all edited and they're all ready to go I just need to like do something to the thumbnails and then like literally they're ready to go and I don't know why I've been like hesitant to like put them out and I think he just might be because I'm afraid because I like I really enjoyed them and they're really fun and I'm like so afraid if I just put them out everyone just gonna hate them and it's like what the are you doing so I'm a little nervous just about but they're gonna be and that's why they've been kind of delayed that's why it's been kind of delayed and going out but there there should be there should be they should be going up soon it's actually the trailer I want to put the trailer out this Saturday and it's gonna change the way that I'm so it's gonna change the way that I'm gonna be doing YouTube stuff guyhnic going forward but you're like hey Sonia you don't even do YouTube stuff yeah you son of a bitch and that's half the reason why it sucks when I finally like get the motivation to like in vlog and like share parts of my life and then like upload and everyone's like oh I haven't seen you alone why am I doing this it's just a reflex that's been part of it I've been really sick and it sucks when I do that and I finally get the motivation and then I put it out and then people like uh you know they kind of like on me or they on boa ball like I know that I'm not going to be uploading regularly I've made that very clear until maybe now ish sort of but I'll get to that it just sucks like finally getting the effort and motivation to like vlog and and edit and put myself out there and do this and that Baba and like finally get stuff on YouTube again and then it's just negativity and it sucks it sucks so it's it's hard to go back to that you know willingly this tub thing I think I'm gonna be doing it once a month send me like the first Saturday of the month or something like that and then I want to like keep a little bit more consistent with doing blogs you know that I have a problem with that so I'm gonna try to do more of instead of like daily vlogs or something like that I'm gonna try and like vlog throughout the week also if that's some like cool hair stuff going on this is a good look I'm gonna try to vlog more just throughout the week like little bits and pieces because I felt like whenever I would vlog I would feel pressured to just like I'm vlogging today and today's the day vlog and of all you everything today and it's not it's not healthy it's not good and like sometimes it's boring and I'm forcing myself to do and it's just like blah so I was little bits and pieces throughout my week and kind of piece it together for sort of a week kind of a thing so how the tub thing once a month on a Saturday and then like every every Saturday I'm gonna try to just do like vlogs from throughout the week if there's like an event or if I'm doing like a like a like a skit or if I'm doing like other stuff like that maybe they'll just go up randomly and it's crazy knock everything out of schedule it was uploaded in the middle of week who knows but it would be nice to have that sort of consistency where it's like every Saturday you know you can pop by this channel and fighting see some stuff who knows what's it's gonna be it's gonna be stuffs though and once a month you get to see some tough videos which again I'm still a little nervous for but this is the beginning this is the beginning of the the potential weekly vlog stuff and things even though this is going to even though the trailers gonna go up this Saturday and then I'm just makes this kind of redundant and then it's done probably don't know what I'm gonna upload this and so maybe this isn't the beginning of the schedule but this is your notification of potential sort of maybe loose schedule ish thing and if that seems very promising but that's the best that I can do for now I just need to shake this cold I need to shake this cold I've been sick for like three weeks but I actually got back from Canada and I was super pumped to get back to streaming and get back to like doing stuff and like being and hanging out with you guys this cold outta hell I had a cough before I went to Canada and then like I had seven flights in two weeks and then it just like propelled it into a cold of unbelievable proportions so I'm I'm on the up and up but I am still dying speaking of dying I want to dye my hair and you guys should help me I'm just torn on like what color to actually do cuz I just want to do my ombre like the bottom part that's blond that's a little bit lighter though I got I picked up I've narrowed it down to these ones I really I like red kind of placed the whole Firefox thing I like a little bit of a deeper red maybe that's what I would look like hopefully I'm not happy I don't know this one I really like cuz it's different and everything but I've never done like this I think this one would be cool too it's kind of what it looks like maybe I could do both of them just kidding I don't have that kind of skill I kind of like this one too just that kind of look like Emma it was like kind of looks like Emma and then like actually Marie had a had it had a baby beautiful so I kind of I kind of like this one I like this one too I'm not quite sure I've been leaning more towards this one this is the one that I've been like really kind of set on it's like a teal because you know my favorite color is mint and this is just like a different mint item maybe until is but a different mint right so that's what the color would look like I kind of dig it I kind of dig it let me know in the comments somebody be the the trendsetter and then pick one of these like comment comment read comment light blue comment indigo comment teal and then if you if you see that comment just like it and whichever one that has the most likes I will ignore and probably go my own route but I will take it into consideration thank you so speaking of blogs and getting stuff done um I have a Canada blog that was just finally edited by the way if you guys are curious I'm I do things with my editing and stuff like that now I basically will vlog and then I will do like a quick edit I'll do all like the jump cuts and all just to go cut out all the fat trim the fat and then I usually send it over to my like my my life okay I sent over to my night / highlights and he kind of cleans it up and makes it look better and and  and I'm never saying meme tastic again do your god so I'm gonna head out I know it's actually kind of oh my god I'm freaking number time for 11 minutes Who am I maybe I'll make this it's kind of like standalone vlog just as an a little quick update vlog I'm sorry this is boring you just got talked to my unmake up frizzy whatever this

new ones they're actually like rebooting them and look at this it looks it looks just like it I'm so excited this is so cool I do have this is the one I had those ones as a kid but I also had these

when your burning out and do something about it be proactive I had twitchcon and it was crazy and I was going nuts and then I immediately got home and then the next day flew out to Atlanta and I was going so hard and I was just going crazy I was doing so much at once and then when I got back I was like man I've been going hard for like a week I need to chill and I knew that I knew I was like 10% away from just burning out and just dying so I took the time I'm like fuck it I'm taking a two-day weekend I'm taking like an actual weekend and I did absolutely nothing taste Saturday Thursday Friday you probably saw they didn't post a lot maybe you didn't see because nobody watches my spot I wasn't posting a lot like Thursday Friday it was because it was intentional I was kind of like taking a break in the literally doing nothing I watched Netflix and did nothing by the way there's new episodes of anything for you in review that are out now so get excited this is not an ad I wish it was please pay me it was important because I knew that I was gonna burn out and I gave myself the time to disconnect and do my own thing which is so so important and not a lot of people do that not a lot of streamers do that what you guys need to do it you're gonna you're gonna hurt yourselves and today I got up at 7:00 and I did a workout and I clean and I got all my work done and I felt fucking great so it's important take care of yourself and take a break also be healthy and eat your honey anyway they're all kind of scattered now and I'm doing a weird squats but thank you thank you to Smosh

I think New York is like one of the only cities that I like haven't been to that I Roux so you know fuck the rest of the US and I should not say that I'm going to get deported Trump I'm sorry I think beings into it are you as think as we drugs you are when did you start dyeing hair brown do some people still don't know that that I'm naturally like bleach blonde perfect I my hair since like November 2011 it's weird that I know that oddly specifically because I like when I was involved with the foster care stuff I here at the Youth Advocacy Center we did this thing a Toronto called our voice our turn and we made this thing called my real life book where we got all these new submissions from youth all across Ontario that are in foster care so like the story is getting some more I promise all these youth all across foster care in Ontario they they submitted their experiences we put them all together in this book and presented it at the Parliament and from the Parliament at a in Toronto and we have like MPs NPP's and like important people there like listening to us and shit and like hearing our voices from Foster Harris it was Dell boson is cool to like make changes and have people listen to our problems but the reason I know that the reason is that I was coming up is because it was a two-day conference and the first day I had blonde hair and then overnight I was like generally I'll get I'm like I want to do some different let's do it and I went to dye my hair it ended up this like gross gray green color cuz I use a box dye and then I'm like I calling my friend at midnight I had to get up at 8 a.m. I call my friend midnight he was a hairdressers if there was like blue I do I don't know I slice it i haired I've never dyed my hair before it was scary and I should just do read it a little help with the green and then and then it was all blotchy my boyfriend the time tried to do any miss Chuck the next day of the conference my hair was like this gross red Brown chunky kind of green swamp cut off I am miserable ever since then so I was I think November 2011 ever since then ever dyeing my hair so that was a big long convoluted story for a whole lot of fucking nothing well to God why is there a bed behind your setup because in my room that's it pots vs. pans the world has a right to know I need to pin for you doing I like pan I use a lot of fans I'm team pan let me know in the comments are you team pan are you team pot when you get chicken nuggets or tenders what dipping sauce do you get I don't know this is a Canadian thing I think is a Canadian thing um I can't honey I swear to God I thought I've fucking with you not do it get honey not honey mustard oh fuck with honey mustard get honey and you won't regret it it's really good I again I don't know if it's a Canadian thing but honey with chicken tenders or chicken strips or chicken nuggets there there's a lot of variations of battered chicken but honey try it trust me you won't regret it kid what a mouse do that Mouse do this I forgot that I fucking many eggs and I just thought of nintendo's to which oh my god I'm gonna go eat mini eggs and play with the switch I'm gonna end on this swags to move you know what he says to me do your best Sonya and I appreciate that because I and and you guys should too you should do your best that's all I got there's my inspirational sign-off I don't even know if I'm gonna post this but we'll see what my night / highlights comes up but thank you guys for putting up with my drunken Bridget Q&amp;A I don't know I guess I just I'll just go out sometimes and drink and come back and talk about things but again I'm gonna go fuck with some mini eggs I'm gonna do yeah anyways I've got cheese Express I'm gonna go thank you guys again I love faces ye this 
what Fox fam you can see the big mountain of stuff behind me yes I have not done a P o box video in a really long time but that's not what this is about this is a little bit separate I wanted to do this one separately because it seems like something a little different so without showing the address their address and stuff like that it says elemental knives on the top and I'm a little concerned you guys know my track record with knives and fingers and stuff like that and also knives and videos and promising nudes so I'm a little I don't really know what to think so uh while it's holiday its knife related I don't know let's just open it okay first of all I don't know if this is like a fan that likes bought this from from this company and sent it or I don't know if like the company itself Center I really have no damn idea so I'm just as lost as you guys let's go there is oh man oh man oh as a couple there's a couple different things in here okay what is this holy shit holy hell oh man Jesus shit is that like a real oh my god is that actually oh man that's actually holy shit dude uh uh this can I eat is this legal just like a legal knife to have and am I allowed to own this in America this is really sharp I was really afraid with shooting guns and stuff and um and this scares me too I am not meant to be an American there's more stuff in here and ahead no looks like there's a shirt - wait is there more knives Jesus Christ the hell so I'm sure that this company just like sent me all of this stuff and in whatever and it's a sneaky way to get promo but you know what these knives are fucking cool so I'm ok with that dear companies sometimes it doesn't always have to be a sponsored video just send me cool shit ok so there's these other three boxes you got this guy and we got kind of a bigger a bigger one and then this one right hurr so um if these are more knives I don't know to do with my life juda what the oh is this a uh oh my god is this like my Karambit wait am i slowly getting this are they replicating all the gum gums hey first of all it's not even guns it's knives but are they right replicating why can't I speak I think replicating all the knives that I got oh dude this is fucking dope I'm pretty sure this is illegal I don't think I can own this but uh holy shit this is just like my Karambit in a in counter-strike holy hell I'm pretty sure that I feel like I shouldn't just wave this around I'm pretty sure that they've replicated all of the knives that I have in counter-strike that's crazy although this is actually really sharp is this legal I don't think are you I don't think you're allowed like can you have crammed bits in the US maybe I'm just like a naive Canadian uh but we're gonna we're gonna put we're gonna put that back in there and tuck that away so a quick Google search um says that I can I guess you can own them you can't carry them in California so I couldn't like I guess it's ok to like have this in the house I just can't take it out of the house although this is trumps America so I'm sure it's fine to carry this anywhere alright so there's this one now so I'm just I'm guessing that they've like been replicating or that they are replicating all the knives I have in csgo which is crazy because the first one kind of looked like one that I had but then I saw the Koran bit and that's that's exactly like mine so this one shit holy hell that looks cool damn I don't know if I have one like this I might but like holy shit this feels like highly illegal this just feels illegal to have on my hand right now I'm just such a Canadian okay at least you know that after my incident in October of 2015 I'll be careful now that's a good that's a good gift to send somebody who's cut off the tip of their finger all right last but probably not least this is the last thing we got here it's kind of a longer it looks like it's like a some sort of a display stand or something which is pretty dope so it's got the their logo and stuff on the back that's pretty cool actually okay so I have a bunch of potentially illegal knives I don't know uh and they all look pretty cool so holy hell I'm assuming I mean it doesn't say anywhere um that like I don't know who it's from I'm guessing it's from the company directly although usually when companies do that and they just send it they usually they'll have like a note or something in it but this doesn't I'm not sure if it was like a fan that purchased it through the company and just bought me a bunch of knives more than likely it's the company that just sent it to me in a just sneaky way to view promo but you know what fuck it that they're dope knives so whatever anyway so I I just got a bunch of knives in the mail and I'm gonna go put them away very very carefully so I'll see you guys later 
see you later get out what up Fox and we are back with more honey pop and the last that we left off we finally got to bang the pretty little innocent flower we did it I'm talking we made it we got our

isn't as like wonky and weird and still leaking a little but he seems okay seems like a happy little kitty gonzo do you want to tell the internet anything while we're here give any wise words for the Internet no he's a cat no I don't want to waste any time Sunday driving well it's Sunday drive time look at this and got a little curl we got darn on gammy leg at Ian's I still say this is probably one of my favorite times just pretty not best that's not pretty but look at this that's so nice I think there's like a fake cop right there I think people just buy crown vics to be dicks but I can't tell if it's real or not I'm gonna stay up here I actually have a height advantage for once oh hey Ann you look so tiny in the owner hi I love minions this is me Anne I'm the new mini Ladd minion I have no depth perception oh look at that ass [Music] you I don't know but you can see it you feel good rough there's somebody taking a selfie with Georgie's car oh my god it's great burn your car so popular - but you're not huh oh my god I just got home hi oh good morning oh my god did I just serve you Boop [Applause] [Applause] [Music] all right listen I'm pretty drunk and we got to talk about a few things first of all literally everything fucked up today I had a fun day and I had a cool vlog miss but a fucked up for some reason I something happened on my camera and I don't know what the fuck happened but all of my videos were filmed in like a 640 times something and they're all in like two frames per second like half missing an eyebrow fuck I don't even know anymore so I just went to you and I and I drank a little lot I drank a decent amount and I realized that all my footage is fucked up I really tried and I really wanted this to be like a merry vlog miss and to like actually start getting festive so you know what I did and I'm gonna make it up to you right now this might be a short vlog and because all my vlog footage got ruined by my incompetence spotless and I'm drunk and there's only one thing I need when I'm drunk a hug but besides that motherfucking Elf on the Shelf now I want to discuss this shit because growing up I never had this growing up I never had this I feel like this is an American thing possibly UK I have no idea but I don't remember really having this like a lot in Canada so maybe this is kind of new to me too I'm a boy yes I'm a boy I would even open the box and it looks like satanic like this at all all right so we're gonna open this bitch up and find our new friend I don't like the leaves fucking sitting that makes me uncomfortable I do anybody volunteer to have this thing in their household listen I'm drunk but this this is it this is no good hi I'm just looking over you for Christmas better be good a little bitch is that some Comic Sans I see this whole situation is just really uncomfortable from the get-go it's just like a register his name and stuff what do we name him stare into those beautiful honey brown shit herbal tea eyes and you tell him you tell him you love him and you you give him a name what is his name the one with the most likes wins I'm speaking like I said though I would like the comment with the most likes from every video and after some vodka and some thinking I think let's do it so again it's really hard to tell on mobile um but I'm gonna try and look for the one that has the most likes and we'll go from there so I'm pretty sure the comment that had the most likes was the Fitnessgram Pacer test is a multi-stage aerobic capacity test that it progressively gets more difficult as it continues the 20 meter Pacer test will begin in 30 seconds line up at the start they're running speaking slowly but gets faster each time after you see every time you hear this sound ting remember the run in a straight line and run as long as possible the second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound resistance over the toes will begin the word start on your mark get ready and start but I think the second most likes I think it was 87 likes and it said cup size yeah it's wino SC it says as 87 likes and it says cup size what's your cup size question mark no we'll listen this is a personal question okay I know just don't give my cup size to everybody but it honestly really Matt you know depends depends on like what I'm trying to put in it this is like my standard cup size it's just like a normal everyday glass but honestly I drink a lot of cheese so sometimes I'll take this little this little cup and this is the cup size used to shout sounds to Pocky sponsored please send me money hashtag at I like to use this cup because it's a nice big cup size so bad answer question anyway this isn't very festive just kidding yes to do I don't like the way he's like side-eyeing me I don't it makes me really uncomfortable no I don't like him as a sidenote please if you have a question for me the question with the most likes I will answer tomorrow do you want to apologize for somehow I don't know what happened to all my video footage today so it's kind of a shitty vlog miss from today not like there's really Andy's standards set at all I want you to know too I am reading like pretty much all the comments I'm bored as hell so whenever I go to Starbucks to actually get internet I'm reading pretty much all the comments if there's anything you want to see like GI wise or like people you want me to collab with or just things you want me to do in general put it in the comments I will see it so ask me a question the question with the most likes I am like legally obligated answer tomorrow and please also the comments with a name suggestion with the most likes will be this motherfuckers name I don't like this look he's giving me just makes me uncomfortable ha but you know what he's here and he's part of our family he's like the creepy uncle we need to just accept him and I'll go from there anyway again sorry for the shitty vlogmas I do want to apologize for like not having internet and sometimes they're uploaded kind of late or weird or like I don't know there's a million things but I'm supposed to have internet in a couple days and I'm gonna be doing some stuff this week so hopefully it'll be a little more interesting I get if there's anything you want to see you want me to do or like literally anything to do with vlog Messer justifies anything I don't know tell me and I'll know tell me you know I'll do it I don't know I'll see you tomorrow ok bye

relationship with a girl no I could do that all the bitches I was a pretty fucking dumb I don't know I'm just knocking it I why do I got a date somebody I'm a day myself bitch Lauren at la z22 oh one says best memory okay so admittedly when I read this I thought it said best memory foam and I was like listen I ain't no fucking biologist but I can lay down some memory foam facts but she says best memory from when you were in Canada one of the memories that pops up or like very quickly is I remember I was pretty drunk and I was walking to go to this one beach that I would always go to in my hometown and we like heard some rustling in these trees that like loomed over the entranceway and we kept hearing rustling up in the trees and it was like 11 o'clock at night we're just going to shoot up some fireworks and hang out and drink like Canadians do I guess in the summer so we're like ready to chill and all blah and then we hear like giggling and really what the fuck is going on and there was maybe four or five of us just chillin and then somebody just goddamn jumps from the trees and like lands in front of us in the sand on this Beach and he was just some random Australian guy and he just was in the tree he was chillin in the tree but he ended up being one of our one of our friends so the night I met an Australian in a tree if you could only it was a for the rest of your life what would it be dude I currently alone in front of a camera I got gonzo you somewhere so I'm not that alone I guess Jeremy gays paradoxes can fish sea water if it's clear I mean can we see water yes we can regardless if it's clear or not maybe that's all I know it's like can you see air I don't know where are you going to Bulgaria probably not I'm sorry you got to come over here what is the tattoo on your finger I haven't even like I haven't even done a proper post on this I probably will it's it's just kind of like you know when you're stuck in a loop you feel like you're stuck in a loop was like like friendships and just relationship stuff or career stuff or just like literally anything you're just stuck in a loop and it just feels like you're repeating the same shit you're feeding the same stuff you're not moving forward you're just working the same toxic shit ah it's just like breaking that it's breaking that shuffling it up putting your life on random just breaking a cycle of just you know work stuff into everything friend stuff and just just doing it bang I don't know it's just like I guess it's just getting out of getting out of being in a loop and then I got a bunch of dumb questions do I eat ass no I've never liked how to do just blatantly be like yo listen bitch I want you to just eat my ass I think I've ever had I've never had a dude do that so I guess I've never just come across that so maybe I would I just don't know I've never been presented with that opportunity although I mean you're kind of licking where you poop so when it all boils down to it not good I really got nothing else that's all I got that's all I got nothing's new with me I mean I got a bed table I got a nice tan I don't nightstand now and I still don't play my guitar um what's in song is drawers we got going on you know I have a 360 camera which I a original Game Boy Color some pokemon card glittery nail polish probably a bag of dice which I use for Magic the Gathering I bet there's

turn and see turn right oh dude this is wrong this is dope this is so crazy oh my god it's literally the future of like augmented reality on the dashboard it's showing me my life is showing me my destination it's showing me like where I need to turn it's showing me my miles per hour like this is insane and again it's not like it's not like a car that's built for like performance and power it's just like it's just sexy and it's smooth then it's sleek and it's just like very technological and that's showing me I have like a right turn symbol and it's showing me so I need to turn right here it's like I keep my eyes on the road it's showing me where to go like this is so cool so I might just going back to the same where am I going whitewalls I didn't listen to the navigation oh my god it's so easy and I still didn't listen to it I knew have a get lost sons of bitches it feels weird accelerating and not having like a where we I'm not at my next destination this is my destination I knew I'd get lost are you serious they'd take me on this they'd take me on this driving experience they set me up they put me it with the GPS and they're like here this is big you'll be fine nope I told him I was gonna get locked and I'm fine I think I'm fine I think I'm okay I'm just yeah yes I'm fine I'm fine everything's fine turn right then turn right again no all right we need to we need to do a nice little nice little three-point turn with this thing that I don't only call didn't know reverse reverse first oh my god oh my god there's people waiting I'm sorry guys I'm sorry I just don't know what I'm doing this is like nobody can trust me you can't they probably think I'm stealing the goddamn car now they're probably looking at all the GPS like what the hell is this girl doing we'll see listen Linda no all right I think we're good we did it we made it we out here somehow we're back okay whoa nothing went wrong right guys everything was told please proceed to the highlighted route Oh I think it worked okay holy heck all right we made it we're here and we did the thing it was a nice food drive and nothing bad happened being 5 foot 2 I'm gonna need a little a lot of adjusting 5 foot 2 you'll actually get somebody in that back seat oh yeah I was going to say so it's kind of someone of mine where there's like there's back seats but they're not you know they're they're not back seat let's do it and it's so quiet like I really want your partner I wouldn't even guess that it's on right now that I'm so used to like the wrath like as soon as I started once the gasoline and yeah soon because I'm gonna let you open it up on count I see that 0-62 for point yeah so I would like to and this is 150 cities so base price is 142 and if you compare it against other hybrid sports cars in its class it's half the price I just saved you if I didn't 42,000 perfect it will make a right here and at the end will make a left on the Huntington or campus and important silly smooth yeah that you feel like a little transition from electric the gas back and forth game is hell it's really nice over here we're going great plus we're gonna make a left so it's the clearance on this that I believe is for point to tackle me and expect another folks because nobody's ever asked me that so basically you have the electric motor in the front taking care of those wheels the gasoline engine which is a three cylinder turbo in the back taking care of those wheels so when they're working together in tandem you get a compliance course power of 357 and two torque 420 and what's really interesting is that you have power supplied to those mules and feel like an all-wheel drive as well even though they're not interests [Music] this lighting is not good wait they're like I probably wait Oh barely kinda yeah that's good oh maybe feet uh just a little more so you get the reflection uh so we're just wrapping up with the BMW event would you think  dope dope super dope super dull and

God okay one at a time so I wanted to discuss this one because I appreciate it I appreciate it because they went through the level of detail into putting my tattoo on there they put my goddamn tattoo on there and I appreciate that level of detail so I also appreciate these and I know that you can't see the tip I know that you can't see them but I I appreciate this one because they are large and if that's what you want to imagine me looking like naked for the love of God yes yes picture this as what you what you think I look like this is such a weird thing to send to your editor I feel like I'm just like taking a step back and there's like listen I I know I don't know how much you can blur this with with still showing kind of what it's about but that's my face on there and and now my editor needs to like look at this and then look at me in the face and me why does this come up is that my face what okay I want to go back to this one again I will leave it your discretion and how the fuck to blur any of this but um yeah this one actually came from so I wanted out a two-part thing here this one actually came from me complaining that the fake news out of me out there were not that good and this person fucking hand rude and made this this masterpiece of of Sanner so I I want that's one part also I'm a little sad that I was demoted to less nice personally it's um it's a little disappointing that I have said I had to handle the lesson up a little offended but that's okay but I am thinking I appreciate boy oh boy is wow this one's new get on the house okay they literally just took a if this has blurred beyond Roble on saving it literally is just a naked like porn star with big boobs big boobs and then a poorly cropped photo of me to plastered pretty carelessly on the top and then in paint they took maybe just crop that little bit out they took like like the spray paint feature and just put left me on the stomach so I mean I don't know how they knew that I had that tattoo but I've seen details oh look it's a collab effort that's cute okay listen again I'm going to go back to if you believe that I have a body like that fuck yes I'm just a little disappointed all of you right now Oh Lord okay let's I mean you can you can determine where to where to blur but um just look that base it's so perfect it's so perfect you know I feel like I mean this whole thing is just everything's blurred I'm imagining so I don't know how oh wow man oh man that is just getting in the weird territory I look quite elegant here actually this is a very classy one I appreciate that a lot um can we as I continue scrolling can we get out of this weird fucking Jesus shit I mean you're gonna have to blur it but like I [Music] [Music] 
I'm kind of scared I brought Doug with me are you gonna hold my hand might as well I mean you're in the right place we're at Nazarian plastic surgery and they're gonna be doing the tattoo removal of the Dragon which you have seen on occasion a little nervous cuz I need to get a needle and then lasers so I believe they'd get laid there so I'll show you some of the stuff and I don't know I'm just nervous so send your thoughts and prayers okay well what's it this is a knife a knife through the Dragon a little bit cooler that's cool you all set didn't hurt as much as you thought it would did it yeah oh my god a place called blue dragon and Bobby 26 give me a motor so it has no significance just a boring tattoo that I probably should have got we slap some numbing stuff on it because I'm a big bitch when it comes to needles so we're just waiting on that to numb and then it's Showtime [Music] are you ready okay they're fine look how much fun this is for the fans I don't know I can't tell either way the humane method of tattoo yeah I probably started doing that literally people would get up into bed would be soaked it's fun really oh man without [Music] you had this coming [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] the best [Music] not that 2017 [Music] oh my god I told you what the heck [Music] barely oh my god I can't do anything so nicely [Music] appreciate ya starting it's not just that oh here okay I'll post that and then it really is dying home hold you yeah this is that super cool it wasn't as bad as I thought it would and I mean just kind of a wimp lessons learned yeah right don't be a wimp remove your tattoo oh yes oh boy we're finally getting rid of the dragon um oh my goodness I'm so excited and I was like so worried before it was so easy although Doug didn't tell me that okay you guys obviously know and see that I am horrible with needles like even getting a blood test I don't I just I can't do it I can't do it and he was saying that I should not watch the pottage because apparently they just like go in I don't know I'm a little nervous to watch it so uh Maya night perch I like hey I'm just gonna send you like everything probably so this is a blog that I'm probably never gonna watch because I don't want to see it I don't wanna see it so I just got home and it's kind of chilled out a little bit it's cool how it went like white instantly it's crazy it's crazy how that happens so this is kind of again like now that it's chilled out you can see like pretty much all of the blue is gone almost that's insane like it's insane how even just like one session like most of the blue is gone so we're gonna see how it looks over the next like couple of days and just like you know keep tabs on the process but uh I'm glad that's kind of chilled out one thing I'm realizing is all these like little holes like all those little like dark spots I think that's all the needle punctures because I think they did a lot I'm gonna wait until tomorrow and then I'm gonna like do an update the day after just to see how it's going and then I'm probably gonna throw it in my vlogs every so often like from now on but uh but this is probably gonna be the the conclusion tomorrow will be the conclusion of like this first like just tattoo removal I just kind of want to keep it separate just so it's its own thing and also so I can warn people like hey there might be some gross shit apparently the Neal's pretty bad oh we're gonna have one one video for that and then ending tomorrow and then I'll do some progress ones as we go throughout other vlogs so shout outs to Sheila and her team for like making it so easy she like held my hand this this woman held my she held my hand as we got the needles and like everything was just so easy like I didn't feel a thing uh you guys are you guys are awesome so thank you so much for that as well and just making me I know I'm kind of a kind of a wimp thank you for catering to guys I'm gonna play this switch I'm gonna chill I'm gonna let this chill I'm gonna we're gonna elevate my leg and elevate our lives at the same time in a couple hours I have to go do the Polaroid Patriot you guys really wanted I said if I got 500 retweets and then I would do a like derpy Polaroid patreon so look forward to that this is your forewarning that it is coming and it's coming in hot so it's gonna be something and just prepare for that and I will keep you updated follow my Twitter and Instagram and stuff that's probably where I'm gonna post about it and that's all I got hello there yes I am wearing a romper thanks for noticing I can't really wear pants because of my like cuz of my leg and it's healing and stuff like that so it's really difficult to like wear pants so this is two days after it looks like it like it's not as puffy and crazy and ridiculous and painful yeah it's still healing it got like a lot of the really deep cut like the really bright blue out it's kind of like a like a weird gray blue gross looking thing now so uh I think I've got a few more sections ahead of me but this is a really good start this is a really good start anyway I think it's pretty it's pretty good it's be good now that I can like actually walk on it and it wasn't hurting it was really really swollen and sore I kind of looked up on some stuff and she gave me some advice on stuff to do so I just sort of like rested it I kept it elevated and I was icing it the last couple days because it was like really swollen I put some like polysporin on it or some neosporin or whatever it was to help with the bird and she also gave me this like laser to put on after - so I've been taking good care of it and cleaning it just keeping it keeping it well so hopefully it heals well and then in like six weeks or so I can go for another treatments so I'll probably be posting updates like every now and then I'll just be like putting them in my vlog and stuff like that but I hope you enjoyed this random I got laser tattoo removal video whoo and maybe it was kind of educational at all if you have any questions about anything like that like how it felt er what's it like after I don't know anything that I could probably answer just for my experiences put it in the comments and stuff like that and shout outs to doctors Arion and her amazing team for like taking care of me and being like so sweet and the ended up calling me afterwards just to see how I was doing and just being awesome I am like terrified of needles so just making me feel so comfortable and making the whole experience awesome I am like excited to go back I never thought I would say that I'm excited to go back and get 14 needles and like a laser on my leg but I am actually stoked because you guys are awesome and this is so far so good and I can't wait to get this dragon off my leg so thank you [Applause]

important question nobody with a blank check yes thank you first off do you remember so you rember the love interest right like he kind of had this I know there's a girl that works at the bank and she's got to be cast at like mid-30s and his kids like nine he's got the hots for this like mid-30s girl and obviously she's not really that into him because he's 9 cuz he's 9 years old um but if he was 10 whoo they had this weird love interesting and at the end he's dropping her off like dropping this blowing off so they do this awkward like are you gonna I do vaguely remember this now that you're saying it they kissed I don't remember that yeah they fucking kissed like there was no tongue involved but there was like an extended lip touching touching no time but but awesome very a very long uncomfortably long clearly a gravedigger gold digger Wow that's the one right if it's weird yes I also would like to submit a Photoshop request so as you see this candle send the Yankee Candle

dick [Music] I can't beat that noise [Music] you just do it and I'll slide [Music] there we go [Music] want me to tell you why you like okay hurt your brain okay sort of sort of the what runs the show it's called the ascending reticular activating system for the a res the ascending reticular activating system okay now what is why aren't we still what is thought is that someone with a more active ascending reticular activating system or a rats will just call the a browser not a single goddamn because guys Frank [Music] cool oh hey what's up he's coming back slow yeah spices no special guests gonzo come here yep yep [Music] anyway with a very active a res tend to be more introverted because they require less simulus so what is that tie into EDM you know I've like you young people they're like you know they need that more outside stimulus like big you know lights and very loud sound okay what if I'm just like listening to it very casually like I don't have like to listen a union can I guess sir please like chill stuff what if I listen to like [Music] meet my arm up here now playback bottom scenario ever you pile it high enough we can send you get without getting less easily oh no

yeah the show this is gonna look better people have each other's face right I was looking in your direction I mean things do you want to bring up or anything you ask or talk about or you know I don't like hashtag blessed focus on Instagram do you not feel blessed or do not feel that they that they don't feel blessed so they're lying they probably feel blessed but I believe that it takes all of the sincerity out of a post when you hashtag blessed so if you were to propose an alternate hashtag blessed for people to use what would you recommend hashtag English class hashtag English class this rubber duckies a basketball our fun fact of the day Emanuela I talk to Pam before before I came here she told me that you guys did dad jokes and I looked up a couple of them oh shit yeah Wow you

good morning so this is it this is the beginning of the end this is uh my adventure in the vlog miss hey I said if I got like an obscene around retweets I would I would do it I would do vlog listen I don't even know if I so I don't even get blog misses so what do I start today and then like tomorrow's the first so I just upload today tomorrow cuz like I I don't I don't know so I'm probably doing it wrong already um excuse me and this is totally how I wanted to start vlogging this how festive is it that I had just I just woke up it's like 8:00 a.m. I'm a um panceliss I'm in a James Bond shirt and I'm shower dand disgusting this is gonna be an interesting month for many reasons one I'm moving as you can tell I'm gonna have no internet for parts of this month I'm gonna be like in complete recluse like seclusion for some parts of this month and also I'm a little scared because now I have committed to having a vlog every single goddamn day someone to cover a few bases before we even dive into this like budget vlog myths that I'm going to be - first of all I slept in makeup it's probably gonna happen and semi off day secondly the vlogs might not be as like you know edited like whatever cool - highlight stuff all the time because if I'm gonna probably have to be the one editing most of them because I don't want to kill my night purge I feel if I give him stuff every single day I am going to kill him third there's gonna be times where I'm gonna be like in the middle of nowhere like I have two trips planned that I'm gonna be like in the woods and have no internet no service or anything for like two or three days twice this month so I would have to kind of like prepare some footage and give it to my night prayers highlights or he might just upload literally with something he might upload like anything I don't know so be prepared that it it's some I don't know I'm afraid that I am giving my night purge highlights like just access to my channel so he can literally upload anything he wants so it's a little frightening but uh we'll see what comes with that but I'm gonna do it you guys wanted it and I'm gonna try and I'd love to do this thing I also feel like it might be a good opportunity to show you guys I mean you guys have already seen like how I'm not not when I'm like off-camera what I'm like not you know I feel like sometimes people have different personalities like on and off camera I feel like I'm pretty much the same human being but like there might be times we're like I have a really bad day and I just need to vent and I'm just gonna be sad maybe I'll cry I don't know there's so much going on in my life right now that like I don't know this December is gonna be it's gonna be a long month so I apologize if it's gonna be a lot of just like me talking to a camera and being very bored today is not very festive but uh let's let's kick it off so tomorrow I'm moving and I've got people coming to help me in the morning I got Devin he's my TaskRabbit homey and I've got two cleaners that I usually have come over they are like awesome people they're gonna help me move and then clean up the place so I can hopefully get my deposit back also this situation is going on like I look like I'm balding I'm straight up look like I'm balding because I'm naturally like super blonde so it's it's the thing I'm gonna fix this i'ma fix these we're gonna move some stuff today and maybe I'll show you the new place who knows I don't know what's in store for this festive son of a bitch let's go Oh also I kind of have some older vlogs that that are being edited right now by mine I purged highlights so those should be up soon it's gonna be like completely out of order maybe it'll save me a day give me like a saving grace of uploads and so this is going up Friday so this is going up tomorrow today's Thursday I'm always gonna be like a day behind I guess I don't know I don't know that's the only way that I can like logically do it right now so Saturday bitches you better say your notifications because Saturday is a new tub video so I'm like pretty stoked on that and you know what it's the day before let's just say it Erica is the special guest so it'll be fun I just can't wait to be out of this apartment I feel like I have just like so much bad energy in this place and just so much like just not good memories not good anything so I'm excited to go to this place plus it's trash this is going for donation this has to be moved everything's just trashed and I'm just sick of living in like a trash pile so I'm excited I feel like it's a fresh start and I'm excited to take that I got like half way through my makeup and I realized that I'm like real hungry so I stopped for some food and I was like digging through some of my drawers and I happen to find this this was a note that was left on my car and it reads couldn't help but notice nice car was in the Lotus earlier we have car meets Pablo but the best part was can't guarantee that you won't not regret it and I will never know because I never texted them but I'm making some tea that's about as thrilling us today is gonna get All Right see you later gods up I said man's not hot gonzo [Music] this is this is the first time I'm doing this and probably the most I'm gonna be blogging ever I guess it's there to share some some worries and fears I'm afraid that I'm not gonna be able to keep up with it but I feel like deep down I feel like you know this is it's a cool challenge I feel like I'm gonna do it feel like my life is not as interesting as people might think I think I've kind of turned a little bit more into an introvert like I've been doing just a lot of stuff at home and like not doing crazy stuff until I'm like working and like I have something like I need to do or doing photo shoots or something like I'm I'm pretty chill guess I'm just nervous but I think it'll be fine and we'll find a ways to make it festive I'm just gonna go gonna Santa hat and then every vlog that I do is just automatically festive right seems boring already so why don't I ask you guys what kind of like holiday stuff do you want to see you're just blogs in general I mean we're obviously gonna be doing the the route and two and Sunday driving time I'm gonna have a lots of guns o stuff because they spend most of my time at home anyway so besides driving in gonzo and then me probably like just ranting about stuff I'm really not that interesting so it's gonna be a it's gonna be a fun MA skirt also I was reminded today that if I do hit 800,000 on YouTube before the end of December my self cup quick Erica Ishii my friend Brooklyn and I think there was a maybe a couple other people we're all gonna like lotion ourselves up so it sticks nice and good and we're gonna roll in a pool of glitter if there's one way to kick off a new place it is to completely destroy it with glitter and just ruin my life so please subscribe also I'm lonely and I get my validation from the Internet so thank you all so also I really hate doing this because it just the weird and sometimes it feels kind of gross people ask every year and it warms my heart it really works my heart but I'm like I don't need anything what I'm trying to get at is people always want to ask like oh I want to give you something for Christmas or oh I want to like you know do something but we'll both so I do have an Amazon wishlist but it's it's funny because I usually use it as like my personal wish list of like oh I'm probably gonna buy this later at some point like if I have extra money I'm just gonna like buy this for you know whatever so there's a lot of like random stuff on it but if you want to send a housewarming gift a Christmas gift any anything at all I am gonna put my Amazon wishlist in the description and this is probably the last time I'm gonna talk about it again it just feels weird people just like giving you stuff on the internet when like I you know I don't I'm a big girl if I need something I'll go buy it if I don't have enough money I'll work hard now get something you know what I mean like I if I want something I'm gonna get it I'm a big girl I can get stuff myself so there's like nothing that I need you know what I mean but there is some things that I was like planning on buying there on that list if you'll if you so please alright I just thought of something like kind of fun and it might be a little scary and maybe I'm gonna get myself in the but who knows I will answer I don't even know how to work this I will answer they comment with the most likes any question you want to know about me are like you know like my personal life or like I didn't just my experiences in life like just anything in general anything does he not to be with me any question that you want to know put it in the comments and whichever one has the most likes I will answer it the next day I am afraid of the things that I'm gonna have to act like answer but uh it let's do it let's go in that's my blog miss motto  Emma can you fix this are you gonna get this is Emma high the way high she didn't do it you could do my hair for like how long about two years a long time it's funny because like this place is even close to where I live at all but I Drive like 40 minutes to come see Emma because she's the best so do you think we can get that out all right wishes look yeah so close so compare we almost we almost got it so I'm just gonna have some kind of like a little weird looking here for a little bit you did it we got most of it out though yeah it looks pretty good so I'm just gonna have it's kind of a weird silvery thing for a bit but you know what it is what it is I'm never doing it again I'm gonna do it I'm gonna come in with like purple hair next time sorry Emma it's so good I mean we got most of it oh it's a pretty hard color to get out so I'm gonna have this weird like silvery hair for a hot minute so oh my right this is not a good place to vlog here you're gonna have like a half melt oh there we go kind of I don't know there's no good situation here I don't like this I also just had somebody like I was walking to my car and I had this guy like follow me and he ran up beside me I thought it was a jogger so I moved over and he was just like hey you know I was just waiting for the bus and I you know I felt compelled to like come talk to you so I thought I'd introduce myself and a pearling he does like stress workshops and stuff and he was like I don't have my phone on me he's like but you want to grab a drink no like no arbitrary man that just ran after me no no thank you I feel like as a person I'm getting a lot better instead of being like oh yeah like feeling awkward about it I was straight up just like oh well I'm not you know I'm not interested but like you know thanks like I hope you have a good day below ivali I was I was nice about it but if you're not interested you gotta just like just say no like leave no ambiguity just be like no not interested but like thanks I'm flattered and you don't have a good day kind of a thing I also feel weird having like half of my half of my mind body illuminated so I'm gonna get going I didn't go get my nails did cuz look at this look at that look at that it's bad it's a bad situation here so let's take care of it oh good morning it is like actual December first now and today is not

relationship with a girl no I could do that all the bitches I was a pretty fucking dumb I don't know I'm just knocking it I why do I got a date somebody I'm a day myself bitch Lauren at la z22 oh one says best memory okay so admittedly when I read this I thought it said best memory foam and I was like listen I ain't no fucking biologist but I can lay down some memory foam facts but she says best memory from when you were in Canada one of the memories that pops up or like very quickly is I remember I was pretty drunk and I was walking to go to this one beach that I would always go to in my hometown and we like heard some rustling in these trees that like loomed over the entranceway and we kept hearing rustling up in the trees and it was like 11 o'clock at night we're just going to shoot up some fireworks and hang out and drink like Canadians do I guess in the summer so we're like ready to chill and all blah and then we hear like giggling and really what the fuck is going on and there was maybe four or five of us just chillin and then somebody just goddamn jumps from the trees and like lands in front of us in the sand on this Beach and he was just some random Australian guy and he just was in the tree he was chillin in the tree but he ended up being one of our one of our friends so the night I met an Australian in a tree if you could only it was a for the rest of your life what would it be dude I currently alone in front of a camera I got gonzo you somewhere so I'm not that alone I guess Jeremy gays paradoxes can fish sea water if it's clear I mean can we see water yes we can regardless if it's clear or not maybe that's all I know it's like can you see air I don't know where are you going to Bulgaria probably not I'm sorry you got to come over here what is the tattoo on your finger I haven't even like I haven't even done a proper post on this I probably will it's it's just kind of like you know when you're stuck in a loop you feel like you're stuck in a loop was like like friendships and just relationship stuff or career stuff or just like literally anything you're just stuck in a loop and it just feels like you're repeating the same shit you're feeding the same stuff you're not moving forward you're just working the same toxic shit ah it's just like breaking that it's breaking that shuffling it up putting your life on random just breaking a cycle of just you know work stuff into everything friend stuff and just just doing it bang I don't know it's just like I guess it's just getting out of getting out of being in a loop and then I got a bunch of dumb questions do I eat ass no I've never liked how to do just blatantly be like yo listen bitch I want you to just eat my ass I think I've ever had I've never had a dude do that so I guess I've never just come across that so maybe I would I just don't know I've never been presented with that opportunity although I mean you're kind of licking where you poop so when it all boils down to it not good I really got nothing else that's all I got that's all I got nothing's new with me I mean I got a bed table I got a nice tan I don't nightstand now and I still don't play my guitar um what's in song is drawers we got going on you know I have a 360 camera which I a original Game Boy Color some pokemon card glittery nail polish probably a bag of dice which I use for Magic the Gathering I bet there's some boss-ass guys in here now these are my lame ones I didn't find the good ones there's a hot stash of fucking die around here of dice dice dice I have an extra key for my car I will like Sailor Jupiter thing I think just like oh oh fuck it Oh doesn't do that in the in the series weird like I'm gonna get like fucking cable on this we're away I have casino chips in here finally I think to wrap it all up I've got some burners I hashtag at just kidding um well I today oh my god you can see me in the reflection I hope that you um nobody enjoyed this nobody enjoyed this ride nobody enjoyed this

the first little bit already so some of it I already kind of know so I'm going to kind of try to blast past the beginning and then we're going to get to a place where I have no idea what the hell I'm doing but luckily regardless of if I know what happens in the beginning or not the game is so full of just random little Easter eggs and little things that like you might not catch her like little things that like you just want to explore and like try so I'm going to show you as much as I know and we're going to get to a point that I have no idea what the hell's going on and then we're going to

random dryer portal so I guess we actually just have to do is back to the laundry all right all right let's look look please wait what are some of these stains I don't want to know that stain but like what are some of these fuck it do I have to put all of this in here do I really need to put all it's also very stiff and it concerns me as to why it is stiff I don't really I don't I think I'm done asking questions at this point let's just do the fucking of laundry okay all right the sauce is fuck oh shit wait a second three what yeah morning laundry Oh laundry don't you get it I thought I was doing this whole time morning so I understand like this is a lot for me to process okay you're not giving me enough time to figure this whole thing out oh hey morning morning morning look a hard to figure out good all day so that we can do the laundry their whole fucking day the right way this whole this whole fuckin we went on a fun little session Rick and Morty adventure where nobody clone is going to do our laundry do about that Rick I'm not sure I like I like the sound of that stuff there's no way we had to do all that stuff just so that you can get some crappy laundry detergent listen Maureen I'm good here right yeah for a while now what that develops clone technology and made the Morty clone I knew it was capable of doing the laundry I knew it oh my god a simple matter of sneaking into the intergalactic Nature Preserve stealing the latter raining egg from the nesting ground you know since clone Lord he was expendable I knew it was the ultimate defense against those muttering hey room you know the fake Carmel thought she was the perfect excuse to bring the clone of the nature preserve I had that all planned out we had to make sure we nurtured the baby creature to an appropriate age so it could grow its mother me without mother who else would never be able to make the perfect great reveal mega detergent that I wanted you know I mean this is a very delicate process Morty and we do we do you say okay and we had to upgrade the car so we could properly handle the egg so I created a honey pot for other Rick's to find us but being the only Rick in the multiverse that it successfully acquired an egg as well as nurtured to the proper level of maturity I knew there would be other Rick's that would be interested in making this Omega detergent right I'm the only Rick that once his laundry done properly these other Rick's bring their mega seeds to our universe knowing that this universe lacked a mega seed to create the Omega detergent in the hopes that they could trick the clone into giving the detergent unfortunately for them the implants that are installed inside the clones brain caused him to recognize that Rick not to be me thus ignoring scoop in at the last minute take out both Rick's which the clown surprisingly helped by taking one of them out for us and cut up the formula using the chip I hit decide the clump and the cone then makes the laundry and oh my god and he'll say to you in a plan and all the Rick would show up and it would happen that way I mean what about the giant creature in the sky well what about that you didn't talk about the huge creature to keep fucking guys okay for us in here but it's perfect you know we had improvised it was a real Boondock Saints situation morning we've seen that movie right the cult classic boondocks teen I just probably who goes around are you guys do your thing I'm just gonna I get the laundry or okay guys I got the ice I still got this so you can do your laundry perfectly I can't be time to just ignore me in the brain keep doing your fucking laundry all right calm down morning calm down calm down it all worked up about this big a big deal fuck your clothes fuck your enemy nobody didn't matter down into the lending it came out okay we're fine who cares relax yeah he's Rick keys Rick what would it do some kind of Bugs Bunny episode I mean what is the point well we got some fuck we're gonna cool the bubble caldron shit now this is cool clone doing all the shit and then now we're just standing here what about the laundry tired upset buddy maybe you just need to put this into perspective you know maybe maybe you just need to see that the universe is bigger than you or me or the laundry for that matter but get you some ice cream more tea would that help calm you down yes

lot more stuff you can do in this game a lot more things to do you know the developers really threw in some insane stuff in here man you know to add to the replayability I mean you could play Troy again let me do it well because we have disregarded they thought of everything didn't make sure did Morty there's over you know there's 13 pizzettes just laying around it in the game trying to find all 13 of those I bet you can find them or whatever they call them in the video game world Easter eggs yeah you see right just like god that's like our Easter like Jesus came and her Jesus Christ came

neighbor oh the one that thank you the let me show you into this room that has a camera set up a full bathtub with soap sushis and fully clothed women completely immersed were painting a beautiful

your videos okay by the way but the units are sorry you're still able to see the clutch what are you doing you're making something [Music] maybe that's a very like look at what are you working on now what are you doing in life I'm gonna start doing this series that I you know got a lot of positive feedback on a really small side note do you see what this is shit does that is the Jolly Green giant's telephone people are just gonna watch this and be like these who are so fucking high or high on life time to shine lollipops I never ever did any drugs or drank when I was in high school or college and so yeah I didn't dream spells 21 I was your first Drake that was my first chair tell me about your fruity drink I got alcohol poisoning yeah so my my brother used to my brother used to do sound basically at all the bars in Wichita no I can talk but he would be really well known by everybody because he went to all the bars and he was there every weekend doing sound playing music so when I turned 21 there are all these waitresses and bartenders and all these people were like Mikey's little sisters turning 21 when they saw they saw Pam go home and they knew Mikey Horton and so they were like oh my god Mikey's little sister is gonna be everyone yeah so I've never drank before and I felt bad about I knew that drinks for expensive and I also knew that you know simple like when someone offered me someone that is friendly offers you a drink if some random persons like take this drink you probably don't want to take that drink I found out that I'm not blackout drunk I remember the whole thing I remember the whole night I remember the Milan vomiting I remember the my stomach remember the doctor's visit it was not a good time tell me I was gonna be like oh that's not a good experience a good person probably tributed to 103 people now yeah can you tell me your best dad my best dad Joe I'll tell actual dad jokes my dad's dead oh yeah three Mike Oh straight up real dad sure your judges I don't know if you saw I did an Instagram post recently where I got a little son was in Kansas so I had more freckles which is something came from a mom's side of the family and it made me remember that when we were younger my dad used to tell my sisters and I that the way you got freckles is by standing behind a Calvin farted like obviously we're like no dad so but he cute no matter how many times you we've told him he didn't believe him no matter how many times or how many eye rules he still tells those jokes whenever her my dad would come home from work he'd take a shot at Jack Daniels like a baller he would just come up take a shot of Jack be done but because he didn't want to like just take a swig of a bottle he had it in a glass already he had the glass jar hit the glass bottles okay you hit the glass bottle and brown sack and so he would take swings out of it instead of it being like any of that we want some that would be like aa snakebite medicine oh my god all of our lives it became not just convincing us out of snake by medicine but it was to scare us in the kitchen so we'd be like I'd be like Hinda in the kitchen doing some dishes and my dad goes and I'm like what what and you go you know safe I'm innocent I'm still still tells that joke or the does your face hurt because it's killing me did you just think that your dad got bit by snakes like we were younger yeah erm anyway come what I just I always thought that it was continuous like treatment I love getting multiple cuz the employee be candid towards the same spot so I was just like oh wow it's really like you better when you have it when you have them oh my god that's some talent yeah because then I know that I need to take bigger breaks for better cuts like this oh I bet that that's postmates it's trying to get a hold of us right now you think so probably they were a stalker of mine that somehow even if they did I'll be right down thanks guys for watching this first episode we would have ideas for my wedding video no you're not if you have ideas for me what do you think the show should be called leave them down in the comments or you can tweet at Sonya at oMG it's Firefox with two exes my god hurry the fuck on a time limit drop if you want to check out my stuff at Pamela or 13 or youtube.com slash Pamela learn stuff yeah you should probably turn on the heat [Music] all right thanks Oh 
and the last we left off in our adventures in honey popping policy was that we were trying to get Momo to love us and she loved us very quickly that was like the easiest date I've ever had in this entire game and also in my real life so that was nice I feel like we should just go for broke there's me a stranger okay we just got our a fuck off by oh we should just go for broke and we should just go for everything because this is the fourth date I am already in my bedroom okay fourth day with Momo so this is like the day not to put a lot of pressure on this but this was like a pretty a pretty important deal so she was pretty easy last time and I feel like talking about her like this is very very inappropriate but uh let's get her drunk and see what happens you are a lightweight so let's do both of those okay and quick that was easy oh my god all right wait could I forget her full as well you know I just want to I want to make sure that she's like in her prime I'm going to set myself up for success so maybe I'll get her a gift who knows home complying cookies fuck yeah my kind of a spy day today actually as I am recording this so how appropriate is this with it with a dollop of cream foreshadowing for later here eat eat you're super duper good all right you know what fuck it I way I'm gonna get her a gift for everyone I don't know a tennis racquet and that's a pretty big gift value oh fuck it she's a good girl shake it like real life I have a problem with buying people gifts okay I unlocked one of her one of her hair if I will hold on that's a trait that's not a hairstyle girls uh where you at Momo this one oh that's cute so that was awesome ah ha that is kind of cute I actually really like her kimono the best we're gonna do that gosh I look so cute alright buddy I was gonna date yes that's always what I say wouldn't do that me out I'm like a date I'm um Oh what the shit first of all relatable second of all I've got two questions here one assignment question that else is fucking aw it's so cute I love it I don't press knuckle I think it's supposed to just be a paw print but looks like she's just rocking brass knuckles they're just fucking yet at any point in time but you know what we're gonna risk it day time so we started off with I think it was this one and then oh yeah we're gonna wait so a little bit of that do a little bit of that and it's get an extra turn and we're gonna do a little bit of that sure what of that and then there was another one that oh yeah this one increases the amount of romance that tokens that fall and the next one I want to get is this one out I want to get it so it doubles a passion level although what does it need it needs a lot of sentiment so if I use these as well as just regular sentiment it'll get that up hella fast so let's do that and little bit of that okay I need one more want to slide that in there hey okay there we go so it's double the current passion levels fuck yeah shits rocking it a little bit oh my god things count for so much now oh my god we're on a roll it's too lit at what an ass look at that we're doing okay right 350 out of like 1300 we have 15 turns um I'm not going to be as cocky as last time I feel like we should play things a little smart I actually don't really understand this and consume a select column of tokens like I don't know I don't know how that works and I'm a little afraid yeah well we'll try it early on so if we fuck up we got time to clicks it okay so uh okay um why don't we get rid of this one because then hopefully if I get another Bell in there it'll be easier to to get an extra turn I'm strategizing two buckets I didn't really do a whole lot actually it didn't do much at all okay well whatever we tried it we took our we took risks and that's what you got to do in life but it would that we got 11 turns and rat 5 like 575 at 1300 I my confidence is like slowly falling by the moment we need to get extra turns badly I need to focus on that because I'm getting like a little afraid concern we're I really need a bail man I really need a belt a little afraid that was pretty good 860 out of 1307 moves left wait I need to move this one down one so what can I do damn I didn't that didn't work all that I mean it works but did work for what I wanted it to work with whatever I'll take what I can get 9 5 a 9 55 out of 13 30 I'm still trying to get an extra turn because I'm like getting a little nervous ok this is going ok though 5 moves and I'm at a thousand out of 1330 that was good oh my god oh my god I think we got this I think we got it I think we're in I don't want to like say it prematurely and I don't want to say prematurely before before taking her back to my place but I think we're in dude I'm at 12:07 out of 1332 innocent she's an underage kitty girl I can't take her home no no no no no she's underage no we determine this can every police officer or anything in the law enforcement agency just turn off your monitors and look away immediately please that was actually an alert that wasn't like a Windows alert sound that was like a like a police paging alert to turn away just for a moment this feels wrong actually I thought I would be excited to get some action but this feels wrong um Marty here already here buggin going in going in we're doing the things please stop moaning it's making it worse and I don't know what to say boy oh boy this is uh oh no I got a like you gotta play them like six moves ahead sex is hard man oh my god sex is complicated you got a really plan ahead shit I didn't think that sex would be a stressful oh no yeah really Oh guys their mother is right now and then don't put those back I go oh no oh man they're distracting shit oh no I lost another together we're gonna wear it uh-uh oh geez okay yep there's only six oh no I love to forget oh no I didn't um Bam Bam Bam I'm trying I'm trying a real hard oh geez oh boy here take some of that a little bit of that oh I'm sorry that's right ah I'm sorry these are very sexy noises I oh oh I did it the noises sound a very underage and bad oh jeez oh okay man you know if again if I wasn't concerned with her being like definitely probably underage let's just put a big big lot of sensor on that jeez old boy well ah we did it that was um I was something okay okay well another day another pair of panties I guess so let's line them up there I feel very slutty can we just like end this episode by saying respect women 
what box am so it's not like finally finally doing a loot crate video where it's not late and I'm pretty excited this is April's loot crate the theme is investigate so it has fun without one you don't know what look great is right her right her Luke read accomplished OMG gets Firefox check that out and you can use code socks I don't know why I'm pointing off screen but is right there fox fo X X if you want to save some Dallas you've never seen my loot crate unboxing is basically I show you guys first I close my eyes I try to guess and usually wrong that's the gist of it let's go and that's it this is so I like to start with a shirt I got that I feel the shirt I'm feeling the shirt so as like I don't know I'm turning my head as if closing my eyes is not enough on my own oh it's like double I don't know okay I feel the sleeve print okay just there that say that's not right investigate ah man oh man for some reason I don't know why and it's not even like relevant right now but I just keep thinking of Inspector Gadget investigate uh I don't know we're just gonna look what is that Oh stranger things it's funny because I haven't seen stranger things I feel like I've got so many things I need to watch and this is on my list but I just can't get to them all and have a life so I'm sorry and next step oh my god a these coconut chips and out ah okay so being a seals inside of a box and don't think that I'm going to be able to get this one especially when the only thing that I could think of is Inspector Gadget and the only thing that I know that could possibly be related to stream the things I have so uh investigate I had Inspector Gadget please oh okay it's Jessica Jones alright well I would I wouldn't have thought of it I wouldn't have thought of it but it makes sense so I mean the reflection of my life cup that's what that's a sweet spot Jessica Jones it's a little cute fig she's just messing up some stuff and things get it laughs enough but this feels weird what is this I thought it was like a pack of gum at first and I'm like that's addressing how are they gonna time added but I have no is it a spoon is it an investigative spoon what in the heck whole lot of China ok the pencil it definitely it's a pencil but like but like what kind of pencil yeah my nostrils are too big oh ok the x-files Oh so each of them each of them say something on them I don't think that's good it's not going to focus the truth is out there I want to believe trust no one and that's why they put the I in SBI I'm going to keep the where's up where's the trust no one no that's not it if I want to believe perfect I found my new pencil trust no one and this is really heavy really heavy and again it's in a box and we're just gonna look because there's no way I'm gonna be able to get it oh let's look that man mug okay alright hold on let's get this it is a it's a color-changing uh Batman mug and I wondered oh ok so that would make sense so it's hard it well you kind of see right there so I'm assuming when you put like hot or cold or something in it you see the bat-signal I'm guessing that that changes color we could try it ok so I put some really hot water in here that I really hope that I don't still somehow that would suck I think it's probably going to take a minute but I feel like I can start to see it kind of change Oh [Applause] [Music] all right you can definitely see it a lot more now there's definitely a color change and going on there oh my god conscious cut man and this is a pin I knew it I knew it it's like a little a little tape player and you get one in each great to kind of collect them all sort of thing April 2017 investigate and I think that oh oh oh I was like I went through a range of emotions as I grabbed this in that sense that I felt this and I wondered what could be so small and then I and I picked it up and I realized there was a pencil sharpener and like why in the hell would they put a pencil and then it clued in that they have pencils and there's my range of emotions there and finally there's a little hopeless that comes in each month so this one obviously is investigate if you never don't know what's in it or what's going on or if you want an explanation on something in the crate this has all of your secrets and answers in it hold it dearly and as always they they kind of like do a thing where you can take apart of the box and put it together and make cool stuff I I have been I've got way too many cardboard cuts to try to attempt to do that again but looks like it's an evidence Locker oh I like to wrap up my other great videos by talking about what my favorite thing in the crate was and your favorite thing put it in the comments please I'm lonely mine would have to be honestly I don't know stranger things I haven't seen it but the one thing that I think I can relate to the most I'm going to go to pencils I got a trust know on pencil that I just dropped on the floor but that's my favorite thing

what is up box there this is gonna be a little bit of a different video but it's got some cool stuff so just to make it clear I have partner with Sony Pictures to promote their new movie Jumanji welcome to the jungle which is gonna be coming out December 20th I've got some cool info about that and about a special video that is coming up very soon we're gonna chat at the end of this I promise but enjoy this random random day vlog from a little bit ago it's a little bit old let's go gonzo it's right now oh good morning so my place is absolutely destroyed cuz I'm moving like I said before gonzo loves it though oh oh oh no no yes or no yes no what what is this I'm gonna scratch you and then what's so funny what do you why you so mean to me listen I I home you I love you I feed you and then oh okay now you're being cute again so like I had said and like you can see I'm moving I'm moving again we're doing it I was just thinking between like foster care and between like living on my own and just everything I have moved like 15 maybe more times it's insane so I feel like I feel like I'm kind of a pro at this by now I pretty much like you know most of my life have lived out of a suitcase so I think I'm kind of used to this by now but uh it still sucks every time because it takes so much time out of everything especially when I'm so busy and it's December and everything a cool part about you know cleaning out everything and not only getting rid of all this is going to donation stuff the cool part about digging through all of your old stuff and just digging through stuff and things is finding things that you kind of forgot about one of them is there's a company called outline I think of the outline masks or something in Montreal so you know got a rep the the Canadians they sent me this mask like at the beginning of the year and I thought that either lost it or like I don't know I thought it got misplaced or I never got it I don't know what I thought happened to it but I found it and this thing is so freaking cool I promise this is not an ad but oh dang look at that so it reacts to sound how freaking cool is this okay so we're gonna slap on some beautiful monstercat music which I have total of full permission to use YouTube [Music] [Music] I will now since I've just been like dancing in the dark in my bathroom this thing is cool and I'm really glad that I found it I'm gonna use this like all the time now I dropped it I broken all these sad I might have so I think kind of like I don't know I've been in a mood I think I've just been like stressed because I have so much going on with like video stuff that I have to do and then streaming which is coming up there's a couple things I want to play The Sims so bad and I got a couple photo shoots that are coming up and I'm moving and I'm hosting a thing coming up and it's just like a million things at once and it seems like all of my friends who I would like you know talked to you for support and stuff like that they're like a way for Thanksgiving so like I feel I feel alone I feel alone all my friends are like out doing family things and I'm like trying to pack and like stressing with a million things so I like the last couple of days I've just did like a super shut-in I have like not left my house so I need to do that for my sanity I need to like get out of here so today it's Sunday and it's usually uh rootin tootin Sunday driving time but as I said everyone's kind of doing their thing I think like Ian just had like a long drive with Pam so they're not gonna they're you know didn't make it today Jordan's doing a thing just everyone's busy doing things and stuff so imma have my own room too suddenly driving time I'm not gonna be going to the place that we usually go to because complete honesty it's like to drive up there do that Drive and then come all the way back is like half a tank of gas so I'm not gonna be doing that today I'm gonna take you guys through a drive through my Holland if you guys have never been through through my Holland not highway but just like the normal road it's cool it's like a nice show a little drive they got some cool spots I'm gonna take you guys up there I'm just gonna get out for my sanity I've got some like errands that I need to do I'm gonna take you guys on a trip today and then later today is supposed to be a parade I guess they supposed to be a Christmas break so I think Alex and I are gonna go do that and have Friendship time and yeah that's it now it's like you're on my Instagram so apparently every time I try to leave the house is like the busiest time ever I went to I went to a store the other day on Friday and forgot it was Black Friday so uh yeah that was a little insane and then today today it's Sunday and apparently it's the Hollywood like Christmas parade so I think that a lot of the streets are like being pre closed so this is gonna be fun this is gonna be fun driving around I have to go like super super super north to this place to drop off some old video games I'm getting rid of like I don't want to get rid of that in my collection I have a bunch of old like 3ds games and I've got this like old Xbox that it's just like it's it's I have I have two of them and I have an old one I don't know why I'm keeping it so I'm getting rid of a bunch of old games I might trade it in for something cool we'll see and then I'm gonna drive back I'll probably go through my Holland and then we'll see but we're gonna have to see where the roads are closed because that's just my luck so uh I don't know let's get out of here yeah so I'm at Hollywood right now I'm like Hollywood there's sunset just past sunset and this is like the route that the parade is gonna take and it's not closed off yet so that's kind of nice I can't imagine like what shit show tonight is gonna be oh my god it's gonna be insane any time there's like streets being blocked off because it traffic and alia is already horrible but when you're like cutting off streets and people are like panicking trying to figure out where the fuck to go it makes it like eighty times worse so if you're in LA tonight don't drive anywhere and you are remotely near Hollywood and it's funny how this is like immediately after Thanksgiving this is like it's the same like with in the same breath of Thanksgiving it's already like okay Christmas parade it's not even December why are they doing the Christmas parade now I don't get it [Music] these people beside me are just parked like a hella weird eye Hey yes right alright so I just finished up at the game shop and I try to uh by trying to get rid of this Xbox one because it was a little bit I have like an extra one because companies will send them and I just have extra ones and I don't need them so I like went to sell it but they have to test it and it like takes a while so I was like you know what hey they're gonna take like an hour to actually do it and I was like you know what I don't want it I don't want to have to wait so I ended up just giving it to the guy so early Merry Christmas Ricardo I got some vivos but I can't show you because some of them are actually like four people and it's really bright and I can't show you any leaving my camera and the super hot Sun was a great idea I'm just waiting for this battery to explode now literally a fucking course I'd be stuck behind a tarp oh oh my god I knew this would are you guys they're not are you kidding kidding me yeah usually they like kind of pull over and like let people by especially if you have like a fast car usually they have the respect to do that but I guess not this fucking are you one solace is this Drive and you are ruining yo oh alright alright I'm Audi I this is it this is it right here guys look at this it for you man this is like a big part of why I love this tribe cuz I always just like I like to pull over especially at night oh this place looks crazy but look at this it's so pretty it's so nice to like steal the city and just like escape for a little button I some look down and be like holy shit there is a lot there's a lot of people in here it's crazy I'm enjoy this for a little bit I'll see you later god dammit ace we made it to our next stop which is cat litter which just made me think that taking this car to get cat litter not only pains my soul that this this this beast is being used to get cat litter but it also makes me realize that I honestly need to get like a daily car I need to get like a little beater that I can just drive everywhere so I don't have to keep putting miles on this baby what do you think I should get let me know in the comments what is he thinking right now damn look how my hat is I like it gentlemen that's pretty much it it probably is like posting on 4chan or reddit or something like maggots for boys classes for man but anybody spells like swag with it with a breed yeah swag cuz he's got it he's a classy fucking dynasty not only fuck of it I'm just a zoomed-in okay good and if you see here the broad is off to start yep it's me vvvv planet recording porting from the sea so Alex and I ended up at the the Hollywood Christmas parade which is in November which is in November and has apparently been going on for like how many years like a bunch of years or at least fourteen supposed to say at least fourteen some girl on Twitter says at least fourteen and I have never heard of it no we need this no or right here we're gonna see it morning live from the scene it's me I'm back again and this is DB DB and have a good after evening but he's still going how many times in your life are you gonna be able to just Crump in the middle of like Highland and hallowed House said hallowed you're gonna Crump right in the mint yeah we go yes feel it feel the Crump Alex feel it yes there we go that's it that's it right there I could see his feelings in his emotions how is that that's how that baby shoe there's a story

Girl did you get something done? Is it new hair dye? Hair job? I got my hair done. Oh my god There okay, so like I'm Gay Gun to your head, someone's like you need to get a tattoo on your face what are you getting? A less than three symbol. It's kind of who I am and if somebody's cool and from the internet they'll be like.. aaaaahhhh That's commitment. I feel like maybe they would like troll you And they would like space it out a bunch and just put a bunch of like equal signs So it's just like a really pointy dick like right under your eye. That's like a really pointy one. That's like you'd need to seek medical attention to that kinda of If your emoji penis looks like that? I dont know.. I'm getting sweaty. I thought I'd just make an announcement um Is this a safe place, would you say? Oh absolutely. Okay, I mean it's just us. There's not like a couple thousand people watching um I actually have a tattoo that An ex-boyfriend has the same one. Oh are you gonna share it?

So 'Leonard18' has a burning question for you, he says: "Is a hot dog a sandwich? How are we defining a sandwich Leonard is the question? Is it simply something edible between two pieces of bread? We made water really hot because we knew it would cool down really fast. It's not cooling down We didn't count on the fact that the plastic balls would insulate the water and keep it real hot. It's um, doing something. So um... Does the hot dog refer to a whole contraption with whole hot dog and the bun? Or is it like the hot dog.. people say like gimme some of that hot dog. Is that what people say? Yeah Gimme some of dat hot dog. That's what I say on a regular basis. and they refer to like just like, the bite Yeah You typically don't just make the weiner yeah nobody has ever called a hot dog a sandwich because the sandwich is a separate thing It has a lot of the same components as a sandwich, but I'm gonna have to go with not a sandwich Okay, so you're verdict is not a sandwich. But I'm an open-minded person and if somebody would like to refer to a hotdog as a sandwich Who am I to stop them? Exactly you know what it's tough because I feel like it is still it's meat between two pieces of bread yes technically yes, I Would not personally refer to it as a sandwich, but as I said no judgement here Wikifeets is gonna love that Go visit my page, rate me high. I do have a decent rating on wiki feeds and I don't have nice feet I don't get it. I don't... I have big feet. It's crazy... No your feet are lovely, but also your feet are lovely. No I have an abnormally They could be mama feets My mama feets. Hi mama feets Hi It's getting weird. Yeah well Not a sandwich typically traditionally, but also no judgement Subway sandwiches are shaped like hot dogs You know hot dog I have hair on me. That's kind of gross Could be my hair Honestly, so what is a meme that you think was very underappreciated? Like a meme that kind of went under the radar that we should have took more time to love and care for and share One that it was probably should have been more near and dear to our hearts, but kind of passed by. And I feel like every meme Has its day in the Sun too quickly Smashmouth's All Star has carried on into 2017 for me, somehow by accident Yeah I mean, It's cuz I mentioned it on a show the other day that it was the me it was the song of 2016 and You know one thing led to another and soon people are giffing me a ton of compilations of Smash Mouth mashed up with gifts from the channel. Good The the seal 2017 movement really it took off for a bit. Yeah the 2017 I mean we were trying to get it started kiss from a rose, but yeah, yeah 2017 song of the year I feel like it was it was in a commercial Yeah, Yelp put it in their email. They put kiss me rose in their email in Drake's new album "Like a kiss from a rose I could be the one to seal your whole fate" I feel like it bypassed meme territory and just went right to mainstream. Are you familiar with Soulja Boy? Ye, uh, yeah, yes, you know how it's always like "Soulja Boy tell 'em" What is he trying to tell us? I was hoping I could hit it but then I also thought to myself, If I get my camera wet and yeah, I'm chaotic neutral But you're so sweet! Awww, that's so sweet of you to say, but you never know though. She probably has committed some murders in different states. I don't know I haven't really gone much out of this state. Can we see who squirts higher? yes, ready? This is the longest my bath has stayed hot.

That was that was more like, like a volume. Yeah, I wonder if it's ever going to just shut off *Alarm dings* *Alarm gets louder* *and more demonic* I don't think it's gonna stop *alarm continues* Whenever I get into a tub I usually like splash around and I go hog.

I forgot I had a tit um... a third one. yes Do you have any topics that you would like to discuss or concerns that you have ummmm In general, in life, on the Internet?

now I'm recording this to put in the middle of the it's gonna be a weird transition in this clip that I'm about to play I tried to touch gonzo and he was not having it and I I was trying to say I was just gonna say okay that's the entire sentence that I'm going to say is I was just gonna say I'm gonna play it now he's probably not gonna let me look at it I'm gonna try and slow it down okay what the fuck am I saying I'm not even speaking English I'm so sorry for anyone who has to have any sort of conversation with me and if I am talking too fast tell me to shut the fuck up anyway here's the rest of your vlog he's probably not gonna let me look at it but it's not painful I've touched it it's not painful it's not red or itchy or anything he's got this like bump he's got this bump on his side I felt it when I was petting him before I left for New York so it's like a little little concerned he is getting up there in age so who knows I'm sure it's fine but he hasn't actually had a check-up in a little while too so we're gonna take him to the vet and this bitch always he's the second I get him in a carrier he pees so here hot tips for anyone who has a cat that pees and does that

I'm gonna change and then I got some work to do but I actually wanted to ask you guys so the tub videos are starting to come out to take my shoes off the tub videos are starting to come out you guys have the trailer and you guys have the first one a Pam the tub videos are gonna be coming out the first Saturday of every month I I have so much other stuff going on in my life that I wish I could commit to doing them more often especially because YouTube just isn't a good platform anymore like I hate to say that but it's not half the time my videos are demonetized and it's just not it's not like financially worth it for me to put more effort in and make them you know every other week or like every week or something like that YouTube isn't like profitable for me I just do it because I'd still enjoy it I still do it and I still enjoy doing dumb vlogs I still enjoy making my friends uncomfortable and putting them on bathtub so until I'm like making stacks and I can like you know just say forget it to other stuff that I'm doing and put all my attention on this the tub videos are gonna be the first Saturday I've ever what do you guys think the first episode was Pam I'm gonna link it somewhere check it out in the description I'll link the video if you haven't seen it and the trailer I'll just put the hold I have like a playlist I'm gonna start uploading them in it so you can just watch them all in one place what do you guys think is it everything that you hoped it would be and more and awkward I'm sitting in my tub and it's edited really awkwardly and stuff like that let me know your thoughts let me know if I'm a thot and I can't wait for you guys to see the rest of them you guys can see some of the people I had that I already have the episodes done for in the trailer so look forward to that I'm gonna get going I'm actually gonna edit this video like immediately I'm gonna edit this video right now and I'm gonna send it over to mine I purged highlights he gonna make it all fancy and actually entertaining rather than just me talking to a camera and I will see you next time I decide to do a random vlog of like six days combined in one okay 
well-dressed day 3 vlogmas day 3 I really wanted to wake you guys up with a beautiful best of gift but I suck well no no no I don't suck I ran in a lights hold on I thought I was gonna wake you guys up with a beautiful festive holiday dick but I ran out a lot so I hope you can enjoy the sentiment at least so continuing from yesterday's vlog I have no internet and I need to upload vog miss and I need to edit the the tub stuff I need to do a lot of internet things the spectrum I'm gonna have to like drive to a Starbucks or something I don't know I'm gonna have to figure it out I'm gonna drive somewhere with Internet and do internet things so wish me luck were going on an adventure today I had to go to this little cafe to like get some work done and stuff like that so I changed all the tough stuff and I made sure that was fine but I realized that I dated my whole vlogmas vlog the one that god is gonna be weird the one that came out yesterday because I'm gonna try to get it up to date I edited the whole thing but I was using kind of an older laptop cuz it's the only laptop that I had that has Sony Vegas on it and it said it was gonna take 46 minutes to render a like seven minute video so that's not gonna work so I need to like run home I need to set up my computer I need to transfer this stuff over I need to render out the video and then go out again and fine internet it's so my good bad but merry vlog honest everybody check yourself before you wreck yourself I'm wondering if this is like suggesting that I should punch myself in the face little conservative cars semester we're doing it it's finally becoming an actual vlogmas push copyright strike what is hello how's it going listen I know that my blog miss vlogs have like not been in that best of lately but got two things I'm going to show you first of all this is kind of coming together slowly I'm getting like somewhat of a work space I still have been aimed him I'm still not sure I haven't quite made friends with him yet so we'll see okay well this is something not very exciting although this of course would happen to me I guess I'm the girl who was like putting my my in it in this didn't really think that maybe this should be wrapped in something both of these are broken and glasses just shattered everywhere but I got a cherries chocolate orange covered in glass show this I'm enough so I guess going for anything in this to show you is like an extra challenge because I'm probably just gonna get my hands sliced from glass marry glass mess I probably have so much glass in my head right now but Merry Christmas I'm starting to make it a little bit more seasonal in here and and listen when you're shopping at Tarzan these things got limited selections anyway I'm happy to finally bring a little a little more Christmas into the end of the vlogs and stuff slowly as my place has less everywhere I will show you a little bit more don't get too excited because I've got my kind of boring news but then like also very exciting news that maybe I'll tell you tomorrow listen I just build this bitch and let's not talk about that or or that or or that let's not let's not talk about it if they don't find you handsome I should at least find you're handy so I actually haven't even at this point in my day have not uploaded vlogmas day to and I'm already recording day three having no internet is killing me I'm supposed to have like unlimited tethering on my phone like my hot spots just BLT I'm like oh I'll just use that it will not connect to my laptop for some reason so I'll I'm gonna go to Starbucks and upload just know that I love you guys how much I love you guys I really have to Starbucks just upload this I got you baby are you okay good eye he like keeps squinting his eye and it's like leaking oh baby what's wrong you okay honey I've cleaned it like five or six times it just keeps leaking I'm hoping that maybe it's just from moving and you got like a little sum in his eye or something my poor baby I know what will make that make you feel better I don't think so there at least my blog is festive now right so since I've been doing this thing of you know I'll answer the question of whatever has the most likes in the comments be sure to do that right now any question you want to know to put in the comments which everyone has the most likes I'm gonna just try and answer as honestly as I can a little vlog miss challenge so this one um I think I okay again I still have internet and I can't really tell but like I think that the most I saw too that like had pretty much the same amount was just wondering like what happened to like Allie and Hailey and I and a about Freddie I think the biggest things were that there was such a lack of like communication between all of us in the fact that Allie would have to travel down like every single week I think there is just a lot of differences between us and just like a really big lack of communication and it just sort of once it kind of got there and it like got real then it just kind of sort of fell apart I loved doing the show so much and I would love to do something like that again but then once it kind of comes to going into a studio and having to make money that was the big issue the attack was kind of trimming some stuff because they were they were doing other stuff info but he's focusing you look focusing on Disney and stuff like that and I didn't know how like serious it was or like how quickly I needed to find somebody but I didn't know that you know I should be looking for sponsors a lot harder I had some people in mind that I wanted to work with and like you know have some stuff on the show and do giveaways and stuff like that but I think that it was just kind of too late and that's pretty much that we didn't have any like sponsors at the end so it just wasn't really making anything and we couldn't pay for the studio time it's like really expensive so and then as friends I feel like we just sort of grew apart and I think the biggest thing was just lack of communication between me and just like any friends that I've sort of like lost contact with they're like had differences with I think the biggest thing is honestly just like a huge lack of communication which is something that like I've learned the most this year I think I've never really been this kind of a person but I've sort of caught myself doing it and instead of just telling people kind of what they want to hear I've just been being honest just absolutely all like completely honest and how I'm feeling completely honest on on how I feel about situations and stuff like that so I feel like sometimes a you can have differences with people because of that sometimes people don't really appreciate that and see you're not gonna get along with everybody you're not going to just get along with everybody that's not possible so it's fine to have differences with people and it's fine to just coexist that's fine also I'm getting this little like curlicue thing going on and I'm kind of digging it oh yeah anyway there's so much more to every story and of course there's always another side of every story without going into supreme detail that's pretty much the TLDR of what happened again leave another question for tomorrow and we'll talk about back kick punch it's all in the mind I'm gonna wrap up this vlog I got some stuff I need to do I'm going out for a dinner a nun I got so much to unpack so I'm gonna work on this stuff because I've got some filming later on this week which you're gonna hear about ah ah sound and they need to use my place so I need to clean I really need to get everything set up I hope you enjoyed this vlog miss by the way I know that people usually do like DIYs and like baking and stuff like that if there's anything that you like honestly want me to do let me know I'm gonna grab a friend maybe I'll grab Alex and make a gingerbread house or like I don't know what kind of stuff do you want to see for vlog this let me know and I will see your beautiful faces tomorrow by

pretty busy day I'm actually gonna be oh my god I like I just I just booked so many things like last minute I'm going to pax tomorrow so suddenly I'm going to Seattle tomorrow and I need to like

higher-quality and it's gonna look really cool so I'm like stoked I'm like stoked I've been learning more and more that when I wouldn't when I've been doing brand deals I've just been like taking pictures or like doing stuff and it's always with brands that I love and enjoy I want you to know that that I am I'm not ever going to do things with brands that I don't enjoy working with her that I don't know where that I don't you know I guys I've been doing this for like I've been doing this for like four years turned down a lot of things and it's because like I won't use this product or I won't do this or blah blah blah listen I don't play mobile games do you know how much money I could make from mobile games if I was just to promote mobile games I would be rolling in money but I don't play mobile games so it wouldn't be right to promote mobile games so I don't do that and I hope that you guys understand that that if I work with a broker the brand or I work with the product or I do something that's branded it's because a I'm either enjoying the hell or be I love the company and I love what they do so I hope you understand that and this one's gonna be really fun so I'm super
