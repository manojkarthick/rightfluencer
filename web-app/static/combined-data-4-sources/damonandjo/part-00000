It's been 7 months since I've last seen Dominique Before all o' dat Are you already there? I am not. I will be there. How do you say, "soon?" We'll meet there, ok? Cool? Mhm. This'll be the first time I eat something French in... C'mon, let's cross Ok let's cross You can't even finish your sentence before having to do something else in NY WE'RE CROSSING (This is a joke that only makes sense in French - sorry y'all) This used to be a café that we used to always go to "Why Not" café! You know why? They thought it was ok to charge $5 for a cup of coffee We were paying for the art, ok? We have to support artists If we didn't support artists, there would be no beauty And if there's no beauty, people start losing hope It's really a French soirée now So why'd you have to choose the most expensive French restaurant? I never looked at the menu... The menu wasn't online You can just tell he doesn't like us He has zero interest in speaking with us The most Parisian "Very expensive" *says incorrectly* $11 each wine $11! $11! 11. They're robbing us. Dominique, they're taking advantage. They're taking advantage. Good evening! Is it funny? Those prices were. Dominique and I are arguing. So it's already a French soirée. There's a restaurant in Paris called La Buvette, too. You see! It's a chain... Another fail. Let's go eat an American cheeseburger! NEXT And directly next door, there's another French restaurant Do you speak French? I'm from Brittany, so I obviously do! So we'll speak in French! We're not even French, but we pretend we are. Success! So yeah, even though we're Americans here speaking French in a French restaurant, I just feel like we're causing more of a scene than if we just acted like regular Americans. That's not the menu. Let's get the Cabernet Sauvignon The bottle. Sorry we're out. Baguette Did you check your phone yet? Your mom texted us saying Congrats on 800k subscribers. In a group chat with you and me Dominique goes... So it takes one hour to put some spinach on a plate with a little goat cheese patty Damn Dominique, coming through with those critiques! You're actually the most French Mhm. She's the most French. What's that that you ordered? It's "Chicken Paillard" Two seconds later Merci It was très bien. Ok real talk, I'm starving and I'm gonna go across the street to the deli and get me an egg sandwich So that means one thing only If you want to eat French food here in New York come prepared with a little sandwich or come prepared with a big bank account That too We just paid.... way too much. So leave a comment below about... I wasn't kidding. Anyway, subscribe to our channel We'll see you next time! Bisous! Ciao. "Comment ça pa" (almost French) That doesn't mean I don't wanna have a French soirée Right Damon? Come, come here. Do you miss Paris? Yes! I tried looking for restaurants here that weren't Luxurious Rich Chic Oh so then I'm not coming 
What's up everybody? Happy Damon and Jo's Domingão! Or Jo's Domingão Because Damon is not here with me Today's video is very simple I would like to help you with the most difficult words in this English American language Which we speak here in the US English is easy But the pronunciation is not easy I'll help you with the most difficult words Because I know how to speak english way better than I know portuguese Let's do it everybody The first word is "laugh" Laughter "Laugh" has a "gh" at the end but its pronounced as a "f" It makes no sense, but that's how it is sometimes It isn't "lau-gh" It's "laugh" I laugh, you laugh We all laugh! Next word I love this word When someone is annoying you "Enough" That's it, quit this, enough The same thing as "laugh" Not "cown-three" Not "com-three" Country Or country music But don't say "Cunt..." Because that's a terrible bad word Third word which I love to say "Beach" is "praia" everybody But "bitch" on the other hand it's "puta" Say it very clearly Alright? Cool It's all about the "th" It looks like you are trying to pronounce "D" but it didn't work Your tongue gets twisted and suddenly you say "th" You place your tongue between your teeth Like this And blow a little bit Is not a beautiful sound But english is not pretty "Através" If is difficult for you to say it with your tongue between your teeth You can place it behind your teeth And blow a little bit again Did it work? Next word "Altough" is "apesar" You blow a little bit on your teeth And also you don't say "altou-gh" Altough has a "gh" with no sound This language is so weird oh my god I know everybody, I get you... I remember the struggle It wasn't easy This next word you may never use it, but in case you see this word... Why there's a "R" in the pronunciation? I don't know And also, a "milhozinho" is a "kernal of corn" But it's not written the same way It's written the way you pronounce it Let's talk about the "r" everybody Pretend that you have a ball inside your mouth And you are giving the ball a little hug with your tongue Not as exaggerated as It's not like this And the "world" word Your tongue is dancing so bad inside your mouth with "world" It looks like you are speaking to a whale And then you put your tongue up in your mouth Did it work? One of my favourite meals I know that you pronounce as "quino-a" But is "quinoa" "Quinoa" very easy What about "tesoura" everybody? Let's cut all the negativity out of our lives with It looks like there's a "Z" in the middle of the word But there's no "Z" It's not scis-sors It's not "Schi-sors" It's not "Schee-sors" It's not "moon-tain" It's not "moun-teen" Mountain "montanha" This is also difficult for us trying to speak portuguese "Montanha" Have you ever heard this in another language? "anha" This? And "listen" Listen "escuta" But it's not "list-en" It's "listen" That's all everybody! That's the end of the video Comment down below if you have other english difficulties for brazilian people And the next english lesson, what will it be? This language is terrible! Who likes this language? This video made me go back to the first time I learned english What a sad moment everybody I was 5 years old They threw me in a american students class Nobody speaking portuguese, spanish or anything Not even a little chinese English only And there I was in the middle of the class Needing to go pee Nobody understood me And I was there with tears in my eyes Needing to go pee Nobody cares And the teacher looked at me and the only thing I understood was she saying "Pencil in the case" I was trying to organize everything to get out of that class And boom. What happened? I peed in my pants And that's how I learned english everybody Peeing my pants 
but it was David Haye so when it's damaged oh and we're doing the whole $20 20 euro 20 versus toilet we're doing 20 20 today except this time we're both in New York City and we have our girls reppin their City what up guys Becky here in Toronto and today we're teaming up the demon jump and doing that $20 challenge now we did this whole thing before let's flash the cliff can I do have hot coffee let me do one of yous how much is it - 15 okay I could do that coffee in a bag New York is one of those places where you can do a lot of free things it's obvious like Times Square is free so I'm sure price free looks a lot of museums are free but we're trying to show you with that extra money what can you do what can you eat and what can you most of will eat things that aren't so obvious and we got some big ones y'all cutting into my budget we can't even afford that today I don't want this I want this but I don't want that I don't actually I want my eggs with - jeez yeah I like the way this one looks all right let's go hey how much is an egg and cheese okay that's fine 27 Swiss cheese on whole-wheat who I'm gonna be with pepperjack please it's one no we asked for two two sandwiches for the price of one hey $6 no taxes included I like that oh and there goes Columbus cafe saw in there two eggs three fish they're trying to have you pay more for less jeans thank you so basically in Toronto you call it teaching seeing like when you're transiting or taking us away or any of the public transit usually the tokens are 325 but if you buy them in bulk they're a bit cheaper so we ended up getting four for the day that means some three dollars each st. Patrick st. Patrick's Day [Music] everything in here cost $2 that is like what I've eaten every day for two so Karen where they have an all-day breakfast that's only five dollars it's amazing okay yes $3.00 breakfast sandwiches those sound good oh my god that sounds good water is free but it's a bonus one flavor that's amazing and I got fruit was my okay you saw me up to the amazing meal together with tax and tips that you feel like 1114 so we each spent about five dollars and fifty cents so far not bad at all bodegas are where the New York Dean and I get a regular coffee with three sugars that's what you're saying this is an apple they good cop this is not bodega coffee this is coffee from an espresso bar as a hair in mine Oh getting it to get for trespassing priceless I'm just kidding gotta go now we're on our way to the Canadian opera company so a couple days a week a couple times a year they've free like a little playing concerts for 12 till 2 their activity and it's $0 obviously I'm sure I don't even have to tell you guys this but if you come to Toronto you have to see the CN Tower the salon are we feeding off our company for this free little showing we're walking up Queen Street which is a really popular shopping district we're here we're not allowed to film the show but that's fine it's kind of the vibes piano down there and it's very full of people standing room only well it's a really cool I've never done this I feel like a tourist in my own City it's kind of cool so that was a Russian vocal series which is so good but also I don't speak brush and I know David enjoy you guys speak lots of your languages but I don't think that you speak Russian 10:44 it's Roman and seven Buster's goes all the way down Broadway so you're gonna pass a lot of things in like this if I call the circle then you got some trash yourself your lips get a break from the stairs you see I see I see [Music] three the next four Street a minute movies favorite crying because this cover is so freakin cute a pet street [Music] lemongrass tofu spicy a little bit funky colored Canadian money I only got bread in that but we're taking a little yoga class yoga to the people is one of those amazing yoga classes that you could pay donations the donations to pay a certain amount oh honey which I don't want to be known as that guy who didn't pay a lot something because on a budget we're donating $4 each the website says a suggested donation 10 next time we'll do one more team will do 50 the team will one-up our thing just know that it's donation only [Music] every time they do the hit pose it's just like I'm not stepping to like the birth anything so that's like for the og yoke you know what she was like crisp [Music] back then kick it through your legs then all right we are in Kensington Market right now which is this really cool like an eclectic really interesting neighborhood that has tons she needs a seat somewhere to go the classic the iconic two bros or how people get by in college here baby [Music] thank you thank you I think I would eat this four times with me in college another tip is to check if you're a city or wherever you are has like a like a website that tells you events that's going on we have something in Toronto here called blog tio but it will tell you what's going on that's free that you can go check out and we're gonna check out an art exhibit is on tonight that was listed as free we are kind of our interesting much more than we expected it's time for us to reveal one of our best-kept secrets of New York City you gotta get tipsy for three

A french day (in New York) The day started like all the others I didn’t want to get up... when all of a sudden I heard something weird... I'm in New York not in Paris     with music! The first song that starts playing is "c'est si bon" weird.... *it's so good* *to go anywhere* *arm in arm* *while singing songs* in that moment Damond sends me a text asking to meet in a french style cafe weird...   it's good! with all these coincidences, I started to think is it possible to spend a french day, here in New York and so I asked the only friend that would know the answer I started to search for my options and...wow! It was really impressive! there was a lot of choice maybe I could actually have a french day here in New York we tried the very french restaurant the Bergamote a  Chelsea Like usual Damon arrives before me but I'm always right behind him at first sight, it was so french it's so french! Next to the toilets, really? and it was there that we decided to move seats it's prettier here no? Look! It's half french half english like us! I'm gonna order a little starter of french fries So french uh? it's not my fault there isn't any vegetarian choice here... because we're really in Paris no? you know one way to make the restaurant prettier is to like put the menu in like a book with the police and all according to Damon the restaurateur and since it was nearly the first time we were in quite a pretty place we took lots of photos maybe you're thinking that I'm taking a picture I'm joking I'm still joking. It was true... you're going to do art on mine Look it's Damon and I was trying to act natural it burns, it was harder than I thought shit, I'm so clumsy but it's okay while all that Damon was patiently waiting for his food a goats cheese salad, his favourite we continued eating with bad shots until I decided to confess something you know that before this I had to pass by 3 french places looking for the best not french enough ugh, to expensive ugh, too basic but finally I've found this one and it's better it's gooood it's soo delicious croque madame french food, my favourite! really! ok that's enough! I'm hungry   and like Damon said a french day doesn't finish without a book and so I choose the book: Passion Simple I can't even understand the book but one thing I'm sure of is that I had a simple day and french is my passion so simple passion END               
Ok, I get it, your bags are tidier than mine I'm not done, OMG you're not done? I'm done, Jo! Jo... Jo? Paige? Yeah? Hello! My name's Paige Very good! Hey Everyone! It's Damon, and Jo. It's Damon and Jo! And this time were here in Iceland. Iselandia? Iceland. I think Actually, Jo, I'll explain it to you It's called Iceland, because they found Ice-
J: No, I'll explain it to you! No! It's not like that It's because they found the country, it was magnificent, and they didn't want people to know that it was that nice, and so, they changed the name to Iceland so that people would think that there was a lot of ice, but there is no ice. It's nice, it's magnificent First, I'm gonna change my clothes to be exactly like Damon Cutie ("Manon" is a cute name), It's good, it's exactly what I thought Is it Christmas yet? From something already crazy, he's gonna do something fashionable Paige! Hey! - Am I in the frame?
- Yeah. Hey! - Thanks Paige!
- You're welcome. We're here in Iceland, and we're gonna see what's in our bags We'll start with this Do you know this brand, because it's super well-known in France "La Roche Posay" (The Posay Rock) You can buy it at Monoprix (popular grocery store) J: I have this-
D: Where's my toothbrush? He doesn't brush his teeth And I don't either, because where's mine? Can you play that song?   She's really confused like, what song? "Where is my toothbrush?" Yeah, I asked YOU that this morning My contacts, meaning my eyes are really bad Like, I can't see D: Who are you again?
J: I'm your sister with my little skirt with my beautiful dress Jo makes fun of me a little because I use a lot of products. No, but, they're necessary products! And it's because of that, he looks like someone who's 17 years old He's 46 years old. My birthday is the 2nd of October. (He's turning) 47! I don't understand why people don't find it necessary You can buy a T-Shirt for $30, or a serum for $30 We wear our skin everyday! I use this, this is my cream. Le crème? 
 La crème? It's good for covering wrinkles. After all of this conversation, she has wrinkles. And this, to cover black eyes. This is good for doing your "eyebrows" When you don't have them eyebrows, eyebrows? " sur les cils" - above your eyebrows We use these types of notebooks everyday, for whatever business notebook, J: This is the notebook of my life
D: This is your business notebook? I've never seen this   That's because I have a lot of things to do This is the notebook of my life. Everything that happens in my life, I write it down Can you read a page for us? I sit here feeling the tingle of my toes defrosting. New York's cold is killing me and not just the weather but the constant flow of energy from people who bless your life in a heartbeat and leave just as quickly The speed of it all is a mere reminder of how nothing lasts forever
D: Stop! Maybe that's why I fell in love with this city six years ago This is my love notebook..with my love Am I in there? HELLLL NAH. Try opening this, it's not possible She's in the subway, and I'm a robber, Oh yeah, IT DOESN'T WORK It doesn't open There's no zipper That's because it opens here You don't realize how many electronics we have like this the cords Ok, deodorant, that I didn't put on today, so excuse me Want some? No, I don't smell (Ya nasty)   It stinks here guys And it's not because of the people or because of the country - it's because of the land Here it is! I found my new favorite hat in my bag. You have to have a clip here, because without it, it won't work Right now I'm ready...for....a trip I know who that's for... I'll explain guys, HE EATS MEAT!! I quit being a vegetarian!! D: That's the title of the video...no.
J: Clickbait. I have this, because when we travel, we like bringing things from a country to the people who live in another I'm gonna give it to someone special Paige, it's okay. J: Paige, I miss you
D: She's eating all alone. I'm saying I miss you, we're almost done. Paige: Oh, oh, I don't give a f*ck! Paige: I'm eating my toast here in peace, keep doing what you're doing! I started traveling with this, I'm not an alcoholic, but it's always important to have something to open a bottle! And you can travel with that? Mm-hmm? And for a situation, a little sexy... HERE IN ICELAND??? That's too sexy, I'm throwing that away, I'm done That's what turns people on Ah, all my vitamins that I didn't take Yeah, and me? I found them You wanted them yesterday evening right? I have really bad allergies! Leave a comment below What's in your bags when you travel? Maybe there's a thing we can learn, yeah? Yeah, like maybe how to pack a bag? KISSES! Paris soon! WHO PUT THESE HERE? No I forgot one thing. How come I've never seen that?! Because it's not for you! No I don't use this, that was a joke, but I'm always ready for a masquerade party Imagine airport security finding this... "NO! NO! It's for a party!" With these! Okay, bye! 
I'm like "he said that it was that building right there but are we here?" and it's a beautiful thing Because Brazil is representing Quebec French words, go! Caulisse = Canadian French "Putain" - expresses rage Tabarnac = Sh*t/F#%k (vulgar, but satisfying) Speak in French! The camera only understands French (talking about a story) this French guy was speaking in slang, the girl at McDonalds was like "what is this language you guys speak?" I'm going to increase your views "I don't know what" "Happiness for life" French, so we can mix everything and they understand me It's really cool, it's really good I love Montreal Really, it's so good for my brain because you need to work twice every time you speak to someone You need to think if the person is going to .... jumbles words You need to think if the person is going to respond... 
Wow yes think I would know how to do this but I know you probably think it click me how am I gonna be a travel host with a fear of flying it's not a click faith it's real I actually hate hate flying in airplanes I don't like it I'm about to turn into GG Akala clean-up on for buses everywhere I go yet my career involves getting on airplanes almost weekly sometimes multiple times a week just the other day I literally took three planes in three days this wasn't always the case but for some reason one flight I was on I was just like okay this is weird I'm 30,000 feet in the air I had literally no control of what happens to me and how is everybody in here pretending that this is okay it starts the day before I fly my stomach starts churning and you know that thing will like you get nervous and all of us in your heart like jumps and you're like okay I think I just got nervous and you're not doing anything that makes you nervous that's what happens the day before I fly the day of I can guarantee a nice clean stomach if you know what I mean and then I get to the gate and my hands get clammy and this happens without fail every single time I fly then I walk in a little like tube in the tunnel to go into the plane and then I try my hardest to swallow the fear your body goes into fight or flight and while in flight you got a fight if you don't fight through the nerves you're nothing that person having a panic attack on the plane a net is never a good thing maybe you're afraid of flying - let's work through this together tip number one try your passionflower passionflower take two capsules and a parent you choke doesn't work for me maybe it'll work for you try melatonin try melatonin water you can pick that up at the airport you can even try allergy medicine do what you need to do to knock yourself out because that always helps the time go by faster camp number two pick an aisle seat I think the fear of flying stems from the fact that you're not in control at all you're sitting there in a metal tube flying thirty thousand feet in the air and a and a co-pilot are literally determining if you're going to land safely or not tell me so anything I can do in the air that makes me feel like I'm in control as stupid as that sounds because I know I'm really not in control at all I will do such as picking an aisle seat so that I need to remember that I'm in full control of my own body my legs I'll get up without disturbing the two people next to me tip number three drink water I was drink water I avoid coffee coffee is an anxiety trigger you don't want to drink the coffee I like drinking water on planes because it helps regulate things right it helps like you take a drink of water just swallowed your breathe repeat and that is a very calming action and the benefit is that it's gonna make you wanna go to the bathroom which means you're gonna have to stand up and when you stand up and walk around on the plane it gives you this sense of like okay we good I'm good we're still good the next tip is to order yourself a glass of wine most of the time is the plain wine is cheaper than the wine in the airport and if it's an international flight even better that is free because they know it's a struggle so take advantage of that and get yourself a wine if you're of age of course the next if it's actually distract yourself like paint a very menial task that's going to require a lot of brainpower such as coloring a book if you're like me you might start shaking the pens I'm like flattery and then you're just not gonna succeed but you can try it because it has worked for me before or you could do something on your phone like deleting all of those old self is that you really don't need here's my go-to tip though I always try to chat up my neighbor because nothing feels more human than connecting to a total stranger while you're both in an uncomfortable environment works like a charm you never know you're gonna meet I've had friends who have met the love of their lives on plaintiff he's been a good mentor in a plane odds are you're not the only one afraid to fly another tip if turbulence is bad even if you don't talk to your next-door neighbor you ask your neighbor if you can hold their hand one time I was in a plane and it was really turbulent we were flying down we were about to touch down I had not spoken one word to the girl next to me and I just looked at her like hey do you mind if I hold your hand and she's like no no I'm okay and I'm like hell might and we did not even speak one word like we didn't say one word to each other not even after we stopped holding hands we just landed we let go of each other's clammy hands walked off the plane no big deal I was comforted so was she the end here's another tip before ending the flight attendants before ending the flight attendants it's always a good thing because if they freak out you can freak out but most of the times they don't freak out and you can ask them questions like do you even like doing this are you not nervous because they'll tell you the truth and most of the times it'll make you feel better you know what else I become the mother on the plane where like because I throne so often if somebody next to me is afraid comforting them helps me feel less afraid when turbulence gets really bad on these flights I've even resulted to singing out loud and singing a specific song makes me happy that's literally a real thing like I have sung out loud on a plane before you guys are like you're crazy who likes flying and one of the best tips that I use to get over my fear of flying is thinking about the flight industry how many people live day by day on planes hundreds and thousands of people have made their careers flying every single day and so if they can live a life where they're on planes and they're not afraid and they're finally being a great life why can't I and if all of that does not make it feel good about flying just think my name is Joe and I'm afraid of flying and I do it all the time because my passion of traveling is greater than my fear of flying what's the point of living if your fear of death keeps you from actually living think about it take a second can you please come on below are you afraid of flying do you force yourself to fly anyways and for those people who actually like flying why how give us some tips I'll see you next time probably on a flight goodbye here's another thing that's really great about being afraid of flying but then forcing yourself to do it anyways every single time I fly and I land somewhere safely I walk out of that plane like we still good so got it we still here laughs I'm a live you know sometimes when I'm laying in bed at night I genuinely have this top well I'm so glad I'm not on a plane right now 
- It all started three days ago when I decided I was bored with America. Maybe it happens to you,
what do you do about it? You Google a bus ticket outta there. And I stumbled upon a bus
ticket to Montreal for $60. And so you know what, I did
what any traveler would do. I clicked book and here I am
today in Montreal, Canada. Click the rewind. Eight hours overnight,
that's all you need. (electronic music) Well, that's a zoom out. Ladies and gentlemen,
it is Jo Franco here. And it is a nice and cozy 11:30 p.m. New york City's Port Authority, the sexiest bus terminal of all. At least they got a sign up. Oh my God, it's Justin Beiber. Eww. This is it, the Big
Apple, you knew you were getting yourself into something good when you step foot in the bus station. I've gone to Montreal before. This is probably my third
or fourth time going, but this time is the first
time I'm taking a bus. I didn't realize I was gonna
have to take three buses. Here's a fun plot twist,
I've gotta take three buses. I'm gonna be up all night, who's ready? And here I was thinking like, oh, the train is 12 hours. Eight hours? What a good trip. And then when I print my boarding passes, it was like, printing
one of four documents. And I'm like what's you
mean, four documents? So apparently I'm gonna go
from New York City to Albany, Albany to the border of Canada, the Canadian border to finally Montreal. Let's do it. (yawns) So do I have to change
my bag for every bus? - [Bus Driver] No, not for every bus. Where are you going? - [Jo] I'm going to Montreal. - [Bus Driver] What every
bus? There's only one bus. - [Jo] What, so why did
I get so many tickets? - [Bus Driver] Because I like paper. - [Jo] Oh, that's the best
news I've heard all day. Thank you. Great, success. - [Jo] Excuse me, sorry. 1:30 a.m., first rest stop. Let's get some food. America. Okay, beautiful. I need fresh, all right. It's not my proudest moment. Bon appetit. Randomly thought about
this while I'm getting my very fresh cheeseburger
and bag of chips from the rest stop. It's 1:30 in the morning. People are working, so next
time you're asleep overnight think about all those people who are servicing the travelers passing through to get to their destination. Shout-out to you, overnight workers. I appreciate you. Oh man, 3:00 a.m. Albany. You really love paper. - [Bus Driver] (laughs) Yes. (downtempo music) - [Driver Over Speaker] You may proceed to get a little morning exercise by removing all of your bags
from underneath the coach. - (yawns) Oh my God. It never ends. (exhales deeply) Smell
that crisp Canadian air. We are here at Immigration at 7 a.m. Nothing like a creepy,
scary stop at Immigration to wake you up and get
you ready for the day. I have been sitting on
a bus for seven hours. So maybe I'm just getting hype
because I can't move my legs. And because I'm gonna be in
Montreal in about two hours. Ask me how much I have planned. Zero. And I didn't even know if they were gonna let me get through, because I didn't even
book a return flight, or train or bus, I'm just going. And sometimes you just
got to shut up and go. Limited edition t-shirt, you
can't even buy this anymore. We stopped producing this merch, but we are in the process
of making new merch. Always thinking about
business, even at 7:00 a.m. Sidenote, the guy at customs was like, (speaks in French) Anyways, let's just see. Because I needed to get out of New York to get my brain moving
because when you're in a place where you're used to being, your brain gets a little lazy. Which is why it's really
important to travel because then your brain
gets a little kick. Okay, (speaks in foreign language). Wrong language. Allons-y. All right, we'll see you there. (relaxed electronic music) (speaking French) Suitcase. Staircase. Not a good case. Let's do it. Oh my God. Oh so close. Two more flights. Holy damn. Okay, we got a work hard for the travel. (sighs) Is this it? I just wanna leave you
with one last thing. People are like, Jo why
are you going to Montreal? It's like, why not is the actual question. Don't forget to click
that subscribe button. And comment below. Have you ever taken a solo trip? And if so, did it fully
exceed your expectations? I bet it did. We'll see you next time. Bye. Shout-out to my fashion statement. I like to call it the high-low
sock with summer sandal look. If anybody wants to cop
it I won't even be mad. 
- Are you guys ready to see this sweater for the next three days? Because it's all I have. - You're looking at my uniform.
- (Damon laughs) My Iceland uniform. - Bought this jacket just for this trip.
- Paige, we get it; you packed really well. - (Paige laughs)
- [Jo] Paige is the packing queen! - Okay, so votes on how much this meal at Café Loki's is gonna cost? - Fifty dollars EACH for a toast!
- (Damon laughs) - For a piece of bread. - So, the first thing you read about Iceland is that it's very expensive. - It's like, "If you are broke, don't go to Iceland!" - Guess who pulls up in Iceland? We do! - Hey, our names are Damon and Jo, and we're here to see what's expensive here. - It's our first day.
- So throughout our trip we're gonna document how much each meal costs and you're gonna see what we got. - You're gonna see what we DON'T get. - What we don't get. Let's go see what we don't get. - This is one of those countries that I'll be hungry (laughing) the entire trip. - Jo, I'm hungry right now! Paige, are you hungry? - [Paige] I'm so hungry! - (Damon laughs)
- We've been hungry! I woke up from the best nap of 2017 and all I thought was, - [Damon] You guys...
- "I'm hungry, but I'm in Iceland, I can't eat." - I'm call... I've already deemed it the Iceland diet. - [Paige] Oh, man! - [Damon] Just look at the orange hues coming out of the windows! - [Jo] We're going to like, the one place that's all in English so you know it's touristy. - [Damon] It said "traditional Icelandic place." - [Jo] I mean, they translated...
- [Paige] It says it right on the fucking building. - (Damon and Jo laugh) - [Damon] So, Jo, do you want the $16 bagel or the $17 bagel? - Um, I'm gonna eat a side of air... with my nothing. - (Damon laughs) On the side of my water. - I just threw my silverware on the floor because JóiPé just sent us a message. (reads) - Can we hang out with him?
- We... - are in touch with Iceland's finest... musician.
- [Damon] Hip-hop group? (hip-hop song playing) - [Damon] My favorite part of this is how everyone went, "Thank you. Thank you." - [Jo] This was supposed to be one of the top-rated places to eat. This cost $22. - [Damon] This cost $13. - Paige hooked us up with this... What is this? - [Paige] I've never seen it before. - Damon's gonna try the first piece of something fattening he's ever eaten in his entire life. - (Damon laughs) - (cricket sound effect) - [Jo] It's good! Stop acting like you're eating poop. If you wanna smell poop, go in the bathroom and put the (laughing) hot water on. - It smells like sulfur.
- [Jo] 'Cause it's heated by sulfur. - That's not cute. - You guys, the grocery store closes at 6:30! (reading message by Patrick Linder) - (Jo squeals) Cash me at Bonus! - (announcer voice) Come with us, Damon and Jo, as we discover just how expensive this gas station is in Iceland. Let's do it. - (normal voice) That's 10 dollars! - [Jo] Aww, snaap! This is the kind of country where you forego your entire diet because it's not up to you, it's up to your bank account. Today, I will probably be consuming hot dogs, gas station coffee and anything else that is under $20. - 'Cause that's how much everything is here. - Okay, I don't know what you see in my hands... - Two free coffees.
- We got two coffees! - And why is it free? Because they're nice. I'm like, "I'm sorry, how do I get coffee?" - And she's like, "Here you go, just take it."
- "Take it." - [Paige] Shit, that looks good! Look good! - Okay, this is one of those countries that I've always wanted to come to. I thought I would love it! I dooo! This is the thing about Iceland: It's like one of those really cheap flights that you get here, and then you get here and you're like, - "How much does it cost?"
- "Everything else is expensive!" - But this was free and look at it.
- This was free! This is why I love it; there is nobody trying to sell you fidget spinners, lightsabers, the things that trip you on the floor. Paige is like, "When you get up there, they're going to be selling you fidget spinners." Let's hope not! - (Damon laughs)
- [Paige] I hope so. - [Damon] Okay, see, this one wasn't THAT expensive.
- [Jo] Mm-mm. - [Jo] The crust is like paper, and it's really delicious, - but it costs twenty dollars.
- Only $20! - [Jo] And the beer was impressive. Only $7. - [Damon] Paige, five million dollars. 
what up its Damon its Joe and it's a minute today we're gonna take a career aptitude test because it's not like being a travel vlogger is something that you learn in high school it's not something

completely how I should be living my life I strongly agree I can be a bit irresponsible to your definition of the word dealing with customers I do like the customer isn't always right and I don't want to pretend that they are and you want to return this up at the water bottle you can I might feel okay cheating on a test if no one ever found out did you come on tell me I did when I first moved to America and we did a spelling test yeah speak English that was me too I know when I first moved do the states that's when I cheated too it was like one of those times that the freaking AP Calculus gives you one day to learn fifty thousand theories I wrote down like the formulas on a gum wrapper the gum wrapper what do you know that one it depends what the test is if I don't believe in what you're giving me the test for like many standardized tests in my entire educational career I don't want to do it because I don't believe that those tests will give you a better indicator of my success potential in the world clearly cuz I did not do one of my other B's being responsible for results of other workers like you are responsible for your results don't blame it on me managing people like again I don't want to be your only responsible for yourself well do I have kids I have 800 thousand of them okay would you like to sell merchandise at a market no I hate sales I would hate that that's what the merchandise is and this the issue like I signed up to be a marketing major in college and then I changed majors because I didn't like brainwashing people to buy products I didn't actually believe in I rely heavily on people's advice like I actually strongly disagree cuz if I would have relied on everyone's advice going through John when I starting a YouTube channel the YouTube channel wouldn't even exist it sounds bad on a surface level like I don't take people's advice but I'm only gonna take your advice if you live the job the career the lifestyle that I want what about this I'm someone who gets pit stains and you got pit stains on your shirt take advice from me counsel people withdrawal or alcohol addiction addiction is something that I know is not easy especially when it comes to love you ever tried give you somebody advice on love and they don't listen to you because love is actually an addiction so not good at that and I doubt I'd be any better with drugs and alcohol this is cool cuz you can see like your top matches throughout the quiz so far I'm a filmmaker and then I'm a lyricist see where was this what I was in school oh my night you want to know my top one blogger blogger than a travel agent anthropologist and a jeweler I like that call me jewelry Joe balanced the budget of a company new do you remember counting the drawer at the hostel he was just like don't talk to the manager like that and you're like don't talk to me like that but just because you're titled the manager doesn't mean that you can degrade me in all aspects of isn't in the air up here and I'm than the employees are down here I have an assertive personality like yes you could be a problem a lot of people dislike me looking at the homecoming key let me just start sewing ticket to show cuz Damon performer oh my I actually don't enjoy musicals and I used to like kind of mock them my sister was a musical theater major alright so I like technically got a pass on this ooh most people only pretend to be honest I think the majority of people probably aren't being completely honest with everybody and that they're only sugarcoating what they reality honesty is more important than success I think so and I think that's the reason why my relationships tend to fail because I'm like be honest with me even if that means we have to break up so I agree it's easy to make me angry it's try try to can't even break down these walls so you are able to incite a reaction from me that shows that I'm letting you like I'm allowing you to control my emotions help a client make business decisions I love that I love everything like consulting and looking at the industry trends and staying on target start a new company we literally started this channel out of nothing and that is the most exciting thing for me like on a business perspective would you like to help elderly people complete their daily activities was one of my first jobs in high school I loved it Gladys Dolores they were my favorites but don't tell anyone else at their time of home that teach kids how to play well with other children kids calm down I would dislike that I talked to my nephew like he's a 75 year old man Donovan Lee you know better than that put it down dealing with angry rude people oh I deal with that every day her name is Joanna Franco install tile floors like what I used to do as a kid with my mom if I could get away with it I might steal a million dollars like people at least have some moral compass wouldn't that be so like slimy you would spend it but you'd be like okay I didn't I should I shouldn't have this whatever like getting to existential I'm clicking strongly disagree because my mother raised me to be the kind of a woman that even if I were at a bar and a man or a woman buys me a drink to deny the drink because she would say if I couldn't afford my own drink I wouldn't have come to the bar if I have something it's mine like I want to be able to pay for my weight I don't want anybody to pay for me I want to be able to say that I did it with my money I earned it I never want things I can't have why can't you have the things that you want like giving up before you're even trying you want to have a Travel Channel on YouTube okay make it happen how bad you really want it publish your thoughts on a topic love it that's what I do this what we do we write on our blog we used to raise been two months now but shout outs about contributing authors if anything can get you very far in life it's your ability to write because that means that you know how to properly examine and place your thoughts so another person can understand what you're thinking yo you ask me enough questions this is just my career we're talking about constant competition must avoid I cannot deal I didn't even do team sports in high school because I hated competition I only ran because at least that way I was only competing with myself if y'all trying to compete you win I don't care take it take the trophy I'm done here comes here comes my first one I'm like I don't think I'd be good at that I mean I have heard this falsetto a few times in the shower but number one I think it's more you it is for you musician why I know I'm not a musician I'm not I don't play instrument I do get that is my voice is really good but I don't play second photographer like I am a highly visual person my third one was actor and I'm really happy about this one because when I was like eleven the all that music and more festival came to foreign Indiana and that open calls and I was too scared to go an audition to be on all that was that funny I know like back then I totally wouldn't have gotten it like it wouldn't be correct and then I got blogger photojournalists all that do you even know what like a flat and sharp are no great well actually did play instruments plan was growing up so yeah I could have been musician I thought that I was gonna go to Juilliard School of Music for violin I don't know why I'm laughing because that's a possibility like and that was literally what I was studying for like this is uki method of violence why'd you give up cuz your guidance counselor told you it wasn't stable Grinnell I gave I didn't give up I chose languages because in my school like most schools they don't actually want to encourage learning so they're like do you want to play an instrument you want to take a language and I chose language cuz I thought it would be more useful the question that should be asked is why can't you take both they make you make these choices and it's unfair because learning shouldn't be about choosing this or that it should be about doing everything that you're curious about that's so messed up and that's what American University is it's like well you're gonna go broke so you gotta focus on one thing whereas if you go to college in Germany you have people who are thirty who are going to school because they actually want to learn and they're taking every class at the University yeah Maria Maria whatever I'm excited about my risotto journalist that's okay sorry my butts hanging out right now where literally my second option journalist what wait I see journalists more because you you've been writing your entire life then photographer we didn't even know that blogging vlogging instagramming was gonna be a thing when we took this in high school that means that right now you're taking this test you don't even know that clogging and flogging and flogging is something career that you want to be doing in ten years so what are you my gir I'm gonna be a flogger remember taking this test and if not take the test and then leave in the comments below what you got subscribe to our videos we're about to hit 1 million I think I'm done I'm not done but it just asked if I want to be a urologist the treatment of medical conditions that affect the male and female urinary tract the question should be like edit for 8 hours straight and publish with time zones in mind and translated subtitles change is usually more trouble than it's worth defeatist I'm not the kind of person who was born with a specific talent I didn't sing like my sister I didn't draw like my brother and I was pissed I was mad ironically we both would choose to work alone yeah we work together but we work together more than we work separately but not at all we like working separately right now 
(Jo whimpering)
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! (upbeat music) Here's something no one
tells you about Iceland, that the whole country smells like a fart. - Like a do-do, 'cause of sulfur. - Can't blame it on me. (upbeat music) - There are various
scenic vlogs of Iceland and we highly suggest that you watch them, but if you want comedic
value, you can watch this one. (chill upbeat music) No, Iceland has no ice, really. Do you see ice? There is ice eventually. - Yeah, my fingers. - This is my good friend Paige. We're gonna meet Damon right now. (Damon and Jo singing) Okay! - [Damon] This is where people
always (dolphin squeaks) and get in the wrong lane. Pop that soup!
- Damn! Iceland style, New York Fashion Week. (Icelandic hip hop music) Icelandic music is randomly so good. - I'mma stop this car right here. - [SatNav] Turn right onto Meðaholt. - [Damon] Home sweet home! Meðaholt.
(Jo laughs) Welcome home everybody! - [Jo] It looks like a prison (laughs). - Should I call our Airbnb
host and speak in Icelandic? - [Paige] You know how to? - Yeah, do you not? Meðaholt.
(Jo laughs) - Nice, random kitchen
area bed with, like, a human body under the sheet.
(laughter) - Got some oomph there.
- What's this? - [Damon] Imagine it's
the Airbnb host hiding. (laughter) - So, welcome to my home! (Jo shrieks) - [Damon] (laughs) Just bodies everywhere. - What can we learn about
Iceland from this home? They like rocks. They like art. Whose butt cheek is fitting on that? (Damon laughs) - [Damon] Jo! - [Jo] It's getting louder! (Damon laughs) - Jo! (laughs)
- What? - [Paige] How am I supposed to take a nap? (Damon laughs)
This is out of control! - [Damon] Jo, what's happening in there? - [Jo] The noise is
loud, the smell is bad. - So, what was the sound? - I don't know! - [Damon] Your towel is
opening up in the wrong places. - It's okay, I have undies on. The hot water smells like dookey, 'cause it's geothermal
and it smells like sulfur. - [Damon] You all may know Damon and Jo as people who travel. This is Jo's suitcase looking decent. This is mine. Okay, we won't talk about it. And then, our good friend
Paige comes through. - Let us see this, what is that? Paige!
- (laughs) Oh my God! - [Jo] It's so good! - You know, I've got my pajama cube, shirts and jeans cube, other shirts cube, then I've got my socks and undies cube, work out gear cube, and then
I've got my little travel pack. When we go outside, I'll just, what! (laughter) - She got me packing cubes
for Christmas, I didn't-- - [Paige] Tell me what
you said about them. - [Damon] Oh yeah, where-- - (laughs) What did I say about them? - (laughs) You go, "Yeah,
thanks for the packing cubes. "I (dolphin squeaks) hate them." (laughter) - [Damon] This is Jo's bag. - [Jo] That is Damon Dominique's bag! I don't have all these nice clothes. (Damon laughs) - [Damon] Yeah, not much-- - Lacy stuff in here. - [Damon] Wow, that's new, isn't it? - You know, I gotta climb a street, I gotta climb some stairs. I would never wheel this thing up there, so I'm gonna strap up. (Damon laughs) And get the hell outta here! (funky upbeat music) - [Jo] Damon is being swarmed by gnats. Ew!
- Let go of my hand, oh! - [Jo] (laughs) There's
so many gnats everywhere. Close the door! (laughs) Danger. What is this randomly doing
in the middle of this? - Doesn't this look like hell? - This does look like a crazy-- - Because I know you've
been there a few times. (cymbal crash) - And there's where I'm goin'! (laughter) The vikings named Iceland Iceland to detract their competitors. They didn't want them to
know, isn't that cool? - She came today with
her research, everybody. She came to Iceland
and she knew the facts. - I got more. - Okay, good, 'cause I don't. - Next fact, there are 330,000 people living in this whole country. Servin' the facts!
(chill music) - [Damon] I'm so done with
Iceland being beautiful. - [Man] The roads are closed, (mumbling). - [Jo] You know what that means! - [Damon] I knew I didn't
have to put on cologne today! No one talks about this fart. - Oh my god, it's so pretty. I can't breathe. It stinks like dookey! - [Damon] It's so smelly. - This smells like a boiled
egg with a fart overlay. Oh my god, this is not okay. This is not okay! I am so amazed by human nature. - I am so amazed by my hair. - What happened to this? This is what we came for. (chill music) When in Iceland, strip down,
get naked, go to a hot spring. - Can I show everybody that
you can still wear a shirt? - Iceland!
- What up, everyone? It's Damon. - It's Jo, and it's-- - We're gonna do another one. - Okay, I don't care. - It's Damon.
- It's Jo. - And it's Damon and Jo.
It's Damon and Jo. Where we are at today? - Iceland!
- Iceland! - [Damon] What? - [Jo] What? (Damon laughs)
- Wait, what? Do you see that bitch? - [Paige] You drive down the
street and you come across a waterfall in the middle
of nowhere Iceland. - 10 points for Damon, Jo and Paige. Let's go! (funky upbeat music) - [Jo] What is this? (Damon laughs) I keep asking, what is this? - I'm getting tired of saying
that every single time. - [Jo] I'm getting tired of
just seeing so much beauty. Let's go home! (funky upbeat music) - Where's the McDonald's? - [Jo] There is none in Iceland, fun fact. - [Damon] What you doin'
over here, what you doin'? - [Jo] Crazy, man. - Now that is the view we've all come for. - [Jo] Damn, daddy! Sunset is in 10 minutes. Is this a crop circle? (record scratches) - [Damon] This is what
we're looking at right now. This is a sight we hoped we'd never see, although I am a huge fan of Lost. - What the hell? To wrap up this Iceland
trip, actually, no, I'm not even gonna say
that, 'cause why would I-- - Excuse me, we've got a lot to do. - It ain't over yet! - Oh, we're about to see Aurora Borealis. - We're about to see Aurora Borealis, but first we decided to
stop over at this famous, or infamous, plane crash that
happened here in Iceland. - Oh, and you're allowed to do this. - [Jo] Again, nobody is here
selling tickets to enter. - This looks like a supply jet. - Well, I got in and it's time to go. Damon's going out in his underwear. - [Damon] Yes, I am. - [Jo] Aurora Borealis! - It's a streak of freaking, (mumbling). - No.
- A streak of green. Look, look, look! - [Jo] Oh my god! (screams) - [Paige] Oh my God, look over there! - [Jo] There are lights in the sky! (Damon laughs) - [Jo] Oh my God! - Shout out to Paige for being a tracker of the Aurora Borealis (laughs). - [Jo] The Aurora Borealis hunter. - I'm the whisperer. - [Damon] (laughs) She's been
tracking this all day long. You can actually find it on the internet. - We'll put it in the
description box below, because this is the only reason. Now they're gone! - Wow. - Top thing to see anywhere, ever. - [Damon] Are you coming
to Iceland for three days and don't know what to do? Yes! - Damon will randomly
burst out in screams. (Damon screams) (laughter) - [Damon] Iceland observation,
nobody uses curtains. - [Jo] Or blinds. I guess they only have blackout curtains. They really like their fish. (singing) See, now I'm having more fun! - [Damon] I'm goin' nude! - Are you?
- No, I'm not going nude. - [Jo] I wouldn't be opposed. - [Damon] Not in this cold. - Tiny little--
- Shrinks into your body. 
- What up, it's Damon. - It's Jo.
- It's Damon &amp; Jo! - College graduate, and dropout. - Wow! Way to just blow up my. I dropped out of college, no regrets. - I graduated college, might regret it. (laughing) And this time we're here to give you our best tips on how to win at college. - Win at college, we're
about to do this thing. - Number one! - Well, in college, you'll
probably want a job, because college is expensive. - I scammed the system,
I knew all the jobs to get all the perks.
- She's Joanna the scammer. - I'm literally "Joanna the scammer". I was an orientation
leader so I could live in the city for free in the summertime. I was a desk attendant,
so I would sign guests in, also to get free housing, I was an RA, and that shed a bajillion dollars off of my college tuition.
- And it wasn't even that hard it was fun. - I love my residents,
aw, you guys, I miss you. - Number two, I was the king of this, condensing your schedule. Most people will be like, spread your schedule out, you don't want to be doing, - "You don't wanna overwork yourself", Negative.
- Negative. Overwork yourself for two days, that way, you have a long weekend so you can travel, or work, or like, party, party, party. Number three, I'm gonna
be real with you guys, I'm hungry, and this video
is sponsored by GrubHub. - This is a tip for you
to survive in college because, one, you ain't
gonna find yourself in those communal kitchens. People don't clean up after themselves, or you don't have pots and pans. - Or, you might not know how to cook, me. - The world cuisine is at my finger tips. - Gimme, okay. - Do you vegetarian orange soy chicken? - Not really. - Vegetarian soy chicken pad see ew? - No, no. I know you like
pad see ew, but I find it - [Voiceover] 20 minutes later. - Will you please order? Another tip in college,
you're gonna be stingy and you're gonna need
all the discount codes you can possibly get. - We have a code down in the
description box below for seven dollars off your first order. Go use that, baby. Okay, number four, use that dot e-d-u to get you all the discounts. - Every single time you go to a store, ask "hey, I'm a student, do I get a discount?" Your professor's personality is going to come down to your grade. - And it's like, maybe I don't
wanna visit this professor because I don't like the professor. I don't wanna go to their office hours 'cause I don't like them as a person. - And for the first time in your life, you have a say of who you're taking. - You better go to the
professor you want and be like, "I'd love to be in your class,
sir, like I really would." - This is your time to be an adult, which means ask for what you
want, and you will get it. - Speaking of asking for what you want, if your financial aid
package is not what you want, go to the office of financial
aid and ask for more. - You can literally appeal
your financial aid package, which means they'll review it, see your circumstance, and
pull money out of nowhere. - Somehow, your financial aid package is larger than what you expected. - Another tip, once your
financial aid is dispersed, your loans and your scholarships will be applied to your tuition payments. And a lot of times, what you do not know, is that you can go and get a refund. And you're like, "whatchu mean,
they're gonna do a refund?" You will literally be paying
more than you need to in loans, and so the excess can be
given to you in cash money. - You know that Drake
song, "imma take naps"? - I don't
- She doesn't. She doesn't know pop culture, you guys. - "Go back to college, Jo". - If you're gonna take
a nap, ninety minutes is how long a REM cycle lasts. And that's why sometimes
when you wake up from a nap you're like "ugh I'm so grogged". - 'Cause you woke up in
the middle of a REM cycle. You party hard, you study
hard, you work hard, and you're gonna need to
nap hard, for 90 minutes! We're a little biased on this, because we went to college
in the middle of Manhattan, college is a bubble,
and so what's important is for you to realize is
that bubble will one day pop. And you need to prepare for
the poppage of the bubble by creating a life outside of college. - All that time you're spending
for your college clubs, it may be good for socialization, and like making friends and all that, but really what's gonna matter
is everything you're doing to advance your life and
career outside after college. - So, you don't wanna be that guy that the highlight of your life was college. - Excuse me, just some college friend. - Use this line if you wanna make friends: "Hey, can I buy you a cup of coffee?" - I swear, we still do that today. - Til this day! - S'Where half our inbox is like, "can we take you out to coffee?" - Can I take you for a cup of coffee? - No one's ever said no. - Or like, tea? - Nature sounds for me is what I would use to like, play in the
background, it'd be like, jungles and storms when
I was trying to study. - Also, trying to sleep,
because you're gonna have roommates if you're dorming, and a lot of times your
roommate isn't gonna wanna go to sleep when you go to sleep. So, headphones are key. - So there's probably international
students at your college and they are probably lonely. Like, more lonely than
you as an American are. You speak the language,
you know the culture. Imagine somebody from a different country coming to your university
in the middle of your state. - Not knowing anybody,
not knowing the language, they're gonna want
friends, and most times, the international culture office, they're gonna have like
a buddy exchange program where you can befriend
an international student. - You're obviously gonna have
to write research papers, thousands of like essays, use
scholars dot google dot com instead of google dot com. - Right, visit the I.T.
department and find out every single piece of
software that you can get for free, because you're actually paying for it in your tuition. - Also, if your computer has a virus, like, go to that I.T. department because there will be smart
students like yourselves, and they will probably do it for free. - Let's talk about study abroad. - Like, get the hair up. - You need to study abroad. This is your moment. - Let's just put it this way. I didn't even know I wanted to drop out of college until I saw how little everyone
was paying for college, and how much more educated they were. - You just get a new perspective. - Our YouTube channel was created when we studied abroad, everybody. - And maybe you might
even meet your next lover. - That happened, too. - We fell in love! - Yeah. - Let's talk textbooks for a second. You are totally gonna need
to buy these hundred dollar textbooks, for one semester of
your life, to barely use it. So now, here are a few tips, one. Ask if you'll actually need that textbook. - Right. - If the professor says yes,
you wanna be like, "really?" If you really do need
it, what I used to do was split it with a friend
who had the same class, because then we would split the payment, we would alternate who has the textbook. - And again, if you have
your schedule set on like, one or two days, then that'll
open up the rest of the week for your friend to take a class, same class with the same textbook. - Right, try to find a digital copy, because those are usually cheaper. And another tip is sell them back, because you will never open those books, probably even while you need them. - College roommates are
a reality, everybody. And you might get along
with them, you might not. The key to surviving
with your roommate is to write out both of your schedules, on a white board or somewhere
where you both can see when the other one's not gonna be there. - Let me just tell you,
Damon was such a part of my particular dorm, he
became a third roommate to the point where it was like, my roommate's schedule, my schedule, and there was literally a
square for Damon's schedule. - My schedule was on it. - You're gonna need your alone time, and you're not gonna
wanna text your roommate because they're gonna be like, "Oh? You're coming home to do what?" - Six months after you graduate, you will have a monthly - [Both] loan payment, - So please take advantage
of all the time you have in college now with friends. Have so much fun. - Speaking of that. - What, your loans? - I wanna tell you about that, too, like that's another video, like how
to defer, sounds responsible. - I did that one, too. Your GrubHub is here. - Hold on one sec, let
me finish the video. Clearly, we have plenty of things to say. Comment below, are you
in college right now? Were these tips helpful? Do you have any other tips
on how to win at college? - Know your options here. I'm someone who's
successful without a degree. She's someone who's
successful with a degree. My favorite thing about college, honestly, we can't say it enough. Study abroad was literally
what changed my life. - What was the second favorite thing? - Why, 'cause you don't like that answer? - I like when you talk about me. - Someone might be able to teach us how to turn the light on. - Let's turn the light on, it's getting a little dark out. Ooh, it's getting a little ugly out. - It's hot! Oh my god, it's so hot. - Fresh off the oven. Just like in Bangkok, but in Los Angeles. - Yup, done. - Tell the guys season it right now. 
He didn't believe! He didn't even want to go out with me He didn't? What am I supposed to do, right? What are you supposed to do? - [Jo] What am I supposed to do?

- My name is Damon and it's Fashion Week here in New York City, which means I'm about to go to the one place that everyone goes before all
the glitz and the glam, Bergdorf Goodwill, no (guffaws loudly), Bloomingwill, no I'm just kidding, Goodwill, we're going to Goodwill today. But I'm not goin' alone, no, Joe's in Connecticut, so I enlisted the help of my good friend, Dominique. (crickets chirping) - What's up? - We're about to go thrifting for New York Fashion Week. (funky rhythm and blues music) Dom just told me her shoes were $5.00. We've been in the Goodwill
at 14th street and 5th fer five minutes, can I show you, Michael Kors, Club Monaco, Polo Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein, if you're
into that kind of stuff. Also none of these are my size, so we gotta start from scratch. (laughs) - We could stuff you in. This hat smells funny, but. - Can I wear it? - If you want. - Can I try it on?
- Yeah. - Oh shit, wow! - Just put the hat on. - (giggles) Oh shit, I'm bout to, - I've never seen, I
think it's a men's hat. Look's cute on you. - This was thrifted. It was also thrifted
from the womens' section. This is a large, that's why only my thumbs can fit in these pockets. How much is this? - It's like $3.00 - They have certain
colors that are half off. See, this is purple. - I'm gonna try those on. - [Both] (laugh loudly] (playful, bouncy music) - [Salesman] May I help you sir? - Hello. - [Salesman] $8.49, credit card? - $8.49, these are from Aldo! Al-do, how do you say that? Like, I'm going to Fashion Week, so. (fun, fake sophisticated music) No more messin' around here! All right, we're now
at the second Goodwill. I'm telling you,
Bloomingdales, Saks Fifth Ave. Low cost! Where'd you get that hat? - Over there. - I'm gonna wear it? Yo, I'm about to walk in to Fashion Week and they're gonna say, Miss Knowles, can I help you? You should get that, honestly. (urban sophisticate music) I get it, not for Fashion Week. Who would wear that to Fashion Week? Damn, since when? Everyone who's not at
Goodwill is missin' out. Like, ya'll are missing out. I actually don't come 'cause I don't have the better option. Like I would take me home. Everyone in the store's like, no, I'm about to walk into Fashion Week and they're gonna say, excuse me sir, are you here for, Givenchy, Dolce and Gabbana? - You one a the models? - Really though, should I take this home? - I mean it looks good, but, it looks better on camera than it does in real life. - [Both] I don't know! - This is kind of a look. No, this is really nice. - Excuse me sir, I see
you're seated next to the restroom, but like, do you wanna move to the front row? Excuse me sir, the
port-a-potty fashion show is in the other building. (guffaws) This could work. - What you gonna do 'bout your hair? - Excuse me, the model entrance is in the back of the building. (laughs) I'm like now mad. - Why mad at it? - Comment below if you think these looks are Fashion Week worthy. - What ya'll think? - Not the hat, though, also not the hair. Also not, okay. Those pants are $3.99! - So, it's $27.96. - I got four items for $27.96. You can't even pay $27.96
to step into Chanel. I want a cooler outfit, though, I want like more sporty. (frenetic, high-energy music) Can you believe those pants were $3.99? I'm a go home, that's my ride okay? All right, we made it
to the third Goodwill. Now, not that I'm gonna wear this, but, Diane von Furstenberg, BCBG? I think I'm startin' to
reach my limit, though. Like, I gotta stop or
else I'll look too cool. - Yeah, cuz then everyone
else will wanna leave. - Yeah, they'll say, sir you gotta go because your outfit's just lookin' too cool. Like, think I might
have to just wear these. - (mumbles) Like you're, yeah. Look, it's Fendi. - Like, Fendi! This is $29.99. They got a Fendi purse over here. - It's not real. - Ohhhhh! (laughs maniacally) - How much is this?
- $30. - I thought it was $50 and I bought it another time. - Oh, that's yours? ♪ Don't be fooled ♪ ♪ By the rocks that I got ♪ J Lo. What do you think?
- Yeah. - (mumbles) Now I'm bad, not bad! - Who's bad! No, there's plenty room. - No, like no one ever told me I got this booty, this donk! - And another one. - Sir, would you like some Steak Tartar? No thanks, I'm a vegetarian. Sir, the VIP entrance is over there. Oh, it's fine, I just happened to stroll in off the street. - It fits so low. - I think they're
womens', should I get 'em? - Yes. - Is this such a boob top? - It's like a muscle top. - Yeah, I worked for this! I'm workin' these girls. No, he said, Fashion Week, why haven't we invited you more times? How much is this shirt? - This one's gonna be $2.99, so your total is $15.97. Would you like to round
up to $16.00 and donate three cents to people at this building? - Yes! Anyways, okay, so we went to three different Goodwills and look, I spent a grand total of $52.46, here's what I got. Three shirts, three pairs of pants, I got a sweater, and some shoes! - Mmm hmm. - And they were all like
good quality clothing. Also, this is the Travel Channel, so I can't be like, squeezin' in suits into my one-piece carry-on. Joe and I will be going to some of the Fashion Week events over the next week-and-a-half. I get it, it's co-ooooold!
- I'm sorry! - (laughs loudly)
- I forgot there was a camera! - Dom's over here like, choooooooo! - (laughs hysterically) I'm sorry. - Make sure to check the @damonandjo instragram handle, @damondominique, and @jo_franco. I'm so ready to go home! Make sure to subscribe to our channel. We'll see you next time, mwa, mwa. Seriously, go to our instagram, 'cause you're gonna see the

day long in New York. - [Both] (laugh crazily) - I'm leavin'! - 'Cause if there's money
in the neighborhood, then they're probably better clothes in the thrift stores. Dom got her coat from Salvation Army. - On sale. I love New York. - [Both] (laugh hysterically) 
Hi guys It's Damon and Jo... is not here because she is in NYC and I'm in Paris So beautiful, isn't it? But that's all right 'cause in this video I'm gonna be telling you guys my problems with Portuguese -We're going to talk about all this- Like the things that you might have never even noticed When I was growing up in Indiana the paradise I never thought that I would learn Portuguese I didn't even know anyone from Brazil when I was young, I had never been to Brazil before I've been to Brazil twice, guys When I speak in Portuguese with someone from Brazil or Portugal, they always ask me "Portuguese is very difficult, right?" And no, it is not Like, I don't think Portuguese is very difficult You guys at home must be like "Yes, Damon. I think it is a bit difficult for you" Even so I have a few problems with it so let's get started Look, why do you guys have two forms of the number two? There is "dois" and there is "duas" But there's no "três" and "tresa" There is no "quatro" and "quatra" And maybe you're gonna hear me say things like "give me two ("dois", masculine) bottles" No, it is not "two (dois) bottles" Damon, it is "duas" The word two changes "Seu (your, masculine)" e "sua (your, femenine)" I always think that "seu" and "sua" are like "dele (his)" and "dela (her)" "Yes, yes, my friend... yes, your (sua) house" No, in "your (sua) house" I'm talking about you but I wanted to say "No, no,  it's her (dela) house" The pronoun changes its position "It's my (meu) cell phone" "It's your (seu) celular" But if this is Jo's cell phone, we'll say "It's Jo's cell phone" Then, we have this one. For example, if I'm talking with my friend João and this is his bottle, what do I do? It's "your (seu, masculine) bottle" because you're a man or it's "your (sua, feminine) bottle" because bottle is a feminine gender word It's "sua" bottle Yes, yes, I understand but it's very complicated for someone who has to change the object gender when it doesn't exist in English The days of the week When your planning on hanging out, to eat, meeting friends I always have to

Was it you who said yes or no to people to enter No, that wasn't me BUT I was the girl who walked on the red carpet with the models And the stars.. We don't want you to watch this and think, "Oh I'd love to do that" We've been doing this work for 7 years! 7 years! 6 years I volunteered for 7 exactly events and it was me who said, "Ah Damon and Jo, would you like to sit over here?"

Oh Paris you are so beautiful ! So Jo's ill, this the reality of always being on the road. Am I pretty, beautiful ? I want to say that we've been in Paris for a week and everything has been fine- but I've been going out a lot and that's why I'm ill now. Yeah Jo, how do you feel now that YOU're ill ? Usually I'm  always the one who's got the strepsils. Where are the strepsils ? [Damon] You actually have them. This is Europe's best product. We only have two left and then we're out of strepsils ! [Jo] You've done it wrong, you idiot. [Jo] Stop it ! Oh my love, I feel so good. That's what I was saying in this bed ! I have something to confess... Damon's always ill. He's always got a cold but he won't admit it ! Having a stuffy nose is not being ill. Being ill is when your head doesn't feel right and you don't want to get out of bed. I'm not ill, I've got a cold. My phone's ringing, okay. [Damon] Who is it ? My doctor. My doctor. Being ill is something that happens when you're travelling. We are going to bring you with us to the pharmacy here in France- because it really is a travel thing. It is an adventure. You need to find medicine in every country that you're visiting. No but really, it is so beautiful. Big old. I don't know if you're a ballerina or an old man. Or a gogo boy. "I love you". I've done that. Is it a thing in France ? Slapping your knee when you say something funny ? Je sais pas, le tapeur de genoux ? [Damon] Anyway, anyway. We made it to the pharmacy. Here are a few things we've noticed about french pharmacies as two americans in Paris. Number 1 : In the US, the green crosses don't mean "pharmacy" but "cannabis. So when you see this it's a bit like... Before we go in, you have to know that this is the only place where you can buy medicine. Where we live, in the US, you can buy medicine everywhere. Everywhere, because everyone is always ill. [Damon] Hello ! [Damon] Usually I always stop here because I love this brand. Are your muscles sore here ? What's going on ? Here, yes. I entered the pharmacy and my muscles are already sore. [Damon] This one is the best. I love this. It's more like a Sephora than a pharmacy. [Damon] Once I had to come here because I had an ingrown hair. What ? Do you have a product for that because I need it too. *laughs* [Pharmacist] Are you in a lot of pain or is it moderate ? [Jo] No, it's okay. [Pharmacist] Okay, so it's just inflamed. [Damon] She's exaggerating. [Jo] No, I'm not exaggerating, okay. [Jo] How much does it cost ? [Pharmacist] It costs 5,90€. [Jo] 5 ? That's good ! [Jo] Something for the muscles, because I have a lot of problems. [Damon] Thank you, have a good day, goodbye ! We are back from the pharmacy. We are back from the pharmacy. I'm going to show you what I've bought. Here is a vocabulary lesson... I think. I'm not French but I do more or less speak French. Doctor A "docteur" is someone who has a PhD. So you can be a "docteur"... ...in philosophy. A "médecin" is someone who knows medicine. Yeah, it's a "doctor". Then there are the "médicaments" -which are the things the doctor gives you when you're ill. That's it. "Docteur", and "Médecin". And the subject is called "Médecine". Here when you need medicine, even if it's strepsils you need to talk to someone. You need to tell your symptoms. At home it's not like that. You can basically buy whatever you want. And since you can buy anything in US' drugstores- the people who work there don't really know medicine. But strepsils is always the best medicine for when you've got a sore throat. I sleep here and she sleeps in the bed. This morning she texted me this picture. Guys, it was awful. I didn't feel good, I had a cold. Suddenly my forehead started itching. I turned on the lights and I saw that I had like 4 or 5 mosquito bites. I thought that there were no mosquitoes in Paris. I looked it up and there actually are mosquitoes. I was shaving, doing my manscaping. I realized that I had an ingrown hair. You've got one, I have like seven. I had several ingrown hairs okay! So I went to the pharmacy in Belleville. The people who worked there laughed at me when- I asked "does this product work for ingrown hair?" They were laughing at me, like. Like talking into the microphone "There is a client with ingrown hairs!" What they gave me didn't work. I had to go to Carrefour and buy a pink stuff called "poils incarnés"- Poils (Hair) master! and it really worked. Yeah, I think I used it once at yours. Did you ? *laughs* Jo you had another interesting story, didn't you ? I needed to buy something for "girly stuff". Mmh. Periods. But I didn't know the word for "tampon" and "pad". So I had to say : "Hello, what's the word for the thing that girls put in every month ?" Aw-ful. She said : "Ah, tampon !" There was a queue of people behind her hearing everything. The words are "tampon" or "serviette". "Serviette" and vaginas. We've talked a lot about ingrown hairs, periods, but it is really something that exists when you're travelling. That's life, it doesn't stop when you're travelling. Life goes on. You know what stops when you're travelling ? Insurance. Oh yes, haha, next video ? We'd like you to comment below useful words when travelling in France- that could be useful to english-speaking people. Words that nobody will teach you. Like your French teacher won't tell you : "it's 'serviette', 'tampons', 'poil incarné' or 'préservatif' (condom)". But we will ! We can teach you everything. Ok, ciao everybody. See you later. In the next vieo, Damon's going to be ill. [Damon] She's not even ill. That's the thing. [Damon] You always say you're ill but I always say I'm not even when I am. Who benefits from this ? You. Because you won't be ill because when I'm ill I know I am so I stay here, but you don't. You're like " *Uuurgh* I'm not ill, let's go film a video!" [Damon] I didn't get it. *laughs*

I know You travel to Beijing and... shit, such a long question Knowing that a Paris-Beijing flight is 10 hrs and that you land at 11pm Paris time and knowing that Beijing is 7 hrs ahead of Paris What time do you arrive in Beijing in local time? This should be easy because Jo and I do this all the time And also because I had a relationship between France and the US for 6 years 11pm in Paris, that's 6 o'clock in Beijing No? So we add 10 hours of flight time It's 6 o'clock, so in 10 hours, it'll be what time? 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4 So it's 4 4 pm! How did you do it? I thought 11 pm, 9 o'clock, plus 7 is 16 If you want to try to play and win more than 12 points play below And guys, it's okay because there are other things in life If you do the test leave your answers, your results below because we want to know if you are *wrong conjugation*... are as stupid as us No If you are *wrong conjugation* Maybe we gave you a few answers here and there but, fine, we gave you some remporter (win), what does that mean? 
- Hi everyone. Due to popular request, I
am back with a workout tape that's going to blast your buns. - Is this the twerk to work class? - No, it's better. Come on in.
- No, I mean--- - You know what--
- I was actually just looking for-- - You know what?
The producers have put together a highlight reel of how much fun you had with me last time. - I'm doing it wrong. - Yeah, ya are. - I'm sorry, I'm doing this wrong. - Yeah, ya are. - I'm doing it wrong. - Yeah, ya are. Better squeeze it nice and tight. - Okay, you got me. Let's do it again. - Let's do it. Now that my star client's on
board, we can get started. - Yeah, Jo. - We have a special craze
that's sweeping the nation. It's hitting loud like a thunder clap. - Wait? - Hold on to your panties. I can assure you this
one will take the cake. You know, I'm really
excited to get stated, because today is all about--
- Okay, wait, hold up, but-- - Exactly, butts. What our keystone flagship
satellite office is all about or BUNS. - You know, I was kinda
hesitant about all this before, but now I love buns. I'm just excited to see
what juicy tips she has for me this time. - BUNS, Brazilians United Nationwide So people can have bigger butts. - I would love to see BUNS
grow as big as possible. You know, with all the
attention I'm getting on the street, I know
that I'll be holding on to buns for as long as they're around. - That's right. If you're not holding onto buns, you're doing something wrong. ♫ Bubble butt ♫ Bubble bubble bubble butt - Let's get farted, I mean started. First things first, I believe
we need to stay hydrated. Star client, can you
fill up my water bottle? (breaking glass) - [Star Client] Ow. - My bad. We're just going to forget about that. But you know what, here at BUNS, we do care about our clients, so what I need from my
star client is to tell me what do you want out of today? - Um, well, originally, I was
looking for a twerk class. But for example, this
morning, I was on Instagram, and I'm going through
the feed and I see Kylie. I mean, Kylie Jenner. I mean it's like a first name basis. She wishes, no. Um, she kinda wishes. So I'm following Kylie
Jenner and she has what, like 99 million followers, right? Maybe even 100. I wonder if she has
more than Kim, actually. Kim probably has over a million. Anyways, so I'm on
Instagram and I'm looking at Kylie Jenner's
profile, and I"m like wow. Like she's beautiful, she's
rich, like she has the life, you know, and so I'm wondering, you know, how does she
have all these followers? Like is it because she's entertaining, 'cause she has a famous family or is it 'cause she got a big ass? - You know what? I don't care. ♫ Bubble butt ♫ Bubble bubble bubble butt ♫ Bubble butt ♫ Bubble bubble bubble butt - Okay, so now you mentioned Kylie. - Yes. - And she's always on Instagram. - Yeah. - Okay, so today's all about
getting that Instagram booty, you ready? - Yes. - Positions, planks. - Okay. - Now, we're going to
need a nice, firm plank. - Wow. - This is a core exercise but when you do a leg kick back like this,
it becomes a booty blaster. - Wait, I'm doing it wrong. - Yeah, ya are. ♫ Bubble butt ♫ Bubble bubble bubble butt - See when I get on Instagram and I go to the Explore Discover
page, I don't know why, but it's nothing but butts. It's like female butts,
male butts, dog butts. And I don't know why I'm seeing that. - Okay, let's get to the next exercise. - Planks.
- Oh. - These are called rainbows. We're going to let our rainbow flag fly. You're going to kick your leg out again. Draw a little rainbow. - Wait, I'm doing this wrong. - Yeah, ya are. ♫ Bubble butt ♫ Bubble bubble bubble butt - See now it's summer
time and when someone with a big booty sits down
and they leave a sweat mark, I'm like, I want that. But my butt isn't as well
rounded, so can you-- - Ooh, don't remind me about
that time in seventh grame. So now this next exercise
is going to really work your lower body. Back lunge, horizontally criss cross, one, dip, two. - Wait, I'm doing this wrong. - Yeah, ya are. ♫ Bubble butt ♫ Bubble bubble bubble butt - Okay, so when I'm in Brazil, I have one question typically. How, how are their butts so sculpted, their thighs so sculpted,
their legs so sculpted, yet so smooth? - You gotta be Brazilian,

Hey everyone, it's Damon and it's not Jo because Jo is in New York right now and I am in Paris Fortunately So, this channel is American but we speak many languages one of these languages is French when we do succeed speaking it We hear a lot of things about the French language that it's a beautiful language that it sounds really romantic but I think that it's a... what's the word again? unbearable! and a pain in the ass for the people who are learning to speak French The French language is pretty hard for someone who is not too smart I'm joking Even after 10 years of studying it there are still things that annoy me Here are these things The "Passé Composé" Did you know that there are 17 verbs that go with "être" (to be) in the "Passé Composé" So you can't say: "J'ai arrivé, j'ai allé " (I arrived, I went) because these verbs have to be used with  "être"(to be) So you have to say: "Je suis allé" "Je suis arrivé" "Je suis mort" (I am dead) after studying the French language Here are the 17 verbs that I learned from a song Arriver, aller, venu, passer devenu, revenu, rentrer, entrer descendu, retourner, rester, monter sortir, partir, tomber, né, mort If you have a verb in the "Passé Composé" used with "être" (to be) you need to add the E's and the S's depending on whether the subject(s)you are talking about feminine or plural subjects for the pronunciation, nothing changes unless there is a consonant at the end like: "Je suis mort, je suis morte" and then there are verbs in the "Passé Composé" that we use with both the auxiliaries "J'ai passé l'examen" "Je suis passé devant la bibliothèque" and that's not even the end of it! and these verbs that need to be used with one of the auxiliaries only need to be used this way not only in the past but also when making hypothesis like for example "Si je serais allé à la fête.." (If I had gone to the party) " je serais encore bourré dans cette vidéo"  (I would still be drunk in this video) We just used "être" (to be) instead of "avoir" (to have) but we're not talking about the past here, but about a hypothesis So this thing with the past and the 17 verbs that are used with "être" (to be) is so annoying There are way too many rules and it takes a long time to learn The numbers 70, 80 and 90 don't exist in French I talk about this all the time on this channel If you really look at the word "soixante-dix" it's not a word, it's a math problem "soixante-dix": 60 + 10 = 70 "quatre-vingt": 4 x 20 = 80 "quatre-vingt-neuf": 4 x 20 + 9 = 89 So for us, when we see that, we see a multiplication not a number but you, that have been studying it since you were young don't even know that it's actually an addition you don't even notice that you have to multiply numbers because it's just the number you've learned ah yeah, yeah and after all that there's the pronunciation but you have words that are almost impossible to pronounce Yesterday night, I was on Des Martyrs Street right next to Montmartre I passed by a cemetery where there were a lot of dead people (morts) maybe because of a murder (meurtre) See, I don't understand how a language that beautiful that romantic and so like... ok no, let's not exaggerate too much so smooth can also include sounds like that: I really want to know who said Ah we won't say meurtre, we'll say meuRTRe no, no, no, Montmartre Montmartre Words with R's, words with U's and then there are words with R's and U's Serrurerie, fourrure So I can get by pretty well here Paris in French and I can say whatever I want, I can express myself but from the moment they say a word with R's or U's I'm done, I'm just another American here Dumb American On, under, over, underneath If "sous" means under and "sur" means over, on top that means "au-dessous" is underneath and "au-dessus" is on top and then there's "déçu" I am disappointed in your French Damon I always mix them up I don't know why "retourner" I thought it was return "rentrer" to go back and "revenir" to come back So um, should be pretty simple right? but apparently, when I use it, I always have a hard time maybe you have already noticed that in our videos and if you didn't, maybe that's because you are not subscribed and if you are not subscribed, you need to subscribe Freaking reflexive verbs I go to Paris, I come back every year (années? ans?) "ans" and "années"?! Oh my god When there is a direct object that you put in the beginning of a sentence before the verb, you need to add an E or ES or an S For example, you would say: "J'ai mangé une pomme" (I ate an apple) but, you would say: " La pomme que j'ai mangée" (the apple that I ate) you're gonna add an E at the end but sometimes, it changes the pronunciation Ah yeah, "J'écris beaucoup de lettres" (I write a lot of letters) "Les lettres que j'ai écrites.." (the letters I wrote) you need to add ES because the order changed, it's not "J'ai écrit" anymore You need to know "lettre" (letter) is feminine and that now it's the letters, so it's feminine plural You need to know the "Passé composé" for "J'ai écrit" (I wrote) "Écrire" (to write) is an irregular verb You need to add the ES and you need to do all of that in a millisecond because if not, you're done. The waiter is going to talk to you in English "Ah if you want I can switch to English" Bitch Ah,  but you remember what I've said before You need to add E's and S's but only if it's used with "être" (to be) Now, it's a sentence with "avoir" (to have) "Les lettres que j'ai écrites" (The letters I wrote) "j'ai écrites" is used with "avoir" (to have) The rule changes sometimes so we're gonna add E's and S's to the verb "avoir" (to have) too but in some other case I am leaving, I am leaving France, I am done with the French language and my tongue is broken too saying all of this "Je veux du lait" after studying French for 10 years I don't even know what that means Is it I want milk or I want some milk? In French I guess it doesn't matter I am talking about the same milk but in some cases it changes from "du" to "de" You say: "Il n'y a pas de lait" when saying there is no milk because it's a negative construction apparently and I can't remember what I was gonna say with all of that ok next! I am talking to a friend who is on holidays and he's gonna come back to Paris "rentrer à Paris, retourner à Paris" ??? and I want to tell him when you're back here, let's go get a coffee "Quand tu seras ici, on prendra un café" "Quand tu seras ici, on prend un café" "Quand tu es ici, on prend un café" "Quand tu es ici, on prendra un café"??? I give up! and to continue with the things that annoy me in French Good, well, bad, badly "bien" is normally an adverb so it goes with the verbs "Tu chantes bien" (You sing well) "Je danse bien" (I dance well) but sometimes, you use it with nouns too "Ah, il était bien le film?" (Ah the movie was good) Isn't it "Il était bon le film"? The movie is good "Ah ouais, le musée il est bien?" (Ah yeah, the museum is good?) Shouldn't it be "est bon" instead? It's an adjective with a noun It's a good museum "bien" is an adverb, well that what I thought but if we talk about food, you are gonna say "bon" "Ah c'est bon le plat" (Ah this meal is good) "L'hamburger, c'est bon non?" (The hamburger is good right?) Why did it just change to "bon" now? and just to add to this, there is this other thing that is kind of connected "C'est beau la ville non?" (The city is beautiful, isn't it?) No, because "ville" (city) is "belle"(beautiful- feminine) so I don't understand why you just said "C'est beau la ville" when it should be "c'est belle la ville" (feminine form) ok, so the french language is not that hard to learn I don't think It's true that even after studying it for 10 years there are a lot of little things like that  I still have difficulty to pronounce I have a hard time understanding, why they did that and I also know English is like the worst language Jo has her own little difficulties in French Normally, we've got the same ones I'm talking as if she was there, she's in New York right now ok? We'll see you in the next French Friday! Actually, we'll see you Sunday and Tuesday because we make videos, 3 videos per week I need to go edit Kisses Ciao, ciao! but sometimes it changes the proun... wow yeah, pronuncia... but sometimes it changes the pronunciat...ion sometimes it changes the pronunciation because, because what...? It's been almost 10 years that I speak French?! Wow! and my French is still like this? 
okay so we're standing in front of a carwash it's a little bit laughs can you guys hear us we're in the midst of collab Mays it's like almost December 25th it gets how much holiday shopping we're

- Oo... Ow! Hold on one second while I fix my face. (snaps) Here I am in Montreal,
Canada, completely alone. Yeah, gets kinda lonely. But you know, what is
the opposite of alone? Going away with a group of friends. (upbeat music) Salud! Now let's take a step back. Most of you seem to believe that Damon and I don't
even have other friends. Yeah, we have other friends. (upbeat music) And every once in awhile, we just like to take
trips with those friends. Odds are, you've probably tried, and probably been that person convincing all your friends to go. Last minute nobody shows up. If you have friends like that,
comment below and tell me because you need to get some new friends. It happens, though, 90% of people say that they want to travel and
they don't actually do it. Hello, welcome to shut up
and go with Damon and Jo. I went to Miami with my girls. We went to college together. Post-college, things change. Despite living in four
different cities in the states, we made it a point to meet up at least once a year for a group trip. (shouting) Now here's the problem. Who's gonna make the decision,
who's gonna pay everybody, it's just complicated. So here's some tips on how
to survive group travel. First things first,
location, location, location. Who's picking the location
and how are y'all gonna agree? Maybe you do what I suggested
at the very end of our trip and you put location options in a bag. Pull a location and that's the decision. Or you can do it like us,
and let one person decide, nobody really researches anything, you show up and you realize, wow this is not what I expected. Ya always gotta disregard
the schmutz on the floor. The most crowded beach
you'll ever see in your life. When we showed up to the Florida Keys, it was home to wildlife. Within minutes, we were
almost attacked by raccoons. Yo, this raccoon is ready to pounce. Uh oh. There was a dinosaur-esque bird. What kind of bird is that? And when I saw the reptile straight out of a Jurassic
Park movie coming towards me, I was like I don't know about all this Florida Keys business. Is this real right now,
is he coming towards me? What is this, Florida? But then we ended up going
to Miami South Beach, and all was mended. South Beach, first impressions? - South Beach, it's pristine. - The Keys are overrated. - Tip number two is make sure you're going with people who are flexible, because when you're in a
group, things will change. You gotta be down for the cause. Next tip, if you're traveling in a group, you're probably gonna save a lot of money if you rent an Airbnb, why? Because if you rent four beds in a dorm it's probably gonna equal the
same as a private apartment. And then, make sure you don't
break things like we did. Checking out of our Airbnb,
freaking broke the bed! Oops ... When making decisions,
communication is key. Don't do what we did and have an argument. And this is coming from four
extremely communicative women. - Guys, there's a lot of talking, I think we should do one by one. - This is what it is to travel in a group. We just talk over each other. (talking together) That's actually how we broke the bed. Share each other's clothes. On multiple accounts, I was
wearing Diana's clothes. Anya was wearing my clothes ... (fast talking) And it actually makes
packing a lot easier. If you're traveling anywhere where weather conditions may
be severe, pack appropriately. It is hot as a MOFO. Can we talk about burn levels. Flaming fire. Another tip, if you plan on renting a car, make sure you pack an extra,
extra long auxiliary cord, cause the people in the
back will most likely want to control what you're listening to. ♫ A little bit of Mary all night long ♫ A little bit of Jessica here I am ♫ A little bit of you makes me your man ♫ Mambo Number 5 When you travel with a group, you need to bring stretchy pants, you need to bring your laxatives, you need to be prepared
to throw all three months of the gym that you've
been putting hard work into out the drain with all your disposal. - At a Cuban restaurant,
has a buttered bread ... - Okay, I'm gonna need one last piece. I said this like three pieces ago. Does anybody want the crumbs? Zamn. Friendship equals happiness,
happiness equals indulgence, indulgence equals Key Lime Pie. - (together) Key Lime Pie! - I'm all about that crust life. It's a beautiful thing
until the bill comes and you don't know how to split the check. Let's talk money. Money is one of those topics that nobody actually wants to talk about. Unless is your name is Joanna
Franco and Damon Dominique . We're the kinda people
that will Venmo request each other for ten cents. None of this like oh
we're friends, I got you. No, because those I got
yous will accumulate to a million dollars if
you're trying to be friendly. Keep track of who's paying for what, and at the end of the day, cha-ching, cha-ching,
Venmo pay each other back. Another good tip, be the
friend that documents. - (Friend) It's very important
that no matter what happens, you make time for those who
are truly important to you. Above everything else
because the one thing you never get back in life is time. And you need to invest
time in your relationships, in those that make your heart happy. - Then you have to part ways! - I know, it's the worst! - I'm actually feeling really sad. - It's always the worst part. - Aww! - I love you, ladies. And that's all I got for you today. Don't forget to click
that subscribe button. Did I hear that? It's operation 1 millie. We are trying to reach
1 million subscribers. Don't forget to read our blog. I actually wrote a blog about the time that I had a little argument
with my best friends, so click on the description box below to read all of the juicy details. And we will see ya next time. (goofy noises) - I have to say, if you're
gonna piss anybody off in the group, don't piss off
Jo cause she's got that ... - I got the blackmail. I would never! (laughs)

(fast whimsical music) - [Damon] Bish! She said, "Could we meet at 2:00 p.m.?" (carnival music) 'Scuse me, Miss, do you need help? (laughing) Misako's getting sad 'cause
she's leaving Paris in two days. That's still two days! - It's not enough time! - We're gettin' a little bit
sad, 'cause we're leaving. - Yeah. - This happens every time. - Yeah, I'm fine. I have a playlist on my phone just made for the day that I leave. ♫ Kept me waitin' I'm all in - [Damon] So is this the part of the song where you just start
bawling your eyes out? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. (whimsical music) - [Damon] This looks like
it should be in a movie. This doesn't. (laughing) - I should've known that shade was coming. - [Damon] Hey, Big Head! (Damon laughing) She goes, "What?" - That's my name! - [Damon] That's what they call me! - This'd be a good time to, we can all find out where the escalator is 'cause I'm not walking up these stairs. (Damon Laughing) (techno music)
(Damon laughing) I cried in bed last night. (Damon laughing) (techno music) - [Damon] (laughing) Hi! (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) - But I've been watching videos. - [Damon] Like Damon and Jo's videos? - Yeah. - Hi, we're here in the edge of Sacre Coeur. (laughing)
- Oh my God. That clip's gettin' cut. - Sorry, continue giving
me the history lesson of Sacre Coeur.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. - And, what do they do here? - They make marshmallows. - Still today? - Yes, to this day, you can-- - That's why there're so many tours. - Yes, they come, and then
there's a bonfire at night, and the ritual is send them
over Paris like, in balloons. (laughing) (polka music) - [Damon] See, I asked Misako, like, "Okay, let's get a
coffee, let's get a tea," and she said, "No!" - Saveen de blanc! (Damon laughing) In case you didn't understand that, she said, sauvignon blanc. The train tracks, it's
an abandoned train track, so people nowadays go on walks. Like, you can get down there and walk on the railroad tracks. - Oh, my gosh! So we can melt. Yeah, I'm very appreciative
of this moment. - Okay, wine's gettin' to her. Reminder, we only have
today and tomorrow in Paris. - Please don't do this.
- Sorry, I shouldn't have, why did I say that? - Why you say dat? - Why I gotta say it like dat? You need to snap out of
that, and you know why? 'Cause we have two more days, and those two days are just as valuable as the first two days, the second two days, the third two days, as these two days, so we still have the same amount
of time here in Paris left, but you're allowing the fact
that we're leaving in two days to ruin the last two days,
which is not why you're here. (fake crying) (Pianist playing "Sobre las
Olas" by Juventino Rosas) I will give you free French lessons. You guys, like, people on our channel would love free French lessons, and then you have this girl. - He says it, then he's never
there to give me lessons. So don't even try me. - Okay, let's go. (shrieking) We got some weird lighting in here, so hold on one second, everybody! - [Misako] (laughing) Makes me re-enter. - Yeah, could you please
get outta here for a second? - I did not sign up for this. (beeping) (sighing) I know you're not about
to lock the door again. - When I did live in Paris,
I lived on the sixth floor. I lived in a tiny, tiny
(speaking in foreign language) (laughing) If you, I'm gonna cut all your clips out of the video! (Misako laughing) (Damon whooshing breath) Wow, look at all the light and the airflow!
- Oh my gosh! - The view!
- Wow! Wow, this is the best
view in the whole house! Oh, I'm sorry! - [Damon] How beautiful! - [Misako] And they're growing pencils in the Airbnb, how crazy. - We got the mirror by the bed, what?
- Eh! Eh! - Misako, this place is only $40 a night. - Say what? (Pianist playing "Sobre las
Olas" by Juventino Rosas) - Apparently, we've learned something. We're all wearing black today. (loud clattering) Alright, she wanna make
more noise? (muttering) Literally the same outfit! - [Misako] My shoes are white, though. (whimsical music) - Misako, where are we at, now? (speaking in foreign language) - La Prom. (laughing) Promenade Planty. Promenade Plantay. - You speak the language of love. (laughing) Don't you, with that one? - I know (speaking in foreign
language) who is living here. Very kind, I will present to you. (laughing) - Save this for me. - [Damon] I'm their wedding photographer. (funky music)
(smooching) You're looking for the exit? - [Misako] Yeah. - Yeah, I think you just
jump off wherever you want. - [Misako] Oh, okay,
cool, cool, cool, cool-- - Cool, cool, cool,
cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool. I'll just get out. (Pianist playing "Sobre las
Olas" by Juventino Rosas) (laughing) Water! - Water would be nice. That's a Spongebob reference. - 'Cause you look like Spongebob! Flashback to all dose. (tape whirring) Why you look like Spongebob? (Misako laughing) - Why you look like Spongebob? (laughing) (tape screeching) Why you look like Spongebob? (laughing) - This is my favorite part
about coming to Europe. You can do this! (plastic ripping) (upbeat drum music) You know how I know about this place? 'Cause it was in that movie Parisian... (camera crashing) That I've been telling you to watch. - I know, but I don't wanna cry, yet! (speaking in foreign language) - No. - Wow, I'm gonna leave now. (indistinct chattering) Yeah, mwah, it's like so
nice to be here with you! (speaking in foreign language) He puts his hand on the tea, and she goes, "No, no, no, delicately!"
(Misako laughing) (laughing) This is for
Instagram, not Worldstar. (funky music) (clearing throat) I'm back in Indiana. Like, things are just different. The people think differently. Why do I have to tip everywhere? Why can't I find a baguette? Why are people so nice? Thank you for watching this Paris blog. We're tryin' to hit one

happening down here. Hi, boys. - Who else has the most philosophical realizations,
not many people. - It's true, who else wants
to go on a 10 minute tangent about why the bread should be
three year olds, and not four? Damon's the only one that can
do that for you. (laughing)

Hi Everyone! It's Damon! It's Jo! And it's Damon and Jo! Need help ? Hey everyone, it's Damon It's Jo And it's Damon and Jo! And today, we're going to continue our adventures with French croissants. Everyone loves the french Everyone loves French croissants, I'm going to correct myself. No but really, I love the french (people), do you ? uhmm.... YEEEEEE. Every 'French Friday', we ask you to comment below a good recipe for making croissants. And we have here, a homemade croissant recipe the picture's not ideal... but.. In order to make home-made croissants, this is what you'll need [the fingers] 190 grams of butter 55 grams of flour An egg yolk,  but it's not yellow, but that's ok, it's an egg But the yellow is inside.. Yeah, ok, it's yellow.. inside [D: It's complicated!] 15 grams of fresh yeast ('levure'). What's that ? 'yeast' How much ? 15 grams. 15 grams of fresh yeast. 12 grams of salt. 50 grams of sugar. 300militers of milk. How much is 300 ml ? Mh, mililiters, 'millilitres'. We're gonna guess ! In the US we use another metric system and another temperature system and it's... actually dumb. It's crazy cause we use cups. Difficulty level : easy, preparation : 45 min, [Damon] That's a lot. baking time : 15. Total time : 1 hour Preparation : in a large 'saladier' (mixing bowl)... 'Saladier' ? [Jo] Don't you have a mixing bowl ? No but, since you don't have one, what are we going to use, this ? There is nothing at his place. Here we go, because I actually cook at home. Ok, that's it. I love this. I feel like a baker. Uh, it stinks too. 50 ml of lukewarm milk. Is it ? No it's cold. It's more or less lukewarm. Mix it. 10 grams of sugar. It's too hard. Don't you have activated Siri ? [Jo] No ! She doesn't do anything here ! [Jo] At least I have mixing bowls a home ! That's true. 680 grams. If it were 21 grams... I don't think it works like this. So a spoonful. Like our accent. 125 grams of flour. We need half a cup, which is 170 grams. So if we need 125 grams, we need less than half a cup. The rest of the sentence for the first step is : Add the remaining flour, milk and sugar, then salt. [Damon] Jo, do you remember at the beginning of the video we said that we needed 500 grams of flour, now we've got to do more maths because we only added, So if 125 grams is half a cup, it means that 500-125=375 grams , [Damon] Yeah. so it means more or less three cups ? How many half cups do we need to have 375 grams ? 1 cup and a half ! We covered it with a damp cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes. Knead in squares...between two pieces of greaseproof paper. Ok our French isn't developped enough for a recipe like this one why did we choose it ? Who wants my croissants ? [Damon] Who wants my crispy croissants ? Golden, pretty with a big crust... The american recipes says that we need a whole pound of butter. But according to the French recipe we only need half a pound. And the Americans wonder why we're all... NEXT ! On a kitchen counter dusted with flour... Had we known the difficulty of the French required to do this recipe, we would have chosen another one. We read it in our comments, so it's them who put us in this crap. The best comment said to go out to the bakery and buy the croissants. Not bad ! Not bad, now we have to mix everything. It's like this, like... It's too... wet. Soup of the day, Damon and Jo's croissants. Next step : I'm starting to feel a bit nervous. It's never going to be croissants. It's the soy milk. Put the butter in the middle. Put the butter in the middle and cover it by refolding the edges of the dough above it. Put the butter in the middle and cover it by refolding - What's "rabattant" (refolding) ? Spread out the butter into a square between two pieces of greaseproof paper. Not bad, ok. [Jo] I'm impressed ! [Damon] Be careful. [Jo] You've got neighbors ! I think you have to do this. Ok, it's alright, look it's a croissant. Well, they look alright. Preheat your oven at 220°C , bake for 45 minutes and hope for the best ! 20 minutes later. We forgot the egg yolk ! Before putting in the oven, brown the croissants with  whisked egg yolk. How to bake croissants for dummies ? We don't know. 45 minutes, here we go. 45min later. It smells like Christmas, I swear ! It's so scented! Have Damon and Jo made this? [Damon] Yeah and they've also done this. Is it a huge disaster ? It's not a big disaster, it's just a big... dryness. I'm going to put a glass of water beside. [Jo] I'm not sure we can call them croissants, maybe 'croustillants' (crispies) ? Nothing to do with... With a bit of butter ? A bit more! Look, this is the normal inside of a croissant. It's just a bit too dry. You add jam and, perfect ! I don't have any ! It's crispy, literally not bad. It's not bad... for an american. It's ok ! It's really ok. No but it's ok. Comment below if we are real French bakers or not. Vote in the poll and tell us if they're ok or not. Make sure to subscribe because we make videos in french every French Friday. No but really, I need a liquid. Ciao, kisses ! 
what happens Damon it's Joan it's a man jokes are now apps travels a lot as do we and we figured today it would be the perfect opportunity to give you the weird bizarre strange offer plain stories that we've never actually shared on our channel I've been on over a thousand flights for sure I would say probably closer to 2,000 flights as a mom I had my share of strange plane shenanigans [Music] and then in order to spice this game up we're going to try to tell our most riveting story in two minutes I'm just happy that we do have a two minute time limit because any time you're around Joe her story's going you tell like every little beat and I have a crowd waiting for the next turn of events if you like let's get this game started two minutes on the clock I think I'm giving you guys my better story so I just want you to appreciate it also don't forget to go and click on the description box below we've also made a video telling the other stories we have on access channel so we've got a lot three-two-one okay so one day I was the chaperone on a traveling speech trip so it's me and a bunch of kids I cook speech we were going to a tournament do is it Boston and so I was like in charge of everything and so it's a lot of work to get all these kids on the plane but I get all of them on the plane right and then we're just and I know that few of them are nervous because they're they're like you whine makes them scared and things like this all of the sudden this is like so we've taken off and this is like just watching the clock we've taken off and we're probably like an hour into the flight and the flight attendant comes up to me with a bag it looks like a biohazard bag like it has scary symbols on it and she's like you need to hold this so could use the party no no and then I found out it was because the flight attendant was new and one of my kids got sick and they vomited the flight attendant in there air sickness bag and the flight attendant took the air sickness bag and they put it in the biohazard bag and they took it and then I think it was a mistake because they're actually not supposed to take it but she was new so she didn't know so you're sitting there with him okay you tell me I'm sorry it's your story so the flight attendant took it from my kid but she didn't know she wasn't supposed to take it so she tried to give it back to my kid when her boss told her to do and the kid was like gross I'm not gonna hold my mom leave didn't know what to do so they ended up going to me because I was a chaperone for the trip and they were like you need to hold your students vomit because we don't have anywhere to put it in the protocol like what I have to hold the whole flight enjoyed it did you know what I would throw up if I had to hold her off well no it was all packaged so I mean it was like it was warm though but oh yeah I feel ready to just sit back and enjoy them now the pressure is one wait two minutes we were going to Reykjavik to Paris Joe and I we were on this flight you know you you sit in your seat and then all of a sudden the flight attendants come on the intercom and they're like actually before that three people have been escorted off of the plane so everyone's sitting by police by police come on they escort three people very sketchy three sketchy people off the plane but then that comes on everyone has to get up in the overhead cab or overhead whatever it's called in compartment compartment and claim their baggage then they're like okay we're good what's my time oh good freakin Rin Sullivan no sir up in the flight and it starts getting very very turbulent and you know that moment when you're going through the clouds that clouds should only take like a minute or two like you're passing through from one plate with one stratosphere to the notes cumulonimbus cloud but okay anyways we're in the clouds like 20 minutes and Joe and I throughout this turbulence we're like this is getting sketchy no clouds are this big unless you're in the cumulonimbus exactly and we did think we were we're getting nervous like come on that we need to start seeing the Eiffel Tower everybody stops talking in the play the man behind us has to borrow my throw-up that starts vomiting behind us we're like what's happening as we're descending towards the tarmac Pawnee shall to go to airport okay people get an escort office playing they have to get our hand luggage we're like in the clouds too long we think we're being directed towards the Eiffel Tower and then to wrap it all up there freaking pilot goes back up in the air we're like into the clouds and that all Damon does is puts on his little like neck Fang neck Oh puts all his sweaters on his lap and he looks at me is like goodbye in fact what it's called it's called an aborted landing over and one time it at like we did it like six times not as fun how can people like flying yes no David took the better story but I'm gonna tell you about this time that we were coming from Thailand and we were connecting I think in Sweden it was a 13-hour flight so it was really long and it was one of those planes that had like no in-flight entertainment like slim pickings on the choices of what to do for 13 hours like 13 hours in a very long time I want to fly um the IOC I love sitting the aisle because I always get up because I hate flying so that's my excuse to like still fill my legs if I'm in control all of a sudden this man taps my shoulder and he looks like a flight attendant he's like man I'm like I'm Joe what's yours and he's like whatever Eric and I'm like cool nice to meet you and I'm like freaking I look like David I'm like Stephen like that guy I think he might be a flight attendant and then I keep looking at the same man and he's circling circling demands but this is a 13-hour place oh no imagine you've seen him on our - circling you like try to fall asleep but you're kind of scared because now this man is just circling and I thought he was a flight attendant but he's not he's getting even we were shot in the jump seat like I said it's there and then all of a sudden I look and he's talking to other people on the plane and I'm like Damon I swear who this man is not a flight attendant he's no Joe what are you talking about he totally is and I'm like no he's not and then David started freaking out we were both like boy you better sit Joe is very super sketchy like he would be like doing laughs he I think he was literally kicked out of the flight attendant seat and was forced to sit back down but all I know is that the entire flight I could not relax for 13 hours because I'm like you go into the pilots cabin look you better not right I feel like he's casing that she was chasing it no it was horrible and he went name and I'm like oh my god and that's my cert ended up landing he wasn't flight attendant read Joe Deonte know what you see suspicious people and you're just like something about this isn't right this whole video goes to show you that yes your flight experiences may not be as pretty as some other ones but we're all still here you know what in the next video I'm gonna tell the most beautiful flight story I have on your

- Why is your name Daddy Yankee? If you really think about it though. - Is there a boob emoji? - But things sound better in Spanish. - They do.
- Agreed. I apologize to my neighbors
because it's about to get loud. - Yes. - As loud as that little
rinky dink thing can take us. - Did you guys bring anything today? - The boombox. - I brought my charisma. ♫ Me esta gustando mas de lo normal ♫ Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo mas ♫ Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningun apuro ♫ Despacito ♫ Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito - What up everyone, it's Damon. - It's Jo. - [Damon And Joan] It's Damon, and Jo and. - Holly! - This chica mujer is
named Holly and she's also very bilingual and very Spanish speaking. We need her help to
understand what the hell is going on in Despacito. - You guys have not Googled this yet? - No, we were waiting
for this collab video. - She didn't even know the song Despacito before this video. - Can you play the clip? ♫ Despacito (vocalizing) That is not the song
we're dissecting today, 'cause that song doesn't exist. - We're gonna do two things today. One, we're gonna react to Despacito. - Okay, I'm gonna tell you
guys something right now, the original version does not include Justin Bieber, sorry guys. It is Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yanky. - Obviously, you can see
she's very knowledgeable, so we're gonna listen to her when she translates the lyrics-- - Or she's gonna tell us the lyrics, and we're gonna try to guess. 'Cause you know Espanol no esta muy bien-- - No esta buenisimo. - [Jo] Esta bien, chicos. - Es perfecto. - Just to let y'all
know, we did film a video on Holly's channel donde hablamos en Portugues y en Espanol.
- Y espanol. - And english. - And english! - Luis Fonsi, Daddy Yankee, Justin Bieber joined the party later,
and luckily, I'm grateful, because it gave the video more visibility. Why do I act like I have
anything invested in this, I should I shoulda bought stock in this (Jo and Damon laughing) Whatever, we're gonna watch the video. They've never seen it, which is insane. It is August of 2017, and
they have not seen this video. - I literally didn't even know the song. ♫ Despacito (vocalizing) I did, I did, I did. - No, you didn't. We heard you singing, girl. You were on a different musical scale. - On a different note too. - Whatever, I was
thinking of a better tune. - Here's the thing, this video has over three billion views right now and we are not any of those views. - So it's like, how many Damon and Jos? - I own about 17 of them. I had a viral comment on this video. Daddy Yankee es inmortal, o que? Parece mas joven que hace diez anos. My comment had 32,000 likes. In case you wondering, the
number of comments allowed under a comment on a video, is 500. Because people were writing me and saying, I tried to comment under your comment, and it wouldn't let me. - Oh yeah, we get that all the time. (laughing) - [Jo and Damon] Is that Daddy Yankee? - No, that's Luis Fonsi! You guys are the same person! - Is that Daddy, no. - That was me, with a brown wig. They're all in black. - They're roasting, you know they're sweating they asses off. - They are roasting on
the streets of Cuba. I'll tell you guys my
favorite line in a second. - This is like, making

favorite line, you'll see. ♫ Suave suavecito ♫ Pasito suave suavecito - Those are the only lyrics anybody knows. English speakers.
- And you like scream them. - Including Justin Bieber. (all laughing) He was like, what I gotta learn? (all laughing) - [Together] Whoa! - I'm sorry, the body roll for Fonsi? - I wanna do that tonight. - That was like a powerful
body collide moment. - Whoa. We were saying we're
going to the gym tonight and do squats, right? - We did.
- Yeah. Listen to Daddy Yankee here. ♫ Favorito favorito baby Oh, I love it so much! - Favorito, favorito baby! - It's my favorite line,
I yell it in the car. Whoa! - I'm just trying to be in
Puerto Rico when her boobs. (Damon laughing) What in the hell does
that song even talk about? - So, Despacito, I can say this without looking at the Lyrics,
it means nice and slow. Like, even when you're grilling onions, you need to keep that fire
low, you know what I'm saying? - Don't tell me that,
I'm always burning stuff. - Yeah well, you need to know this. - That's true. - We're actually having intervention here. You need to turn the flame
down, and take your time. Sabes que ya llevo un rato mirandote. - It's been a while that
I've been staring at you. - Yup. - Que ya llevo un rato, okay. - I know that one. - He's the creep in the club - Tengo que bailar contigo hoy. - I needa dance with you today. - Que tu mirada ya estaba llam-- - Your look was already calling me. - Yes! Some people have those bedroom

- Who the hell Betty Davis? - Okay, I was born in like 1999. Muestrame el camino que yo voy. - Oh, show me the path in
which we will go together. - Yes. - I'm just wondering
if they translate this in spanish classes
today, because it's easy. - Well, they should not,
'cause then they wouldn't come to our channel. (Holly and Damon laughing) - Tu eres el iman y yo soy el metal. You are the magnet, and I am the metal Voy acercando y voy armando el plan. - Oh shit, I'mma get closer
and I'm gonna form the plan. - Can I get some students
that don't know everything? Solo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso. - Just thinking about
it accelerates my pulse. - Yes! Ya, ya me esta gustando mas de lo normal. - You're making me like
you more than normal. - Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo mas. - All my feelings are doing something. - Asking me for more. - Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningun apuro. Let's go back to your cooking. - Oh shit. Onions? - Oh, I have to do this with no hurry. - Despacito, quiero respirar
tu cuello despacito. This could be creepy if it's
coming from the wrong person. - I wanna sniff your neck slowly. - Yes! Deja que te diga cosas al oido. - I wanna tell you sweet
nothings in your ear. - Para que te acuerdes
si no estás conmigo. - So you can remember
if you're now with me. - Uh-huh. So, is it out of sight, out of mind, or absence makes the heart grow fonder? - Holly, as travelers
we deal with this a lot. And we don't know which one's true. - I hit a nerve. - I learned a lot, I
hope you learned a lot. - Like, I see the world
through the Despacito eyes. I didn't know what it meant. I didn't even know what it was. (Damon laughing) - Did you used to do
things, like, too quickly? - Go watch the collab video that we filmed on Holly's channel. - It's really good. If you're bristling and you
think you understand Spanish, go see if you understand her
Mexicanese words, because-- - We had some fun. We had some fun. - And there was Kashasta involved. Also, don't forget to click
that subscribe button. What is your favorite
Spanish speaking song? - But we didn't finish the song. - Girl, that's for the
next video we gotta go out. I'm trying to dance with Despacito. - Why are you guys abandoning me? ♫ Despacito - Wait, Damon, is your middle name Daniel? - Damon Despacito Dominique. (all laughing) - We can all feel the pheromones
coming out of the screen. Am I right or am I just making this up? - I saw a lot of this. - Suave suavecito! - They were doing it,
and I need to learn that. With my husband only. 
*(Later on)
- [Jo] It's working! *(Later on) Who likes feijoada? I don't know! Because I've never tried And neither did you I don't know what... How it's like Like, I've never seen it I saw it once And I didn't tried it Maybe I have when I was 5 I've never seen... or eaten You can't eat something you've never seen Today we are making a very americanized/vegetarian feijoada "vegetarianized" "DamonAndJonized" He's a vegetarian Our neighbour doesn't want us to Let's go Let's do it! We have an american recipe To make a brazilian feijoada Ingredients: Farofa, do we need it? Later, to put it on top He's such a brazilian! Rice! To eat with the feijoada Ok. Now on to the feijoada recipe Cilantro What is this called? I don't know In english, cilantro For a smelly mouth Garlic I don't know what is called Ground cilantro a cilantro powder Fake meat Fake meat like pepperoni Vegetarian Fake bacon Facon! And I know you are going to kill me because of this But we don't have a 
pressure-cooker Or even 11hours to cook beans Beans Canned I know that all the brazilians will be like "Ew! Who eats canned beans?" Bay leaf Onions! Bay leaf And onions! Onions! For us to cry... ...about our feijoada that will taste bad We are starting now - [Jo] Damon, what are you doing? What is feijoada? - [Jo] What is feijoada!? Feijão- (beans) ada! No way! Wow Feijoada is a really famous brazilian dish With beans on it The dish is based on beans The beans are the star of the dish How is this any different from the rice and beans dish? For me it looks the same But there's a lot of meat on it It's like 8 types of meat This is great for a vegetarian! That's why we got fake meat First off: Rice And yes, I'll use this because it's much faster - [Jo] This boy is doing everything... ...right! The american way Because americans don't eat rice, so that's already a problem Let's boil the rice and then we'll start to cook the feijoada Directions: Immerse the meats in bath for about 36hours Changing the water several times if you're in a hot environment or in the summer We don't have all this time Brazil How to make feijoada in 36 seconds, go! It's almost finished! But what are you going to do with this water? I'll put in the pot to cook rice But you'll light the stove afterwards? So you are boiling the water to take it to the pot And then turn on the stove to boil the water again? - [Damon] I don't have time! Oh boy! 36 seconds, hurry up! - [Jo] Oh my god... There's no math here, just put the rice on the pot And then let the water boil, case closed. Go, go, go, go Take off some of the water, there's too much water This rice is going to get soggy! No one likes a soggy rice! We are supposed to immerse the meat in bath for 36 hours We don't have all this time This knife is terrible Vegetarians don't even use knives Because they don't eat meat - [Damon] Frigideira (frying pan) - [Damon] What is "panela"? - [Damon] Here's the frying pan "Panela" is a pan - [Jo] "Frigideira" is a frying pan A little oil Where is it? Where is it!? It's in here A little oil A tiny little oil Olive oil So expensive, I've put 5 dollars in the pan already - [Damon] I've never... - [Jo] ...cooked - [Jo] Why did you let the lid... - [Jo] Oh my god He doesn't even know how to eat canned beans - [Jo] No, don't do this, no! - [Damon] Yes! - [Jo] Why are you doing... - [Jo] You are taking off all of the bean broth - [Jo] This is the bean broth! How are we supposed to make a feijoada? - [Jo] Let me do this, please But this is so watery Like, I don't want... Feijoada is like a soup! It's supposed to be watery I don't want a beverage "Comida" (food) comes from the word "comer" (to eat) This is something... Feijoada is a dish, right? It's not a beverage I don't want to drink it, I want to eat it What's a sopa (soup) then? It comes from the "sopar" verb Alright, Can I do this? Ok, good Ok, careful The fire alarm always goes off I love meat but I also like fake meat Ok, I told you that this was going to happen Fire, fire Our feijoada is cooking already And I was looking for information on the Internet I found a recipe called "Sunday's Feijoada" And here we are in the Damon and Jo's Big Sunday Look at the ingredients Two pork feets 250g of pork ribs Pork tails Sliced bacon Pork's ear Is this edible? I don't know Sausage Like, the whole pork is in the feijoada We don't have any pork Is it a feijoada? We'll see Jo, I have a question - [Jo] Yes? Where's the bin? - [Jo] Behind you Then why is this not in the trash? Shut it, boy! He's so annoying! I can't take it Annoying people in the kitchen That's our next show that we filmed... ...No Annoying people cooking Ok, now let's cut onions, to cry a little bit Onion Garlic But which one? Both, we got to cut both Now what? We put it like this, right? No! I'm joking you guys I love the smell of garlic Specially when you kiss someone and they got that garlic breath You know? It's so good You guys see this? It's like my personality that has several layers [Jo] That's how you improvise people [Jo] You guys may be thinking that we are putting dog food on our feijoada - [Jo] This is facon - [Jo] Or fake bacon - [Jo] I don't even know... -[Jo] I've never seen this is Brazil [Jo] Have you? Yes! There's a lot of vegetarian restaurants in São Paulo - [Jo] Made with soy, but fake bacon? I don't know I want to go back there Alright, let's put this to replace the pork's foot One, two, three I know that this may not look like a brazilian feijoada But the smell that is in here... It smells like a brazilian house Because of the garlic and onions - [Jo] Damn, this looks so brazilian! How do you cook this? - [Jo] You can toast it, or eat it like that No, but the way it is... The word... How can I say... Oh my god! - [Jo] Who wants farofa? - [Damon] No! How to make feijoada in 36 days! Next step? - [Jo] It's a bit burned, but let it be - [Jo] Let it boil, let everything boiling - [Jo] Where's the salt and pepper? - [Jo] Specially salt - [Jo] Because we love our salt - [Jo] You guys, this one has a face of despair Look, I'm going to make a "Farofinha" with eggs Eggs as well? Eggs, you've never tried! I think there's too much eggs Oh my god! How do you turn it off? Put this with the beans It's working everybody! Oh, guys... Tasty! ♪ It looks so good, it looks so good ♪ No! I took the top layer off It went right on the beans pot After the Havaiana inside the feijoada plot I'll just add the last spices The bay leaves Did you know that in Brazil my grandmother used to say that if you get a bay leaf inside of your beans It's good luck Is it? Yes. Let's see who's the luckiest Me! Because I'm going to eat a feijoada with Havaiana We are almost finished - [Jo] The moment of truth - [Damon] Should I put it on top? - [Jo] You can put it on top, on the side, do what you want - [Jo] Damn!
- [Damon] Wow! - [Jo] It looks good! - [Jo] Come on, this is vegetarian? - [Jo] And made by gringos? And to finish Let's sprinkle the dish with a toasted "Farofinha" with eggs Let me tell you, I'm proud - [Damon] You didn't expect this - [Jo] Ok? Everyone at home - [Jo] I didn't read a single step in the recipe It smells like nothing Brazilian food! Burns the mouth Too hot It tastes like meat Did you put it? Brazil, thank you again for inspiring another great meal here in the United States in LA Actually, it's great I think that maybe you'll need someone that's half brazilian to help you with that Oh, yeah Good Last thing everybody We are here eating this feijoada That end up being quite good It's good We are making a poll right here Do you think our vegetarian american feijoada looks good?

(Rewinding) - I don't know how to turn this off. There were issues with the toilet too. I love France. I used to live here. I even think I've been back 10 times. Each time probably at least two weeks. It's fine, I've stayed
within my visa limits. So we all know that
Paris is the city of love and for me it is the city of love. It's also the city of love and hate. Why? Why? Just like your city at home, Paris is not all roses. In fact, it's the least amount, okay I'm trying really hard
to get these different angles. In fact it's only hose
if I'm using this filter. But I know you wouldn't
have clicked on this video if you were expecting all pon de chocolat or Eiffel Tower, so I'm about to give you the roast session that you were looking for. Here are the things that I dislike, that I loathe, that I hate about Paris. The metro. The paris metro is the best metro I've ever seen in the world. The thing that doesn't make sense, the weekly and monthly metro passes start on very annoying days. If you try to buy a weekly
unlimited pass on a Thursday, you're only getting it until Monday. So, if you want the weekly pass, you have to wait until Monday. It's not like it goes seven days from the date of purchase. You have to wait, or
you have to waste money. Hip hop clubs. (Music) Wow. Who's gonna get into a
hip hop club looking like that? Why is it so hard to find
hip hop and R&amp;B clubs? Well because electro is very popular here. Why is electro popular here? I have two theories (bells). One, no one understands the English in popular American songs (laughs). And how can you when everything is like roasting and shook and I'm triggered and I'm crackling and like whatever. Two, they don't know how to dance. Ooooh, that felt bad. The sketchyness. Paris I still feel like is a sketchy city. I still feel like I
need to clutch my phone and hide it in my underwear. Maybe this is because I look like a frail lil white boy from America, maybe. But they ain't know what's underneath. No but for real, Paris is pretty sketchy, I think at night. It's just the architecture,
like the lights are yellow, so it doesn't look safe. The roads are tiny and
there's lots of curbs, so like it's easy mugging territory. The metro, I mean especially like the RER, like the time between the stops is so long that it gives you ample time
to just make your rounds up and down to get your blackberries or in my case, get his blackberry. I didn't mug him. French waiters, sorry Parisian waiters. Parisian waiters do this, hi, could I have a glass of water? (French) Kay, here yo go. (Glass shattering) (French) You want a goat cheese salad? Okay here you go. This is me, like do you
wanna put that down nicely? Like I know there's not
much of a tipping culture, but that doesn't give you
a reason to be mean to me. When I'm ordering a coffee
at the end of my meal, why are you doing everything possible to not recognize when I need you? (Beep) (French) Excuse me. I'm gonna go get it. (Beep) Parisian waiters part two. (French) I was at a Vietnamese restaurant. I wanted a Bo Bun. How is adding tofu that's on the menu and Bo bun that's on the menu to make a tofu Bo Bun
that's not on the menu, How is that impossible? (French) Ahh. The huffing and puffing. The huffing and puffing I really hate, but I also really love to hate it. You're holding up the line and French people are the best at showing you how much you are an inconvenience to their lives. (Beeps) (French) It's to the point that my friend now walks around Paris like this. Woah. Can you do the thing where,
the huffing and the puffing? - The tempers are a little shorter here. I've been traveling
through Paris by way of huffing and puffing. (Laughter) - There have been many times
when I walk into a store and I being American, would be like, "Excuse me, do you have this or that?" If you don't say bonjour, hello, before you ask your question, prepare to get the most attitude you've ever seen in your life. If you do not say au revoir, merci, (French), you're ruined. Don't come back. Parisians give Americans a hard time for being superficial,
fake, very surface level. Like "Hey how are you? I'm
good. Okay cool, that's great." And yet this is exactly what that is. (French) (French) It's the same exact thing. The smoking. For example, I'm filming this video and I see you and you outside
of your window smoking. That's fine because you're
in your private space, but when I'm walking down the street or I'm in a coffee shop, why am I smelling your smoke? How is that an accepted part of society and it affects everyone else's air. We're talking about air. Airflow. Or lack there of. There is no airflow in Paris. Okay when I get on the bus, I'm not expecting there to be A/C, there doesn't need to be A/C. Why are we not opening up those windows? Air flow feels good. It's for the benefit of everybody. Who wants stale air? Nobody wants stale, musty air, so why aren't we opening the windows? (French) Why is there a flat screen TV, why is there a towel warmer? But do we have a fan? (French) Oh I don't like the fan,
it makes too much noise. If the fan makes too much noise, put on Seiza, put on Frank Ocean. But we're talking about a
level of grime on our skin. Who wants to feel salty all day long? The gyms. Speaking of sweatiness, first of all Parisians go to the pool. Number one thing if you're
an American going to Paris, you can't wear your board shorts. It literally says (French), so you need to put on
your Speedo, like I do. Okay so we're sweating,
we're already outside. You're like why do I need to go to the gym if I'm already sweating
inside my own house? Valid. Even more valid when you do go to the gym, because I went to a gym
where they literally tried selling me on their group classes. You guys, the group classes, this is literally what they say, "Welcome, here we have
a wide range of classes. "We have a Zumba, we have
yoga, we have cardio fitness. "We use a state of the art television. "We wheel it into the room." I was like that's- what you're telling me, you roll a TV into the room and people watch aerobics. I didn't sign up for that shit. Obviously Paris has a lot
of things going for it. It's beautiful, the
architecture, the people, the fashion, the food. People chill in parks,
they drink by the sun. They're always going to the movies, they're reading books,
they're going to museums, they're going to the latest expo. They're so cultured,
they're so in the know, they have a bigger
vocabulary than you or I do. Don't know if they know
how to be on camera though. (Bell) (French) Dammit. I filmed that entire video and now I just remembered
there's a lot more I hate about Paris. I love Paris, come on. I understand that French society is not as crazy about work
as we are in the States. But everything is always closed. As an entrepreneur, I
enjoy work on my laptop. If I go to a bistro or a brasserie the amount of looks that you get for having your laptop open
in a social environment, I'm not okay with that. No one's wearing colors here. In fact, this is the
brightest color you'll see in Paris. But what if I wanna wear my
camo pants with a red shirt? If you like this video,
make sure you subscribe. We're trying to reach one million. These are the things that I
don't really enjoy in Paris, but that doesn't mean that I'm not gonna keep coming back here, because there are plenty of
other things that I love. We'll see you next time (French) Ciao. 
- What up, it's Damon - And it's Jo and it's DamonandJo You know some people think we're one person, some people don't even know which one of us is Damon or Jo. We even get confused sometimes. Truth is we are two different people ! - Could you tell ? - With two different backgrounds, but are we really that different ? Today, we're about to embark on an adventure to see if there's any proof that we come from the same place. Let's zoom out ! So, I'm Jo. I grew up in the USA But I was originally born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. I consider myself Brazilian American or an americanized Brazilian What does that mean? Well, my mom's from rio, and so was my dad. My grandmother's father aka my great-grandfather was also born in Rio, But his mother my great-great grandmother was a freed slave from Africa. His father was Italian. My grandmother's mother, aka my great-grandmother was from the Netherlands. And then, later, went to Ceará. Then she moved to Rio at a young age with her very[ [???] parents. My grandpa's mother was born in Rio, But his father was an immigrant - just like me - when he left his hometown of Portu-portugal So a part of me is portuguese. My great-grandfather went to Brazil at 7 years old with his family who worked in construction to build a better life in Rio. On my dad's side : his parents are Brazilian and African... Which basically means that I'm [???] So the point is : I brought all that culture with me when I moved to Bethel, Connecticut, at the age of 5. I grew up in a tiny suburb in town until, later, I moved into New York, where I met Damon. - And I'm damon and my whole family's from Fort Wayne, Indiana Yeah, that's all I know. Until now. Mooom, do you have any idea where we're from ? - Umm... no... we're American ! - My mom didn't know so I thought I'd call my dad - Hello Damon, how are you ? - Dad, do you have idea where we're from ? - We're from America ! - Then I thought to call my grandma Edna - Hello ? - Grandma, do you have any idea where we're from ? - We're just American. - Deep down, we're not just American there's always more to the story. - Damon are you not going to have one piece of chocolate for me to eat in your house? I [???] pita chips. - I got a better question for you If you had to guess the country where I'm from, what would you say ? Well, considering your baby blues, I' Please trust me, please ewing. I know how good in your house. So that's them no You don't know where you're from whoa do it does any American? Alright. I'm not American, okay? Yeah, like I don't know okay. So I would like to know where do you think you're from? I always look like a sweden just trying to fit in with the model And you loop it and like do you want to go through these pictures like wow such a model shot damon He is swedish right here like this is actually his native place home place in Sweden kid sister Swedish Cloud 3 My mom was born and pleaded under changing naturally, but I was born in Fort Wayne, Indiana like the rest of my family Okay, no good jokes aside. Where am I really from the answer could be found in my dna or you know my Deoxyribonucleic acid okay the molecule that carries the genetic instruction to who he is or a human being? Basically what I mean by this is that I spin the Tube and send it off to the 23 me labs who would help me Think in my life out So if you want to find some home behind Recommend. It what you're going to need is a 20 grand me kit inside. The kit. You will find a tuba It's a special solution and a little bag that's all you need and your spit damon Naomi a star I don't even have it. I need more fit preferably not on me a lot of spit In there it was my spit in transit. Help me discover where I was really from So here's the latest greatest on the Demon to adventure what I do go to email. What email the email these Hours yep 23 new Year reports already. Can you type that be report? Okay, so here's what I am don't be looking okay. Tell me what you are, okay 54% British predict earnings of a 20 percent swedish principal 14% French and German project all one percent portuguese oh my God like we're twins we had a Stage yep? My walking one percent of iberian connected Dna could be part of the reason why Joe and I spend 99% of our time together? We could let your because we actually found out that a part of it could be from the same place and thanks to 23andme We're packing our bags, and we're going to portugal Portugal cuz that's casual because I want a drink wine Oh my God, you throw me a see later voice. Tell me that's wrong. I don't even have it 
What is this? It charges by oxygen It's a new technology Lots of jokes later Hello everybody, it's Damon And it's Jo It's Damon and Jo And... And Bruna! Bruna Vieira I need help I speak Portuguese, but I'm not as good as you two Not as good as you Yeah, I'm not included I want you to visit Minas Gerais when you go to Brazil Me too, I never went there It's my state We have to practice to go to Minas Gerais And of course we need help of a brazilian who's from Minas To teach us some Minas slangs They're really short slangs, you'll see Alright I said one already "cê" Did you get it? - [Damon ] "Cê", "você"
- [Jo] "Cê vai ver" We cut the "Vo" Why should I say "Vo" if you can get it just by saying "cê"? You don't need a "Vo" "Vo" stays at home. Let's get it started In portuguese we have this word Which you can't translate it Where we use it in several situations It's "eita" You can use "eita" when you're speechless You see something really wrong going on But it can also be something really good There's no way to "Eita" Like "Eita, I ate a lot" "I'm serious" - [Jo] My pants are so tight
- [Damon] We were eating just now We also usually say "Eita mano do céu" "Mano do céu" What's that? A "mano" who's in "céu" (sky/heaven) It comes from "irmão"(brother), right? Yeah, it comes from "irmão" "Irmão" to "Mano" It's like a brother nickname "Eita" it's not just from Minas But it's where we use the most Yeah, my grandmother always use that like These kind of things Oh, my grandma "Eita" it's great Another expression "Nuu" What's that? It's not "naked" "No boteco" (At the bar) It's not "naked" I love it Because "Nu" also means "naked" Like Something really bad happened But why? Get this naked person out of your head No! I wasn't even thinking It's to express what you're feeling There's not a specific meaning to that But it gives intensity to what you're going to say next What? She speaks so fast Next There's "arreda" Do you know what it is? It's like "get out" It's something we say in Minas Gerais only Because it's full of farms, country life, crops, cows and cattle breeding It's like Texas - [Damon] Like "get out of here"
- [Bruna] On the farms they say "Bezerro"? What's that? "Bezerro" it's a bull's breeding "Boi"? I don't know "Arrega" I'm speaking another language "Rego" It's like your buttcrack What? In Minas we call everything "trem" For example Can you hand me this "trem"? - [Damon] A "thing"
- [Jo] This is crazy I'm confusing you A "bagulho" it's like "la chose" in french In english it's "thingymabobber" Very complicated The last one "uai" Why? "porquê" My grandma says that too It's not from "why" You get somewhere and you want people to tell you're from Minas Gerais You get like And then people get it Where are you from? "Uai" No! Like when you pause to say something "Uai, I didn't know that" It kind of gives you some time to think on what you're going to say I like it then Because I need a lot of time To think on what I'm going to say Test time Use at least two words your learned in a sentence "Uai..."

- Jo, are you ready? - I'm picking my wedgie. - Got you butt ready? - Got my wedgie ready for you guys. - What up. (goofy sounds) - We're a little happy
because we're in Laguna Beach. - We're in Southern
California, we live in LA. But it's like why stay in LA
when you can drive to Laguna? - You guys, honestly we got a little bored so we came to Laguna and that's why. - Hit it. (upbeat beachy music) - Jo, did you actually watch
Laguna Beach in high school? (phff) - One episode. Me and them, nothing in common. Everybody's like Jo, where'd
you get this swim suit? This is how you know- - Big Lots. - How cheap. Go to an Urban Outfitters. You ask for the box of
bathing suits at the end of the season. There is dust on the box. 20 dollars. - [Damon] Let me see. - 20 dollas. - [Damon] 20 dollars. - 20 dollars. The chump got left behind. - [Damon] It's okay, we're back. - [Jo] It's okay. (moaning) - Watch it. - [Damon] Watch it, Jo. You're being vulgar and loud. Jo are you going to go in the water? - [Jo] Maybe. Because I want to freeze my bleep off. (laughs) - For every who thought Socko
and I were the same person, surprise! - We're just sisters. - Actually, I edited this
video so there's actually two of the same person right here. This is a piece of Jo's shoe. - These are expensive. - [Damon] Really? - I've had them for like seven years. - [Damon] You sure about that, JO? - Nap time. (upbeat beachy music) - [Jo] It's beautiful. Doing the same thing. (laughs) - [Jo] Oh my god, lovers. I dedicate this video to the lovers. To my lover. ♫ Show me a place where dreams - Ride on a magic carpet and know- - Are you 46? Who knows that song? - Yes I am. - Can you do that thing where
you act like you're taking a video of me but actually film them? (upbeat music) - Come here, baby. - [Jo] Here's a flower. (laughs) (romantic music) ♫ Before I put on my make up - Forever and ever we never will bottle how I love you forever and ever. - [Jo] Keep going. - Is that? - [Jo] I cut it off for your solo. Couple goals, that is it. It's about them. - Why are we both acting
like we don't have lovers. Oh what! - You caught me. - This in my lover that
I was talking about. - And this my lover and we're a throuple. (laughs) - On a honeymoon. (upbeat beachy music) - So this is what you do in the middle of Southern California,
you go to Red Robin. Yum! - So if it's not bad enough
that I'm not on Masocko's insurance for her car, I
just got her a few tickets or two just now on the highway. - I wanted to forget about that. - [Jo] Did you literally get a ticket? - Yes, he drove. - Jo, look up from your phone. The lights flashed. - [Jo] You got a ticket? - No, it's because Google
Maps told us to take a toll road. - How much do we owe her? Damn it. - [Socko] It's like a $300 ticket. - [Jo] Stop. - [Damon] Stop. - [Jo] Well you're about
to get hit by the car maybe we can get a lawsuit. - [Damon] There was no toll thing. You guys, they just say
it was dark on the highway so they flashed so we could see more. - I cannot believe that
we just got her a ticket. - [Damon] Yeah, I hope
that's fun paying that. Let's go to Red Robin. It's two words. - [Socko] It's two words,
the subject is TV show. - [Damon] The Office. (laughs) - [Damon] You have my phone, right? - I do. - [Damon] Can I have it maybe? - No, it's a family dinner. We need to be talking as a family. - It's two words, it's a TV show. - Bomb. - Yes. - Boom, y'all? - The poops because you guys are those. - If your don't guess it
then you get really sick and throw up at the table right now. (laughs) - Are you just throwing in words? The todays? - The Office, god. But why, why do I care? I really did see the last people looking at her saying sorry. I just put it in my mouth. - She's just like
biggest piece of broccoli could have parted it three ways. - [Socko] It's bottomless. - [Damon] Yeah. - Do I see a bottom? I see a bottom. - I saw you eat glass on that side. - No that was Damon. - That was probably me. - That was you. Me and my margarita are out to dinner. I don't know these goons are. - [Damon] It's like these
silly things that American places do. - [Jo] Americans are so silly. - That would not happen
in another country. - [Jo] They just like did a whole festive happy birthday song. - It was table 36's birthday
so everyone in the restaurant went over there and started singing. Oh wait, I have a question how do you steam your broccoli? - [Watiress] Uh, microwave. - [Jo] Well now we know. Microwave. The secret to why we
love Red Robin so much because of their
broccoli, it's microwaved. - [Damon] Jo clicked one
button on here, it started playing a game and we
just got charged 2.99. - [Jo] I'm sorry. - [Damon] 1.99. - [Jo] I wasn't planning on that. - [Socko] Wait, I thought
the sides came with the meal. - [Jo] Me too. - [Damon] So who's paying for the game? - Actually it was your
whole idea so you guys have to pay for it. - So I touched the button
for a game and I didn't actually play the game. I literally canceled it. Okay, phew. I need every dollar I can spare. - So what are we playing when
we get back to the hotel? That's a real question,
what games are we playing? - The go to sleep game. - Jo is the biggest grandma. - I got enough white
hairs to be a grandma. - I want to play the heads up game. - [Jo] Oh we should play that,
I'll stay awake for that. - How many rounds. - Commitment issues. - So you have two double
beds or one double bed. We're doing that thing
where we pay for two people in the hotel. And we're going to smuggle her in. - Five minutes later a dirty
girl with beach clothes comes on, like they've
never seen me before. I'm just going up. I'm just to help them settle in I'm their personal assistant. - [Damon] And then you never leave. - Yeah. - Personal assistant. (laughs) - Here they are. Are you guys knocking on the wrong door? Get in here. - [Jo] I was about to
scream outside the door you're strippers are here. What's the gross part about
having a bag on the floor? - [Socko] Potentially taking home bugs. - In a hotel room we paid good money for? - This is where we catch them diseases. (laughs) - Damon just farted. - Guys we successfully scammed the system. - Damon farted. - I did not fart, not yet. Masocko has the best
travel hack for anyone who doesn't want to pay for parking. - Yeah, we're just going
to pretend that my car was broken into so we don't
have to pay for parking. - And then what- - We'll bash one of the windows out. (laughs) - [Damon] There's an 80s
and 90s party downstairs and Masocko wants to wear this. - [Jo] Bo chika wow wow. (laughs) - [Jo] Chicka chicka
chicka bow chicka wow wow. - [Damon] She really
said are we going out out on Laguna Beach tonight? - [Jo] Damn, look at that leg mommy. The tag's still on, you better you better. - [Damon] My god. (laughs) - [Damon] Are you guys hungry? - I have a tiny piece of
chocolate on the counter and that's the only reason I'm getting up. - [Damon] Oh look who came
up with all the travel tips this morning now that it's past check out. - [Socko] Is it really? - What time is it? We're just watching peoples stories. You didn't catch me. You didn't just catch me
watching somebody's story. - [Damon] You guys, check out was at 8:30. - No. - You guys it's 12 pm. Bye. (upbeat music) - Yo, we found a place to
go in Southern California. This little place called
Inspiration Point. - Ugly view, beautiful view. Look at my hair. Doesn't it look beautiful? - [Damon] Hey Jo, can I see your shirt? - Look at what just happened. (laughs) - I don't know whose idea
it was to not put a shirt on this morning. Just ran into a subscriber
because people live here and that is mind blowing. All I'm saying is I'ma go in the water. Can you hold the camera. - Oh my god. This really is so beautiful. I swear it want on for any of that. (waves crashing) - I was just laughing
because we're over here not looking at our stuff that
Masocko told us specifically told us to look at. And then Masocko like runs by. - She's the freakin winner. Hold on, sorry, it's a very salty ocean. This is every moment that
I want to be spending of my life is doing that. - [Damon] Get back in! (upbeat music) ♫ Come on let's drive around ♫ Take the top down fool around ♫ Come on let's drive around - Oh man, it's time to leave Masocko. - [Masocko] I'll see
you in like three hours. - Where we going next? - The Holiday Inn. (laughs) - Alright, that's a wrap. - The end of the road for visit. - Yeah, make sure you comment below. Did I do it right, guys? (laughs) - Yeah just comment below. - Comment below. - Okay, buh bye. - Bye. - Muah. - [Damon] Are you taking your laptop? - No I'm on vacation for 24 hours. - I woke and told housekeeping to go away. - You literally hopped up like. (laughs) - I was going to go naked. I do want to go boogey boarding though, that might be fun. - With like the one centimeter wave? I have a rock formations
imprinted on my butt. - [Masocko] We're at another
Red Robin and this is my favorite restaurant. - You know what, okay. - Actors of the year. I can't even go out with them. - Bye bye. - So was it good? - You have to get your own room. (laughs)

- One of those overly
productive days where I woke up and I'm like, it's time to get shit done! The priority right now is
cleaning my closet, maybe laundry. (babbling) This is looking busted. I've lived in this apartment
alone for about six months. Why do I have so much crap? My goal today is literally
to take everything that I have not used in the
past two weeks to a month and put it in a bag to give away, because if I haven't
thought about this item, if I haven't worn this item, if I haven't missed this
item, it is not important. Let's get to work! Welcome to my closet! Wow, hoarder much? This is a mess, this is a mess. It's really rough, people. We, as human beings,
like to grasp onto things that are sentimental to us, and every few months,
it's time to think about what actually matters and get rid of all the shit that doesn't. Where do I begin? Garbage bags. This is it. This dress, I got it for free. I'm a sucker for free things, so if you give me a dress and it's free, it's gonna be for me and for you to. And that's all fine and dandy, until I look in my closet and I'm like, I don't really need it. Just because it was free
doesn't mean it is for me. It may be for you, which is why I'm gonna donate all these clothes. There are studies that basically show the less clutter physically
you have around you, the less mental clutter you have, and this is what the goal of today is. I'm trying to get rid of all this stuff. If I have not wanted to wear this in a few months, I don't need it. If I bought this in Thailand because I wanted to wear it in LA, I've been in LA all this
time and I haven't worn it, I don't need it. If I have this sweater dress
that I'm telling myself that maybe one day, there's
that perfect climate in which I can wear a dress, but it needs to be a sweater, and I've never come across
that perfect climate, I don't need it! Bye! I'm having all types of
life epiphanies here. The reason why I keep
these things in my closet occupying space is for
the following reason: maybe one day. It's not guaranteed, which means it's taking up space for an
indefinite amount of time for something that's not guaranteed, when the things that you actually need on a day to day basis, you're
not even making room for, because you have so
much crap in your closet of things that you
might use maybe one day. Let's just take a moment to talk about how many suitcases I've
collected throughout the years. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and I'm pretty sure there are three others in each of those suitcases. Bag lady redefined. And that's not even counting the bookbags. I have one, two, three, four, five. I'm giving two or three away. I have like three totes right there. Like, why do I need all this baggage? I've had these for forever,
didn't wear them once. Bye! Condense the bags. So much crap! I don't want any of it! What's in this suitcase number 785? Oh, look, sentimental things that I have no business keeping onto. Goodbye! Oh, and just like that, a
relationship is in the garbage. Well, no time to dwell on the past! Getting rid of crap that's sentimental isn't for the weak of heart, but you can't make new memories if you hold onto old ones. Let that marinate. Oh, look, another bag! I can't even tell you
the one thing I bought in this whole pile of crap. It's because I like free things. Garbage! But then I come across some things that I genuinely wanna keep and I'm like, wow, why haven't I used that? Because it's been hidden
in my damn closet, that's been cluttered with all this shit that I don't need! That's why I haven't come across this beautiful designer bag that I could easily take on a weekend getaway. You see why shit gets in the way, and why you need to get rid of the shit that you don't need? So you can find these beautiful items that you had all this time that you just couldn't get to, 'cause you didn't have a ladder to climb over the shit you didn't need! I'm getting into this. I'm pretty sure this is Damon's lip balm. I'm getting a little crusty
from all this decluttering. Let's keep going! I'm a hoarder, I'm a memory hogger. This scarf is not the
four years that I had at the university that I went to. This is just clutter, and this is also going in the giveaway pile. Okay, Spanx are good to suck in, but working on your abs at the gym, you won't need all of these
extra stupid things that are just taking up space. Love this scarf, it's basically a blanket. It takes up so much space that I really need to love it to keep it. This one's stayin'. Swish and flick. Why the hell do I have a Hermione wand? Like, what am I doing with this? Where do you put something like this? I don't know, which means I don't need it. Sorry, Harry Potter fans. Swish and goodbye. This blazer is important because, not only was it $15 on
clearance at Forever 21, but it symbolizes what I don't want to do with my life anymore. I don't want to go into
an office every day and have to wear a blazer
to be taken seriously. I don't wanna straighten my hair so that I'm not disturbing
anybody in a conference room. I don't want to be around anybody who judges my ability to be a professional based on what I wear, so goodbye, blazer! I called for backup. Masako just pulled to
eat some Kashi cookies. - Yeah, I'm gonna help her, I promise. Oh my God, I've never had these. - [Joanna] They're so good. You're gonna kill 'em! Wait, so are you finding
some treasures in there? - I am, like, my pile is growing. Oh my God! - It's another perfectly great poncho, and the hood zips off. Maybe I'll keep that one. - [Masako] You wanna keep it? It's nice. - [Joanna] Fine, Masako. - If you don't, I will. - Throw it back on the bed. She was supposed to come in and help me. She making it harder! After about six hours, four bags of perfectly good clothes to
give away, and a garbage bag, I'm done, just in time for all the stores to probably be closed. I think hoarders are all in denial. Are you a hoarder? - [Masako] No. - She taking stuff home! This is Masako's shopping bag! So, don't forget to comment below. Are you a hoarder, and have you cleaned out your closet recently? And maybe, if you do a
little mental decluttering, that's my next episode. Like, all the garbage in my head that I don't want inside of it. I'll see you next time, bye! So, one thing I'm not ready to let go of, autographed picture of
Damen Dominique himself. - [Masako] Is that the
cover of Vogue magazine? - Look at this sexy stud, circa 2012!

Do I even have 20 euros? Paris on 5 euros a day!! (sarcastically) Yeah right. Voilà, 20 euros. Okay, we're good Oh I want to show you this I didn't know how to open this door for three freaking days We have a bowl right here filled with doorknobs (laughs) I'm having too much fun already in this video Zero euros.

Thank you! *gasp* Sesame pancake, you got some dumplingsss Ok, so this was a euro thirty-five (€1.35). Typically, it's €1.10 but I'm over here in the boujee part, next to the Eiffel Tower. Look. Favorite spot in Paris! Completely free. On the street, and just as stanky as you thought. Wow. It's beauty, it's grace, it's Miss United States. Don't do that.

*misconjugating* Não sabe (You don't know) I know that she has... You don't speak portuguese I don't? A gente nem "sei"
(We don't even know) Stupid! We speak english fluently, we are americans I have a dual nationality We already know 
*misconjugating* 3, 2, 1... Ok guys, so right now we are going to... We are reacting to Anitta We're back! Go to the other side She released a song called "Will I See You" All in english, let's listen to it I personally like this title, because we... We always think "Will I See You?" Will I see you again? Because we travel a lot! Like, will I see you again? I don't know! We never know - And this is so...
- Anitta thinks the same way She understands us! ♪ When it's all said and done will I see you? ♪ She's beautiful ♪ When it's all said and done will I see you? ♪ Ok, who's singing? You better let her sing! ♪ All the way on you, I won't turn it off ♪ ♪ Would you do the same? ♪ ♪ When it's all said and done will I see you? ♪ She speaks english you guys, this is very good Her english is 99.99999... 9999... ...% My sister also sings, and when she sings 
it sounds like she knows how to speak French But she doesn't speaks french She does speaks a little bit Maybe Anitta speaks english only when she's singing I think that she actually speaks english,
since she's able to talk like this But her accent... It's perfect I like the video because she's all dressed in white And she also gets naked I like that as well ♪ Lord knows I do ♪ The question is: Does she speaks english? The answer is: Yes In the song. Now let's see in the interviews If she speaks english or not It's Ok if she don't. 
Because I don't speak portuguese that well But it's just to prove that 
after editing everything gets better Just like our videos I'm very happy to be here I came from a big schedule of shows and my own TV show, so... I was just a little sick yesterday but now I'm Ok And thank you for the invitation Well, Umm... Well If you asked this question to me "Asked" Guys, guys, guys! - Ok, two things
- Suddenly it changed Two things brazilians do when speaking english "Well" - This double "L"
- It doesn't work The "all" and "well" Well and all Another thing: "Asked, tried" No Asked Tried When you're speaking in the past,
it's not two syllables It's like... I walked. Not walk-ed It's always Tried Asked Walked That's all There's more, there's more Watched. Not watch-ed Never watch-ed, nobody watch-ed I've already tried some things in english I like to try, I like to... To test how can I sing in another language This is another one "How can I" instead of 
"How I can" You don't repeat the question. 
You change the verb and subject She spoke like this "I'm trying to test how can I"... I'm trying to test how I can Giveaway! It's a giveaway Dead giveaway This marks you as "Brazilian" I don't know I make a lot of classes ...to learn - Make a lot of classes
- I make a lot of classes I do a lot of classes No I take a lot of classes "Eu tomo muitas aulas"
(I take a lot of classes) In english And you're asking, Anitta speaks english or not? Yes She does! Speaks better in the song She's a brazilian trying to interview her in english ...same time without losting my public Without losing my public in Brazil My public? "Sem perder o meu público no Brasil"
(Without losing my audience in Brazil) It's not "My public", it's "my audience" The same way i said "polução" 
and it's "poluição" (pollution) *In Spanish*
I don't speak English that well neither But I speak spanish a little because now I have songs in spanish and I have to do some interviews in Spanish as well Suddenly Anitta will have to come here to talk with Damon and Jo Anitta, if you're watching, come to Los Angeles Maybe she lives here already We can make a video in English, Spanish, Portuguese...

We are here with our favorite TV Show Ok, that's not a TV Show Music group They're Jackson 6 We are fans too everybody And we are looking for our next TV Show Or next favorite thing In Brazil So it came up to us: Novelas! (Soap Opera) Look, I didn't even Ok, I knew there were Novelas But more like... Hispano Hablantes Hispanas? Like in Spain I didn't know this came from Brazil There are many Novelas that are as great 
and goes on spanish channels here We tweeted Did you hear that? This time you twitted us some novelas But most of them said Avenida Brasil! You guys said it! If it's outdated it's because you're old First moments of Avenida Brasil Intense music This guy is so famous What was that? Oh my god! Motherfucker! Get em! Get em! Like, maybe that's not the best song For you to... Lipstick? There's like broccoli You should have a friend that tell you

- Nobody does anything This guy is in all the Novelas
 If you are watching one, he's in it. Ok You guys, this novela. I'll drive you to the hospital Apologize! There are a hundred thousand 
things happening in the same... But I think these are only the first clips So it's kind of like... It's not the whole novela, 
it's the most dramatic moments - Oh, that's why
- That's why my blood pressure is really high Oh, this pretty face Actress of the year Why did she leave? They're dating ♪ They're dating, they're dating ♪ That's right. And we will be engaged Engaged? I like this in portuguese I feel like I can express 
a lot of english and portuguese You can do it like this It's like "Noivo?" (Engaged) What is this?

My mom screaming at me to clean my room Shut up Joanna! Go clean your room! They're on her side now, can't you see it? I've never seen brazilians screaming like this They're always in a good mood Because you never grew up in a Brazilian house With a brazilian mom Eat rice and beans! My mom Love you mom! Vagabunda! - Vagabunda is a slut
- Because in english "vagabond" is someone who travels It's not the same thing We're not vagabundos That's right, I'm vagabundo It's like, the translation that doesn't work It doesn't Ok, next video Let's skip to episode 9 I know, renting an apartment 
on the internet is complicated, right? The pictures are really better than reality But here is different. You'll see Let's start by the afternoon sun, look at this It's all renovated.

An american would be like Oh, it's just a water bottle Brazilian This water bottle will fill you for the rest of your life You'll never have to drink water from another water bottle Because this water This water will fill you with water It's specially watery A water Why everybody? I'm like this as well Damon be like "Shut it girl" There's not such thing in the US Actually, it does There are "soaps" Soap Opera Yes But it's not produced in the same way, 
doesn't have the same sense I have another thing to say When I was in Cuba Em cuba, na cuba 
(Portuguese prepositions) When I was taking a walk Cuba When I went Cuba So, em cuba Na cuba English to portuguese Em cuba I was travelling in cuba and I noticed that all the homemade restaurants were called "Paladar" And I asked 
"Why is it called paladar?" Then my spanish teacher, Pedro Perez He used to say He said that there was brazilian novela
that was so popular in Cuba They decided that in the Cuban system If you have a restaurant in your house It will have to be called a "Paladar" Because in the brazilian novela there was a poor woman Who made a restaurant in her house with three or four tables And she called it "Paladar" Like palate Because everything she cooked tasted good It's good for your palate And now this exists in Cuba because of an brazilian novela All these restaurants are called Paladar? Yes Because every cuban wants to get rich Just like this poor woman who made "Paladar" It made sense I have a question Jo I don't know if I have the answer You'll have Which video do you want to watch next Rita is left in the dumping ground Nina cuts Carminha's hair Max is murdered Oh my god Max is murdered!

[Jo] It doesn't work. Because your bike is too old. So I just bought something that doesn't work ? [Jo] Yes exactly. [Damon] Damo and Jo, is that you ? Hey everybody it's Damon. Hey everybody it's Jo. And it's Damon and Jo. [Damon] Welcome to our house ! [Jo] Imagine. [Damon] Here is our car. [Damon] No but really, our house is here. It's actually here. [Jo] Anywyay...that's true. [Jo] It's like Paris. [Damon] I will be here everyday. [Damon] Eighty yeah ! [Damon] She's watching our video. [Damon] So this is not Paris, but this, is quite parisian. [Jo] It's pretty ! This is called a tropézienne. Honestly... no ok i'm kidding. Of course I ordered the 100% chocolate pie. This is called a tropézienne, Saint-Tropez, not Paris Damon and Jo. It's French. Everything that is French isn't parisian. Like Rihanna. I think it's important to take little breaks to have coffee. Here in the US we have coffee to go, not like this. I love this because it gives me a moment to think about life. One thing I thought was interesting when I was in France. I wanted to eat eggs, and my French friend asked me how I could eat something so salty in the morning. I thought it was interesting because here we're not used to eat sweet things like this, but in France you are. So we were saying that it was too noisy, too sweet. We're literally trespassing. You know I just planned a trip to Paris. And I will stay in New York ! I swear, we pick places where there are nobody, and all of a sudden people start like... They're coming... He lives here, we're tresspassing again. It's his house. [Damon] It's crazy right ? [Jo] Is this how you imagined Los Angeles ? [Damon] And then the tree breaks.
[Jo] We're going to end this. Be careful. It's going to be alright. What were we saying, suddenly everyone comes out. Anyway. Hi! It's ok. We were in this bakery, and the cashier asked if we were dancers. So we said yes. Yes, of course we are. Because in Los Angeles you always say that you are what people want you to be. What you're not. And what you're not. To put yourself in trouble when they present the situation. A casting, and you fail it completely. Like the Friends episode where Joey says he can speak French but he actually can't. Suddenly it's the busiest street in Los Angeles. You wanna go there ? No ! [Damon] Here is ok ! Ok that's it, here we go. Fucking shit, literal shit. Why aren't you coming to Paris with me. Because important people are waiting for me in New York. I have a few lovers to visit... Someone very special. No but really, I know that Paris isn't the only city in France. That, we know. There is la tropézienne, Saint Tropez ! What city in France are you from ? For example I'm going to Paris, I know it's not the only city blabla. But where are you from then ? There are a lot of other cities in france. No but you agree that Paris is the cool place, don't you ? Next video we're going to try and bake croissants. So please comment below the most popular croissant recipes. Please comment below recipes for croissant and other pastries because we're going to cook at home. And you need to do it right now because we're going to do that next French friday. And we're leaving you with this. He started with his machine. This is illegal. Ok now they've got my prints, they're going to find me they're going to say I crashed my car and hid it. I need to go, I need to leave the US and go to France, get a new identity because here it won't work anymore. Can we got the gym please I have too much energy. It's important to support the small dogs- But the small dogs, I don't know like, the little guys, The small guys, the small businesses, they need our help. 
Hello everyone, it's Damon Hey everyone, it's Jo And it's Damon and Jo Welcome to French Friday I don't know if you have already watched this video where we made crêpes Sorry, we're making crêpes in this video I meant the video where we made croissants It's impossible that these are croissants How to make croissants for dummies We don't know We don't make them and I am prepared for another disaster today How to make crêpes I am here at my grandparent's who are in Florida at the moment Since Damon is at his grandparent's and I am home We're going to use the same recipe to make the dough for our crêpes To make crêpes the Damon and Jo style you need... 250g of flour Eggs, specifically 4 a dash of salt 2 tablespoons of sugar 50g of (melted) butter Here in the United States, we like portions to be big We are only going to use half a liter of milk Half a liter of milk, that I totally forgot at home Ok milk All that for some crêpes that are probably gonna end up tasting disgusting Half a liter of milk And well I am making savory crêpes so I got faux meat and cheese I am making crêpes with chocolate Obviously I bought chocolate and strawberries at the supermarket It's cute isn't it? Damn, it's super fancy now I've been coming here since I was 5 Everyone is looking at me here because nobody speaks any other language in this city French doesn't exist here Wow, this is my home What do you think of France? What do you think of French people? Yes Yeah Did you ever eat crêpes? Oh My God It's the pasta section And do you happen to need some bread? Oh god, it keeps going and it's just one brand and it's only the bread section Isn't it mom? It's the bread section There are only 20,000 citizens here It's a lot of food for a little town It's just that I don't understand why there are so many products in here but there is no vegetarian meat right mom? yes Exactly! This is the United States there's only meat I need some chocolate that melts Chocolate, chocolate I'm gonna buy it and we'll see A day in the supermarket for me... nothing but chocolate My mom in this video Me in this video um mom, I think we have reached the maximum number of articles There is no maximum and after all of this, there is even a McDonalds Even the bag is free I am more European because I hate when we waste plastic It's minus 6 Degrees here Damn, it's hot! You're meeting me there? Ok! I live so deeply in the countryside that some people come here riding their horses The Amish but in French, the Amish? Yes Ok so on the other side of the street there is another shop called Myer It's as big as Walmart but here there is faux meat Hello? Hello? I don't know how people can live in the countryside like that Okay! Let's start! Let's start! Let's go! 50g of melted butter 4 tablespoons! Damn! It's like that right? I hope that's what i'm supposed to be doing I love cooking especially when there's nothing for me to do Except changing my hair a thousand times like a true chocolate lover pshh like chocolate lover?! no like a... like a true chocolate fan It's extremely important to know how to melt it It's something I learnt from my grandmother The most important thing here is not to burn the chocolate Holy sh*t! This looks so good Put the flour in the mixing bowl with the salt and the sugar Put the flour in the mixing bowl I am lightly whisking the eggs okay! kind of toxic You know what? I would never have imagined me in the kitchen cooking things like that because you see what happens hey that's not bad! I prefer putting my hands in it Damon, are you doing alright? Half a liter of milk How much is half a liter? I don't think that's ok Ok I don't eat crêpes very often so I don't know how it's supposed to look like It's a soup! Step 2: when all the milk has been mixed The dough has to be pretty runny We are going to do a little American improvisation Yeah, you have seen in our previous videos that me in the kitchen results in something pretty shocking This time around, I think it will end up being what you expected of me A joke! Damon and I, we bought these things to make crêpes I have lost them When the edge of the crêpe changes to a light orange color it's time to flip it, leave it cooking for about 2 minutes and the crêpe is done ahhh I'm scared Omg it's terrible Darn it! You take me for a fool who doesn't even know how to make crêpes They always do that don't they? um nothing's going on here just a crêpe trying to be a crêpe Okay, I'm not touching it ohh doesn't matter no good! Stay with me, I'll try it again oh no! Oh shoot! Now we're talking now we close it Did I just make my first crêpe?! ok, excuse me Seriously! You should be proud of me! I started making disgusting quiches and disgusting croissants and now I am making a normal crêpe Impressive Damon! A crêpe made by an American Jojo, she knows how to make them crêpes This is my crêpe No taste and super greasy It's so good Here is the final result all the good ingredients are in there um ok It's not that it's not good ok, vote in the poll above which crêpe you'd prefer eating mine or Jo's Leave a comment below Did you ever make your own crêpes?

- I don't have vocal
chords anymore, you guys. Did I say vocal core? I don't know, let's replay that. I don't have vocal
chords anymore, you guys. Okay, so I did say vocal chords. My vocal chords are a
little shot right now, which is actually, I'm kind
of proud of it, to be honest. (clears throat) Your boy was out 'til seven! Okay, I was drinking a little
bit, but like, whatever. I just turned 21 (laughs). (ominous music) Damn it! The one coffee shop I wanted
to go to this morning, closed! Alright, well, time to
go to the next stop. (snorts) Yeah, right. (clears throat) Too close, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Didn't sign up for that this morning. Jo and I have been raving
about Montreal for years. I think this is my fifth
time coming to Montreal. Here are the reasons why. Number one, everyone speaks
perfect French and English. In fact, when you walk into a store, they'll ask you, "Hi, bonjour. "Salut, bonjour." Okay, what do they ask you again? Number two, because there's
a French influence way back in the day, it feels like a
European city in North America. Number three, it's a college town. There are so many universities here. Some that speak only French,
some that speak English, and I think some that speak both. Clearly I'm an expert. Number four, I have not (clears throat). Number four, I have not been
to a more beautiful city than Montreal in the fall. I mean, look. Just ignore that. Ew, and that. And this. Okay, technically it's
not fall yet, but really, Mount Royal, the big ass
mountain here, gorgeous! Number whatever this one is. It's a big city but it also
feels like a medium, small city. You can get around everywhere
with your bike, which, I think I'm in, are these for bikes? The next number, these little alleyways are filled with street art. I mean, look at this. Because it's a young city
with lots of students, there are a lot of coffee shops. That is actually a good
thing for Jo and I, because we're always editing videos. We put up three videos a week. We got a lot to do, which is where I'm trying to go right now. Please leave a comment below, what are your favorite
things about Montreal? Again, Jo and I could go on
and on and on and on and on. Hello (laughs). And on and on and on. Montreal feels very much like Berlin, where there have been
people walking in this door, and I don't know what's behind this door, and I'm not about to go find out. Alright, onto the next
coffee shop (snorts). Okay, I gotta really stop doing that. (dramatic ominous music) Okay, I'm feeling good. I just put the video up. You know, three videos a
week, that's hard to do. Here in Montreal, I
have about two friends, so we're gonna go see what
one of them are doing. (speaking foreign language) Hope that sounded good. (speaking foreign language) Why are you watching this video, acting like you don't
replay your voice notes? You know you listen to it too. Or do you? You do. (upbeat music) So, I missed my stop on the bus, and I'm now I'm 20 minutes away. See, this is what happens
when I don't take my Maserati. (speaking foreign language) (funky French music) Alright, time to turn on
the camera personalities. (mumbling) is trying to
argue about Vancouver. You know, I brought these blue
chips as a social experiment to see how you guys would
respond, and you guys are failing. - Why? - Because nobody is
eating the food I brought, which is healthy, nutritious food. You liked the sriracha hummus. Oh, and now (laughs),
now he starts trying it. (funky French music) (speaking foreign language) (laughter) Well, if you're looking at it, then it won't get stolen, right? Wait, is it really gonna get stolen? (speaking foreign language) (dramatic French music) (laughter and chatter) (cheering) Hold on, everybody! (laughs) Ruining the game right now. Okay! Whoa, disaster. Montreal and I are over. My time here is coming to an end, because I'm leaving for Iceland. I still can't believe I'm
getting on a flight to Iceland. It was only 100, okay, maybe it was $200, but Jo's flight was only
140 to Iceland, everybody. You may be at home thinking, like, "Oh, I wish I had the money
to go do what they're doing." I was staying in a hostel
here, an eight bed hostel. It was $18 a night. 18 times five nights, that comes out to... And I was in AP Calculus. Xavier is a friend that I met in New York 'cause he was traveling in New York. The more you travel, the
more people you meet, the more connections you
have around the world, and the more those people can
hook you up in their cities. Thank you for watching this video. Thank you for watching all of our videos. We'll have many more videos
in Iceland, Paris, Morocco, and in London, and then
back in Los Angeles, so please subscribe,
leave a comment below. What do you love about Montreal? I'll leave about 500 comments down below. And that's it, see you later. Wow, Montreal. What a beautiful city. And what a beautiful poop turd

Okay We have to- 
Haha What up? It's Damon. It's Jo. And it's Damon and Jo. And... Kingsley! Kingsley's here with us to kick off our 12 collabs of Christmas which means every single day until Christmas, we're going to have a new collab video. On my channel we did this video quizzing them about pop culture in 2017 since they travel so much and don't know what's going on. How do you feel about 2017 in general? It was bleak. Because 2017 was a pretty grim and bleak and "blum" year We're gonna head to the driving range to drive those worries away (singing) we're going to drive it away (imitating Cranes in the Sky by Solange) But all of these negative moments are gonna be knocked the hell out of my life You can do it, Kingsley. This is to all the airlines that charge me $25 for a carry-on like I didn't just spend $500 on a ticket. That's the truth. This one goes out to its student loan debt. How student loan debt? (jokingly imitating Monster by Nicki Minaj) $50,000 to a verse no money Debt be gone. I'd like to dedicate this one to all those times that iCloud doesn't sync from your iPhone to your Mac. This it's for whoever decided to let Arby's purchase Buffalo Wild Wings. Oh! He mad about that one. Apple's new update that ruined everybody's phone. Mhmm! When American baristas don't know the difference between a cappuccino and a flat white I want a flat white! Nobody served this man a cappuccino This is for mother nature because that bitch has been out of control in 2017. Hurricanes, tsunamis, earthquakes fires...who hurt you?! You know...mother nature wins on this one. This one goes out to interest rates that are compounded daily. I want to dedicate this one to all those colleges and universities out there who think it's okay to ask for a donation when your $50,000 in debt. Give me my money! Yes. Pennywise You pasty, big foreheaded ass clown You did not have to buy Georgie's arm off like that. You had an entire town full of teenagers and shit And you went with the infant Fuck you. They all float down there. This next one goes out to everybody who faces increasingly severe back and neck pain because of our digital age. I'm going to stretch it before this one. Oof. Look at the form! This one goes out to all those people trying to create beef between Cardi B and Nicki Minaj all the time. They are two legitimate artists in their own lanes. (singing Bodak Yellow) If you wanted to Oh! Zamn! This is for all the cashiers at the grocery store who didn't give my my discount just because I forgot my rewards card. Y'all know my face. That's right. This one goes out to non-refundable tickets. like why y'all acting like we all know what's happening the next day of our lives. I'll always know! Give me my money back! This one goes out to paying 200 dollars monthly for a health insurance plan and you still have a 7,000 dollar deductible. I want your European healthcare and I want it now! This is for Nazis, sexual predators, white supremacists, Tomi Lahren, Donald Trump Sara Huckabee Sanders and everything that comes out of her mouth, the whole administration Long distance relationships being really hard. Passports and the fact that if you're not born in a certain country, you can't go everywhere and that's unfair! Visas being unnecessarily expensive and constricting. When your hair randomly decides to be a different texture When you take a picture with all your friends And you're the only one that ends up looking so frumpy and nobody cares because they all look good When acne cream doesn't even work! We're gonna get antiperspirant, and you don't even anti-perspire. When you put on chapstick and five minutes later, your lips is crusty When you're in the drive thru, you got a 12 piece nugget, a large fry and some extra nuggets and you ask for some extra sauce and they act like the one packet they put in there is gonna be enough for you and like you just asked them give you a room in their house rent-free Incorrect password. Incorrect password. Incorrect password. When you dial zero for the operator and there's no operator When the seatbelt sign is on and you have to pee. When you accidentally tap an ad and it opens. That Sunday feeling before work. Oh my god. I thought I hit a car. You know, I came in here today and 2017 was just weighing me down and now I feel so liberated. I feel like I'm just ready for next year. You know I feel like you've gotten out of my system, and it just feels really good You know I came in here to this golf driving range thinking that I had a good 2017. Then when I get up there I realized this year has been really hard The end of the year is always such a painful time for people because you know you feel like you've lost something but today. Today I gained something. I gained control of my 2018 by knocking all the negativity out of the park. Knock it out of  twenty every-teen. I thought I was bad I can't stand you ! Joanna Franco! (laughing) This is for Pennywise You pasty, big ass forehead ass...wait. (laughing) It needs to disappear. Dis-apparate. Condense. What's the...what are the the? Condensation. Evaporate into the cumulus clouds that will then be driven through my airplane of life and positivity. Oh my god. Get stuck there. Get constipated up there and don't precipitate. Yup.

everyone is David he's telling it's a minute drop so Christine's all about books pop culture and books how many hours a day do you spend reading not every day like I spend hours they spend at least in at work you always get one question where's the favorite place to travel was that the questions and there are some that stick out to you here the ones that stick out so this book was translated in so many languages interesting me enough I cannot get through the portrait to make it even juicier a lover gave it to me book is about it's like a fiction it's a man who keeps having a recurring dream and he's I don't know points when people see like shit seems like they all confirm he needs to follow this dream to go to the interview here means he goes there he fails which reminds me of our personal engineering the ultimate goal is the process and that's where the beauty lives what changed my perspective was the whole like shit goes wrong wait so it's not about it I read this book four years ago and I just know that it's gonna be one that chain I'm sorry in the deepest moment of my I realized that I was so unhappy living in New York and this was the one that changed it and the art of nonconformity okay the reason I like this book is that it made me realize that my life is my life it's not a go is not your life you start strong yeah you don't have to live the life the way other people expect you to and this was like that one book that sparked that first of all people always tell us like oh why don't you just save up money and travel when you're retired you're taking time and acting like it's gonna last forever oh well when you're 30 or you guys still gonna travel things will be different when you're married like people that's what this book did for me and made me realize like door I'm calling the shots here and you are - [Music] when I was 16 and it completely just made me realize that I've just been taking everything everyone says as real as the only truth and it just was kind of like a zoom out for me like when you're a kid you're respective to my oh your parents know so everything they tell you so excited yeah there's a murder in the loot they leave like all these clues to solve The DaVinci Code women security do you read out and lots - I can do if you're going through an existential crisis and your concern type what would you do if money were no object and only in the present is like where you live so this book is talking about religion and how it became less common for people to be religious after the Industrial Revolution because there were so many more scientific explanations for things but then if you remove religion people get insecure and when people get scared and anxious they start buying things like if we just embrace the ambiguous and the fact that maybe there is no purpose of it all maybe just maybe we can be happy in the present like we said about time what time the only way to get to the future is through the present why waste the present worrying about the future okay look you can find inner peace I read this one on the New York City Subway not a cheesy one it's more intellectual if you like we may feel anxiety upon entering a room full of people or a crowded train carriage or even joining a small gathering for lunch what we fear the emotions that people can arouse in us this is me like in the New York City Subway like it's not that you're anxious about giving a speech is that you're anxious about going up there and other people seeing people's reactions not reacting to you and that's what you're afraid of so you can go into a room and be fully comfortable with who you are then you would miss reactions regardless of actions because you're so comfortable with yourself you're just really afraid of embarrassing yourself create your own emotion and I'm afraid of actually giving the speech you're afraid of what you might do to Americans of look that's only this much in the book so far it's probably like the biggest computer dream but it's also like super embarrassing I won't let myself in backups right but you're just gonna stop when you see that it's red it changed everything her bag is still just recently but a big part of why like me such the impact on me was that I had never read a book with a female my age she was in high school she was going through like boy travels and it also brought me to youtube this is what pays a check brought me to where I am today everyone's like really Twilight like that piece of shit I love making some point I can make fun it very well because I know it so we're listing all of the books in the description box below you become a blow what were the books that changed your life that have the most impact on you and why if you want to get deep in the comments I'm trying to read books down in the comments also we've thrown the video over on Christine's channel yeah we're talking about reading from planes but today we're gonna talk about our favorite books of all time our favorite no one but our lighting change really when you read more than one at lunch like nachos calm weird about the person presenting they're cleaning up Avengers look Joe you want to sit here just announced here's one more time so you might rely too much on your public rolling so yeah I'm I need to define who you are and I don't know what the rest of chapter said 
Hey it's Damon and it's Jo and it's Damon, and it's Jo and it's Damon, and it's Jo and it's Jo, and it's Damon But it's not Jo and Damon because then there are two vowels then it'd be Joand Damon Especially in French cuz there's the liaison DamonNAND Jo Joanna Her name's Joanne My name's Joanna actually but What we're about to do in this video is revise Jo's little notebook from studying abroad from the year 1970... "1980" The exact joke we made in the last video Damon's notebook from 1970 We're up here on the roof, which is illegal It's illegal here Everything in the United States is illegal You're gonna take the easy way!? Yeah Do we go? or Do we not go? The door has an alarm There's no alarm? Damon? Hey guys The most dangerous stairs in the world This is what it's all about! Life! and death! Lemme not make jokes while I'm still on this thing I'm RIGHT here. It's beautiful! We're a bit French in that aspect We're gonna do what we wanna do We even drank up here one time We smoked up here! No, no. We made love Here? Yeah! Together! Me, I have. You haven't. Naaaaaan Yes, actually No. No, I've never done that. We're going to...stop for the helicopter 5 Minutes Later 1 Hour Later ...after the first five minutes He's coming back? He's coming down Here? Here!!! Two Hours Later ...the first hour after the five minutes wait this is complicated Imagine if our landlord hired a helicopter to do rounds to make sure no one is up here Are there cameras? Nope, I already checked Look at the smog It's good air He's leaving, after all that. Yeah, he's leaving Jo THE joke of 2017 So I found my notebook of words that I learned words and expressions that I learned during my four months in Paris for my exchange We're going to do a test to see if she remembers any of these words First word: maîtriser learning Why do you pronounce it like that? It's "d'apprendRE" I'm a gangsta To perfect/improve and I didn't do that I haven't seen or read this notebook And trust me, you don't want to "That pisses me off" (Not the right word) Shoes? And here you wrote something about the Modern Temple Hotel Who were you there with? Right next to Pigalle! (where the prostitutes are) I know this one Your little bracelets and hair Stop "taquiner"ing me Wait did you just fart No it was this You wrote this "Se Moquer" - learn to conjugate like learn how to form the verb My French teacher Orphanage Orifice? To brake Gimme a sentence with the plus-que-parfait (grammar tense) This one will be hard Before eating my breakfast I already ate I had already eaten another breakfast I hooked up Did you pécho? Oh ça va! It's fiiiine. You dirty That page was really dirty Even if you're not going to repeat the words, you have to know them Yeah and that's why we did a class on dirty words We learned words like And that's why I love French To turn off *thinks it's "attendre"* To turn off What's that sound mean? A subscription Like subscribers who are going to subscribe to our YT channel Yes, for example! You must subscribe to the DamonAndJo channel Now we gotta go cuz there are like people up here It's illegal. There are helicopters all the sirens looking for us See ya next time and remember we'll be in Paris the first week of October, which is my birthday Happy Birthday to you! Sing it to me! Happy Birthday to you! Sing it to me now You're a big old oldie Happy birthday to you See you in Paris Bye bye! I imagine that before death you'll hear a sound like that Ding! It's your time. You've been eliminated. We're going to do something important I say that in every video Everything we do is important really Yes...very important Because life is important and if you aren't doing things that aren't important, what are you doing with your life! There are just criminals and police sirens here We live in a very safe neighborhood The worst is yet to come I wrote that? That's good! "Avenir" means "future" in French which is literally "à" (to) and "venir" (come) so it's literally "what's going to come" And then you have "demain" (tomorrow) cuz it's like you're going to have tomorrow in your hand ("main") I don't know... Or like "two hands" which present you tomorrow, the day Makes total sense to me Logic You dumb 
(clacking) (upbeat rock music) (record scratch) - London, man, (blows lips) wow. Moving to London, I mean this is something
I've wanted to do forever, I think even before New
York, even before Paris, even before Los Angeles,
London's been on the list. Why am I not living here? I think back to when I was a kid, when I liked the Spice Girls. I think back to when I
was in middle school, and I had a Union Jack phone case. I think back to my studio
apartment in New York, where I hung a British flag. I think back to the time
that I was taking a DNA test and it told me I'm 54% British. So, I'm just asking myself, "When will be the right
time to move to London?" There's never a right
time, just shut up and go. (record scratch)
(child yelling) God, British kids yelling too loud. - [Children] He's cheating! I don't care! - Whatever, why you cryin' so much. But, do you know what, I got something good going
in Los Angeles right now. And no, we're not getting married! (many pops) See, that's what I should
be doing, actually. (upbeat music) Dammit, am I trespassing again? But, right, I am on a solo trip to London, a week long solo trip. Here's the thing about me and London, I've been here many times, so I've done everything
from Big Ben to Shoreditch, this time, though, I'm switching it up, I'm doing a lot of new
things, like the following. Notting Hill, Portobello Road, Kensington Gardens, Kyoto Gardens. All right, the time has come, if I'm really gonna be British, I need to learn to start liking tea. But first let me look at the menu. (bright piano music) Um, could I just get a table? - For one? - Here, 'cause this is pretty. (bright piano music) I had to move, y'all
know I need the airflow. And this waitress is
givin' me some attitude. (cymbals) I have a question, we have
all these contraptions. - [Waitress] Should I do it? - [Damon] Yes, yes, you do it for me. I'm only 54% British. - [Waitress] There, in it. - Ah, I knew that, I
knew all that, thank you. I had already forgot and I'd been pouring
it directly like this. I hope she's not watching. (clacking) Uh, could I get a flat white? Well, if I'm gonna be British, I gotta find a British gym. This one's okay, dammit. (upbeat electronic music) So you're saying I'm 12 years old? - [Man] Not mental age, your physical age, but a metabolic age. - [Damon] So I have the body of a 12 year old boy, basically. (chill electronic music) Well, if I'm gonna be British, I guess I gotta take this bad boy. (chill electronic music) This is not the right way. And if I really want to be British, I need to meet someone British. Any takers? (cheerful piano music) First day here I went to Joe
and the Juice, I met Asante. - My name's Asante, I'm 23
years old, I'm from (laughs) Is that good? - She says, "Oh, you're from LA," I say, "Oh you're from London," she says, "What are you doing here?" I said, "You tell me," she said, "Oh, well come
to the barbecue on Sunday," and boom, barbecue. So, I have to walk home
every night through the park, which is beautiful during the day, but not beautiful when
you get mugged at night. Here's a clip I filmed last night I don't know how nobody wrote
about this in the reviews. Actually I do know, because
ain't nobody partying like me! Oh my god, okay, it's scary. (clacking) (quiet background conversation) Good morning, it's Damon here
in my 13 bed hostel dorm. This place has done me well. I've been here for, what, five nights? Only three more to go, dammit. No, but it's about 5
p.m. and I just woke up, no, just kidding, it's 10 a.m., we're gonna go get the
day started, let's do it. Sayonara, that's my bed. (somber electronic music) I told you no! Last time this happened, he jumped on me, ran up my body, and I've had a
fear of squirrels ever since. Bitch. So, I'm walking to the Tube station, and I've had this song stuck
in my head ever since I woke up (clears throat) ♫ Ask
Lil Wayne, ask Lil Wayne ♫ who the five star bitch is. (upbeat rap music) Hope you're having a good day like I am. You know, if you ever
wondered back at home like if vlogging in public in foreign countries is
awkward or embarrassing, it is. ♫ Ask Lil Wayne who
the five star bitch is. (upbeat rap music) All right, next up, I figure
if I'm about to move to London, I need to know more about
the history of London and there's a lot of it. - Trafalgar Square is
not named after a king. - Pause the tour. We went the whole tour both thinking like, "Wait, what's, what's her
name, what's his name?" - Three hour tour, three hours. - I had to turn the camera on Olivia because she started talking about the ideal person that watches our channel. (bell ringing) - So for about like six months, my friend and I were
planning this awesome trip, it was gonna be two months
in Europe after graduation, and then the week we were
gonna buy tickets, got a text, - What'd it say? - Worse than a breakup text. Her parents were more comfortable with her going on an organized tour instead of just two gals roamin' Europe. But, not how I wanted to travel, so I started planning
my six week solo tour. (whoops) - Your parents, what'd your parents say? - Yeah, I thought that they would be like, "Hell, no, Olivia, like
you're not doin' that." - But they just want you to
be happy in the long run. - But, they want-- they were proud of me, that I was going outside my comfort zone and pushing myself to travel the world. - Why are you trying to edge
out of the freaking camera? - I don't know! - She's like, "And so, and my." - Do you want me to cuddle with you? - So now what, you're here in, you're here, by yourself, solo. - I'm here by myself.
- Week two. - You know I've been
meeting awesome people in hostels and on tours, meet
really cool people, but-- - Who? It's like, what's your name again? (silly piano music) (clears throat)
Ooh. (crashing)
Oh my god, every time. Okay. And finally I figured if I'm
really trying to be Bitish, why can't I pronounce that right, I even pronounced it wrong last time. If I'm really trying to
bre Bitish, be British, and finally I figured if I'm
really trying to be British, I need to end the video in
a classic red phone booth. Which smells like pee. No, but London, I love you. Honestly, like if I move from Los Angeles, which I will, one day, and then maybe move back to Los Angeles, if I move from Los Angeles, I will most move to London, I gotta see what it's like here. So, if you're from London,
or if you've been to London, please leave a comment
below how much you love it. I actually wrote a daily London diary blog over on our travel blog,
Shut Up and Go dot travel, and again, if you like our videos, we're trying to hit one
milli, so please subscribe. So, anyways, that is a wrap. I'm outta London, but I'll
be back very soon. Damon out. Next, ow. I'm gonna leave that to Jo. You can hear everything that I'm-- every word that is coming out of my mouth, - Every word that is
coming out of your mouth. - Every time I go to a cash register, I literally just go
like this, here you go. It doesn't work
- [Olivia] No. Yeah, I guess I gotta use my iPhone. I actually filmed my phone because I thought it was impressive that I walked this many
steps and 26 yesterday, then Olivia pulls up hers. Thirty one thousand,
thirty five thousand, okay. - [Man] Thank you.
- Yep. I think they just asked
me to join their team. Guys, I finally found out how Olivia gets all of her steps in. "Update, followed my
maps and got to an area where there are literally no
restaurants, hashtag thriving." That's what happens when you
ain't with Damon Dominique. 
Imma be real with y'all We just filmed an entire thing which was pretty good and the whole thing wasn't even on Wasn't working Jo: Anyways! What's up everybody?
Damon: What up it's Damon It's Jo. And it's Damon and Jo And we're here in Paris We are co-ordinating a meet up. We ain't got no permission No authorization to be in this park. But we about to see who showed up D: Do you think we're really gonna get kicked out of this park right now? J: There's a likely chance 'cause we decided to do it in front of a government building That was my baaaad Do you know where we're going ? Because I don't know the adress. You're the one who planned it all. The moment when you're late for your own meet up. Damn it! And you don't even know where it is Here's the thing with these meet ups, we never know how many of you are actually gonna show up This is about you meeting each other. This is not about us, like you may come thinking that you're here to see us-- No! Let's go and find the spot, Jo. I think it's right here Hello, good evening everybody ! Look how beautiful! [Damon] Oh people are already here ! [Jo] Aww, guys. [Jo] Hi ! How are you ? [Girl] I'm good, how about you ? [Jo] I'm great ! *greeting everyone in French* I love how they're coming from nowhere Oh my god, I love this Everyone looks so cool too! Jo: I just love how it's like 'oh my god! there you guys are!'' Look at you cuties! American Are you French ? French. [Girl] French and Brazilian ! [Jo] French and Brazilian, cool ! English, and polish ! How cool ! We're making a vlog ! This is Paris ! Jo: Lost my voice already D: What up everybody, this is a beautiful moment We did an international cultural picnic When we were studying abroad, this is exactly what we were looking for and it didn't actually exist I know! That's why I'm so happy that everyone's here meeting each other They're like all staring
[laughter] There are French people and international people And like, when did you ever think we would all get along so well [Government person] It was not authorized, you need to get an anthorization and we control it. [Damon] Sorry, we're just here for a week and we wanted to meet everyone. [Government person] Yeah, we watched it. [Damon] That's me ! It's actually a good video, you should watch it ! [Government person] We did our reasearch. [Jo] It's okay, you need to watch our channel, you're gonna like it, it's about the mix of cultures. [Damon] We're American but we speak French, it's a travel channel. [Jo] Ok we're picking everything up. Okay, everybody. So it's true, we did get (cough) kicked out They caught us, that's okay, we had a backup location - Ok, Paris prefecture, if you're watching this, it's okay, everyone's here.
- Désolée ! [Damon] Like, alright, it's okay. [Jo] Best lighting for the photo op [Damon] Jo, can you get the key? [Jo] Yeah, just hold on one second There it is. Leave it to us to put the key under the mat [Damon] Anybody wanna come in 'cause the key's just under the mat, what? [Jo] If you missed the meet up, you know where to find us [Damon] Oh my gosh, how tired are you right now? [Jo] On a scale from 1 to 10, I'm "crevée" (I'm dead/beat) [Damon] I will literally keep this door open 'cause my arm is too tired to close a door right now. It was really fun That was so good When Jo loses her voice I'm yawning, can't I yawn ? And this is the  irony, the Paris prefecture kicks us out of the park ! We make videos in French every week. 
So Dear Jo... Honey, you're 25 years old Don't be ashamed! Like, 25 years old There is no sexier age than 25 years Yes, you got some white hair Yes, you still have to shave your legs Yes, you got some dark circles under your eyes because you never sleep! But you have 25 years old of experience And you have to be proud of that! It's time to contemplate your life These 25 years All the experiences All the mistakes All the regrets No You don't have any regrets! Ok. Maybe that ex But let's forget about him Ok, here we go First lesson
*OLDER JO
Somewhere in the middle of Connecticut - USA Girl, don't drink cow milk It's not going to work Your stomach is not going to like you You're not going to like your stomach No one needs this! Because no one will want to smell you It's not a gross thing Moving on Lesson #2 You know how you like to tell stories You like to remember things in life Don't stop It's good that you keep writing in your little notebooks. Because someday you'll get really sad, really happy and really excited just from reading your own stories. And memories from your own life And you'll always have a story to tell Lesson #3 Let's talk about love Important topic in your life You know what you already know And when you already know, you stop it When you don't know yet, you know you don't know It's complicated but you'll know what to do For example, you'll have several relationships that will last several years. 3 years, 4 years, 5 years Oh my god And maybe you won't know when to stop But really, you know it And if you get that little feeling inside you Stop it. Because you know what you already know. You know? This next one you're really going to try to change but you'll not succeed It's fine You'll never going to like to wake up early Never, never, never You'll turn into a monster and will have to wake up early Advices Coffee, chocolate and some music to take a step faster Next lesson
Lesson #5 Joaninha, I know you love the family concept But you also love to travel You left Brazil when you were 5 years old Of course you grew up away from your family But this never got easier and will never get easier You'll miss seeing your father, your grandmother Going to your aunt's house on a Sunday and having some coffee This is normal It's going to be a big part of you You'll never stop missing your family But the good thing is You're really going to appreciate the time you spent together Because it's not everyday Ok, I know that you think it's very important to have straight hair But it isn't. And it's not good for you. And it will all get very fried, so stop straightening your hair girl You hair is beautiful, wonderful and perfect It smells good, it's big Curly Just because society thinks that women with straight hair are prettier This is not true, curly hair is also beautiful You're going to stop But maybe don't wait until your mother in France argue with you because you burned out the light After using your international hair dryer? And yes, whenever you wear shorts there's going to be a situation about your thighs Because they're thick And that's ok Just because the little girls in Connecticut Have those thin little thighs Doesn't mean you that you also have to have thin thighs Your body is different and everything it's going to be fine One day everyone is going to even write rap songs about your thighs! So be happy girl. And to "wrap" things up Exactly And to wrap things up You'll always have this terrible accent speaking portuguese Because you'll never be 100% brazilian You'll never be 100% american You'll never be 100% anything Keep in mind that this is a great thing. You can be part of any culture And even if you read those comments that say that you no longer speaks portuguese That you have a terrible accent These people will never know about your ridiculously good english level Because you grew up speaking english, not portuguese But it's okay, because you'll never be considered American And also, of course Brazilians don't think you're brazilian This is a big part of you In a nutshell, everything is going to be fine Don't worry Yes, sometimes it's going to be difficult Yes, sometimes no one is going to understand you But everything will be alright Have confidence in that A big kiss I adore you A lot - Jo. I tried in this video, I don't know if it worked Do you understand? Do you know what I mean? Do you know? 
- Sounds like Paris. These silly little
buttons you have to press to exit French buildings. And again. I don't think it has ever
been this hard to find one boulangerie in Paris. I'll just get a kabob. Let me ask somebody. (speaking in French) Totally just used tu when
I should have used vou. Whoops. (speaking in French) The best part of my day. So good. - Sounds like New York. A bright, sunny day in Harlem. And yeah, we're about to jaywalk. Can I do cracked pepper
mill turkey and cheese? All right, so here's the
deal, ladies and gentlemen. We have some big news. It's a big day. - This one's a pretty big announcement. - So, it all started one day
when we wanted to write a book. - We have this travel blog
where we post two blogs, kind of, every week. - I enjoy writing. I've journaled since I was a child. Anyways. - We wrote a book called #Woke. - The only self-help book
you will read in 12 minutes. Or maybe it'll take you 12 hours. The point is that you can take
as much time as you desire. - You might go on a juice cleanse if you're trying to cleanse
your body for the day. You might go on a social media cleanse if you feel like you're
too attached to your phone. You might go on a friend cleanse if you feel like your friends are toxic. But wouldn't it be so bad
to go your entire life to then be in a rocking chair
when you're 80 years old and to look back at your
life and be life, damn, I should have lived it that way. That's what this book is all about. - We wrote. - And wrote. - And wrote. - And wrote. - And changed the title 30 times. Disagreed on the chapters. Changed our mind about the
entire theme of the book. Told our designer to change
the design several times, because we suck at writing a book clearly. Before clicking publish on this book, I promise you I found atrocious typos. There are probably still
typos in it right now. We each wrote six chapters. And then, and then,
the ebook was complete. - This book is a life cleanse. You start it at 8 AM,
you read one chapter. 9 AM, you read the next chapter. 10 AM, you read the next chapter. And it lasts for 12 hours. That would happen. When I'm on the best spiel of the video. One second. Where was I? Creating something from
scratch takes work, which is why we had 1000 questions. - We pondered, would people
even like this ebook? - Does the format of the book need to be vertical or horizontal? - Do people even read? - What are the fonts? What are the designs? What are the colors of the ebook? - Do we even read? - Do we sell it on Amazon? Do you sell it on Shopify? Do you sell it-- Do you even sell it? Am I allowed to say Netflix in my chapter? 'Cause I did, and then I took it out. I'm at the pharmacy
everyday here in Paris. - And for the sake of this little preview, I'll be reading some of Damon's chapters, and he'll be reading some of mine. - If I can get through them. Ooh! Just kidding, we've both
edited each other's chapters. Okay. - Welcome to the beginning of 12 hopefully enlightening
hours of your life. These next 12 chapters
are all about getting you to do you. I just clicked "BY." Did you ever realize,
like, it's your life? Wow, this is like my life. We're supposed to spend
eight hours sleeping a night. And some people spend even
more time sleepwalking through each day. We're not trying to shame you. Don't worry. Because we slept-walked
some of our life too. Point is, if you're reading this and you're aware that you're sleepwalking, maybe you can channel
a little bit of change, and start living a little more awake. Maybe you feel as though you've been zombie-ing through life. Like you're seeing other
people living their dream life via Instagram. Do people do that? Yes, they do. Are you mad at it? Maybe. - Chapter Two, Open Your Eyes,
8:30 AM, by Joanna Franco. What are you going to do with
the power of being alive? Are you going to live to
please those around you? I'm only going to be this young right now. So, in ten minutes I'm
already ten minutes older. And it's not to freak you out, it's to get you to be
like, damn, you know what, maybe I should go do that. Maybe I should go surfing tomorrow. Maybe I should go to the lake on Saturday. Maybe I should go to Russia
to see what's in Russia. (car alarm) - You know what that alarm is? You waking the hell up. The last chapter I'll
share with you is: Say Yes. When you don't have much
to share or much to offer, or if you're someone who talks
a lot but doesn't say much, that is boring. I know various people who
like, blahblahblahblahblah. And they don't talk about anything. I cannot surround myself
with this level of stagnant. All I know is that we're
on this Earth right now. If you're watching this video,
you are very much alive. You have the power to control the next few stages of your life. - Another chapter: Say no. Jo and I are really big supporters on being yes men when
there's an opportunity that you're really interested in. You should go and do it. And not be a boring borster. We all tend to load our
schedules with crap. I need to go to work from
this hour to this hour. I'm going to go get drinks. I'm going to do this,
this, this, and this. And before you know it, you're
exhausted at 10 PM at home, and you look back at your day, and you're like that was a good day, but it was only "good," because you kinda filled the time with things you semi-like to do. But what if you were to say
no to one of those things, and spend it on something you enjoy more. I don't want to go the movies. I don't want to go to the
football game on Saturday. I don't want to go to
college, Mom and Dad. It is up to you how you spend your time. So you have to learn to say no to things that you really don't
care about deep down. - Have you ever realized that you literally don't
have to do anything you don't want to do? Point black period. Like at the end of the
day, you control your body, your limbs, your words, you control it. Book number 767, mind bangers. What are they, and how can
you keep them in your life? - We're so pressured by
everybody all the time, even Damon and Jo, we're
telling you to do something. You don't have to do anything that we say. You are the one that makes the decision. And again, we only know
our lives by the way that we all live them. So, the way that I live,
the way that Jo lives, yes it works for us, but
maybe it doesn't work for you. Or maybe it does work for you if you want to live the life that we live. - You gotta do nuthin. - I just remembered my guidance counselors all the time would tell me, well Damon, if you want to travel the world, you need to take this prerequisite, that I did not care about, you need to be the president of this club, that I did not care about, and then if you do these things, you will get to this point where then you could work a nice job to earn you money to then travel with your two weeks off per year. Yeah right! Absolutely not. - At the end of the day, when we travel, it's not just about seeing sexy places or taking Instagram photos,
it's about expanding the mind. Wanted a little Damon and
Jo-prah, you know what I mean? Like, this ebook is exactly where all of those crazy thoughts will live. Those not exactly related to travel, but how can you shut up and go live the best life you've ever
wanted to live?-kind of book. Oh God, no, coffee spillage. Oh! Why did I need to put my coffee
right next to my keyboard? Chapter 13: Why do we put
coffees next to computers? - Hope you liked this video. If you liked anything in this video, you're going to like
the ebook that we wrote. - Click on the description box below and click on the link. I love books. What other ebooks would
you like us to write? And we'll see you next time. - We'll see you in the next video. - Happy vein. Shout out to the happy vein. It only comes out when you're happy, which is a good thing,
but it's not a good thing, because it looks unattractive. We all go 'em. Just like buttholes. - I have a happy vein
too, at certain angles. Sometimes when I'm laying
down next to somebody... no. I told you to stay closed. People can't be seeing my booty cream. - Every moment in your life (car horn) becomes a memory. We picked a theme so that
both of us could understand the body and the movement of the book. Don't forget to read our blogs, because that's a free ebook right there. Every freaking page of the blog is basically what we wrote
in a well-packaged ebook, but it's there for you. Shutupandgo.travel. - Can't even find the ebook. - It's time for me to go. Goodbye.

So Dear Damon... Damon In english, "Damon" In october of 2017 you're 26 years old Yes, 26 years old Sometimes people like to hide their age but... I don't understand why A year older a year, one more year of travel, friends... Ok, friends not really And if it's not like that maybe you are doing something wrong, right? Your age is something that you should be admired by You got more experience, so why are we all hiding our age? I'm 26 years old! Well, starting over Here I am, 26 years old I think you did everything kind of right You're here, you're doing YouTube And you don't live with any regrets How does it say? Arrependimento (regrets) So maybe it's a sign that you are doing everything just right Well, here's what I learned *a couple lessons Alright, first "lesson" - [Jo] Lição Learn portuguese sooner You'll kind of have a career in Brazil You'll get an audience of portuguese speakers You'll get a brazilian audience Get ready for it Come to Brazil! *you stressed out for nothing Damon, listen to me When you were a student you were always stressed For what? To get in a university which you'll not like? The clubs which you were president Which didn't even matter after that year You was so worried about getting the best grades You were right It doesn't matter if you got an A in 11th grade Or if you got a B Because no one is going to ask about it What people is going to ask is about your experiences The stories that make you different from everybody else. *stop cooking Damon, stop cooking. You already know you're not really talented in the kitchen. But you keep trying And you should stop Because it's never going to work You're never going to learn You'll aways set the wrong temperature on the oven Stop it It's better just to order food delivered at home *the goals You know everyone has fitness goals Goals of having a better body But sometimes they're not serious Isn't it bad to always have goals but never achieving them? Yes, it's bad Alright then, if you want to get muscular you got to stop doing cardio Damon You'll have to eat more fake meat And you'll have to do weight training everyday Because you're not brazilian And you're from Indiana Where everyone only eats McDonald's *the family The family topic Sometimes we'll have... other centers of interest other than your family I think it's very interesting that in our society we value our family blood a lot more than The people we spend our days with For example, we'll spend more days with our friends But we'll always say that we are closer to our family Sometimes that's just not true It's true that our family is going to play a special part in our lives But that doesn't mean that will be the closest. *the love The love topic A topic on which we have a lot of stories That we never tell You will have a six-year long-distance relationship And I know it's really hard when your heart says something And your mind says another Which one should you listen to? In your case you should've listened to Your mind It's not like that You lived a... You had a really good relationship But today you are no longer together A six-year long relationship Wich was a long-distance relationship Maybe it should be no longer a relationship When you don't want the same thing I get it, I get it It's really hard to listen to your heart and listen to your mind I know, I know *you already know what it is Do you remember when you were living in New York but you didn't want to live there? This doesn't make much sense, right? We already know what it is Like, you know what you want to do Why are you not doing it? It's really simple If you don't like your job, change jobs. Just like you did when you were a waiter for 3 days In Johnny Rockets 3 days was enough to know that you'd never do that job again *but well... Everything happened as it should've Even without theses lessons that you learned Everything went well, you did a good job Damon That's all, kisses everybody And kisses to young Damon? Or is it weird? I don't know Ok, bye bye! Good 
it's been one year since I was shot in the back I was in a vehicle and it was stopped by men who wanted to rob the car and my uncle kept driving in Brazil and the men thought it would be a good idea to start shooting up the car and we almost came out and scratched until I felt something going to my back and I said I just got shot in the back I've made a video on that but today is more about what it is to have lived a full year after having a near-death experience and I know we're supposed to celebrate on birthdays and New Year's but to me this day represents the knowledge that I now have of how fragile life is I already knew you know I already knew we started this channel because we believe that you should be living your your full potential in your full dream today I think it's really really important to talk about these things because as crappy as it is they're becoming more frequent and these traumas that nobody should have to live with are almost becoming normal I went to several doctors if you're wondering and I went to doctors in Brazil I went to doctors in New York I went to doctors in LA and here's some of the footage that was way faster in the States just saying that zeal romantic West's quizzes you see if he came back you just start pretty much all in place there's nothing that's impinging any good I wouldn't do anything I mean I think it's just gonna probably be there and you know there's heart and the scar is there it's pretty ugly I'm gonna show you there is if you follow us on social media if you follow me on Instagram which you've seen I didn't stop my life didn't end and I wanted to make that very clear that because I almost lost my life now is the time for me to live in more than I've ever lived before and I encourage you to do the same even if you haven't gone through something traumatic especially if you haven't gone through something traumatic take it from me as somebody who has seen some crazy stuff like the explosion come out of a gun directly towards my head and if I hadn't ducked it would have gotten me life is short life is so short today's a reminder for you to live your life to the fullest like we think we have problems right like I'm late to work I got a bad grade on my test like oh my god I have a pimple the end of the world is near and those problems are so small thank you for following the journey thank you for believing and shutting up and going thank you for learning languages thank you for seeing the beauty in the world along with us because even if something is traumatic as me literally getting shot happened I'm still the same person I didn't need a shake I was already living my life but if anything it happened to me so I could share this message along with you to live your lives the way you want to because I didn't wake up that morning thinking that I was going to be shot thinking that it could have all almost ended thinking that all of the relationships that I had would have gone out on a bad term because that day I was fighting with everybody that I loved did I take the good from it the things that I remember are things like when I first pulled up into the hospital nobody was telling me what was going on right all I know is that I walked in limping after having gotten shot and I said somebody help me please no sense of urgency no doctor in the emergency room this nurse who had never met me before didn't know who I was and she where my hand as I was laying down and she said it's gonna be okay and I remember that because to me that speaks so much more than the vicious that had just happened a few minutes before I think about my dad coming over it hugging me almost in a saree way because he didn't know that that was gonna happen and if he had know he would have hugged me like that before we don't know what's gonna happen next so why do we act like it what I also remember is being in the hospital bed and Damon coming and he making a joke saying that everybody who says that damn Street credit they don't have anything on me now and I'm laughing in the hospital bed and Damon's like Joe stop laughing and I said I'm not dead yet I could still laugh and to me that's the most important thing in life is laughter it's happiness it's feeling like you're making memories for yourself because when it's all said and done what are you gonna remember this smartphone that you had or are you gonna remember that time that you were backpacking Europe and had no money and met a stranger who turned into a lifelong friend cuz that's what I remember I don't remember what version of the damn phone I had 10 years ago I don't know I don't care the other day I was speaking and this woman came up to me she said she connected to the shut up and gone motto and she didn't know that I had a near-death experience or anything and she comes up to me and she says that her motto is hurry up and live but she had lost her her husband to cancer and she then realized when she lost her husband she should have hurried up and lived when he was alive and I'm thinking why do we have to wait for trauma to happen to have these wake-up calls this is not permanent the most important takeaways are you are responsible for your happiness if you're miserable you have the power to change it patty fights and simply not speaking to the people you love so dumb it doesn't need to be because of trauma that you have a wake-up call and if anything I'll be the one to take the bullet and I'll take one for the team to let you know that yeah it's very very very very fragile this thing this thing that we're living in don't act like you have tomorrow don't make me promises for tomorrow because I don't know what can happen tomorrow don't make yourself promises for tomorrow that day time slowed down I saw how every second triggers the next series of events that may or may not change your life forever and there's nothing we can do about that there's nothing we can do about it we can't prevent it because again like I said you don't know what's gonna happen tomorrow but what you can do is live your life as happy and as fulfilled as possible get out of the dead-end job are you kidding me if you hate your boss quit life's too short it's not worth it do something that you love because the money will come and I'm saying is that somebody who's done that we moved to LA with a carry-on suitcase 40,000 subscribers and no plan B for a job no matter what happens don't let the fear paralyze you another aftermath of getting shot is realizing how important taking care of our bodies is it's critical if I hadn't been working out my muscles would have been too weak my back I'm also literally lives in harmony with a bullet which is probably a 45 millimeter that is a massive we act like our bodies work for us when we really should work for our bodies there are two separate things you are not your body your body is not you you need to treat your body with respect just like you would a very good friend because you need to get along to get through life so let's consider today a rebirth or a reminder that I almost lost my life today but I did it and for that I'm going to live so hard and I want you to do exactly that make an effort to unite with the people that you care about cuz one day what would always be like that my heart goes out to you anybody who's experienced trauma we're here together we don't need to let it define us as people we should just keep that as a little extra piece of strength I really believe that you find strength in the lowest points of your life and you can panic you can you have the choice to panic and I remember being like panic is so close god I just I just can't hold on to that if I got hold on to my strength so hold on to your strength no will not here panic cuz strength is way more powerful obviously a year later after almost losing my life I'm very thankful to look back and see nothing but beautiful memories I've made really stand up for gun control email your low government and and just demand gun control demand better laws demand harder access to buying bullets like are you kidding me a packet of bullets is less than birth control that's disgusting if anything what you get from this is life's too short and you should shut up and go because you don't have any promises of tomorrow let's continue with the happy stuff right that's all I have for you today we'll see you next time bye think about how lightly we treat the good stuff and how heavily we treat the bad stuff why is that what if we switched it around what if we put the weight on the good stuff and just let the bad stuff fly by that's what we do in our videos bad things happen but the good stuff is so much better we show the bad stuff but we show more of the good stuff because there's just more good stuff to show if you're watching this video you're alive so live 
Good morning everyone Today is travel day I'm not a messy person. But when I'm travelling... This is what happens This is what happens and I can't control it I always pack on the travel day I'm so used to do this It's like working out a muscle I'm here in Los Angeles and tonight I'll be heading to San Francisco To a conference So it's going to be a really quick trip Because I'll only be there for 24h Now it's the season that I pack to unpack and pack again While I'm packing my next bag I'm thinking what I should wear during the next days Because it's easier then And like, are different climates Is really sunny here in Los Angeles It's always raining in San Francisco And I'll be back in New York where is snowing So, how do you do it then? You pack for everything In the smallest bag possible How is this going to fit? I have no idea It's going to work One, two, three and I'm done, you guys It's just like wearing jeans Damon are you ready? Yes I am. Are you really? Yes. Let me see My hair Yeah, you are ready! Let me see your bag Have you packed? Damn! This boy is ready! And you are ready to go to the beach. Not wearing any jeans Ouch, my eye! I'm fine everybody. There's just a stone inside And If you are asking, I brushed my teeth in the shower so I can save time What time is it? Nine. A bit of powder to block the shine (Damon singing). Let's fix this hair a little I don't use a hairbrush, fingers only Hair cream, and that's it - [Damon] What is happening...
- [Jo] The blue lighting It was so yellow before Check it out. Los Angeles, how beautiful. Colors fixed.

Hi everyone, it's Jo and happy French Friday. I'm going to tell you why I speak French, and how it changed my life Because there's a huge story here and I'm going to try to tell you all of it in French today, let's go! My story with French started before I was born and maybe you're asking yourself, why? First thing: I'm not French, I was born in Brazil Everyone in my family is Brazilian My dad, his name is Pierre Franco Like, Francophone, that means someone who speaks French Pierre, that's an obvious French name He's not French at all! And his family isn't French And so, why is his name Pierre Franco? I have no idea. With my mom, it was also bizarre My mom is 100% Brazilian But my mom, her name is Denise she studied French her whole life She studied in "L'Alliance Française" in Brazil and then she started working for La Societe Generale (a French bank). Why? No idea Because no one in the family spoke French So since she was young, she really wanted to speak French Her dream was to study in Paris Between Paris and my Dad, guess what she chose? My daddddd. She got married instead of creating a life in Paris, in France She never went to Paris Well, it was fast, they got married and had three kids I was the youngest of the three When I was five years old, my mom moved us to Bethel, Connecticut in the USA So that was a huge change in my life I started speaking English, because my native language was Portuguese Then, when I began speaking English, I thought "I'm never going to be 100% Brazilian, I'm not going to be 100% American And so, here in the USA when I was 12 I could choose to study either Spanish, or French And all the students told me "Jo, you already speak Portuguese so you should choose Spanish because it'll be so easy!" Portuguese and Spanish are pretty similar and for me, it wasn't fair to choose something JUST because it was easier So at 12, I started studying French in school I hated studying French in school it wasn't for me I prefer just figuring out the language, instead of knowing if its é or è I know that it's important, but it's just to tell you that in school, I wasn't the best student The exams, and tests, and all that I was awful At this time, all the other students stopped learning French because the teachers weren't good I advise you to not stop studying something just because the teacher is bad, because it's a little sad I did the same thing with music because I played the saxophone and the violin and then I stopped because I didn't like the teachers In high school, there was another teacher and all the other students didn't like him because he was really, very, extremely, strict Not cool. But, he loved me why? Because he knew I loved speaking and the other students didn't I don't know if it was easier for me to learn French when I was 12 because my mom used to speak to me as a baby in French Or if it was something in the spirit of my parents In the classroom, my French name was "Cécile"   And like, every question it was "Cécile, the answer?" When I was 17 years old, I decided to start learning Italian also because I really loved languages And in my opinion, if I could speak Portuguese, learn English, and French, Italian should be easy Then it was time to go to University and I thought, ok Connecticut, there's nothing for me here. New York City is only two hours away on the train I wanted to be an international business woman while speaking French so I chose to go to a school in the city and I didn't have any friends so I added myself to the "incoming Freshmen" facebook group of students who wanted to speak to other perspective students of the University and it was thereeeee where my life changed people. I wrote on the Facebook group Who responded to me? It's thanks to the French language that Damon and I met So we started speaking on Facebook before going to University just so we'd have a friend at school (when we got there) Because we both had a passion for the French language we both did an exchange to go to Paris, France at the same time He did a year, I did a semester. But it was dumb, because due to the fact I studied business at an American university (in the USA) they told me that I couldn't study in French in Paris So I needed to study at an American University in Paris. DUMB. So all my classes were in English even while I was in Paris and I lived with a French homestay family and it was with them that I learned the most French So I studied abroad for four months in 2012. That's where we started the channel And after the exchanged, my life changed. It's always like that. When we started filming little videos I started thinking, "why work for someone else?" I told myself, "maybe these videos are a career" Maybe we can create a new option of content showing young people who want to learn languages who want to travel. And so, Shut Up and Go was born! That changed my life I don't need to speak French but I love the language and like this, I can practice with you. And now, if you can leave a comment below of something that's changed your life. And we'll see each other next time! When I told my mom that I wanted to study in Paris as a 17/18 year old all alone, with a French family that I had no idea You know what she said? "Joanna, you can go there, but under one condition. I'm going with you for a week it was always my dream to go to Paris" And that was how my mom finally got to live her dream to go to Paris with ME! it was really cute! 
- What up, everyone, it's Damon. - And Joanna. - [Both] It's Damon and Jo. - And guess what I have here? Chopsticks. Y'all throw a lot of shade on Instagram. You know we have an Instagram, @Damonandjo and recently posted a
picture with Jo fingers. - I was hand modeling and
apparently I was doing the worst job holding chopsticks. - [Damon] This is Jo. - You know what? - This is how you-- - It's not my fault. Egg rolls are very heavy. - Let's just be happy she
didn't do this, everybody. So test Jo's ability here, I have placed a few different-sized
options and textures for you to try to pick up. Item one, the jade tree. - Where did you get this? - [Damon] (clears throat)
ding ding ding ding ding. Ding ding ding ding ding. - Item two, the tape roll. Uh oh. - [Damon] Ding ding ding ding ding. - Oh I see what you did there. It's so slippery. How many seconds do I get? - Wow it looks like a big fail. Item three. The slippery chili paste. - [Both] Oh! - I good, you good, she good, we good. - I'm like, poke someone's eye out. - It's like also flimsy. - Shh, shh, shh. Like just stabs it. Oh! Last object, the pencil. - OK, let's get it to
the center of the plate. Pick it up. (both laugh) Oh it's bad, it's bad everybody. - This is a life lesson. Things are hard, you don't give up. I'm don't give up. (beep) it, I give up. Clearly, I thought I knew. I don't. - How do you use chopsticks? You do this, this is the
Damon and Jo version. Hold the first one like a
pencil, like you're gonna write. Jo, you got it? - Oh I'm already on step three. (laughs) - Step two, place the other chopstick in between this little hole-- - In the holey hole. - and hold it with your third finger. - So you're-- - What's going on with this? That looks like that hurts. - Do you see, it does hurt? Who's picking up food with this? - Well not you because it's uneven. - This is why I can't
use chopsticks correctly so for all those comments,
you should feel bad. You made fun of somebody
with a disjointed problem. You guys, this is what we're gonna do, we're gonna take Jo to the
local Korean restaurant. - To embarrass me? - Ma Dang Gook Soo, we're
comin' to you right now. It's the one, it's the only. - [Both] It's Ma Dang Gook Soo. - We're here in Korea Town in LA. We're about to go put my chopstick skills, or lack of, to the test. - [Damon] Two. - [Jo] Hi, for two. - We'll just eat out here. Like either my Korean got
worse or her English got worse. Think it's my Korean. - So updates, here we are
at the Korean restaurant where we are the only people
who don't speak Korean. It's quite difficult. I know how people feel now
with their language barriers. I swear, we got there way before they did. - [Damon] Oh now Jo's startin'
shit with this place, right? You know, my favorite place
in Korean Town right now. - They didn't even know who you were. - I just hope my BB
Bop comes without beef. Let's be real. Are you gonna be on your
phone the whole time we eat lunch together? - Yeah 'cause I don't wanna talk to you. (ding) It's been 10 minutes. We're still-- - [Damon] Oh my god! I'm sorry. - You just spit on my face. - That's why we're not allowed in there. Can't even hold your saliva.
- I'm enjoyin' myself. - 'Cause I'm with you, that's why. - That ain't even true. - [Jo] Thank you. - I feel at home here. We don't know each other. You go, see ya. How are the kids? Alright. Jo says, "How do you say thank you in Korean?" and I said, "Kam-sa-ham-nida". And she smiled at me because
we all know each other. How you doin', how are the kids? Dahm-sum? - I'm not learning
Korean from you. (laughs) Place stick between
thumb and index finger. - [Damon] Can I get the
directions in Korean? Pencil position, through
the hole, third finger. Yay, my favorite part. - So good. - [Damon] Kam-sa-ham-nida. (laughs) Mmmm. - You mix. Thank you, Kam-sa-ham-nida. - [Damon] Banga-langa-shlanga-danga. - [Jo] Your BB Bop. You have your soup, you have your kimbap, you have your green thing. - Watch the professional do it. (background chatter) - Good eating. It's a 10 hour thing. - [Jo] Your mouth is burning. - [Damon] You didn't mix your BB Bop, Jo. - Neither did you. - [Damon] I see those
fingers flimsy-ing away. What aren't you using your
chopsticks for the soup? Exactly. See I'm lookin' around
and seein' everyone using their chopsticks so effortlessly
and then I'm just like, "Whoa!" Like what's happenin' there? - What's happening? - [Damon] It looks good, Jo. - I've practiced all day
long to get here. (laughs) - [Damon] I like my kuchu
a little bit spicier, Ma Dang Gook Soo, but I'll
let it pass this time. - [Jo] This is moving by itself. - Is that what technology's
like in Korean? (Jo laughs) Not bad. - [Jo] How does that look? - [Damon] That's not bad. - [Jo] The pinky for support. - [Damon] Not bad at all. - [Jo] Comment below, one to
ten, what are my chopsticks skills looking like before
and after the practice? - Is that one of our chopsticks? - My chopsticks skills are
so good that one of them ended up over there. My bad. - You know what, Jo came out
here today wanting to learn how to use those chopsticks
and I think she really pulled it off. I'm happy for you. - Give thanks, thanks, thanks. - Make sure to comment below,
you know, what you think of Jo's chopsticks skills
or if you have any tips. - Or are you terrible at chopsticks? And that's OK if you are
'cause now we have something in common. - Make sure to subscribe. - And we'll see you next time, goodbye. - Bye bye. ♫ Hey, hey. ♫ Hello, what's up ♫ I only am more ♫ What's wore, oh I call ya ♫ My-a-from-my-ya-mi-amore ♫ Who told ya you could ♫ Oops, doe (fast mumble singing) - This boy playin' me out. That's right, you better get in line. - That's right, you better
leave my Ma Dang Gook Soo ass in line. - It's like the most innocent,
elderly people. (laughs) - You can wait. - Oh. - [Damon] Wah wah wah. - Baby, how's the skill? - Kam-sa-ham-nida 
Thayne it's Jonah it's Damon intro and telling the full vocal audio sounds back in the day I used to really be into astrology so much so that I got an astrology book before Christmas yeah he gave to me and I'm Cameron right well I was so into astrology it's like this whole one up like I was so into this strategy that yeah I drew all the zodiac sign I would literally sit there and draw all the signs all 12 signs in their order and I googled and I know I didn't move over that was like seven I looked it up and encyclopedias and books both my parents are really into it sounds overused on it what is your sign you're a Leo Leo Libra cancer there's more than meets the eye you can look at your birth chart and each planet was in a certain position the time you were born in the place you were born no I love astrology but yeah there are times when I'm like my brother's a Libra I'm a Libra and we're completely different but it's because you got a little charm and it'll explain why you crazy we are doing a collab with Stella which means we have a video on her channel we're gonna be giving our like lessons learned right um I do vlogs I do yeah a lot of lifestyle stuff spirituality astrology talks about health and veganism and mindfulness awareness consciousness like I feel like there are other youtubers out there who can like really get deep and like Damon B I'm pretty sure was five 10 T you know ready to call my mom yeah do you know what time I was born mom I need exact details here because I thought it was 5 10 p.m. but this is very important it's for my astrological birth report [Music] I remember that second of my life thank you mom ok so 5 10 p.m. after much research Damon has guys natal chart my son is in Libra my moon is in Leo and my Mercury's in Libra and my Venus is in Leo wait your rising was not in Pisces last time we did this Pisces the ones you fall for I know maybe that's why we do long they have an in Sagittarius that I always fell for Sagittarius well Midheaven is how you're gonna walk through your life with a Sagittarius next to me your whole thing it's the entire time my moon sign is Leo what does that mean you're like always going for the number one spot in somebody's heart and you're Venus and we're so what's that mean that's like how you love Amina bawl my eyes out a few times in the airport we are Libra and Mars is how you fight for somebody might assert yourself yeah how you put yourself forward and that's why you're always trying to find the most diplomatic way you're gonna make your presence known wait tinder Plaza okay your rising is your dreamer high C's is the most dreamy sign but pie fish so when people need you they're probably thinking this kid has big dream but then the problem with a lot of Pisces is that they don't have the backbone a lot of times to like manifest those dreams unless you have something like a moon and Leo and amen in Sagittarius which are fire signs which are going to propel your dreams into for a wish so basically my career is about to be what does this mean for you okay so I process emotions very like my rising is tourists are very like I do things I'm like I'm kind of stubborn but it's sometimes like I wonder doing um so a lot of like earth and fire but then my Venus and Mars are booking cancer so I love very like we care about the other person like I won't be there for them and then Mars and cancer Mars how you serve yourself so or how do you fight for people yeah which one of you answer which cancers are super emotional we're like the kind of people that will have things in our minds and we'll talk about and one day we'll just so I'm like trying to add to the video but I don't know anything so next no so her maiden heaven is in capricorn capricornianas hard-working signs we out here organize we carry that's why she can be like a bad be but still be grounded exactly yeah we go no I don't Leo I know that psyche there again it's supposed to be the most outgoing and fiery extrovert right the center of attention is the lion like the king of the jungle I like much they didn't like your chart I don't know I think you have a kid and you don't like their charge my son isn't cancer my moon is in Scorpio my rising is in Virgo my Venus is in cancer my Mars is in Taurus and my mid heavens and Genesis do you take a gander so you're sensing cancer so well I'm not really your typical cancer I'm not like most cancers cancer I ain't really because I always like write long letters I journal I think that's why I like cancers like they don't have to throw it all out there mostly cuz we're too sensitive to know where you think about it what is Scorpius oh I would assume you would feel emotions very intensely so I'm a passionate person passionate your Venus is also cancer which same we love love I've always had long relationships and I think that's nice serial relationship I'm a serial relationship or 1x and then your Mars isn't Taurus so you're gonna assert yourself like like that Taurus is like a bull so things like stubborn maybe like when you have your mindset Mars doesn't really implanted at war so how you fight like how you going how you gonna terminate like the contract which mines and kids are ok for you my rising Virgo virgos are so organized a logical very my analytical another cool yeah you always look at all the analytics and you write down everything you need to do I want to know like I want observe I want to get data which I think comes down to a Virgo like meetings information to organize and your cancer so it's a pleasure Karen I genuinely want to help and scrub and you're like I'm in my mid heavens in Gemini that's the ruling house of basically how you're gonna take your career your social standing and geminis have two different sides I'm a cancer but I love to travel so it's like I'm literally always changing that and yours a Sagittarius right yeah that's like down like yeah like let's go let's do it which is why some friends like I want to go and I'm like I want to stay and they're gonna take solo trips for that reason yeah time at all and wow you guys have been wanting to know that forever

Hey everyone it's Damon. It's Jo. It's Damon and Jo. We have already done this  "are you Parisian ?" kind of video, look. It was nice, but- That was a space for them to watch. Yes but we can cut. Yes but it gives 2 seconds. Are you annoying ? Minus ? The results. [Jo] -7 % !
[Damon] That can't be right. I was more Parisian that you ! Yeah because you're nastier. Because I'm more stylish and cool and- Uh no, have you seen my- [Jo] Okay, okay.
[Damon] Look. [Damon] And now on the catwalk: Damon Dominique ! Boom chika wowow. It is super hot. How crazy are you ? One hundred per cent crazy ! This test's called "How - Okay, How- [Jo] -French are you ?
[Damon] Quebec are you ? This test's called- How French are you ? "After a meal at the restaurant abroad, you have to leave a 20% tip even though the service was mediocre." "How do you react?" "You refuse to leave a tip." "You roll your eyes and leave 1 or 2 euros." It's not the responsability of the customer to pay for their salary, it is that of the restaurant. "A subway strike has you running late. Choose a reaction." It is a bit shady. "Someone yells enthusiatically in a public place. How do you feel?" "Irritated, distressed, confused, delighted". [Damon] At the bottom..here. What does "dérouté" mean ? They're yelling, oh,  shouts like "Ahhh!" Yeah "Delighted", which is not how French people would answer. "A stranger tries to start a conversation on the subway. Choose a reaction." I engage in the conversation everytime. That's what happens here in the L.A  subway. I was wearing ripped jeans, and of course there was a woman who was like- "Oh is this today's fashion ? Are you wearing two pair of trousers ?" [Damon] I'm always this. [Jo] Yes grandma,  I wear ripped jeans. "This is presented as "French bread" in a supermarket - ours for example -  how do you feel ?" Like, disrepected. Deeply sad. "How would you describe yourself?" Either "rebel" or "always hungry". I am hungry now. I am so hungry ! We're also a bit zen. [Damon] Rebel or always hungry. [Jo] You're also a bit "beauf" (French slang for "vulgar and stupid"). A colleague writes "j'ai manger" (I've eaten) instead of "j'ai mangé" in an email. Describe this person. Idiot. It's basic grammar. Ok so they're an idiot. I would like to change my answer. I don't really like this answer because... It's mean. It's mean because some people don't have the same access to education that we have. "Benêt" (Idiot). Yeah we're going to see what "benêt" means. A politician is having an affair. It's not my life. Yeah like it's none of our business. If it's not your life, It has nothing to do with you. It has not. "A colleague schedules a meeting during lunch break. How annoyed are you ?" It doesn't annoy me, why would it? Because you know how French people like to have their really long lunch break. Yeah but no, it doesn't annoy me at all. Let's see... It's a BuzzFeed test so it's 100% accurate. You got : "As French as Owen Wilson in Midnight in Paris. So not French at all. Admit it, you're American". Again, another result like this ! I like this film, and his role because he's an American interested by France who wants to live there. It could be interesting if you French people took this quizz- -because I want to know if there are actually French answers. Please take the quizz, we're going to put it in the description below.

Putain ! (f*ck) It's Damon. It's Jo. And it's Damon and Jo. We know that you French people enjoy eating. But what do WE like to eat, as two Americans here in France. That is the question. For me, only chocolate. Tabouleh ! My study abroad was rice- Was it already open ? Maybe I shouldn't eat it. My study abroad consisted in this, only this. It's good, it's fresh, it's France ! Next ! I had a hard time choosing between rice pudding, semolina pudding, fromage blanc, greek yogurt... What's semolina ? It's the perfect texture. Maybe for old people ? We don't like very sweet stuff like mille-feuille. No no, this isn't right. Eclairs ? I have never seen you eat one. That's because you never come to Paris with me ! We bought half a baguette because we also bought these, what are these ? It couldn't be easier to have a very French moment- because everything is already ready to eat, even the little... they're here too ! Do you want my baguette ? I don't want your bread. This doesn't exist in the US. No, they say that it is a French baguette, but it's not. Jockey, It's a kind of yogurt with straciatella bits- it's so good because it's "smooth and soft". It's too sweet but it's good ! Oh shit, ew, who bought this? Little cookies with chocolate. With no sugar added. Yes, it's dark chocolate, it is so good! Then we eat it! Shut up,  I'll put it in your face! I'm back after a short toilet break. Just kidding I didn't go to the toilet. I know that you French people- My next favourite thing is this. It's very simple, but you all know I can't cook, even lentils. It's good that you're aware of it. I'm not vegan nor vegetarian but there are a lot of options here. *reads the description on the packaging* Is it a book or a packaging ? The French language is like poetry. Everything from this brand is very good, so if you see "Vegan Deli"- In Monoprix, Franprix, G20, Casino, Simply Market or Leader price or Lidl. My favourite food is making me sick. I just ate a small piece of this and went to get the packaging from the bin- to check if it was actually vegetarian. To eat what was in the bin! I want to show you- More chocolate? No but it's organic okay, it's dark chocolate, 74%. 1 euro! Three years ago we did the same stuff with different stuff from the supermarket. Stuff, stuff and stuff. Stuff stuff stuff. Now you'd be proud of me because I'm eating the rind. I mean I'm eating the rind of the cheese. Right, but you need to like, squeesh it. "Whole wheat, rice and barley (orge) petals" That's why I- no. "Orge" (barley) like "orgy", is full in the box? Less than 2 euros. Like really France, I'm shocked. It's organic, there's no... preservation ? There's no shit in it ! There's no "préservatifs" (French for condom) in this. I made this mistake once because in the US it's called "preservatives". How do you say it in France? "Cons.." I know this word. Cons, con... connard (asshole). - Drink it
- Cheers. I have a rule : every time I go to the supermarket abroad... You have to buy something new ? At least one thing. "Mini sticks, the mini pocket" I love that everything's in English. My god, everything's in English. "Made with pork meat of French origin, the format assures you a tasty savoury snack." Okay, it's dry sausage. It smells really good! No, smell it! Oh my god it's so good. 1 euro. These are called "crêpes dentelles" filled with Roquefort cheese. So, French roquefort, French crêpes. "Dents" (Teeth) not very French. One of my favourite thing here in France is the "Crêpes dentelles". It's really good. Is it ? It's like a salty biscuit. Hello, honey ! Thanks for watching this video. We appreciate you being here. We make videos every French fridays. Comment below, do you like the things we have here ? What should we eat next time in Paris ? To the gym ! Oh my god like, I want new pants. [Damon] I want a new body ! I want a new heart ! You are so chic and I'm so heavy. I have already shown that I love chocolate. *Damon corrects her* I have... ...already shown you. I've already shown you. "I have already shown you" okay.

Jo: Sarah, nice to meet you! Jo: What's your name?
Girl 2: Maddie
Jo: Maddie, nice to meet you! Jo: Awe, I love meeting people like this. 
Happy New Year! Girls: Happy New Year! Bye Jo: Stuff like that makes me so hype. It's nice when it happens in New York because this is where it all started Also shout-out to those tourists who come to New York City for winter New Year's Eve because it's cold out here It's that kind of cool that stings your legs. How did I live here for six years!? I was out here on living my life...? Out here...like dis? Like di- you can't even see what I'm saying 'cuz my mouth's covered by a huge scarf (in French) "Exit" Damon: Joe what's up in New York? Jo: Alright, just Joe here. Finished up my workout; it was a good one. Last workout of 2017... *music plays* And all I'm trying to say is that: if you are one of those people that's gonna wait until New Year's Day to go to the gym and sign up for a membership you're gonna be a statistic And if you are starting to do whatever you want to do, when you want to do it, good for you! Damon: Man, I could really live here Okay, the greens are a little, um, oily Misako: Like from what? Damon: From...the oil *Misako laughs* Misako: Oh my gosh! You're so sweet Misako: I didn't realize it would be done this quickly 
Jo: Y'all hear that? Jo: It's New Year's 2018, and we're 'bout to go to "Club Barbes" Jo: Can I do an egg white omelette Wow! New York, this is why people don't like living in you $11.40 for an egg white omelet with three toppings. That has to be a joke! I'm just mad that this is $11 Jo: Oh my god hiiii Misako: You're so beautiful!
Jo: You're so beautiful! Misako: Hi!
Damon: Say hi to the camera, like... *Jo laughs* Jo: Happy last day of 2017! *All cheer* Paige: Ayyyyeee. Happy New Year! Damon: Bye
Jo: Bisou, tchau (kisses, bye) Misako: Oh it's on... *Damon laughs* Damon: Hold on we gotta turn the music down for a second. I gotta talk about 2018 Damon: Well me...knocking on 2018's door *Damon laughs* Jo: Just woke up from the last nap of 2017, and I'm feeling a little inspired Damon: You know I'm honestly having a rough time with this one coming up with a 2018 resolution because I don't feel like I live my life that way Jo: I'm not really one for New Year's resolutions because I don't believe you should wait for New Year's to do what you've always wanted to do Damon: Jo and I, we don't really wait for January 1st to make things happen. Our whole mentality of this channel is to shut up and go! Jo: Do that ish now Damon: We're not the people to wait until a certain date to get things going Jo: But if I am to give you a preview of 2018 this is what it looks like... Damon: Next year, I already consider myself to be a bold person. But as of last night... see I don't need January 1st to be a start...as of last night if I see somebody that I want to talk to, a friend a potential love interest, whoever, I'm going to talk to YOU! 'cuz I know that if I don't I'm gonna go home and wonder what could have been Which is what kind of happened three nights ago when I went to the club and didn't say "hi" to some people that I wanted to say "hi" to... so Not letting myself do that anymore because you're gonna go through your life wondering what could have been and that's no way to live life at all Jo: And I'm hoping that you all have an amazing 2018 where you shut up and go and honestly I'mma gonna get cheesy Thank-you, because if it weren't for you guys watching this channel we would not be able to live these lives and continue inspiring you to travel and learn languages But it's something that we would do with or without this channel so it's even more exciting that we get to share it with you Damon: I don't know. I don't know Misako: I think this is definitely like more- 
Damon: of like a nightlife
Misako: -sleek, yeah, like he's going out, he's stepping out He's gunna be collect numbers... cheques... Social Security numbers, bank account routing numbers I even like the hair falling down in streaks like that like Damon: I used to think this looks cool and then you go on Instagram and you know what...74% people told me to cut it off, under the pole Misako: Well I guess, we'll do, WE'LL GIVE YOU GUYS WHAT YOU WANT, I'm gunna go get the scissors *Damon laughs* Jo: The moment of truuuth. Ooh, it's chilled. She ready for New Year's Misako: *sings* 'Tis the season to be litty Misako: I broke it Damon: *laughs* Nooo Jo: Please don't hit me *Jo laughs* Paige: Technical difficulties

Let's make it happen in 2018 Super intense close-out 
Hi Everyone! It's Damon! It's Jo! And it's Damon and Jo! Need help ? Hey everyone, it's Damon It's Jo And it's Damon and Jo! And today, we're going to continue our adventures with French croissants. Everyone loves the french Everyone loves French croissants, I'm going to correct myself. No but really, I love the french (people), do you ? uhmm.... YEEEEEE. Every 'French Friday', we ask you to comment below a good recipe for making croissants. And we have here, a homemade croissant recipe the picture's not ideal... but.. In order to make home-made croissants, this is what you'll need [the fingers] 190 grams of butter 55 grams of flour An egg yolk,  but it's not yellow, but that's ok, it's an egg But the yellow is inside.. Yeah, ok, it's yellow.. inside [D: It's complicated!] 15 grams of fresh yeast ('levure'). What's that ? 'yeast' How much ? 15 grams. 15 grams of fresh yeast. 12 grams of salt. 50 grams of sugar. 300militers of milk. How much is 300 ml ? Mh, mililiters, 'millilitres'. We're gonna guess ! In the US we use another metric system and another temperature system and it's... actually dumb. It's crazy cause we use cups. Difficulty level : easy, preparation : 45 min, [Damon] That's a lot. baking time : 15. Total time : 1 hour Preparation : in a large 'saladier' (mixing bowl)... 'Saladier' ? [Jo] Don't you have a mixing bowl ? No but, since you don't have one, what are we going to use, this ? There is nothing at his place. Here we go, because I actually cook at home. Ok, that's it. I love this. I feel like a baker. Uh, it stinks too. 50 ml of lukewarm milk. Is it ? No it's cold. It's more or less lukewarm. Mix it. 10 grams of sugar. It's too hard. Don't you have activated Siri ? [Jo] No ! She doesn't do anything here ! [Jo] At least I have mixing bowls a home ! That's true. 680 grams. If it were 21 grams... I don't think it works like this. So a spoonful. Like our accent. 125 grams of flour. We need half a cup, which is 170 grams. So if we need 125 grams, we need less than half a cup. The rest of the sentence for the first step is : Add the remaining flour, milk and sugar, then salt. [Damon] Jo, do you remember at the beginning of the video we said that we needed 500 grams of flour, now we've got to do more maths because we only added, So if 125 grams is half a cup, it means that 500-125=375 grams , [Damon] Yeah. so it means more or less three cups ? How many half cups do we need to have 375 grams ? 1 cup and a half ! We covered it with a damp cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes. Knead in squares...between two pieces of greaseproof paper. Ok our French isn't developped enough for a recipe like this one why did we choose it ? Who wants my croissants ? [Damon] Who wants my crispy croissants ? Golden, pretty with a big crust... The american recipes says that we need a whole pound of butter. But according to the French recipe we only need half a pound. And the Americans wonder why we're all... NEXT ! On a kitchen counter dusted with flour... Had we known the difficulty of the French required to do this recipe, we would have chosen another one. We read it in our comments, so it's them who put us in this crap. The best comment said to go out to the bakery and buy the croissants. Not bad ! Not bad, now we have to mix everything. It's like this, like... It's too... wet. Soup of the day, Damon and Jo's croissants. Next step : I'm starting to feel a bit nervous. It's never going to be croissants. It's the soy milk. Put the butter in the middle. Put the butter in the middle and cover it by refolding the edges of the dough above it. Put the butter in the middle and cover it by refolding - What's "rabattant" (refolding) ? Spread out the butter into a square between two pieces of greaseproof paper. Not bad, ok. [Jo] I'm impressed ! [Damon] Be careful. [Jo] You've got neighbors ! I think you have to do this. Ok, it's alright, look it's a croissant. Well, they look alright. Preheat your oven at 220°C , bake for 45 minutes and hope for the best ! 20 minutes later. We forgot the egg yolk ! Before putting in the oven, brown the croissants with  whisked egg yolk. How to bake croissants for dummies ? We don't know. 45 minutes, here we go. 45min later. It smells like Christmas, I swear ! It's so scented! Have Damon and Jo made this? [Damon] Yeah and they've also done this. Is it a huge disaster ? It's not a big disaster, it's just a big... dryness. I'm going to put a glass of water beside. [Jo] I'm not sure we can call them croissants, maybe 'croustillants' (crispies) ? Nothing to do with... With a bit of butter ? A bit more! Look, this is the normal inside of a croissant. It's just a bit too dry. You add jam and, perfect ! I don't have any ! It's crispy, literally not bad. It's not bad... for an american. It's ok ! It's really ok. No but it's ok. Comment below if we are real French bakers or not. Vote in the poll and tell us if they're ok or not. Make sure to subscribe because we make videos in french every French Friday. No but really, I need a liquid. Ciao, kisses ! 
Seriously? Charming... I'm over it Hello? Hello Are you ready? Okay! I can't believe you've never seen this movie It's the first time! They already ate it all Thanks Jo, she left me this Apple ID problems... Nobody remembers their password or their Apple ID France.... Okay Quebecer... *Mimics his pronunciation of France* Wait.. how do i do it? I'm gonna marry someone just to have a shorter name Why did i put the most complicated password?! Don't look! It's not going to work.. No... We're not going to watch the movie... but we still have our snacks! What's the main reason why you've never seen this movie? The first thing is that it was very difficult The second thing is that I had to choose between Amélie and BoJack Horseman Jo, explain this to me... What inspires you in the movie? Actually, I'm going to redo the question You know, there's actors and actresses who play their roles very well in the movie Is there a particular role that speaks to you? The role when the movie works Okay, we have to watch that in another place. Another place.. maybe another city? all of a sudden, someone is dead?... Yeah, the mom Really? there's not like another story? Sometimes it's just like that It reminds me of the day you have an test and they give you a bunch of information and in the end you have to remember everything Nothing happens but everything happens... What happens? It's obvious that you've never watched a French film before.. You have to concentrate But that's real life The Paris metro It's crazy saying that that's where I want to be right now Look at how they've filmed! It's so pretty! I know, the colors! The colors, the composition! That's why you watch this movie! I didn't understand... I know the story is a bit difficult to understand What is happening? They obviously did the most with this movie Like it's noticeable how much of the most they did It's about the little details Like, doing the absolute most Damon: Yes, but it's pretty and it's cool and it's mysterious Jo: I'm not saying it's bad, I'm just saying it's the most She drops her thing and then that thing makes the brick grow It's obvious She finds the name and she has to find him They worked on this Nobody worked on my hair though The French are quite profound What they say normally... yeah, it's pretty It's just like, holy sh- how long did it take you to think about that? How long did it take you to form that phrase? Did she just steal her dad's gnome? I don't know... what's happening but I know the Gare du Nord doesn't look like that! not as pretty... I never dared watch this movie in French because I could never understand Without subtitles? I barely understand the English subtitles Okay, our French is not very good despite... How do you say despite? I don't even know what that means in English anymore Like, what does that mean? Despite? You know what that means! Level 1 English It's been a really hard couple of months This is the kind of movie I have to rewatch a million times to understand *struggles* with English subtitles like, English dubbed English version Imagine if you were French and could understand what they were saying. That would be so beautiful. I've never seen an American movie like that.. I like this movie but what surprises me is just how popular it is in France How a film so eccentric and a little weird could be the number one, the classic Why do I like this movie? besides the colors and the scene composition and all that... The fact that it's set in Paris. I like that she appreciates life... to the point of appreciating the details of life that we normally just let happen and forget These little moments aren't just little moments Do I appreciate the little things in my life? If not, well, there's a lot of things happening... 5000 times a day and society normally just lets beautiful moments pass That's my summary of the movie That we haven't even finished.. So... I know that you've already watched Amélie so leave a comment down below What do you think of the movie? Do you like the movie? Do you not like the movie? For me,  I'm on both sides I think... I like the production but I don't like the story I like the movie... if I'm not required to watch the movie xoxo Good night Okay, last question! a little quiz What is her name? Amélie Yes, but Amélie what? In French *struggles to say Poulain* Yes, Jo. That's it... Is it Bretodeau or Bretodeau? *said differently* It's Bretodeau Wow! You're not sleeping! I understood only one thing One second of the movie 
Waaah, salut ! - What's up it's Damon!

- Or the Friday video, as you want. Recently we tweeted something like that. What is French rap ? Who are the French rappers ? So we created a list of all the rappers that you guys recommended to us. And they were gooooooood And if you see the police behind us, please comment below because- Yeah cause we're really about the hip-hip culture. I think it's illegal to be here. Everything we do is illegal. Not everything... It depends on the country. *laughs* First song : Nougat. Cut, cut ! Okay, what are they saying here ? I think even French people don't know. Okay, I heard... Vladimir Putin. "cocaine" and "shooting". Okay Booba ! Réseaux, by Niska. Okay, a bit slower. I am a gangsta! What are they saying here ? Did you understand ? Are you seriously asking me that ? If you know Cardi B, for example, can you in France comment below- cause like Cardi B like... It's that Cardi B ! The only female rapper I know is Diam's. ♫ A man that could give me wings, a man, faithful and who's not afraid to be loved- ♫ So if you've got it all babe, give me your email ! Is that the police ? Hide the camera ! Is that on ? It is on, okay. That was such a dad thing. And the next song is, Papaoutai ! Yeah, dad... If in all the comments in our... what ? Gross, like- Papaoutai. Dad where are you? Yes, I know ! I know the song, I'm not stupid. *unintelligible banter* You, are a baby, you're not a dad. I, am like- Yes I am ! I've got two kids in France.   ♫ Where is your dad ? ♫ Tell me where is your dad. ♫ You don't even need to talk, he already knows what's wrong. ♫ Oh cheeky dad, tell me where you're hiding. ♫ I think I've counted my fingers at least a thousand times. This is too sad for the theme of a video. No but, I think I've cracked my neck. Where is your dad ? Suprême NTM, That's my people ! In English, even though it is a French song.       *sings* Smoking spliffs. If you don't listen to NTM I will stop following you. Do you know what NTM means ?

But, you didn't even listen to the chorus. But that's not rap. People are walking by. Yes, I'm listening to Katy Perry here it's alright. He might be French. What are the most popular rap songs right now ? Did we forget anything ? Are there things like Drake, Nickie Minaj, or Cardi B? It's not exactly rap, like that. That's too much like rap. Like hardcore rap. So, I don't know if you're aware, but we have been French rappers for seven years. Yes, it's been seven years since we did a small video, that you guys are going to see now... *unintelligible banter* Hit it ! ♫ Who says studies says a job, who says a job says money, ♫ Who says money says expenses, who says credits says debts ♫ Who says debts says baillif, says sitting in shit. ♫ Who says love says kids, says forever and says divorce. ♫ Who says close ones says mourning cause troubles don't come alone. ♫ Who says crisis says you world says hunger and  says third-world. ♫ Who says tiredness says waking up, still deaf from the night before. ♫ So we dance to forget all the problems. ♫ So we dance. And were leaving you with a small announcement : We are... going to Paris ! Together, together, together ! Kisses, guys, see you in Paris. I hope I'm not sweating too much. You're going to sweat even more with Paris when there's no aircon. If you haven't noticed we're here in Venice Beach. Where all the rappers live. Sorry ! It's always men, like, you know ? Where are the French Cardi B ? That's because men bring strength. *goofy sounds*

Hello everyone it's Damon. It's Jo. And it's Damon and Jo ! Today we're going a play a little game that we invented ourselves called: The Cheese Challenge French or Fake ? We just went to our local supermarket and we found 3 French cheeses. But we bought some others to try and see if we could guess- -which ones are French and which ones are, yes- which ones aren't French, which ones are fake, and which ones are French. [Jo] One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Since it's our French Friday, we are having a glass of wine ! Cheers ! What was it ? "Santé" ? (Cheers) Is it French or fake ? It's old ! No but really, you opened it three weeks ago and left it in your fridge. No, it's wine from Portugal. First cheese ! [Damon] Jo, here it is. Is it going to be like the baguette that isn't French at all even though they say it is ? French or fake ? I know it's gross, right ? Mmh, it's good ! It isn't French, no. Is it French or fake ? It's fake ! It's French ! Since you didn't answer correctly you have to drink. Oh no, what a shame ! You're going to guess just- I already want to say it's fake because of how much plastic there is wrapping the cheese. Why is there stuff in it ? No this is  super fake. Doesn't it look delicious ? Since you answered correctly you have to drink ! Okay. Really, it's bad. This isn't cheese. This is so gross. Is it French or fake ? Fake, it's fake ! Is it your final answer ? It's fake ! But it's French style. No but it's literally fake, it's vegan. It's literally fake. It's literally not cheese. It's vegan cheese. Since you were right this time, we have to drink. Please. Damon and Jo : are they drunk ? True or False. I used to love maths questions like- Open your mouth. Okay. Okay, cheese is really disgusting, the texture- [Jo] When you don't know.
[Damon] presented like that. It's fake Jo, it's fake. Open your eyes. You're right ! Since you gave the wrong answer- -we need to drink ! I love French Fridays. I can't travel without this. Yeah, yeah ok. Is it French or fake ? It's French, it's brie ! This is the perfect moment for a flashback to when I tasted the rind of the cheese, because I don't like it. We put a poll here in the video, you need to vote for what cheese you like- - brie, emmental, gouda, what's your favourite cheese ? The question isn't for me but I'll answer it anyway. I'm going to vote. Camembert. Yeah, it's camembert. It's camembert but my second favorite is this one. It was awful ! Since you answered correctly, you have to drink ! Okay, are you ready ? Yes. Are you going to give me a few seconds before you- Wait, I know this cheese. It's goat cheese, it's French baby ! Do I have to drink ? Exactly ! Cheers ! And we already know that the last one isn't French at all- but we are going to taste it. We don't like the rind, at all. We eat like this. We want to know what's in the American section where you live. Because sometimes where we live the "French" things aren't French at all. There is no French section. We made another video called "French foods in the US". We tasted "French" things that aren't French at all. What does it mean ? Since when ? We have a bit of French Onion Dip. Wait, you need to see this. No, no it looks awful. Look. Subscribe if you like wine ! Subscribe and call me ! Call me ! And also subscribe if you like Damon and Jo. And comment below that you like us ! Ciao ! We're not alcoholics okay. No, I don't drink. Is it my turn ? If the French are really drunk, is it French or fake ? I have a question. Yeah ? Who's going to keep the gross cheeses ? Not me. It's your boyfriend who's coming. We are starting this game with wine, is it French or fake ? Ok, kisses bye ! Ciao !

 Send me this "parada" The word can be applied to almost everything What are you trying to tell me right now? I'm trying to tell you that you can use
"parada" to any sense. So... Here's the "parada" (deal) I got to stop at the Açai shop No, here's the "parada", I want to eat Açai right now. Is this a "parada"? It's a thing every carioca says Next!

You got to give me the nomenclature,
if is it a verb, adjective, pronoun, noun Is a noun, a person who's very annoying - So, someone
- You are No I'm not No, what I mean is, in general I always took good grades but I wasn't Puxa saco... Maybe "chato" (boring) but not "puxa saco" - I'm "chato"!

I'm carioca I didn't know that word Jo Really? I'm still teaching you? What a great moment "Maneiro", for example Adjective that means something 
interesting, cool, beautiful Like, Jo you're "maneira" I know right? Next! "Pô" Poor? That's us "Pô" is the "Por" verb Yes, but no. This verb is so funny by the way everybody "Põe" It's like... "Pô" "Porra" I taught you that. Good! "Não tem porra nenhuma aqui!"
(There's no fucking deal here!) This is also really carioca-like This way to say this in any sense But I can't say that in like, a interview If you're from Rio, yes you can "Porra mano!"
(Fuck, dude!) "Caraca!"
(Damn!) "Pô" No, this is like "Poxa" "Poxa!" I like that one "Poxa" You are learning! "Tá ligado" What? - "Tá ligado"
- It's great Tá ligado? You say these things sometimes
and I stand there by your side like... You are making excuses - Tá ligado?
- Tá ligado. It's Ok, all right Perfect - Tá ligado
- Tá ligado For example, I'm at the Açaí shop I ask like, give me a bowl of Açaí. "Tá ligado?"
(You got it on?) I wouldn't say that But why not? When should I say it then? I said to her that it wasn't my fault,
"tá ligado?" (got it?) like, do you understand? Am I being clear? Oh, ok Are you paying attention to what I'm saying? Like, when you teach me something, 
"não tá ligado" (I don't understand) Like, didn't work. It did not I called you and you did not answer There's just a bit more There's dirty pics I've learned a lot this time Truly? I truly don't remember any of which I learned today What's up "Malucos"? You at home, leave other slangs in the comments So we can make a Part 2, maybe.

Hello everyone, it's Damon, it's Jo and it's Damon and Jo! Today, we're gonna do a little test (as usual) in order to know "in what french city should you really be living in?" We ALWAYS receive this comment: but why do you only travel to Paris? there are plenty of other cities in France you know? I often go to Paris because I love the city But is Paris the right French city for me? This is what we're gonna find out today First of all, I went to the south of France and I thought it was kinda nice Maybe I could have the "French riviera" result I already know that I will have the "South of France" result Maybe I don't know Paris? I hope not... I'm joking First question ! Choose a movie ! The King's Speech, the Apartment ... The Spanish Apartment ! The Spanish Apartment I loveee it Because I don't know the other movies It's the only one I know Even if it's about Barcelona, flatmates, in a big house with international people, it's cool At karaoke, you sing ... Michel Sardou, Iam, Gilbert Montagné, Pierre... The only one I know is Manau I went to a party with friends, and we played a card game And I receive the "Who sings but shouldn't sing " card [singing] I don't know what it means. You can see that it's not bad. Rita Mitsouko, Alizée, M. Pokora Monsieur Pokora? Oh, Moussier Tombola.   It's fine, it's fine. And plenty of other options that I've never heard of. Your ideal vacation is... A culinary food tour in France. Cape Ferret New York, pfft. New York is in no way a vacation. It's just stressful. Like, if you go to New York for vacation, you're going to need to take another vacation just to destress. Exploring your favorite region, in the sun and on the beach, Venice Oohhh... In the sun and on the beach, yesss Venice? I love Venice. Yeah it's super touristy, but sometimes there's a reason for that. That's why I like Paris. Choose a mode of transport. Subway, skateboarding, scooter, bike, car, walking Bike! Subway, I'm a subway girl. Comment below if you have a Vélib (bike sharing service) subscription that I can use next time I'm in France. which will be in two weeks ...if the French Consulate gives me my passport... Even if it stinks, even if it's noisy, even if there are crazy people It's fine. You hate people... Period. You hate people who are... slow. Yeah, I'm going go with that. slow. Yes. annoying Of course, who likes people who are annoying. I hate people are slow. s l o w.  s  l  o  w. Pretentious I don't really get along well with people who take themselves too seriously. So, pretentious. Just because of my answer I'm going to get Paris because I don't like slow people. It's sad because I like the sun and the beach and the south of France. Okay, let's continue. What is your addiction? Paris. (reading the responses) Cigarettes. If you know me, my addiction is chocolate and coffee a little bit. Coffee, I drink it all the time. Anyway, I can't live a day without eating a piece of chocolate. Choose a sport. Badminton? Yeah, I like Badmin...OH TENNIS! Jogging? Okay, jogging. Football. That depends if it's Brazilian Football because sometimes I don't suck at it. I used to teach tennis before. I was a tennis teacher. All the other sports where you need, like, coordination and all that with a ball. No, not for me. The ball comes here, and I hit it way over there. It's horrible, I'm really bad. So, jogging. You would spend your ideal Friday evening... In a bar with your friends, no, I don't drink that much. Dancing, yeah, after drinking something... Dancing, dancing. I'm Brazilian. So absolutely dancing. At the movies. No, because I don't like the movies because I love talking. At the movies, yeah, if it's in France, because it's super expensive here. You can't be that person in the theater who talks during the movie, so... Dancing. I always say I'm going to the club to meet people and then I get there and I'm like, I don't care if you're here, I'm came here to dance. Doesn't matter as long as there's alcohol. Like yeah, sometimes. Okay, dancing. Choose a series. Friends, friends, friends, friends, friends, DAMMIT. Sherlock, no. Sherlock, never seen it. Game of Thrones, no. Game of Thrones, never seen it.

If it's not Paris... ...nothing. My life will continue. You got... Cannes! It was Cannes! In the French Riveria! Strasbourg! I'm so happy! It wasn't Paris. International European city? What other city is more European and international than Paris? If you're right-wing, retired, and very rich, this city is made for you. Okay, no. Please vote in the poll above if you're from Paris or outside of Paris. Jo! The test thinks that I'm like Donald Trump... I like the beach, so I'm a little happy... Show Damon Domnique's result! Show Jo Franco's result! 1, 2, 3! D: Strasbourg!
J: Cannes! [laugh] Maybe this test changed my mind enough that the next time I go to Paris I'm going to take another...take a trip by train... The TGV (major train system in France) is super fast Yeah, like the SNCF (French railway company) We took the test, so now it's your turn to take it. And after that, comment below your result. ...and if you actually live in the same city that you got in the test Subscribe by clicking on the red button below that says...subscribe? I think it says that in French. Yes? Each Friday we're going to return with a French Friday video D: It's true. So a French Friday video, and we'll see each other next time. Kisses! "I've got you on my mind..." "The secret..." [laugh] "I've been watching you..." "At night, I think of you" Like, ice cream man. At the weirdest times Mommy, can I get an ice cream? Like... I'm here to sell ice cream to the kids in the neighborhood. You want a cone? Go home! 
Hey Wassup Yep it's Damon and I'm in Paris Again... I love Paris Yeah there are things that really piss me off here but overall, one of the things I love the most in France French food. Well, French food that I can eat As a vegetarian in Paris, my options are a bit limited Also due to my budget Seriously though Don't care if avocado toast costs $15 There is no way I'm paying $15 for something you can buy at Monoprix for maximum $3 Damn that was Parisian Parisian! I'm not at all Parisian Don't know if y'all remember I took a quiz one time that told me I'm -7% Parisian Yeah no one's shocked by that French food - I love it Milk Yogurt Salad Baguettes Marron Suis YOP Chocolat Anything and everything at Picard And especially the quiches Typically I'd go to the boulangerie to get one But this time it's all changing cuz I, an American in Paris I'm gonna attempt to prepare a French meal À l'Americain Basically, it'll be gross It's my first time cooking a quiche Also the first time I'm cooking Ok where's the oven even? Wait, I think this is the oven Don't even know if this is possible with this Damn it's so hot tho That's why there's no oven here! I googled "cheese quiche" cuz I'm a vegetarian When you go to the boulangerie, you have the choice Goat cheese and spinach quiche... Tomato Mozzarella quiche... This time we're making quiche... with whatever's in my fridge Basically, it'll be gross For this recipe, I'll need Goat cheese Fresh cream Emmental cheese Spinach leaves Eggs (cage-free c'mon) Lil bit of salt and pepper But I don't really know why And the dough C'mon I didn't forget And hell yeah it's the store brand I'm a cheap-ass I'm watching my neighbor. He's cooking. Maybe he can teach me a thing or two. Step one: Preheat the oven to 180 I don't know if y'all Frenchies have realized but numbers in French are a bunch of bologna For example, 80 for you Well there is no word for 80 You say 4 times 20 It's like an equation So 4 times 20 equals 80, and that's how you say 80. 70, is not just 70. It's 60 plus 10, which equals 70 So that's why IDK if I turned this on correctly Let me just check with my hand...noooooo Kidding Let's do this Step two: Unravel the dough Ok step zero: wash your hands Do it a lil like this Wait. Hold up. You have to have a pie dish but this is all I found here This already looks gross Already did it all wrong Don't forget to use this Wow looks so good Seriously K. Let's just move on. Step three: Get your eggs. Add cream. All this? Who's in the mood to eat rn? It's a disaster in the kitchen... Step four: add cheese So let's go ahead and do that "Verser" on the pie crust What's "verser" mean? Ok. If the meal is getting a lil gross, just add goat cheese. Misako (friend) Whatcha doing? Yeah. Step...I don't even know what number Pour the odd mixture over the other odd mixture This being my first time, I don't know if this is how it's supposed to look Excuse me, is this what it should look ilke before the oven? Oh you again. You got another question? Royal Palace, Champs Elysées Road Oh it looks FINE It'll be fine and if not, I'll just go to one of the 300 boulangeries in the street Last step: Close the oven door and pray for the best Setting my alarm and calling a French person asap 28 minutes later 2 more minutes till our famous quiche ...is ready Maybe if I put the spinach over the quiche People won't see that it's not fully cooked It'll, in fact, hide the quiche I need a fork Yeah you do Misako, she's gonna try it Cheese. Wait this is good I'm even suprised! Seriously this is fine Conclusion: some parts aren't so cooked and other parts that are too cooked Not my fault! A little bit my fault. Exactly Y'all heard it yourselves. She wants some. Final, final step: add more spinach to hide the quiche you just made. Thanks for watching this video Click like if you liked the video!

[Music] welcome to my 11:00 or doc LH - do I pay $1,100 which yes is pretty cringy as it is this is a steal in Los Angeles can we just talk about how much better it is than your New York City apartment so as you can see we had to do lofted beds again not much happening here okay okay reason why Damon lives in like the Taj Mahal okay we found these apartments very like serendipitously I swear to you the kitchen cabinets were in the living room nothing was even done you know what Damon said boom job this is my apartment mine is nice but it's like like I've done today so Davis is nice and very well lit okay for him I came in here first thing I saw hardwood floors maybe I'm like we got it these are beautiful okay their whole dusty right now sorry I didn't use my Swiffer I put this thing here because if you have to do you need to divide the room in my last department Harlem I had bunk beds Wow who bought the things you need to divide the rooms if you're in a studio so that's what I did with this we have a closet come on this is actually a massive this is a bedroom like and I swear if you like the design of this apartment I'm gonna teach you a few things number one the hangers are one of those things that you're like I'm not gonna buy okay yeah sorry I went into the club last night hangers hangers change the style these hangers I think I bought from like a big lots or something it was six for like ten don't just think that because they look nice at they're too expensive that's what we thought when we saw this building these beautiful windows are nice cuz the airflow comes in and I always have a family but then it's always so dusty in here wait till you see my kitchen table y'all I don't know this business from Walmart or Vestas black tables I've seen the boy cleanness and ten minutes later that's what we're working with we're coming into what Joe called boudoir again you can put a matthew singing i live in a one two three four i live in a five bedroom apartment look and there's even built-in mirror your invite you want to know why body fat okay that's where that wise see I could be buying a lot more stuff of t.j.maxx 20 welcome to the bathroom it's bathroom because the reason I love this bathroom is because I was a windows 3 palm trees another interior design tip from me and my HGTV watching and since clay plants everywhere like this is a plant that I try to shower with daily but now it's just dead and now it looks like this you can look outside did you ever wonder if people are looking at you this is like movie level what you getting back once people get back like this you know sometimes you're like a little naked at home when you get back here and now for the main event this is the entire apartment here again it looks really really really big but that's because we have a wide angle lens on you know and also compared your star trying to looking at this wall on your maybe two things one what the hell is going on with all these frames I have nothing in and or two damn that looks pretty cool what about that that I like that on the floor the secret you gotta have different shapes if you had just squares on the wall is we can look it's cool maybe maybe but I wanted to start with this bad boy was $60 I want a big golden ear and I originally wanted a huge one and also every time I come over I take the best selfies in here is deal with me even literally walked up six flights of stairs with this couch in a box alone you know what that's really true I put this together I put that together this I swear will fall off the wall one day which is why typically I keep it down here this is his vehicle this is how he gets around in LA this in the 720 public five when we moved to LA we're like the number one thing we don't want a car I don't want to have to deal with parking gas tick tick you know I'm gonna get a ticket then the next thing is like us being apart oh wow sure I'm gonna get our guy car so this is actually where I sleep every night this is a Walmart couch for a $300 Hertz this is also a reason I put the bike down because who's trying to sleep like this you want to up the style game of your apartment you need a big rug and this rug I think it was $80 on Amazon I was gonna pair it with the runner the long one but I didn't have enough money in my account and if you get really close one you can see that I need to vacuum too you see that it's not vintage or rustic at all it's just dirty from afar it looks good when you get up close it looks a little cheap just like you from Walmart this is from Rome Market it's a linen curtain that I think cost $10 also all of my bedding is linen this skin will only touch linen white linen sheets are the secret because you feel like you're in the hotel this pillow I bought off Amazon it was kind of expensive $50 for this therapeutic pillow and you know you spent $50 on so many other things in your life all the time but we sleep every day I keep these windows open every day at all hours of the day air flow is key the main thing I liked about this apartment was all the light in here you walk in and there's tons of light three big windows north-facing that's a key detail well three big ones for small north-facing windows because if the Sun rises hold on let me think about this you're gonna burn me look at this okay right now there's a lot of smog in LA mhmmm such a great place to live on a good day you can see all the way to the Hollywood Hills and on a bad day you can't see anything everything a Damon's apartment was carefully chosen he's not an impulse buyer he made sure to plan like you saw this little silly table thing you wanted and you bought it you know when I walked in this apartment with Joe and push traveled away I knew exactly what I wanted I loved the hardwood floors the walls were cream yellow which we painted over slash Joe painted over because just I can bring the design I can't bring the freaking like the hard work no I see the hard labor I can do hard labor but you're not a handyman handy work get a lot of plants these ones are the cheapest and they're the easiest to take care of pathos peel thos they're not looking so hot because we left for a month so don't judge make sure you get some water globes cuz water globes are the way to keep them still alive so maybe you're like damn like that apartment looks nice it is nice until I have a faulty fire alarm yeah it does never work I purposely have this red stool here so I can get up here I don't at this point I've done this a thousand times he's been having problems with this for a year like that episode of friends were phoebe you know as a faulty one she hits it with a hammer we went to the train post the Melrose trading post words like a flea market they said this was from the Pacific Palisades and I'm like thinking it it's mine furnishing apartment cost money but once you furnish it nicely then you feel good in it and then you can make more money you know when you walk into Muji and it smells really really good it's cuz they have probably 50 of these going at the same time I bought this one off Amazon for $50 you get some little lavender oil sprinkle it in and it's good if you don't like candles some people don't like cameras cause it's too fake I had a face like that but now I'm back I'm alcohol harvest style tips stick to certain colors in your apartment my colors alack and whites emerald green and gold becoming for you style police lives in the worst neighborhood kitchens are the places that acquire the most appliances but give me appliance that we need to talk about right now is the magic moly I don't like small demon love smoothies draw some kale banana vanilla soymilk this is the reason why we don't live together anymore people I would wake up every day ATM came home last night it's a beautiful home this was my apartment everybody leave a comment below if you like the style of this apartment I paid $1,100 a month 1125 per month which I still cringe every time I write that number down but I do know that you're not gonna find anything like this in Los Angeles or New York or Paris also on utilities included and it's rent stabilized and also get super hot as we can't have I almost got you nicked in you've got to click on my video to see what's up with my apartment and to hear how we actually found this building on one last thing here's a key tear up our mess at all now it's time for my apartment so we're buying subscribe hello and welcome to my 10,000 my wine is already kicking in my $1,000 studio come on 
- [In unison] Okay! - Five minutes on the clock. - Here's everything you need to know if you want to travel like Damon and Jo. Five minutes, let's do it! (upbeat music) There are three websites that Damon and Jo use all the time, every single flight. We got Skyscanner. - We got StudentUniverse.com - And Jetradar. - Okay, all of these three sites you need to book on with an incognito window so that
- Private browsing mode! - [Jo] They can't track your cookies so that you're guaranteed
the cheapest possible prices. - We've been using Skyscanner for years. So much so that we even emailed
them to partner with them and now you can book
flights on our website. - [Jo] Shutupandgo.travel/flights - Skyscanner has this
option where you can plug in your home airport and in the destination, you plug in the everywhere feature. - [Jo] Which means if you're flexible, you can get a list of
the cheapest destinations to go all over the world in your country. In the cities that are cheaper. - StudentUniverse is
good for anyone under 26 or if you're a student
or if you're a professor. You get special rates because you're young and you beautiful. - And even if you're not under 26, and if you're not a student
you can still book it. AKA Damon. - [In unison] And Jetradar! - Jetradar is that site that will give you these ridiculously long layovers
but the cheapest prices. - Next! Taking a flight is not the only way. You can take Megabus, you
can take Greyhound bus, you can take BoltBus. - And if you book so far in advance, you might even score a bus
ticket for a dollar, round trip. Okay, no, I'm exaggerating. - One way! - One way. - So two dollars round trip. - [Jo] Accommodations. Airbnbs will give you
sometimes weekly discounts, monthly discounts, so if you're staying for a long time check airbnb. Also if you're traveling in
groups that's the best way because it will end up being
a lot cheaper to get a room, or an apartment than
just to buy hostel beds. - A hostel is a place where
you book a bed in a room. So yes, you're technically
sleeping with other strangers in the room but these
strangers are cool ass people. Think of, like, we're
staying in the room with you and you'd rather spend
your money on other things. - And they always host
free events like pub crawls and concerts or whatever so
if you're traveling solo, hostels are probably your
best bet and the cheapest bet. If you're a little bit more upscale and you need to stay in a
hotel, check Hotel Tonight. - Some of you might be watching this like, oh y'all are travel bloggers, of course y'all can travel the world. That ain't true! - We were Damon and Jo traveling before Damon and Jo on YouTube traveling. - You can be a flight attendant, you can be an English teacher abroad. - You can be an au pair, you
can be a volunteer at a hostel. - House sitter! - One time Damon actually
reached out to a hostel to see if he could volunteer in exchange for a bed and they let him! - I randomly worked at the bar of a hostel in exchange for accommodation
which ended up being cheaper than my lifestyle here
in the United States. - Right, so we have
options here with jobs. - I taught English once in Italy to sleep in a family's home. - If you just want to
travel but you don't know what you want to do, you're
willing to do whatever, go to helpx.net Look at the country you want to go to and there will be a job for you. - Or WWOOFing which is where you work in the natural agriculture
- Like on a farm. I still want to do that. - Me too! - For free accommodations
in, like, Sweden! - Or you could be a study abroad advisor for a study abroad program, abroad. That was my literal back up plan! If YouTube didn't work out,
I was going to be working for John Cabot University abroad as their study abroad coordinator. - Ah! I quit, I want a new job! - [In unison] Money! - Money management, my favorite topic. - Chase Sapphire! - By the way, this is
not a sponsored video but we are telling you our gift to you. - Y'all need to know, we
just want to help out. - So Chase Sapphire is
our favorite travel card because one, there are no
international transaction fees. Two, every time you spend money on travel or dining at restaurants,
you get two times the points. - There's really no
point in using cash ever because you might as well
get points for ordering Just make sure to pay
your credit card off. - If you're looking for another option for a credit card, look
at airline credit cards. A lot of them like
American Airlines will have an American Airlines
CitiBank Advantage card. Which any time you spend
money, you'll get points towards American Airlines'
frequent flyer program. Which means just by
spending regular money, all of a sudden you're
upgraded and you get free bags and you get access to lounges because you're partnered with their credit card. Some of them will give
you free global entry which includes TSA pre-check so you zoom through security lines. - Never even used it for
like the first five years. We just got that.
- So stupid. Next! - Frequent flyer miles. Okay there are three main alliances and there's 20 airlines partners in each. It's super confusing. Find the alliance with the
most amount of partners that you travel with. For maybe five years,
we didn't even do it. - We didn't even do it and it's stupid! - We didn't track anything. We were, like, why are
we going to track it? - I travel on so many different airlines. - We'll just take the cheapest one. - You get perks like free
baggage, lounge access, just for flying with
those alliance partners. Make sure to pick an alliance, join now. It's always free. They're going to give
you some spammy number. Every single time you fly on that airline or with one of their alliance partners, you get miles for flying. - I used to have a frequent flyer number for American Airlines and British Airways and I would do them but they're
both on the same alliance! So I was doing myself a disservice. - Right, you could have just used the American Airlines
number on British Airways. - And gotten all the points! - On American Airlines,
- Too much for five minutes! - Anways, and that's it! - Time! (buzzer rings) So who understood stuff? Did you guys even understand that? - Don't forget to click in
the description box below if what we said was a little too fast. - It was way too fast but guess what? There's a replay button. - There's a replay button and a blog that has all of these links. - If you're subscribing to
us, you probably already knew a lot of these things

That's all we have for you today, I'm Jo. - And I'm Damon. - And we're Damon and Jo, [In unison] we'll see you next time! - Au revoir! No, no, you say it.
