⭐️ This super fit woman is Lizzy. Lizzy is a beautiful member of my FIT family. She was going through some really tough times in her life and wanted to channel her energy into something positive. Like many people  myself included Lizzy turned to healthy eating and exercise. I can't emphasise enough how much of a difference in my life making the healthy positive change made. You can see by Lizzy's pics it made a huge difference to hers too. Well done Lizzy you look incredible :) xx

"Heya! I am thrilled to be a successful follower of the life changing Emily Skye F.I.T. program! I began my health journey soon after my Mum passed away. At the time I was so lost and suffering debilitating depression and anxiety. I didn't even know what healthy eating meant  and couldn't tell you what a good workout felt like. Looking for something to fill my day  I started by running every week and I developed a love for it! I soon realised I needed structure and winging it just wasn't working. This was when I decided to take the plunge and buy Emily's program. During Phase 1 was when I saw my biggest changes  and I was hooked! Not only was I quickly seeing physical changes  but mentally I was becoming stronger every day. 
I was lucky that I could manage my depression with exercise  and I couldn't ask for a better support group than the amazing girls in the F.I.T. family. I also love that the workouts have both gym and at home options for when I need a day at home 🙂

Happy International Women’s Day from Mia and me! 💕 
We arrived in Adelaide (South Australia) today and took Mia to the beach for the first time ever but she slept the whole time haha! 😴😝

I just wanted to say how amazing you all are - I’m so grateful to be surrounded by so many beautiful  kind  supportive women from all around the world! 
Women supporting and uplifting each other. - Exactly how it should be I think!
Strong women encourage others to do what they want to do and be who they want to be!

You don’t lose anything by showing kindness and support to other women - in fact you have everything to GAIN!

I believe in accepting others and celebrating our uniqueness and being able to be who we truly are without feeling afraid or ashamed. 

- These are things I wish to instil in Mia so she can grow up to be a strong  kind woman who’s accepting and supportive of others. ☺️💗

Keep being amazing all of you beautiful ladies! Sending lots of love to you all! 😘

⭐️ This gorgeous woman is Ferah. I think it's amazing that by including weight lifting into her routine Ferah not only looks fantastic. She's also put on 3kgs in the process. I really think this is something to celebrate. Far to often women are obsessed by the number on the scale. Not realising that you can actually look a whole lot better by building shape and putting on muscle. The scale is just a silly number. Ferah is a great example of all the benefits of the weightlifting in my F.I.T program. You've done so well Ferah to stay consistent and dedicated. Your amazing physique is a reflection of all your hard work! :)

"Today marks my 1 year fitness journey! Here are the before and after shots of exactly 1 year! I'm feeling much healthier  fitter and stronger. In my first pic I weighed 61 kg  I now weigh 64!! That's an extra 3 kg of muscle haha. Also please note  in my first images (when I was bigger) I was actually sucking in my stomach a fair bit for the photo as my belly was quite big but in the new image I'm not sucking in anything at all!!"

3 Ingredient Pancakes with Sweet Sticky Topping

INGREDIENTS

1 ripe large banana  mashed
3 large eggs  lightly whisked
1⁄2 tsp baking powder
2 tsp pumpkin seeds
2 tsp sunflower kernels
1 tbs walnuts  roughly chopped
2 tsp goji berries
2 tsp honey
3 strawberries  cut in to quarters
1⁄4 cup Greek yoghurt

METHOD

Add banana  eggs and baking powder to a small mixing bowl  whisk together until well combined. Set aside for 5 minutes.

Heat a small saucepan over medium heat  add pumpkin seeds  sunflower seeds  nuts and goji berries and toast for a few minutes. Add half the honey to pan  stir to coat and remove from heat.

Heat a non-stick fry pan over medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons of batter to pan  cook for 2 minutes  until golden underneath and starting to puff up. Carefully flip and cook for an additional 2 minutes.

⭐️ This beautiful mum is Zhara. It can be really hard for mums to get back into it after having a baby. Especially if you haven't been particularly active before giving birth. The great thing about the FIT family is that there's thousands of mums from all over the world who have gone through the same thing! I'm glad Zhara has been able to achieve her goals with the help of all the amazing women in our community. You look incredible Zhara! xx :)

"Hi I am Zhara  i have been a member of Emily Skye's for over a year.
The first pic was taken 2 months post baby number 2 with the second pic 4.5 months after.
I bought phase one and two   Emily's programmes truly changed my life ! The online support group gave me the motivation i needed as a stay at home mum at the time  having like minded support every day helped me to stick to the program. These programmes not only teach you how to train  and eat well  but on a far more deeper level of learning to love and respect the skin we live in.
Once you achieve that  there is no turning back!!! It is a way of life not a "quick fix" 1 year on and i am still benefiting from what i gained from Emily's Programmes."

I spend most of my days either in my PJ’s (when I’m working from home) or in super casual/comfy clothes and a messy bun. I barely ever do my makeup and hair - in fact I’d be lucky to wash my hair once a week (it’s such a looong process)! 😂
I had a photo shoot and a meeting today so I did myself up and decided to put an old dress on and see how it fit. I’ve had it for a year but never got to wear it because I ended up getting pregnant and couldn’t fit it! 😝 I’d bought a heap of clothes online that I never got to wear and still can’t wear most of them because I don’t fit them.. and they may never fit which is totally fine by me.. it just gives me a reason to get a whole new wardrobe! 😃🙌🏼 What do you think Declan - should we go clothes shopping this weekend? 😂 ...Yeah right!

Anyway my verdict is I’m quite happy with how the dress fit me. I still have a little pudginess (is that a word?) on my belly but overall I’m happy with how my body has recovered so far and I’m really enjoying doing my FIT Program. 

One of my biggest downfalls is I can be really hard on myself and expect too much of myself - I’ve just gotta cut myself some slack and appreciate everything I am and everything I have - I’m very blessed. ☺️🙏🏼

⭐️ This stunning girl is Tammy. It really makes a difference when you surround yourself with supportive people. Achieving goals that can be difficult are made somewhat easier when you have an environment of supportive people to help you along. Tammy found the FIT family was just what she needed to get her motivated and back on track. Well done Tammy you look fantastic!! xx

"I'm so grateful for Emily and her amazing inspiration  especially the inspiration from all the other ladies who are on the same journey.

10 weeks postpartum progress check! 

It’s hard to notice changes when you see yourself everyday. I’ve been really consistent with sticking to my FIT Program and Declan told me that I’m looking great and getting leaner. I couldn’t see it myself and said “no I’m not” - Dec then told me to stop being so hard on myself and that I’m not seeing what he’s seeing. He said to go take some progress pics and look at them - So I took these today and I can see a difference! I AM getting leaner and my tummy is coming in! Every day I’m feeling stronger  fitter and more energetic! 😃

When you start seeing & feeling results it’s the best motivation to keep going! Usually it just takes a little while to actually start seeing changes but you’ve just gotta keep at it!

Well don't Bryana you look out of this world!!!

"It has been an amazing 2 months and my life has completely changed! I live by clean eating now and have totally changed my view of exercise also! My confidence has skyrocketed and I see myself in such a more positive light. Yes there has been moments that I have wanted to stay in bed  to quit  to binge  but despite a few slip ups (we are all human!) I have stayed strong and motivated! I got my priorities in check and it has made a huge difference! I have been working towards goals  staying away from the scales (they don't measure fitness  or anything other than your relationship with gravity!)  and creating a happier and more confident version of myself! Thank you Emily for creating such an amazing shred!!

I took Mia for a swim today and I was able to fit into one of my pre-baby swimsuits yay! When tracking my progress I like to go by how I feel  measurements and how clothes fit  so I’m happy to be back in my old swimmers thanks to being consistent with following my FIT Program! 😊 
Out of curiosity I jumped on the scales a few times today and my weight changed over a kg in one day - this is exactly why I don’t believe your weight is a good way to track progress. Your weight will go up and down throughout the day/week/month depending on how much you eat (food weight)  how regularly you go to the bathroom  how much you drink and retain fluid  fat loss  your cycle and muscle gain (which weighs more than fat per area).
Tracking your progress according to what the scales say usually doesn’t help you because if you go up on the scales it can make you feel disappointed and can lead to feeling unmotivated. 
Focus on how you feel mentally and physically  go by your measurements and how your clothes fit to track your progress. 👍🏼😃. Trial my FIT Program for the 1st week FREE: https://www.emilyskyefit.com/

⭐️ This beautiful girl is Mia. I think one of the biggest motivating factors in my life has been people telling me that I can't do something. Mia experienced this also during her health and fitness journey. All to often it's the people closest to you that will try and bring you down and say that you're taking it too far. There's nothing "too far" about wanting to live a healthy and active lifestyle. I guess its a case of "misery enjoys company!" Mia didn't let these people hold her back and is out there achieving her goals. Well done Mia you're incredible! xx :)

"9 weeks ago I decided I was going to change myself. I was not taking care of my body and it started having a serious affect on my mind. I'd been following Emily Skye's workouts for a while and saw her program advertised. Best money I've ever spent.Thank you  Emily and FIT community for supporting me through this when I have so many people in my life telling me I can't. It's been life changing and I look forward to continuing this journey! ❤️ Mia from Boston  USA"

⭐️ This inspirational woman is Michelle. Michelle's story is really something that strikes a chord with me. I know all to well about the feelings of self doubt as well as low self esteem. Michelle showed fantastic inner strength to make the decision to change as well as pulling herself out of that dark horrible spot. Well done Michelle I really admire your determination. You've done so well!! :) xx 

"Self hatred. I am sure we've all experienced this on some level. Through bad relationships  media and/or your own inner voice  we sometimes give into the notion that we are not good enough. But you have to get up every single day and say "Screw that". Learn to love yourself by living life how you want  setting goals and reaching them on your own terms  by realising that you contribute to the human race by being uniquely you. Through increasing my outer strength and stamina  I am finding it easier to diminish my fears  fight my inner demons and I now celebrate my victories.Because every victory is important. I am proud of what I have accomplished even though most days my self doubt rears it's stubborn head and tells me in it's deafening tone "you're disgusting and fat and no one will ever love you again  just give up". But I won't and I want every one of you to give yourself a congratulatory hug. You are amazing and have done a great job.

Just taking a quick pic to check my progress and yes that's a massive mess behind me hahaha. Being a mum is a super tough job as I'm finding out. Trying to keep the house neat and tidy right now is even harder hahaha. One thing I am really trying to do in amongst all the craziness is take some time out and work on me. For me that's training as regularly as I can. To be honest I'm not setting any specific times. As soon as Mia is asleep is usually when I'm putting my gym gear on  turning the TV on and following one of my FIT at home workouts. It's been a pretty successful formula so far  and I'm really quite happy. No doubt though as soon as Mia changes my workout routines will also need to change and adapt.

Physically speaking I will never be the same (which isn’t a bad thing) and I’m making the most of what I’ve got. I’ve still got loose skin on my belly but my abs are beginning to make a comeback - which shows me that what I’m doing is working (following my FIT Program)!

Some people misunderstand my reasons for living a fit and active lifestyle and think it’s “selfish” because I’m now a mum.  Being fit  strong and healthy is important to me mainly because of how it makes me feel. And if I feel good I’m happy  and I’m a much better mum to my daughter Mia and a better partner to my man Dec and so on. 
I also like being strong for myself because I like it and I love the look of a strong physique! My focus is always on being healthy but I like to look good too and there’s absolutely nothing wrong with wanting to look good!! I’m not sure why there seems to be a stigma attached to wanting to look good. As long as I’m not ever sacrificing my health to look a certain way and as long as it doesn’t negatively affect my family I don’t see anything wrong with it - in fact I see everything RIGHT with it!
Do what makes you happy regardless of what anyone else thinks - as long as it doesn’t directly hurt anybody. - These are words I live by and what I’ll instil in my daughter. The last thing I want is for her to live to please others (like I used to) - there is a difference between showing love and doing nice things for people and trying to constantly please others at the expense of your own happiness.

This lifestyle makes me happy so I’m going to keep living it and I encourage you to live a life that makes you happy too. 😃

What makes you happy  and are you doing it?. Like a lot of people I'm a real coffee lover. But like anything it has it's positives and negatives.

Same body but different than before.. actually scrub that  it’s BETTER than before! 😃😝 I’m 2 months postpartum over 3 weeks into my FIT Program and I feel stronger and more capable than ever! I’m so proud of what I’ve achieved physically and mentally.
Pregnancy  giving birth  taking care of my baby Mia  running my business and getting my fitness back is not easy but I feel incredibly blessed to be able to do it all. ☺️
Making the time to exercise is a gift to myself and my family because it makes me a better and happier person for my loved ones and I feel I’m a much better mum to Mia. I personally believe we’re able to take care of others a lot better when we take care of ourselves also.

My gorgeous little girl Mia is 2 months old today. We spent the afternoon laughing  playing and paddling outside in the pool. It's crazy how fast she's growing. Every day Dec and I are noticing something new that she's doing which is so cool to experience!

Body update: While Mia is growing I'm shrinking haha! 😂 My training has been going great. I've been sticking to the home workouts from my FIT program so far but this week I'm hoping I'll be able to get to the gym to start the gym training program. All my body measurements are coming down week by week and I'm feeling really good! 
The hardest thing for me so far has been correcting my posture and retraining my core to be tight and strong. So often I'm finding that my tummy just wants to hang out. I have to be conscious of it all the time otherwise my posture isn’t good and my belly sticks out and I look like I’m 4 months pregnant! 🙈  It's something that I was expecting to happen after giving birth  but I didn’t imagine it being this hard to retrain myself. I have to keep reminding myself that it took 9 months to grow Mia so it’s probably going to take at least the same amount of time for my body to recover. 😊

Persistence and patience is key! 😉👍🏼. Sometimes the only one standing in your way from achieving success is yourself. Positivity and being positive can sometimes take practice. Here's some tips to help you achieve a positive mindset :). Trial my FIT Program for the 1st week FREE:

⭐️ This stunning girl is Charlotte. Charlotte has for a number of years battled anorexia. Anorexia is such a serious condition that so many women have to live with. Charlotte is extremely brave to have shared her story with everyone and I really thank her for it. She's such an inspiration for me because I know when I was younger I really struggled with my relationship with food and my body image issues. It's so amazing to see Charlotte overcome her battle and be flourishing after it. I'm so proud of you Charlotte! xxx 

"Hi Emily and all you lovely ladies. My name is Charlotte and my transformation is a slightly different one. I have struggled with my weight for a long time. I was diagnosed with anorexia when I was 15 years old and hospitalised twice over the space of 5 years because of it. I hated myself  my body and my life and struggled to find reason to live. I thought i started to get my life back but then relapsed and was back to square one. When I reached 19 years of age I then began to realise this is no way to live. I wasn't living  I was only just existing. I battled my demons as hard I possibly could and gradually started putting weight back on and I began to feel happier and healthier. I discovered Emily's guides which have helped me so very much and it's because of Emily and all the support from friends and family that I am where I am today. I just want every person out there with an eating disorder to see this is and know that it does get better  I promise. Although i will always have my bad days i will never stop fighting. Im 21 now and I never thought I'd be where I am today. So thank you Emily Skye  So much! This is really the only comparison I have... thank you for reading 😊 xx"

Another day getting it done because we all know persistence pays off! I'm not going to lie  I'm pretty happy about being able to get into some of my pre-pregnancy clothes. 😁
I'm not a big fan of weighing myself and truth be told I haven't weighed myself once since I started back training after giving birth. Being able to fit into clothes that I was wearing 9 months ago is enough of an indication that I'm on the right track. All in all I'm really happy about my results a little over 3 weeks after starting my FIT program. The women in the FIT forum have been great and super motivating. I'm really looking forward to seeing how I progress over the next few weeks after upping the weights! 😁👊. Fartlek or interval training is a great way to burn fat.

⭐️ This gorgeous woman is Ravsan. You don't have to have a background in sport or have any previous experience in the gym to appreciate lifting weights. Ravsan went from a total beginner to someone who has fallen in love with weight training. Good thing to know that my FIT programs is they're jam packed with weight lifting :) Well done Ravsan with sticking at it. You're really enjoying the benefits now because you look incredible :) xx

"These are my results after phase 1! I love Emily's programs and they completely changed my mindset and body. They were the beginning to a healthy new lifestyle! I've never been the sporty kind of person at all and always thought that I won't ever be able to stick to something  achieve results and maintain them. Well guess what? I've been lifting weights for almost 2 years now and I'm the happiest I've ever been! Not only is my body stronger than ever  I am too!"

It took having my baby Mia for me to be truly grateful for my body and to be proud of myself and what I’m capable of. 💗

Declan took this pic the day we brought Mia home from hospital! Everything was a blur back then and I was in the middle of post baby blues - I felt abnormal and alone (even though I wasn’t). I knew I was so blessed but I couldn’t help feeling really down for no reason! I thought I was supposed to feel overwhelmed with happiness and I felt guilty for feeling this way. My hormones were haywire  I was severely sleep deprived and questioned whether I was cut out for this whole “being a mother thing”. - All I knew was I loved Mia more than anything. 💗
Luckily these negative feelings passed within a couple of weeks. 🙏🏼 My hormones levelled out and I’m sleeping pretty well now. I love being a mother to Mia and I know I’m a fantastic mother to her. ☺️ I had no reason to doubt myself - but I guess we all do from time to time. 

I’ve been blessed with the most INCREDIBLE baby girl! Everyday I fall more and more in love with her... and it’s a love I could have never imagined before.  Having her has changed my life  my mind and my body pretty dramatically and I wouldn’t want it any other way. I’m truly grateful and proud of myself. 🙏🏼😃🙌🏼

Remember - you are more capable than you think you are. Don’t ever be afraid to reach out and ask for help. You are not alone. 😘💗

One of the lovely ladies in my forum (Laura) posted this pic of me in my FIT Forum. These 2 pics were taken about 2 weeks apart. The pic on the left is my first workout back after getting the all clear from my doc to start training again after giving birth. The pic on the right is from a couple of days ago :)

One of the things I really wanted to do with my particular fitness journey was document absolutely everything. I'm going to be sharing regular updates and my experiences along the way :)

I'm following the at home workouts from my FIT program at the moment until I work up to being able to start in the gym again. From that point I'll pick up the in gym FIT workouts. I've also been really consistent with my diet and I'm using the "building muscle" food plan from the FIT program as it's a little more calories which is important while I'm still breast feeding.

To be honest I haven't stepped on a scale once and I don't plan to at all. Pics like these are all the motivation I need. All of my body measurements are coming in and I'm starting to lose a little of my jiggle and inflammation. I've also seen a significant increase in my strength and energy levels which I'm also really happy about.

It's also been really heart warming to have the support of the tens of thousands of ladies from all over the world in the FIT forum. The messages of support I've been receiving daily from so many beautiful ladies has been amazing and its something I'm so grateful for xx. Are you eating healthy?

Another home workout done! I filmed some of it and put them in my IG stories. It wasn’t easy but I feel great now. 
I’m feeling on top of the world lately! These workouts are giving me more energy  my mind is clearer and I’m a much happier person! I missed this feeling so much while I was pregnant. I loved being pregnant even though I was so heavy and in pain but I was looking forward to feeling fit and strong again - nothing compares! (besides Mia of course 😝).
I’m so excited to be on my way back... I may even end up fitter than before! 😃 I am stronger mentally than I’ve ever been and mental strength is the best kind of strength because it means you can do pretty much anything you set your mind to. 👊🏼😉. Trial my FIT Program for the 1st week FREE :)

⭐️ This amazing woman is Victoria. Travelling can be really tough especially if you're trying to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Good food options aren't always available which can make life difficult. Victoria has also had past experience with appetite suppressants which didn't address the issue at all. I'm so glad to have Victoria as a part of the FIT Family. Reaching your goal is so much easier when you have thousands of women behind you every step of the way. She's done such a fantastic job and I'm really proud of what Victoria has achieved!

"After getting back from 5 weeks in USA I was topping the scales at 81kg the heaviest I had been before. I was getting frustrated as some of my favourite clothes didn't fit so I knew what I had to do but didn't have the confidence in myself to do so. My GP wanted to see me lose weight so prescribed my appetite suppressants! This did nothing. I loved exercise but I also loved to eat! I was watching the Emily Skye Facebook page for ages and just completed phase 1 today. I used the fit on a budget meal plan as I am not on the highest wage. I also indulged in Easter eggs and hot cross buns yesterday and i would have a sliver of cake if there was a birthday so I could have done better but am proud of my results! 5 kg lost I am now at 76kg. 7cm home from my waist  6cm from my butt and 6cm from my thigh and only 1cm from my bicep. Emily Skye fit has completely changed my relationship with cooking and nutrition. I love cooking and would eat veges but always used sauces and meal based high in sodium and sugar. I am now inspired to always cool clean and from scratch  I realise it is not that difficult and enjoy finding new recipes online. Hubby has lost 8kg too just from eating what I cook and cycling to work  and the GP was proud of the results we got from this programme and may suggest it to other patients. What a fabulous journey xx"

Here's a front squat tutorial I filmed a few months ago while I was pregnant. I get asked questions quite regularly about front squat technique. It's also an exercise I really enjoy doing. I've had neck problems for many years and I find the front squat is a great exercise that doesn't result in my neck being irritated. Quite often I find that I get a sore neck after doing back squats.

I just finished another midnight workout from my FIT Program. I try to get my workout in earlier but Mia doesn't allow that haha! I have goals I want to achieve and I won't achieve them if I'm not consistent with my workouts and healthy eating so I've committed myself - no matter what time it is. I feel so much better now that I'm back working out. I really missed it during the last trimester of my pregnancy (I literally could barely stand up and walk around the house let alone train!)
I'm taking it 1 day at a time and feeling better every day!
I 100% believe in myself and I KNOW I will get fit  strong and healthy again! :D - My dedication will get me there! :)

For me this whole “snap back” idea is unrealistic - it’s taking me hard work  consistency and patience. 
I’ve got a saggy belly  extra body fat  cellulite  stretch marks & I’ve lost a lot of muscle but my abs are still under there when I flex my butt off haha! 😝 I’m 2 days into my FIT Program and I’m doing the home workouts and I’m feeling absolutely amazing! The endorphins are real! 😃🙌🏼

Becoming a mum has changed me in so many ways. Some changes are positive and some could be seen as negative but I’m choosing to focus on the positives and the things I can control - such as working out and eating healthy. 

Many people have told me things like: “your body is ruined” and “your body will never be the same”.  - You’re right  it will be BETTER! 😝😃 

The best strength you can have in my opinion is mental strength and I’m much stronger mentally than I’ve ever been and I believe I can do whatever I set my mind to.
I WILL get fit and strong again and I’m gonna have a rockin bod to match!

But it can be really tough to get back into it afterwards. Emily has done a brilliant job and is a great example for all mums wanting to get fit and healthy :)

"I started Phase one 8 weeks after having my second child. (January 2016) I had always been fat-skinny  never in great shape and I wanted to make a change. I wanted to look better and feel better but now I want to see what I am capable of- how hard I can push my body. It's been 10 months and I am happier and healthier than ever. Until a 3 weeks ago all of my workouts have been done at home which just proves that you don't need fancy equipment or an expensive membership  just some motivation and drive!"

Soloff to melbourne on another plane again so we're trying to get everything ready and packed deck packed in about five seconds but I take a lot longer even though I do this probably every week almost still not that good at it I have an event for Good Life health clubs and then I think we fly back really early in the morning at like five or six si and then go to Brisbane and fly out of there I don't know I don't really know what's going on I would ask my manager see him because he organizes everything for me and I suck at getting myself organized going to LA New York and Boston again I think yeah I'm not really sure exactly I just literally let Sam and Dec organize all that sort of stuff because if I think about it all I just get confused because there's so much going on so I've got a lot of meetings to go to while over there and some photoshoots and things like that so it should be exciting looking forward to it just got to get myself back now which is not too fun this deodorants really good by the way it's it's all natural so there's no no babies in it so nothing that's going to hurt your underarms no aluminium all natural like almond oil and coconut oil and things like that so pretty good alright I'm up in Adam I'm going to go off and get some spare batteries for my camera because I don't think this one's going to last too long Dex just put some soup on for me we made pumpkin suit the other day it's amazing so it's just heated it up and made me a coffee isn't he the best boyfriend ever sailor just like fire you be looking at I'm really going to well is it Oh God so hard because I'm trying to pack to go to the States as well as Melbourne I don't know what I'm gonna need I don't know what the weather's like the joys of the traveling alive I call myself the traveler the ending Oh young y'all what is it dick ah looks like pee delicious food is on cinnamon her en tie-dye chicken sounds good as this storm there is literally a massive storm coming I'm going back inside I'm having a coffee deck made me mum yes I drink coffee at night because I usually don't go to bed till crazy o'clock and I actually sleep better when I've have has some coffee in my system so and I've got my name on it so don't forget my name but yeah I'm still packing it's a bit of a nightmare I haven't really gotten to too far but uh I sort of him I mean I'm thinking about it a lot better now sighing she comes somewhere why I always capsize turn all that h1s lays out I'm not gonna be sizing you Jess - touching my face I mean because we want to inside right you're inside it's fine yeah there'd be like so cool take hub so dick and I were at home and the storm started going nuts and we just freaked out and thought oh now we can't get dessert but we made it out to bullies and now I'm trying to choose ice cream and it's a big good job it's really difficult altered look at this one Becky burnt fig honeycomb and caramel they just get too full on like with crazy do too much overs oh yeah yeah yeah you like that one it was good last time and I just melted some chocolate we've got an apple pie and ice cream so I've just got up and really worried about this storm and going to Melbourne and doing this event tonight because I'm worried that when we fly back in the morning we go to Brisbane and then we have a couple of hours before we fly to LA and it's the only flight we can get and if we miss that one then it's the next day we've butterfly tea because there's no other flights so Stan and I are trying to work out what to do whether to go or not I really want to go to this good life event in Melbourne but really anxious about this weather and really concerned about missing this flight so see what happens well I didn't sleep a wink last night because of these crazy weather back in bed I'm gonna have a shower started getting ready to go to the airport for Sam to come pick me up and then I got a call from him saying that we've canceled it so half of me is relieved the other half is disappointed because I really wanted to do this event in Melbourne for good life but sometimes you got to make these decisions and the most important thing is getting to LA I had to choose my safety I guess and in making this flight tomorrow so this is our spare room because our room is right like on the front of the ocean and the wind's hitting it's like straight on and all the the rains hitting it as well and it's making this annoying noise and I just can't sleep with that noise so full on I feel horrible I feel hungover so I'm back into bed and I'm gonna get a few hours sleep before well I guess I'm already packed for LA tomorrow so maybe I can work on some more vlogs and editing better get used to this new world of vlogging our vlog on air all right maybe not like yet I feel like it's something you sort of got it and any I don't even know what I'm talking about because I am so tired and as you can hear my voice is not too good and cracki and annoying more annoying than usual okay well I had about an hour-and-a-half sleep that came home and woke me up the storms still here and I also found out that the flight is a couple hours delayed anyway so I would have been late for tonight so it was a good call canceling going and now making my tea so in the mornings before I eat anything I have this it's a licorice root powder and it's really good this stuff because it kills Candida I get fresh ginger and I grate it soon and I also use some cinnamon put it all in the teapot that's brewing and I brew that for a bit I've bruised the right word but that's sit there for about 10 minutes so it can infuse and then I drink it but I put the licorice root in you know tea pot like this so it strains it so that you're not left with all the bits floating around because it's got quite a bit of texture and then I'm going to eat this the deck made me so it's chicken thigh marinated in coconut barbecue sauce and steamed zucchini and the reason I use all the time is because it's one of the only things that my tummy really likes and it's really easy on my tummy so chicken and fish seem to really good with my tummy and steamed veggies like this oh oh how good's my little path why do you cook for me and Dean Starla was gonna cook neat stuff you start yeah we put no we'd both starve if you didn't do it and I don't do it then go star she should merely be ready now there you go I actually really like the taste of this not some Dec not so this is what I have that helps me get rid of my bloating issue so I've got no bloating now which is really good when ads are actually starting to come back me they'd make an appearance one day soon you

number three in how to take a photo that was progressing regardless of mindful with an absolute zero but she's nice right like an encouraging teacher maybe she doesn't have a say over you should quit you can't smile in a photo you're the one that needs to learn you know selfie time because I can see my own face and so I feel like it's not as hard nothing you can see this what was it the other day when you can see on the phone okay you keep tricking me aplenty in the journal video used to good mole but I don't know that I can it's like when I can't see the camera yeah okay maybe photos doing first thing also later you playing at home okay let's just keep it man you can avoid this this one here right she's had to experience at it just in case you're watering so anyway I'm over the to the river cover of my life I knew he loved take my I'll be standing there in this photo she the other day me with fear and Palestine from I can see a rock policy they're firing shots like it's guarded a fashion like it's some sort of war and she's there you know arm this wave had this slow moving all over the place either boobs I'm a statue if I'm going to look like this that what I look like but then I was going well she's living started roofing but I'm thing you I don't have any other food like I don't have a sighting like it's a little movement you could fly with it yeah its sponsor year the you know there I was watching the hand on the air for the side fears of the hair and the whiteness of the faces we will either vote on any way back to listen I've got a drill lift in so wait what you've got to do first is if that establish where the lights coming from so you want to direct itself towards a lot you don't want to get in the light so I mean you don't have you outside with someone because when you have those harsh shadows underneath your eyes why use Jones cosmetics no I totally have out the book with it it's going to be even better than combining James in the good life so you preferably want to be English shattered putting the shade the dresser where you can buy James goes money who you actually you do anything to get out of it well you do at the checkout James to make soda Power Company Sam and I own it because we love it and eventually qualified beautician in case you guys didn't know I'm not because something and and the James cosmetics are those we have a lot of stuff coming really exciting stuff but we have under-eye clinical parents I wanna be here expand our good latch but it's true hated that's friend of one okay I know this is like tell the camera whether this is an audio if you're editing like that we just create sorry change the Lighting's really good here actually I you can do that later on a family Island give me a second hi we're back Stan's trying to do everything you can to get out of doing it okay so as I said you're on the stage you're in the shade but you've got a light source coming from somewhere preferably right in front of you that you think of it you've been coming at you if it's coming from up there it's going to create shadows coming straight at you to fill in lines and everything that's why sometimes photos repair brush that aren't actually a good lighting so towards a nice lighting is kind of got quite good lighting here but if we turned have the window lights out there might be slightly bad anyway go with this and then I'm going to make sure you look not doing this see you don't want to have double chin going on before the other go but not like this sometimes the end of this too much bacala making it nice and tall and it's slightly ever so slightly forward which you get through this and then you want to make sure you're either nothing though there are workshops you probably were uncomfortable traffic coming to your it can be probably uncomfortable things like makes your eyes open so printing keep the motor but not too open like oh do you headlights this is where I'm natural and then it's nice smile and keep keep it like a happy so they know I don't want my smile because of leaderless I'd still time at that time you'll ever think you out enough that you need to do anyway I think you're getting a little bit better but you can see myself this is a kale probably spent some time won't try anything you can't help it came if you look her doctor look like that is the other day which the complete design okay ready one two three I don't look at myself I mean if turn your head up differently here the treaty anyway enough about weaved if done the meetings some James Cosmetics meeting

yeah we'll tell you about the UM exciting meeting we just had [Music] 
well my shoulders feeling alright today but I don't know I just don't don't feel like training I don't know what's wrong with me I just feel off like I've lost my passion for it do you guys ever get like that where you have some time off training and you just don't feel like going and you just feel flat in your sleep yeah I almost feel depressed as you guys probably already know I've talked about it a lot I had really bad depression when I was younger I was actually put on antidepressants by my doctor from age 12 I think it was up until my mid-20s and I just found it didn't do anything for me it didn't fix it I just got fed up with it I got sick of feeling that way and I knew that it was up to me to do something about it so that's when I started exercising and eating healthier food and now I feel because I've barely trained literally barely trained in the last month I just I just I don't know I just feel crap I seriously feel down and I've talked about it before and I still believe it that eating healthy food and exercising really does help depression but it doesn't cure it's a way of managing it because I barely trained I I really can feel how much exercising does help me I need it and I just can't get back into it so I thought there's no point moping around at home feeling sorry for myself because I really have no reason to feel sorry for myself so I got out here went for a walk I just wanted to do this video because I I know that I'm positive a lot and most people are online they show their highlights you know the highlights of their life I want to be as real as possible with you and I don't want to just be su and put all positive stuff all the time I want to be real and express how I feel so here's something ruinous for you I'm feeling down in the dumps I feel like I'm unmotivated I don't want to train and I want to do anything on a sleep all the time on a cry all the time I just want you to know that if you feel anything like what I'm feeling now it's totally normal most people don't show it but everyone feels this way from time to time so don't think you're the only one and don't think you're abnormal because you're not it's normal can I be perfect at the time we're not perfectly humans so my advice to myself that I'm going to share with you is to have a cry if you need to I've had plenty of cries today feel what you feel do what you need to do to make yourself feel better if you don't want to go to the gym and train then don't if you want to eat chocolate then do it if you want to go running on the beach like I'm doing then do it and then push yourself into it get yourself moving get yourself to the gym get yourself eating healthier do what you know works and do what you know will help you and I feel bad for doing it I know I always think I'll I don't have a right to feel this way whatever I got to be upset about there's so many people out there that there's so much worse off than I am but we all do have a right to to feel sometimes so I'm gonna do this I'm gonna get back into it I'm gonna be feeling myself again hey guys just a quick update I'm still on the beach I've just been on the phone to a beautiful friend of mine Nikki who's been how I'm feeling is amazing and I just read some of your comments on my Instagram with your support and also expressing how you can relate to how I'm feeling reading some of your comments literally brought me to tears and it just shows me how many amazing people there are out there and you're all beautiful and I really appreciate you and I'm already feeling much better so I'm going to go inside now and maybe do some yoga might YouTube some yoga stuff I think that'll do me good

the people is it really big no hangover Oh got a nice little sunflower going on here so as you already know I caught up with DJ yesterday the rock and I went on set and watched him film ballers and then had a nice catch-up probably an hour an hour and a half chat and I mean obviously he's amazing he's achieved in his career and he's really genuine down-to-earth incredibly inspirational cares about people and I feel really really lucky that I was able to sit down with him and I guess have a bit of a DNN and to gave me a lot of advice inspired me even more gave me a bit of a different perspective to what I had before we all have things that we struggle with and and one of the things I struggle with is for a long time it was my confidence and my self-worth and while I have managed to really I guess overcome it or come to a point where I actually do believe that I'm worthy and I have got a lot more confidence now it's still something that comes up every now and then it's always in the back of my head and every time I go to do something that's quite big I get this negative voice in my head that tells me you're not good enough or who are you to think you can do this or you're not worthy or there's so many people out there that are better than you at this that are more knowledgeable that are better talking to camera and better talking to people and there's always someone better out there talking to a DJ yesterday it was really good because I was telling him about how I was rated number three like I told you guys the other day number three by full Fitness influencer in the world I can't believe that that's me there number three vote and I'm amongst elite other amazing people like how did this happen and yes I did set out to reach as many people as I could and spread a positive message but it's really hard to believe that this is real and this is actually happening and something I do struggle with and I don't know whether it's because for many years I did modeling before this and obviously it's very competitive in the industry we're very a very small amount of people actually are successful it's like acting and you're up against all the other people so it is a competition and it wasn't for me and it didn't really work with me I did struggle with insecurities all those years and depression and anxiety it sort of just added to that for me I have a lot of troubles being proud of myself and really owning what I've accomplished and like I was saying with them my whole modeling world I don't know whether it's stemmed from there because you have against so many people and you're going out so musical castings and most of the time you don't get it so there's no point getting your hopes up and it's sort of like I just I told myself not to get my hopes up because when you do you get let down a lot and that's sort of like something I've just always had in my head if you get your hopes up you get let down and I'd rather avoid getting let down all together so I wouldn't bother getting excited and I don't know whether that sort of numbed me in a way so I've numbed the bad but also numbs the good you can't experience joy and love and all the good things without experience all the bad things as well you need to experience both I'm not saying that I'm not appreciative and I'm not grateful for everything that I've got and been given and that I've worked hard for an accomplished day I really do appreciate it and like I said I'm blown away you know the Forbes thing is amazing and some doing a massive cover shoot in a few days probably the biggest one I've ever done and well it is the biggest and I just find it really hard to to accept that it's happening that it's me and that I that I deserve it I mean I've got to shoot my own shoe coming out with Reebok I have my own Emily sky trainer coming out and for some reason I don't know how to celebrate these um accomplishments that I've made I don't know whether it's because I see I fear all the climate people please I'm a natural people please I care what people think I try not to but I do everything that's happened in your life your experience all adds up into who you are now and how you feel now so because I do pop some negativity I'm not going to say a lot because it really isn't that much compared to what I see a lot of other people get but I do still receive negativity and it's human nature to Zone in on those negative comments and cut downs that people make so of course I focus on that and I might get thousands of lovely comments and I sort of overlook them and not that I don't appreciate them I appreciate every single person out there who's been supporting me and the beautiful comments they give me but I don't put up a photo or a video or whatever to get people to say I love you um you know you're you're attractive or whatever yeah I don't do it for those reasons that's not why I put the content up I do it because I want to try and help people and I want to want people to get something from it and I know that I do post you know selfies and bikini photos and blah blah blah I'm in a bikini right now but I mean if I'm going to play in the the big field of social media and trying to stand out from everyone else we're flooded with all these images I've talked about this before but there's so many photos out there but sometimes people post their highlight reels but I like to show a bit of both I don't they like to post a nice photo so I like to look good - I'd be lying if I said I didn't but my point is I post those photos because if you want to stand out you've got to post things actually stand out that a some stuff is and people aren't going to stop if I'm just you know take a photo of the tree over here and and say some motivational quote or like some story or something something I want to share something I think is valuable I mean people aren't going to stop unfortunately I wish I wish that was the case young girls especially are online searching for their goal body or people who have as a role model or you know body goals life goals use the hash tag family goals boyfriend goals whatever they searching pull that I don't know what it is that people seem to like the idea of having the perfect life like that the romance movie it's bullshit it doesn't exist we know that but in my experience I've found that if I don't post photos of my body as bad as that sounds I mean bad good I don't know I I love my body and I embrace every I embrace my imperfections why kind of you proud of that that I can be argue too that's my opinion but I post photos because it gets attention the girls are stopping on it I mean I've got an 80% plus following the females and all I supply my 15 millions with a lot of women out there and you can't please everyone and I I know that I guess what I tell myself is I'm able to reach millions of people and I do have a positive impact on people's life and that's my intention to help people can't control everything and I can't please them all so let's get back on top again I can talk a lot my brain runs at a million miles an hour and my mouth can't keep up but I have a lot of trouble being proud of myself and celebrating my achievements especially publicly they're always going to judge and criticize and I just I think I have this fear of what people are going to think and say and then how that affects me I mean I go up and down it's like a roller coaster sometimes I feel really confident I just go stuff stuff along but I'm not going to worry about what they're thinking I'm just going to post what I feel and what I love and what I'm experiencing and just put it out there and be me and then other times I stress I get anxiety and I let those thoughts and the negativity get to me and hold me back and stop me from doing what I love and what I set out to do several years ago I when I first started this I have important messages to share that I know from experience do help people and I have to keep doing it I need to to really focus on the positive and what I what I do and why I do it and the response I get and that I am able to help all these people over here and the people that I can't help the people that I can't please I mean it does matter because I do care about them but I just can't please mother to let go of that and my point of this is I think we should all be able to celebrate our accomplishments and you know reaching goals for me to be a good role model for you guys and for everyone else oh I should be I should be able to show that I'm proud of myself and um not fear it and set a good example of loving yourself and being proud of yourself and also knowing that you'll be worthy and believing in yourself yeah that's my message that's today's message I mean I went around in circles a bit the off topic a bit a lot I asked him what how he deals with everything and I mean he can't leave the house without getting bombarded by paparazzi and fans and everything any I mean he loves what he does that he can really tell that he loved his fans and he really appreciates them and shows that I'm curious about how he deals with it and said that years ago ouch how many years but years ago he was getting evicted and he had nothing and I'm decklist Tel Aviv before actually that he was really badly depressed I didn't know that but he was but he was getting evicted and uhm and he just remembers reminds himself of that and how things have changed and what he has actually been blessed with and what he's able to do now and he said he looked around because we're in the studio with our filming bowlers and they had the monster truck there and I just taken that out and everyone had sort of cleared out and I went after lunch and I'm DJ was just sitting there talking to Sam and me and and he said look look what I get to do something along the lines of I don't know works where I can't remember my memory isn't that good but he said look at all the people I have around me and what I get to do every day I'm so grateful for this and I think about the time when I was getting evicted and it's all worth it and I'm so grateful to do what I'm what I'm doing he said something like that and and while I knew this it was really good to have to just be reminded so yeah else gives a pretty good advice I mean he talked for a long time so there's a lot other stuff that really got me thinking and he also told me to to be I mean I am I'm always as real as I can be but sometimes I hold back a little bit because in that of that fear of being judged and what people say and think of me I just just mean I'm dealing with it I'm working on it guys but I'm going to put the camera down he was annoying me and he also said to to not hold back from being me and not be afraid to be 100% me and because I was paying too much least we're quite a lot I blamed BEC because he was in the army for 13 years and he has a really bad mouth a dirty mouth and I sort of adopted that so I've got a dirty mouth too and I swear a lot but I really try to hold back online because I don't want to offend anyone and I know that there's a lot of young people following me or mums with their teenage kids and I just I don't want to be a bad influence on them so I really hold back that DJ was saying that you know if swearing is part of me and I'm always conscious of not swearing and conscious of what I what I'm saying then I'll never truly be me and you always it's never really always like in the back your head thinking about that and I totally get it like I it's annoying not being at a fucking we're sorry but I do I swear a lot and I'm so to CJ and he can swear and carry on well yesterday it was pretty funny oh I think that's going to conclude this vlog [Music]

amazing so this is the 60 second ultimate treatment amazing you stuff can't live without it so I use that pretty much every time I wash my hair so what happens is usually I use this and then use use this conditioner and I rub that into my scalp because it's supposed to help you hear grow back nice and thick when I say grow back I mean like grow more and then I put this in the ends of my hair so I use it with that and the same goes with the purple shampoo when I put the conditioner in I just put that in the top parts of my hair and the brassy parts and then use these throughout the ends of my hair because it's an amazing treatment and it's so quick and easy to use so they're my shampoo good evening it's possible it I'm definitely not ready I'm trying to my hair back that process is that process is exactly why I only wash my hair once a week if that because it just takes me so long by the time I've washed blow dried and then strained it with a straightener oh my gosh it's like an hour and a half so now I'm going to use this I put this lash and brow revitalize are in my eyelashes and brows every single night it's best to stimulate growth and it's made with organic cast oil okay now that's done I'm going to go do my nails because I have had time to get them done properly so I'm sticking these on and I'm going to go and make a juice first so take my trusty truck I'm gonna show you how I make my super green healthy smoothie so I get a bunch of this what Chris a handful of neat leaves fresh mint leaves one lime squeezed an apple appealed Apple I just feel like it blends better it has a little beach through it and then I have probably about I'd say a quarter of a cup of a liver juice and then about a cup of coconut water oh the key Jumba what this is and that my BES is how you make my super green sweetie and I love the flavor some people get it it looks gross or it sounds gross all right it's not it's really good for you it's quite a pleasant taste quite pleasant even dick likes it Green goodness for you ducky that good I had an extra coconut water for you because you like it sweeter yeah yeah you like it a bit like soup no it's like more green goodness in there cream good totally boy yeah it's not supposed to be like it going out drink like a cocktail but like was grain goodness green goodness like nutrients okay it's goofy about a nutrients good for you all right so Dex gone to bed and I am sitting up it's like 2:30 in the morning and I'm trying to get my vlog up well I'm trying to finish it first and then get it up and I realized that the camera that I was using literally kept turning itself off in the middle of me doing a very important talk about very important things so now it's missing all the really good stuff I mean all of its good stuff obviously but there are ants and the things I wanted to talk about that I thought are important are all cut out so I'm gonna try and fill you in now and there's literally one part that's still left there so I'm gonna leave that in there blog for you and I'll try and fill in all the gaps that make sense so I was talking about how I'm going away to the US and that I don't really know what's happening and I've got meetings and I've got so events on but I don't know exactly what's going on and I actually prefer it that way so Sam who's my manager he organizes all these events for me and collaborations with different brands and brands that are suitable for me and brands that I believe in that I agree with and that we um we both have similar ethos and beliefs what I did say in the video that didn't record is how I have had a lot of different companies come to me and brands come to me you know throwing all sorts of money at me to do things but they they're things I don't believe in and it doesn't actually make sense and I just I don't see the point in throwing away my integrity for the money and I've never been about that and I never want to lose that I think it's really important to do things for the right reason and not just because you're gonna get money for it and I think once you choose to do things for just money I mean we all have to earn a living we all have to make money and it's totally fine to make money from something that you love but if you're sacrificing your integrity and your beliefs and your morals and and good intentions for money then I think it's the wrong thing but that's just my opinion each their own you do what you want to do okay so I'm going to the u.s. Sam's been organizing all the meetings and I know what's going on a lot of the time but that's the way I like it because I tend to stress out a lot I overthink everything and get anxious and if I know something's coming up I get really bad anxiety and thinking about things that are coming up and that anticipation of events and things that are happening I I deal with very well so I prefer not to know too much about things and I like to be spontaneous and I have things I guess dumped on me even though I'll complain and say oh no you can't dump these things in me at last minute I actually prefer it because then I don't have the time to stress about it and I've got a lot of issues with sleeping I've always been like that since I was a kid like it's probably close to 3:00 a.m. now and I'm still awake because I just function better in the middle of the night so if I have something one if I have an event on something that takes me out of my comfort zone Saturday night I'm doing something where I've got to actually get up on stage in front of a lot of people and talk and that's like one of my biggest fears and normally I'd be stressing like crazy about it but I've literally only had found out about it today I knew I was gonna be doing something but I didn't know I was gonna be actually doing like an interview type of thing on stage I don't like having that time you know having weeks leading up to something where I I know something's coming I anticipate it and then I can't sleep and I can't function and I get all that anxiety crap happening and it's really horrible so I like not knowing all these things that's why I have people like CMU organize stuff and I just focus on the other thing is that I'm actually good at and it's not organizing stuff tomorrow on Saturday Sam and I are going to Melbourne I do this event for good life so all my workout classes my functional training classes are in all the good life health clubs throughout Australia so I'm doing an event for them to tomorrow night Saturday night and that's what I'm going up onstage and I'll be doing some questions and things like that talking to the crowd so it should be should be fun as I was saying before it's something that really does get me out of my comfort zone it's something that normally I'd be really scared about because it's like my biggest fear and and I'm fine with it I've overcome it and I still get nervous of course I do but I guess one of the things that helped me get over that is to realize that everyone is a human though everyone's human everyone makes mistakes nobody's perfect and I used to always put this pressure on myself to be perfectly perfect to get things done perfectly and to talk perfectly and never make a mistake and putting that pressure on me actually makes me stuff up more and I don't perform well in anything no matter what it is no matter what I do I'm not able to perform well if if I have that pressure on myself to do it perfectly so I've let go of that and I just realized that everyone who's there who's watching me whether it's on this on YouTube or whether it's on my facebook Instagram snapchat whether it's on stage whether it's on TV radio whatever everyone who's watching that or listening isn't perfect either and I find one of the things that really connects humans with other humans is obviously to relate and be real with people and to be vulnerable and to show your flaws and show your mistakes and and show that that you're not perfect I think people like to see that because no one is and I I know myself if I see someone else it's not like I like to see people screw up but if I see someone else who isn't obviously perfect and and does make mistakes it doesn't make me feel better about myself because I think they like me and I make mistakes too and and I can relate to them and I like that so I do think when you're when you show vulnerabilities and you take away I guess your facade your masks that you know we all will have it at times some people have more than others and when we take that away I feel like we can really connect with other people and and that's something like I'm really interested in now I'm really interested in sounds like a real interest but it was something that I used to really fear for a long time and I'm 31 now so it's taken me a while to be able to to do it but I guess it was just that whole fear of fear of being vulnerable fear of people seeing me for who what you really am and for thought my you know my flaws and how I really look or how I really act or my true personality having people see those things it's it's not easy because you are shoving it all and and if someone judges you and doesn't like you want you if they don't like you because of those things and they it's who you truly are and you do you do for vulnerable so it's it's my favorite word right now vulnerabilities being vulnerable but it's a good thing because like I said showing vulnerabilities helps us connect with other people and that's what I think life's all about our connections and the relationships that were able to form with other people and whether it's online or in real life or it's your family your friends people you meet on the street or people coffee shop whatever I think those connections are important and humans need connection it's how we it's how we function it's what makes us happy and if we can be more real with people I think we will be able to be happier so that's the end of my little rant I think it's time that I went to bed because I have a lot to do tomorrow and I've barely started paying I have like my underwear my underwear and my bikini packed in the suitcase so I've got a pack tomorrow but it gets stuff ready for my event on Saturday which is like a ball events I've got I've got an outfit it's getting Sam's organizing for me but I've got to also bring some spares as backups just in case and organize my shoes and bags and things like that I don't really have many bags I don't have many designer wear because I'm not into it but if that's a bad thing but I think personally it's a bit of a waste of money I mean if you like something go get it I'm all for that but yeah I've got a lot of stuff to do tomorrow and I want to film some more vlogging because I'm kind of addicted now you guys probably hate me by now because I'm incredibly annoying probably really boring too but whatever you can't please everyone and that's something that I've learned especially doing things on social media which is the place to be judged and criticized everyone is a keyboard warrior and they all have confidence to say what they think and feel and they're hiding behind their computer screen so I have learned a lot and it taught me how to be how to be happy regardless what everyone else thinks and that your own opinions are most important and I'm off topic again but I hope you guys like my vlogs and do let me know what you think and let me know if you want me to do anything in particular see you next time you 
let's need today's the day we go to the US and we're off and we're light and is going to go that's good oh is the air conditioner last time we left it on for two weeks you sure we're all lucky played on the replay pretty much but it's so good it really isn't it's not gonna happen I forgot we weren't allowed to take fruit through departures and so making all my Kiwi fruits now did tell you three down one to go did tell you I told you we're gonna bring it gonna check out Neil and are you all right God started to him I've been flying again a week later how do you like the new my older first to the record yeah I wanna play it's a la moving coal backflow debate it's still early so hopefully it does warm up and I know that Palm Springs is going to be really hot you look at sports and we in the mail what they're not being built definitely will really give them all wait wait wait where I want my what do we have here where it is please hey sy Emmy Emmy did you say Emmy ME ME hey doesn't look too happy to say look there's a boot you want to go to The Mikado sushi bar to get ass kicked by these four guys hey I feel like this club with our big job what that music out there yeah gonna be good supposed to be good yeah people love to do the hottest tracks I want a guy on a go no toucan Oh some food fill it on the ground let's feed it back why it'll make him like a and lock your little Wrigley fingers counting their three it is here in the mornings friggin putter I went to bed at about 3:30 in the afternoon yesterday I just crashed I was so tired I was like three nights of barely any sleep and then Dec got up at 6:00 and when I had something to eat for dinner and I was just like not forget it food is not my priority right now sleep is so I literally slept till about 3:30 in the morning and then got up and now we're at the gym it's like 5:30 now and because I haven't eaten for 20 hours something like that I'm having an apple it's only food that's available right now starving so I'm off to chain legs so I'm starting off with some sumo deadlifts so the weight I'm using is gosh I can't even remember what weight it was but it was the heaviest a head there they didn't have any squat racks or an Olympic bar so I just used this barbell got the heaviest weight and thought okay let's up up the rep range to 20 rather than it being 12 like I usually do it's good to change things up every now and then - so I don't mind so when you're picking your weight make sure that you choose a weight that is challenging for you and the last few reps should be almost impossible to lift so as long as you're training with that intensity then you're good to go so as you can see my back remains straight throughout I'm pushing through my glutes and I come up and then squeeze I don't overextend or arch my back at all you've got to keep your tummy tight it's a really strong through the core and then using those glutes rather than trying to use your back to lift it up so this is only a light weight so it's a little bit hard to see what I'm talking about here but a lot of people I guess really use their back to lift up the weight rather than pushing through those glutes and keeping their back really straight and core tight so the next exercise I'm doing is a front foot so again they didn't have very heavyweight so I'm just making the most of it so I love front squats because I hurt my neck many years ago many is I should say probably about five or six years ago I was lifting two heavy weights and hurt my neck I regret that big time so France quads work really well for me because it stops that pressure that putting the bar across my back puts on my neck so I obviously bring it across the front of my delts their front of my shoulders and again type tummy really pushing through the glutes not over overextending when I come up not bringing my shoulders back too far not frosting for just keeping my whole body in line so as you can see from when I come at the top from feet to head everything straight not over thrusting forward with my pelvis pelvic region over thrusting brush and remember elbows come up high as well so this exercises one of my favorites the glute bridge it's really helped me grow my booty from being non-existent to having a little bit there I've got a bit of a bit of shake now they're actually really strong now I used to have really dominant quads but now my glutes have become more even I guess so I'm more balanced now a lot stronger through my posterior chain so will through my hamstrings my glutes my lower back everything's a lot of stronger now and balanced which is what we want so this is the same thing no matter what you do you want to keep your core tight and back straight and this is pushing all through your glutes so you really squeeze your glutes rather than arching your back if that makes sense so moving on to the last exercise for my session this is another one of my favorites it's called the abductor machine so you obviously using your glutes and your glute medius you add a part of your glutes to bring the pads out let's really think of what they are called so this one's um I love this exercise it's a bit of a tough one but it looks um it's easier than what it actually is and then I turn around and I face the seat and I have a little cushion parts on the outer parts of my knees and then I just do small movements and that concludes my leg and booty session if you liked it 
[Music] get in the car here's my outfit for the day yes it looks a lot like yesterday that's because I couldn't be bothered to pull out clothes for my suitcase this is it again [Music] you love it

I just want you guys to know that it's crazy that things that you do simple things can actually change people's lives and make a huge impact these little things that we can all do every day something as simple as a smile and asking how someone is and genuinely meaning it taking an interest in someone or simply opening up to someone and sharing your own story and showing a bit of vulnerability we're all way more alike than we think we are and I think if we only opened up a little bit more we'd realize this and I think a lot of people have a fear of exposure exposing themselves because they're afraid of being judged or criticized or being laughter I think one of the biggest things that helps people to be able to connect is actually being vulnerable being real with people and expressing how you feel and just just communicating and not being afraid of revealing things and revealing our flaws and struggles we all have them nothing makes me happier than hearing feedback from someone saying that somehow I've had a positive impact on their life will change your life it just blows it blows me away and I think what I I've done something to help you change your life and just belittle me and it just shows as I was saying before that we all have the ability to help someone or have some sort of impact on changing their life in some way it's just the simple things the small things that you can do everyday that don't cost a cent like smiling or talking to someone nothing not money not famous success nothing to Pierce - knowing that you've made someone feel a little bit better oh god I just realized looks like I may never snap naked I'm wearing my bikini top in my closing but I remember that what goes around comes around so what you put out there comes back to you it's amazing how it works like let's be a little bit more vulnerable let's talk more communicate with each other let's support each other and uplift each other more and show you love if anyone out there is watching this and they're going through a tough time or you're going through some issues with self hate or negativity from other people just know that things can't get better I've been there before many times and severely when I was teenager I hated myself and hated life but one day actually I realized that I had to make changes and I was the one that had to pick myself up I'd to love myself no truly believe that I do the best I'm worthy it took a while but I got there and you can too don't be afraid to reach out to someone and ask for help I'm one of those people that hates doing that but we need to do it humans need humans and don't ever think that you're a weirdo you're abnormal something's wrong with you we are so much more alike than we think we are by the way being weird is a good thing I'm weird and I embrace my weirdness let's all be weird together okay I'm really going now I told you that wasn't there probably gonna be the real conclusion 
[Music] subject it set off to autumn and salad with snow beans for a vessel yesterday with the chickpeas and a top clothes excellent so annoying and I've added some turkey breast or some sort of protein or unfortunately my tolerance is not much I can eat to get enough nutrition see how go today and I'm getting a peppermint tea it helps with my digestion and they'll add digest then into it

right way I remember seeing this house you got a blue model yes so we got yes I got yes okay I'll see you soon y'all know where am i remember this oh yeah okay all right I'm on my way that's the worst thing about me I don't pay attention unless I have to if it's just me going somewhere if I'm driving somewhere walking somewhere I know I know exactly where to go if I'm with someone else I'm not painted genom I have no idea I'm hopeless it's a beautiful day here in LA I got a little over the biggest not like I'm just not good at this walking and holding a camera out in front of me stuff well first I'm going a Blue Bottle coffee shop has my morning coffee I'm having an iced coffee the Sun and creation after the lunch or no breakfast so then after we have breakfast I have a meeting and then I'm going to visit Wayne Johnson on set of bowlers so that should be fun and then supposed to have a couple of other meetings but it's really difficult because obviously LA traffic is crazy and getting places is a bit bit of a pain but yeah we'll see how we go because I might need to move a couple of things all right well I'm nearly at the coffee shop there could be happy that actually made it without him I think he secretly likes the fact that I need him look I've made energy it's a really good oh my god friend laughing look yep now mathematically riccati oh I wasn't gay I just went outside and I got confused cuz really really more guys married I we will the same way every time you just on your phone never look what we gon get me high it's inside walkie it's my head madly trying to get ready now and I've just ordered some overeat just mahi-mahi fish and salad and make your own salad from some salad place I think it's good to shop or something women here drive you the space suit from the hair drives in the states are strong enough to drive here has a voltage like half of what we have in Australia one [Music] 
hey guys so as I promised a few weeks ago have taken me so long I'm going to show you how to do a proper deadlift so there's all different versions I guess of doing the deadlift but the one thing that you got to keep in mind is they took tipped me back at all times so a lot of people deadlift by they come down the bar and they stand back up and they hyperextend and then they thrust their keeps too far forward when you come up you want to stay in a straight line so imagine there's a align from the roof to the ground he's trying to mimic that line I guess and stay in line with it so if I overextending or hyper extending and thrusting hips forward you're not in line so you're going to come down push away from the ground stand back up and squeeze your glutes shoulders are down and your back doesn't come back like this it's straight so you cause really tight keeping core tight throughout whole thing is very important ok so I'm going to show you from the front how I set up a bit cuff columns do crazy turnaround circuit I'm going to post that as well so I may have already posted it by now so check it out it's a tough one you gather a weight that's suitable for you so that's one thing your low people ask me what weight am I using it doesn't matter what anyone else is using it's important that you choose a weight that is challenging for you but it's suitable so that you can perform good me so I'm just using the 50 kilos here this is a way to like to use when I'm doing a circuit because I'm going through different exercises one after the other with no rest but usually if I was to do a strength session with deadlifts and I probably do about 70 to 80 kilos but I think dead lifting for years so I'm always making sure that my form is right and I usually do between 10 and 12 reps or 10 and 15 depending on how heavy I go and whether it's a circuit or not okay so nothing chatting set up so your feet are going to be about roughly shoulder-width apart everyone's setup is going to be slightly different because what our bodies are all different so we're going to squat differently we're going to deadlift differently but just making sure that we've got the basics like our tight core straight back pushing through using your glutes shoulders down not back and over arched there the key things to keep in mind so I like to have my toes slightly out so I have a little bit of a wide set up I squat with a fairly wide stance with my shoulders now that's most comfortable for me but really you're just got to do it and see how you feel I squat down find where I feel comfortable and then that's where I know where to set up okay so I had to do the the over-and-under grip so I alternate my group each round or each set that I do just so I get it even so coming down grabbing just outside of the knee before you even lift any weight you want to make sure your heads in neutral you've got a really strong core see cause really tight and then you pull away from the bar so you're pulling away before you even move Deak that big toe into the ground and then push away from the ground squeezing those glutes at the top and then tight tummy and then coming back down again to the ground pushing away from the ground squeezing those gluts and down again if I'm going to show you from the side so the first thing you want to do is tighten that core make sure your shoulders are down and your heads in a neutral position so that means you're not coming forward like this not backing up looking up and looking down just nice and neutral in line with your spine and then you're going to squeeze those gluts so you can see that I'm in a straight line spotl I do have a little bit of a sway back but everything's tight here so I'm drawing my stomach in my back's as flat as possible I'm using my glutes so this is really tight and then shoulders are down so a lot of people Scott like this thing they stick their butt out and actually back and shoulders are arch like this that's not how you that's not a good form it's not how you set up and it's not how you do deadlifts all you're going to do is put a lot of pressure on your lower back and you're actually activating your glutes properly okay so time is glutes tight tummy straight fast shoulders down it's neutral you're going to come down painting that position so you want to keep a straight back he's a really tight core and moving down like this so you've actually moving but you shouldn't be going like like this or anything that's all steady coming down pick up the bar do those big toes down you take around using those glutes you're going to push a one in from the ground and stand back up squeezing those glutes at the top and as you can see your back doesn't change your core doesn't change your shoulders are down they're not back like this and you're not hyper extending let's think about I know but over time you just keep running through the basics you'll get better easy so now using the bar I'm going to grab the bar pull it towards you then I'm drawing the bar pulling it towards me as far looking so it touches my shin bone then first thing I do is dig my toes into the ground that makes make sure that you believe activate properly that's funny little tip then you're going to pull the weight apart before you even move it if you guys will switch on and then you're going to stand out pushing away from the ground squeeze mentally to the top stomachs tight and then you're going to come back down and give me a straight back really to damage at the start before I did that circuit okay so as you can see I'm not coming down pushing back and then doing this none of this is happening now just think about what that's doing to your lower back those muscles become very tight down squeezing those glutes everything's are straight as possible so I think you get my point oh and make sure that your it stays a mutual prayer the head goes wind moves with your torso so I hope all that made sense I know I love Iran a lot but I just really wanted to do a video like that just explain the right sort of technique and you know a lot of people there's a lot of them I call them the peanut gallery the people who think they know everything they critique everything that that you do everything that I put up every that everything that everyone else puts up there's always people there commenting negative things and saying that the forms incorrect and blah blah blah I get it all the time I know that my form is good I've worked on this for several years with my physio with exercise scientists I'm obsessive with this stuff so everything all my technique is as good as I can get it now no one's got perfect technique no one has the perfect structure I guess and no one is perfectly balanced either so everyone squats and deadlifts are going to look different so keep that in mind do what's best for you do what's most comfortable for you and make sure that you're always protecting yourself safety is always first so drop the weight down if you have to leave your ego at the door and lift safely with good form hope you enjoyed it and we skies yeah [Music] 
hi everyone and things are stopping by I'm going to show you a quick hair tutorial this is something I do if I'm heading out to dinner if I'm going to a party or if it's someone's your birthday Christmas have been anything where I just want a natural Victoria's Secret sort of style hair so beautiful flowy curls alright let's get started so I'm gonna start with my knife repel ends leaving moisturizer this stuff's great because it protects your hair can opener then protect your hair from heat styling so I put it down from that here down so go take it up too high it becomes too oily and then my hair gets too flat and because my hair's really seen it seems to get flat really easily and stringy so you can use this on dry hair as well or you can put it in your hair after you've towel dried it before you dry it and straighten it so I've already I've washed my hair yesterday and I blow dried it and then I ran a straightener through it and as you can see my hair starts going curly straight away it gets a bit of a wave in it smells really good mmm lovely stuff and it's not oily that the hair stuff as well there's some repel ends so you can put this in your hair everyday I don't wash my hair every day I wash it about once a week because it's a nightmare my washing in and it takes hours for me to do it all the whole process so that stuffs are really good in a protect sea hair grab are you happy here alright grab a bit from here up so get that out of the way and then that's what I'm gonna do laughs and we don't really be going out now this is called a novel okay it's all this up here I mean I'm gonna split it down the back and then I'll just start with sections like this so I'm gonna use my curve I think this is called it's a GHD tri-zone technology pretty sure it's called a curve or something but it's shaped as you can see it's shaped a little bit of shape through it's not like a round normal color all right so sections about that big so this is really quick to do because I hate spending a lot of time on my hair so not all the way up and bring it down probably around my mouth height and you hold it here for about 50 or 10 seconds you don't have to hold it for too long it depends if your hair is really thick or not you might need to leave it longer mine curls quite well so there's a couple of different ways you can do curls there's a way where you grab it like to be sitting you literally just see how it twists I don't want you to do it like that think of this it's because it'll go sort of away this one I'm wrapping it around but keeping it flat without a twisting so it creates that curl and if your hair tends to drop really easily you can take it out of and then you can even put it click there and hold it and wait for it to cool down and then release it and it'll hold that curl a bit longer see how that one's already sitting up higher so with these curls I'm actually bringing the hair away from my face rather than going forward oh so you're wrapping it all away rather than the other way so I'm going to use my neck fixation finishing spray and to spray the ends while they're still holding the shape so I will separate them but just lifting it out a little bit and spraying from underneath spray your face and then scrunch it up a little bit well I've got a big whiff of that I feel drunk from it okay I'm really restricted he's sitting here because these thighs so normally I'm standing up and I said of lean over and do it like this it's scrunching it up so retain those curls and doesn't drop out too much because my hair does tend to drop a little bit and then I'm gonna get rid of this thing whatever that is so I'm just grabbing that big section and then bringing it down to there so I don't want my fringe in it too much because it can sort of flick out too much and curl up funny so any pots that you feel like I'm full and out of eight or need a little bit more you can just redo it and hold it a little bit longer and then because that one is flicking in a little bit I'm gonna try to shake that out of you now I'm gonna get my comb it's broken it still work though and then just run it along here so you just bring it through make it out centimeter wide and just separate this and then just tease it a little bit so holding it straight up and just pushing down and then while he's still holding it up I just brush it over on the top part and then I bring it down you can spray it if you want to get more of a hold you can spray some hairspray in that now we can start separating the curls so I didn't spray the the top parts because I want them to be a little bit more loose so just separating them just some little dots like there like this and then just spray the ends and around the back and scrunch it a little bit and sort of mess it up from the roots and you look for these nice flowy big waves just sort of play with it a bit so usually in my hair just does it like it literally does its own thing so whatever I do at home and then I step outside it just you know even does whatever it wants to do but usually this I can deal with in it it usually stays quite well throughout the night is just messy and it's close to what my natural hair does anyway my natural curls but yeah that's pretty much it and if I don't like that I can also mess it up flick it over to one side put one behind my ear that's what I love about this style if you can call it a style you can do so many different things with it and it's just really flexible and flowy natural sort of looking natural but not natural so there you have it this is how I style my hair when I'm heading out and I want that real feminine and beautiful Victoria Secret style hair this is what I do and it's really quick and easy and flows nicely it's not too structured it's not set in a certain way that no can't be messed up you can do whatever you want with this mess it up throw it around dance all night and it still looks pretty good I hope you

[Music] everyone look at the wrong Scott hey everyone so tomorrow we are leaving at 4:30 I think it is 4:30 a.m. to go pick them up and take him to the airport so we get a Brisbane and then go to Melbourne and then fly out from there to LA and I'm trying to get packing and it's not going too well because I really suck at packing even though I've had a lot of practice so I'm going to get my tablets all organized so I've got these little bags here and I'm going to cook every day every day's worth tablets in that one I am a bio Jess that's good food digestion evening primrose good for women and our hormones for my greens here there's a couple there the organic ones and then me in defense and I get bad Sciences so that helps with that t-43 to cancer thyroid this is adrenal cortex support the adrenals astral Gander is a episode of arrow Vedic adaptogen and my multivitamins bacillus Caligula's that's it's kind of like the eggs for good bacteria so takes it down into your tummy and then they hatch and breed and protect you and fight of the bad guys to keep a good balance between good and bad bacteria this is iron by spicy food 5 glyph solute Buster get exclusive 8 okay that'll do so obviously my iron knife feels really good for cellular renewal I think it is so I'm yeah repairs your cells and then my basic B complex or the B vitamins and phosphatidylcholine it which is really good for your brain helps his memory also helps if some you know you're a bit crazy like me and I know it's groups of people with bipolar and things like that well so there's my subs that I'm taking with me oh yeah also started and see I take this every day one to two of these when it's a quarter of a teaspoon to have that once or twice a day that also help to my immunity as well and magnesium at night although this has been making me a bit upset my gut so I've backed that off for a bit and I have lemon two in the morning with a bit of chlorophyll with my vitamin C to get you know glutamine too so you might be thinking why do I need all these supplements I mean I eat healthy food and exercise don't I get enough nutrition from my food well the answer is I'm not sure and I don't want to take any risks and miss out on essential nutrients that I need to be as healthy as I can be so all of the food relaxed nutrients there's a lot of things missing like iodine in the soil I've supplements with all of these to try to make sure I fill any gaps that I might be missing with my nutrition also I've got to explain the benefits of l-glutamine this stuff is amazing most people think that it's great for muscle growth and a repair as well but the number one thing these days my first thing it does is go into your tummy and repair it so if you've got any holes like leaky gut or you know raw inside it'll go and repair all that and it is enough left over then it goes to your muscles so usually people don't take enough a bit for it to make it to the muscles so I usually take this a few times a day like that's been really bad and I'm doing a bit of a gut healing protocol I'll have it up to several times a day so five to seven times a teaspoon and I have it I have a teaspoon and then drink water or between water and drink it straight away you never leave it to sit because it goes bad and if I'm not trying to heal my tummy but my tummy's being really good which is rare then I reduce it to one or two times a day it's a sweet awesome don't glutamine get a good quality one nice there's a lot of crap stuff out there and I still is in it that goes for all supplements to there

damage because I'm getting pains that are radiating I guess my shoulder blade area out my shoulder and then cut it down a little bit it is really painful any position I get in just hurts and I can't get comfortable I can't relieve it oh and I'm on painkillers and it's still horrible and then if I cough or sneeze I try not to do it's excruciating yes I I'm feeling a bit in a bit of a downer mood but I've got to snap myself out of it because things could always be worse and that's what I always try to think when I'm feeling down or feel like I've had something go wrong and I'm upset about it whatever I remind myself that things could always be worse and I should appreciate what everything that I do have and I've got my health trying to turn frown upside down the outside trying to get the lawsuit the Sun although I've missed most of it we're flying directly from Brisbane to LA tomorrow so instead of going to Melbourne and then waiting there and then flying out to LA we're having a direct flight so that's a bonus as well so get a look at the bright side positive things in life because there's always positive things I guess sometimes it might seem like they're all negative but there are always things it just depends how you look at things depends on your perspective so my memory card died before so dick and I went and bought a couple more had some dinner came back home and we're already packed for tomorrow ready yeah and I was this long yes and I was sitting here doing my work and then dick came in and said hey I'm full this is ninety number three in the world for Fitness influencer I'm good right I can't believe it imagine years ago there someone had said tough this would have happened I never would have this crazy huh never would have believed them and there's amazing people up there I'll show you this top ten here this foot so there I am like these awesome people but yeah I'm so excited and I just want to thank everyone who's catering arc now who has been there all along since the beginning and when I first started getting into health and fitness and started making changes with my life not a very flattering angle whatever reflected off of those shop is it whatever you guys probably know my story and don't have that feeling like always stuffing but yells really um depressed and secure I didn't know what I was doing with my life had no direction met Zach he changed everything I did change everything he had a lot you had a lot to live with it you just gave me like a really good perspective and I you know looked at things differently and also you so don't believe so yeah just so you know if you want something but you can actually have it and you can have whatever you want movie for you Monty and so I started lifting weights a bit before I met Zach but more more when I met him we started lifting a lot more together you cost so much like so much shave me era started it was crazy I couldn't believe it was like when we first started seeing each other was around the time that you started getting serious about you know training and lifting weights and you know you really loved it and yeah some in closest friends were like with the most um I'm not supportive for them to put it in a nice way yeah I couldn't believe it I couldn't believe it that these are these are your friends that were saying how far you taking it yeah I'm looking mainly you're far and I was obsessed and didn't look good and I remember I was at a friend's house with some friends who um it's not really crazy because I'm not friends with anyone in it remember that magazine Lynette yeah and I'm saying I wanted to get I filled muscle like these women there was really strong women named muscle level lean they looked really I guess it was empowering and it made me want to have what they thought were a little grow and it's not generous the strength of their body it's the mental strength as well I wanted to have what they had for me obviously everyone's different and I was showing them thinking that I'd get some sort of support and I didn't get support and so then horrible things to me ended up in tears I removed a lot of people from my life who and negative and bringing me down because there's no need for that they don't add to my life so what's the point of having them innit I don't find it really funny hell when you change your life and you actually become happy people some people aren't happy for you most really struggle to show that they're happy for you or show support now I don't know whether it's because they're not happy or whatever Isaac if you can't if you can't look at somebody who you admire or you want to be like it you aspire to be like if you can't if you can't sort of draw some inspiration and be like oh I want to do what they're doing if you can't do that if you have to turn it in some sort of negative way to make you feel better about how you're dying to try and bring them down yeah it just doesn't leave the same you never let it look good while you're trying to bring someone else down something like that but here I am now number three in the world rated by four it's like it's pretty crazy and hard for me to have it thinking because I struggle with accepting things and like really and not let's not sayin things that that accepting things that you achieve yes that are like maybe I get a really really great achievements you sort of play them down a bit bill oh yeah I don't know that's insecurity trying to come back up that voice in the back of head that says you don't deserve it I struggle with it and I working on it with Dex help I'm grateful for what I do and what I've been able to achieve but it's hard to really like accept it so I'm really I'm trying Temari nearly sky trainers coming soon and yeah when I first got got told that I was chosen to create a shoe with Reebok from the ground up something they've never done before I first thing I said was why me why me I'm a pretty bad attitude to have really so yeah I'm working I'm trying to know that I deserve everything that I worked for I think that's a message for you guys as well if there's things that you're working for in life and you're working towards with you really want know that you deserve it I think that makes it worthwhile when you achieve those things you can really celebrate those achievements and know that you did work hard and you realize well yeah what do you like what do you look for if you if you're not if you're not working towards achieving your goal yeah and then when you do achieve a goal if you don't see to celebrate that it puts a point in doing it maybe my father Rosalie's thank you to everyone who has supported me along my journey over the last several years a lot of you I know some of you been there since the beginning and then a lot of you have sort of jumped on board along the journey and I really do appreciate you because obviously without all of you I wouldn't be able to do all this I wouldn't be able to live my dreams but also share share messages with you that I find are important things that have helped me like along my life that I've learned that have really helped me overcome different things whether it's overcoming depression getting gaining confidence becoming happy healthy fit all those things I love sharing that with you so it makes it all worthwhile like everything that I do all hard work with it the criticisms and all that crap makes it all worthwhile and I think when I see things like this like the fourth sondik story in the world I really told me that what I'm doing is it's working in that circle we need to be proud of myself but I really do want to thank you and I mean it I just couldn't do any of this without you and I can do this is that new Lila goal well it like oh you know they get out a half he's he's really nice no it's not we work together that's crazy that we have an amazing relationship you know what romantic relationships as well as what he does relate with it yes so we've got both and I think we're pretty lucky here so that's the story let's excitement for the day apart from using our plane we're not missing a plane plane being canceled and getting a flight in the morning and then we'll be heading off to LA to shoot something exciting it I don't know if I'm allowed to say yet their own side of caution and say nothing oh our seems more oh I'm he can excited there's one of the biggest things that I've ever done I'm really really decided is to be sure you've ever done the biggest yet the biggest magazine chew yeah yeah and um you know how I always like to I live a really balanced to the last I I try the best I can and life has its ups and downs she'd happened and it's got to go with it and sometimes he can't train and I've had a few things happen one after the other my wisdom teeth had drums with that had dry socket a lot of pain could train only Drew's pulled my head and a quad and then I've done something to the nerve in my neck so I'm got a lot of pain there which I already told you about so it's one thing after another I haven't been ever trained that much but I have been consistent over the years so I guess you don't just lose it just like that it takes a long time for you lose muscle I think it's two weeks when your muscle starts break down but that's doing nothing for you yes so there's nothing to worry about a lot of people ask me how do you deal with not being able to Train it's not the end of the world it really isn't it's not a big deal I do the best I can I'm eating healthy food most of the time I mean you are eating very healthy yeah you eat a lot of food but it's very healthy and also if I want to treat I do have a W now you have the weekends where we just go berserk and whatever but I want you to think that you can not train and see healthy food and get the results that you want you've got to Train really hard you got to be lifting weights doing a bit of heat training or whatever it is you enjoy doing and then incorporate obviously healthy food and eat enough food having one or the other it's not as good but if you can't train not the end of the world do the best you can and just keep eating healthy food like I've been doing and that's how I've been able to maintain a pretty lean physique and yeah I was the leanest weather but that's not what I'm about I'm about balancing about attainable health that everyone can actually you know achievable unattainable and maintainable I'm going to go to bed now know what yeah he's your

hey guys are back into it i'm doing some beauty videos now and today i'm going to do a first impressions video so i've got a few different products i haven't used before and I'm going to be trying them out and then telling you what I think of them so let's get into it so first we're going to try the Jaclyn healed champagne collection palette I've been waiting to try this i'm so excited i got it in the mail alright so the first thing I'm going to use is the blush so this one's called like a better keep this year's I so I know the names can pull this Pamplemousse papers not people miss I don't want any pimples the apples of my cheek oh yeah that's pretty color oh it's really nice it doesn't go like some of the blushes I use a to seek it sort of gets in all my wrinkles and the pores of my skin but this one's really natural and goes on quite well it's not streaky beautiful Jaclyn you've done well the highlighters so i think i'm going to mix them both so i'm not sure which color is so I'm doing champagne pop and Prosecco pop put a little bit of it back of my hand and on the top of my cheekbones just put a little bit on there just keeping it on my cheek bone there and I do little circular motion so once I pop it on then I do the circular motions to blend it in more so you don't of these two lines he like war paint yeah that's beautiful it's really fine it's not chunky it doesn't have big little bits like a lot of them have yeah very happy with that well done Jacqueline so I'm going to try the Maybelline vivid matte liquid lips and the color is number five in a nude nude flesh watching mood in nude flat settings I'll be flushing if I'm flashing all right let's give this a go looks like beautiful color I'm going to start in the middle of my lips and not talk probably shouldn't all stop talking okay wow it's really smooth it's a really nice texture it's really smooth it's kind of like moose like whipped moose spreads really nicely there's no you know bumpy bits or thick bits or anything feels really nice it's not dry it's it feels really moisturizing I love the feeling it feels natural it's almost like I'm not wearing anything and it's not tacky either I love it I'm bit scared to use this I've been wanting to try a fiber lash for a long time and I've also seen that they do eyebrow fibers as well so this is by designer brands so it's got the eyelash fibers and mascara and it's also got the fiber for your eyebrows so yeah let's let's give it a go oh it's all fibers there till falling out everywhere okay for starting here oh my gosh wow it actually works I did not think this would work I thought I would have liked it great is it looks great almost in there on the end of the little tip thing here so so actually got some pigment to it wow I had no idea I really thought this was not work oh my gosh see how much darker my brows compared to the other one winning it's gonna be somewhere where you're not over white carpet because the fibers drop everywhere it's a little bit messy but it does work so yeah I just like some doesn't taste very nice it should make a flavor better cool let's make sure you don't put this anywhere near your up a week it's about having a mo so I'm using medium dark I didn't even realize these k colors I literally just picked this up so I probably would have got a lighter color this one's for brunette so it's a full-on kit this is vegan tune it's not tested on animals so I love that yeah it's a little bit messy out here so I probably have to clean that up Abby because I hate I hate when your eyebrows sort of go out of where they're supposed to be so it's one downside but other than that they do work it does work quite well you probably have to neaten it up get a q-tip and clean that off a little bit and then get a little bit of concealer and tidy that up but otherwise quite good so let's move on to the eyes now eyelashes supposed to put on the mascara first and then put the fiber formula on and then put the mascara back on and you can keep doing that process until you're happy so this mascara wand is almost like a comb I like how it's not too big so you can get it right in your lashes from the base and I put it on from the base so you can feel it on your skin like on your waterline there in the upper lid and then we go up to the sides and then bring it back up all the way through the lashes and you get to pull that stupid face too late so far so good the scar is quite good not too much comes out it stays really seen it's a little chunky and doesn't put little bits everywhere it doesn't fall anywhere it's quite good and it's a really good price product as well not too expensive at all i think there's about twenty five dollars australian full twice one thing i guess you'd have to make sure is that this doesn't get in your eye so I'm shutting my eye while I'm doing this so I actually blinked into it so that when all the fibers full everywhere it's not going straight into my see that time that one was a little bit better a little bit better than the other one but I'm making a mess okay so then I'm going to put this mascara back on again this is quite difficult and itchy now I'm going to put my ball fibers on because I really want to get a dramatic flash look it's hair stuck in there as well what is that blondie I don't even have a long day Wow alright get those fibers on yep this is called a fairy makeup look good for winter that's a winter here in Australia keeps your face warm can barely see edit e now more mr. there's a little bit of droppage going on Wow can you hear that I think the Emergencies coming i found out and screwed up a makeup I've been coming to help me definitely an emergency ok it comes up quite easily that's good that's good yeah that's really good so like the carpet anyway Oh even up there I feel like it added a little bit of length but it's quite chunky like the ends don't taper off into a scene lash it's kind of chunked up at the ends so i don't i don't know i don't know if i like it does make them seeker and a bit longer but very messy time consuming and I like keep doing my makeup quickly decks like no she doesn't my favorite thing has to be the Jacqueline heel palette these colors are amazing and I love the consistency they're really smooth they don't go on chunky bits or anything and I get much droppage it's a really fine powder really beautiful so Japanese on really well and I'm very happy my delivery today now that my magnets have dried I'm going to do the kiss test there I'm going to kiss the back of her hand and the see if it actually does transfer onto my hand or not yeah it does see so it does come off but it's a really nice color so what I normally wear is a leap like a tinted lip color and that comes off anyway so this is a similar kind of thing it's just a bit thicker and obviously Matt so I do like it I will continue to use this lip matte lip stuff what's the code so there's my first first

hi I'm Emily sky and welcome to my youtube channel this is one of the first YouTube vlog things whatever you call it that I've done I've been trying to do it for a while now started last year wasn't really happening for me I was trying to get used to carrying around a camera and having a camera in my face all the time weird thing to get used to I'm giving it a go it's something I've always wanted to do okay when I say always maybe for a few years but always I find on I'm pretty boring so I don't really know if I'm gonna meet someone who's entertaining for you but please suggest things to me this is really hurting to smile so if I'm not smiling very well then it's not because I'm not happy it's just because this clay mask is absolutely killing my face it is I like my arms to I'm you to be so no idea what I'm doing but if you do have any suggestions that will make it easier for me a little better better for you better for watching me more entertaining or anything that you want to see me do or talk about let me know in the comments section I would love to know I'd love your feedback constructive criticism is a good thing so if you've got it bring it on if you're gonna be rude I'll block you you're gonna be rude I'll come and find you and I'll get you and I'll put you through one of my leg sessions no not really okay enough of me talking I never know when to stop so I'm gonna get back to work and hopefully get this face mask off soon see you on my blog what are you saying see you in the next clip whatever all righty so I slept in because crazy sleeping hours I go to bed it liked it last night it was wasn't till like 5:30 until I'm in to sleep so it's pretty bad so I'm gonna I'm gonna go is getting up really early on Saturday I thought I had to fly to Melbourne tomorrow but actually I have to go on Saturday so I've got all that stuff I was waiting to hear back from Sam and yeah he let me know it's Saturday so I guess that's gonna be an early flight but I know the next day he's gonna be even more early immorally even earlier weather and then I go to the US so I'm gonna make coffee most important part of day but it's not too good today come on go guys what's happening my gosh I don't know how these vloggers do this hello all right now I've got my coffee I'm gonna make a DIY face mask so what I do is I get bentonite clay so this is a Redman clay it's supposed to be really good I've done some research on a great brand so I'm gonna make a clay mask out of it it's gonna draw all the crap basically out of my skin so something that's pretty important is mixing it with something that's not metal because it's a toxin the clay actually gets metal on it it draws all the toxins out of it the middle out of it or something so okay I'm using apple cider vinegar my clay mask just a little bit of that I'm not very good with measuring because I can't be bothered I'm just putting I guess that's a couple of tablespoons about that roughly that's something getting a bit up I'd say it's almost a tablespoon see how that goes it's all about the consistency probably put too much apple cider oops so you want this to be like a paste paste consistency so that you can spread it on your face and it's not going to just run off your face tell you what I feel really weird talking to myself I think anyone saw me they think girls mad because now if you've got sensitive skin I wouldn't use at the cider because it's probably too strong for you I would use just plain old water or you can even put some lemon in there too but just remember eating it's acidic like the apple cider or the lemon is gonna be a little bit harsh on your skin if you are sensitive so it's kind of frothing up a little bit now that some people need more I definitely used way too much apple cider that's what happens when you don't measure things camera balancing on this shoebox I think it is and then I've got the toothpaste under to lift it up I really don't know how people do this I'm going to start the application process oh yeah I feel like I'm on ghost the idea is to put this all over your face but keep it away from sensitive areas like your eyes so I keep it just I guess about half an inch below maybe a little bit more so sort of does that sting your eyes a little bit and I do have sensitive eyes oh my eyes I definitely make way to be much anyone else what any oh that's so much extra what does the rabbit on my arms that's how can I get this every way I could stick look off at me I'm the biggest grub and I put stuff everywhere like I literally spill things everywhere to pie over I bash into walls I'm always hurting myself my gosh the camera just went off again ah anyway as I was saying because I don't do with stress naturally I don't deal with it very well I have to make an effort to deal with it better because I just can't function like that it affects my health my immune system goes down because I'm stressed so much I can't digest food properly I get extreme food sensitivities like I've talked about before I'm gonna do another vlog keep going to called blog that's a vlog of the video blog I'll do another one on gut health so back to their stress and that stuff so I had an event started last year I was going on TV and I just I was going on the morning one of the morning shows it was sunrise and I just stressed out so much before it for the week leading up I couldn't sleep I couldn't breathe probably I had like that really tight feeling in my chest I've had headaches I felt nauseous I always just a mess I got chocolate all over my dress again chocolate a doing chocolate it's all about balance if you bought something that you really want then you have it if you want to eat chocolate every day then you have it don't complain if you are not in the best shape we don't feel it all about balance still about doing makes you feel your best and it's all about those long-term goals and long-term status and over short-term pleasures yeah so I gotta go up to this meeting really shortly no Sam debts meeting me there but I've got some work to do doing some exercise videos so I post a free workout video every day on my Facebook page and I try to put on my Instagram as well so here's all my video clips along here I put each clip along and I chop it so I usually do like four EPS that's how I make my videos and yeah I think you guys really like it I think it's good to show you some workouts that you can do a lot of them just workouts you can do home a lot of them don't even have any equipment or they use minimal equipment a lot of these workouts aren't ones that I do every day I do a lot of heavy lifting that I do much I don't do any like long cardio sessions I do a little bit of heat here and there but mainly this clay is like falling off now can you stay up Haley does it look Wow it's really hard to drink and eat with this and talk of this now it's all cracking all right time to wash this off actually really really tight now teaching ok so just um had to go wash this stuff off my face because it was really itchy and getting really tight I know that's supposed to happen but it was just like driving me nuts my face is really red now that is normal it's drawing everything to the service surface so although purities are coming out and then the blood comes to the surface as well so it's got this sort of hot feeling but last time I did this the same thing happens and it did go down probably at about 20 minutes or half an hour or something like that so yeah they go get ready now and go to my meeting with Sam I think decks already there but I'm late because I was doing this face mask thing so better get going here's what I'm wearing today love this little Reebok thing and I put it over the top of my lungs sleeve top it's getting quite cool here today well now you know on the Gold Coast so winter is definitely coming I've got my favourite cap it's from Dec when he was in the army so it's his actual unit hat it's quite cool but I yeah Sam and um Decker actually waiting for me at the coffee shop now so a bit to go and these are my cool Reebok shoes by the way they like my favorite better guy I'm already like I've ever been so late somewhere that you actually think maybe the people aren't there anymore maybe the people that you're meeting actually got on and they've gone home redness in my faces quietly better it's still there a little bit though I just put some moisturizer and some organic moisturizer so I should um should help my skin to feel better soon but it's already feeling really clean and soft which is good
