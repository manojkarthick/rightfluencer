another item that I got as I picked up was this black file box now I know if you followed my blog for a while I like to blog basically sitting in my living room chair so I thought this would be a great product to have kind of sitting next to the chair because i always have paperwork scattered everywhere so I thought if I could get this hanging file folder organizer it would keep all my paperwork kind of hidden away so we'll see how its successful i am at that the file box was 1399 so not too bad it comes with them if you can see it comes with some black hanging folders and it which are nice then I got a couple of things to match the file box um these I actually found in the dollar bin now these are file folders and of course black and white striped what else right when I saw these i had to get them i think they might come with six folders um so they had the black and white striped the black white polka dot and like a another sort of laughs and white design totally fun for a dollar right another cheap product that i found was this black and white straight composition book dollar fifty and you know I'm a sucker for anything black and white with stripes right so had to get that hands a one of the same lines is this a room essentials binder also in the office supply aisle and it was 5 90 95 99 and I just thought it was cute you know it goes along with whole collection black and white stripes with the gold pretty pretty fabulous combo and then I like the little label on the back here so you know if you had a few of these like on your bookshelf or something with like invoices or whatever you need to keep it's definitely a good way to do it 
hi guys it's Rachel here and today I just wanted to kind of go over some of the fun things that i bought this month um came in the mail so I kind of want to hope to do a monthly feature kind of going over everything that I bought for the month and kind of what i liked what i didn't like what i returned anyway hopefully you guys will find it useful um I do have a Pinterest board called bought it so you can kind of find the sources of what I'm talking about there or you know just go to the website that I talked about um anyway so the first item I want to talk about is this awesome nightstand and it's like a knockoff of the cartel component and I got this one from Dantan bow and i think i paid a hundred and twenty dollars but the actual version i think is probably only like twenty bucks more um I just had some credit on Zombo that I wanted to use and I've been wanting one of these for a while I thought it would be perfect for the kids room it's kind of it it's a good little lightweight nightstand and it's not too not too tall so it's perfect to put a little lamp on maybe some books and toys or whatever in the apartment um so yeah it's made of this like card plastic so it's lightweight and obviously it's easy to open and close anyway somebody find next two comrades bed ok the next item I got was also from dottin bow and it is this cute adorable little fish apartment I think it's called and I paid $35 and what's cool about this is you can buy more and stack them so you can have like a little fish high-rise which I thought was kind of fun so i got this one for Arden we don't have a fish right now but I thought be fun to go this weekend and pick out a fish for her yeah so I thought you know this would be a great addition to the playroom kind of teachers some responsibility on how to take care of a low-maintenance pet anyway so um this one's the white 1i think there's different colors it's made of plastic on the outside actually has two layers on the inside pull this off is this glass insert square insert um and yeah I mean it's pulled out for cleaning I think these are just little fish stickies that you can take off um anyway that should be fun ok the next item I want to talk about is this small bottle that i also got from Dantan bow I love small bottles I don't know if you guys are familiar with them but this is my third one that it's called it's well as s ' w.e.l.l anyway they're really cool because their streamlined you can fit them in cup holders and they're made of steel no plastic and they're double and like double walled so they have insulation they are supposed to keep cold things cold for 24 hours and hot things hot for 12 so anyway they are I think are usually $35 but dombo has them has the orange ones i think for thirty dollars so i figured why not you can't have too many okay so the next package i want to talk about is on my package from gap com anyway they were having major sale so i wanted to share with you some of the good finds that I found one of them was this awesome cashmere sweater that I'm wearing um I think it was sixty sixty seven dollars I think um it's a hundred percent cashmere it's a woman's sweater I know it's kind of big I actually work this is an extra-large but I like my cozy winter sweaters to be kind of big and comfy so that's why um but yeah anyway obviously I love it i'm wearing it oh this is like the third time I've worn it um and I would definitely recommend it it's good quality soft cashmere it has some really nice like stiffing detail on the sleeves and think on the collar here anyway love that the next thing I want to talk about are these super cute striped leggings and for those of you who know me even a little bit know that I love stripes so I've worn these a few times already um and I think they're gap fit they were twenty five dollars um anyway they're super cute and super comfy and stretchy and you can wear them with some boots and a cozy sweater okay the last thing I want to talk about from gap is this amazing tote bag for those of you who follow me on instagram you probably have seen my um my posts already about this tote but um can i just say i love this tote bag it was I think 37 38 I can't remember I think it's less than thirty eight dollars 100% leather and its really good quality it's really thick nice leather you know the inside is this nice soft suede the straps are this nice thick kind of sturdy saddle leather um has like brass hardware detailing there's a little pocket inside here with the zipper and anyway obviously this is a bunch of crap in it so i have many it and i highly recommend it so i would run to your closest gap or go online and buy it because leather tote like this for thirty seven dollars is such a steal and i think someone even commented on my Instagram that it looks just like they're made well tote which i think is i don't know how much it is but it's a lot more than 37 i think it's like either 100 or 200 or something anyway um totally love this love it definitely recommend ok the next thing i want to talk about are some things for the littles um let's get these together so a couple of pairs of shoes um I at these Sparkle princess shoes like garden calls them on zulily now Arden is very particular about her shoes she either wears sparkly princess shoes like these or furry boots so obvious place winner right now so she's all about the furry boots I heard these in the size larger than she usually was because I'm hoping this will be a nice spring shoe now um I don't know if you guys recognize these they're very very similar to the shoes that will maybe it was selling they don't sell them anymore but they were Arden's like favorite shoes and she would just wear those every day and I think we've gone through like 25 different pairs I've had to like hunt them down on ebay and I haven't found any for a while so when I saw these on zulily I think there were like ten dollars I snatched them up so hopefully she likes him just as much they're a little bit different the the front here is actual pieces of glitter glued on so I'm a little worried about that worried that there's going to be glitter all over the place but anyway um not too bad for ten dollars so we'll see how long they last the next pair of shoes I got our for Conrad's and they are the see kai run brands which we love art and where those went was younger too he's a year old right now so I wanted to kind of stick with something very kind of supportive I think these were twenty-five dollars on guilt I want to say um yeah they're little more expensive but I think they're worth it especially when your little one is just learning to walk he's been wearing soft soles lately so these will be kind of his first hard sole shoe but even then they're very flexible and lightweight so I think he will still be able to kind of feel the grounds he's walking on um and Arden loved them when she was his age so I think they were good choice and they are super adorable they come in like really adorable designs they're not as cheesy as other brands can be so highly recommend see kai run check them out next I got a couple of cute outfits um for them from burt's bees and they were actually from two different con two different sites so I actually got this cute little knits like it cuz it's like a sweater a sweatshirt dress for carp for Arden from burt's bees on gilt com and I think it was twenty dollars comes with this cute hood it's this gray knit material kind of like a sweatshirt it's super cozy has this it has some fun like these distressing kind of details like this super cute pink snowflake which you loves the hood is lined in pink and like ivory stripes which she also loves stripes takes after her mom um anyway yes she it's super comfy it's great during the winter comes with this light cozy and lighting so and it's organic you can't beat organic and especially for the prices that birds bees cells cells clothing at is it's a great deal so i would highly recommend um here's another Burt's Bees item this one's for Conrad I know it looks almost like the same size he's wearing a size 2 t now even though he's 13 months um anyway it's his cute little navy striped long sleeve top also organic it's gray and navy and super comfy and he loves it to go with that I got home these cute sweat kind of pants I guess they're the same kind of knit material that Artemis dress is made out of and it has the same kind of distressing details a cute little pockets and the drawstring and they're also size 2t big um anyway they're super comfy for him especially we get running around the playground so um anyway keep an eye out for the Burt's Bees they've been making the rounds on all the flash sales lights and I definitely recommend them and such a good price too and I think that is it you guys so anyway if you see something on the Pinterest my baudet Pinterest board that you want me to talk about feel free to leave me a note and I hope you guys enjoyed and I will see you later

hi Rachel Broussard here and today I am cleaning out my purse I got the motivation and the inspiration to do this from two of my favorite youtubers lavender and naturally v thrifty mom they're doing a five-day series I think it's five days to minimalism is the hashtag and today they're focusing on purses and diaper bags I think so so without further ado let's get down to it okay first things first I need my keys I don't need all three your bet in the pockets next up I have my two glasses this is fair spare in case my contacts give out flashlights and keep them there to my sunglasses but don't need both except I have a spare phone charger so that just keeps my iphone charged if it runs out of batteries go in there some hand sanitizer sunblock these two bags are stay all three so these carry my shopping bags this one is a waterproof bag lining right here is waterproof and these are my little so my receipt bag and she recedes probably this one's empty is to me these cards so I'll go through my gift cards maybe a keep those routes I don't really use this that way this and they're a bit simplified back these are the things I don't really use garbage receipts extra cards lipgloss and an extra weight okay well that's about it so I hope you liked going through my purse with me so check back in later and I'll probably do a couple more minimalism videos how much time I have and found up there yet but if you liked the video please give me a thumbs up because it really helped me out and definitely subscribe if you'd like to see more and to back into the next video you 
this chronic I'd like to pop talk about is this this like fuchsia tufted ottoman I know you've all seen in loves it's definitely a statement piece that's for sure this one actually isn't I couldn't find it online either and um I think it's because it's also unclear ins the clearance price was 4799 so that's actually pretty good the piece itself is pretty lightweight obviously cuz I'm lifting it up easily but you know what i want to talk about is the scale of this piece a lot of times target you know can kind of have smaller scale pieces and this piece is actually pretty good size um definitely a good ottoman sighs um try to do it close up the only thing that i'd say is a drawback on this is the cushion top it's not very thick and it's not very substantial so you can definitely feel like the base through it so i don't think you know when you're sitting on it it's going to be like the softest I'm seat in the house that's for sure um otherwise that you know the fabric school you know it has a great like texture to a kind of like a linen texture and the tufting of the button tufting it's obviously pretty fun the the legs are you know metal material um and they're pretty solid um the finish is more of like a like a rubbed brass like a like a matte brass not a shiny not a shiny finish which is which is nice it's a great finish overall you know you can't beat the price for this especially on clearance so highly recommend 
[Music] hi there Rachel boussard here and today I'm starting a brand new series for you guys you might have seen a few weeks ago on my Instagram I posted a call for designs of love us so basically I'm going to help you guys with your design problems so in this video I'm going to go through a complete design dilemma from start to finish and obviously it's a real example I hope you guys like it and if you'd like to be featured in a future video go ahead and submit your information down below I'll put the link down in the description so go take a look at that and if you liked the video don't forget to give me a thumbs up because it really helps me out and don't forget to subscribe I'll put a little link right up there so go ahead take a look and let me know what you think in the comments below okay so today's dilemma design dilemma is for Coby O'Sullivan in st. Louis Missouri it is a living room here or a sitting room I guess she calls it she's looking to update it add some blue in some more white and kind of go for a like a modern kind of coastal beachy cottage look a her total budget is $4,500 she has a two-year-old and they used this room as kind of a game room / playroom so she's looking for a nice her priority as a nice coffee table that they complete games on that her child can draw and play on so with that all said let's get started actually here let me show you the finished design I did for her here it is and let's back up I'll show you the three design picture she showed me or she sent to me this is the first one so you can see there's lots of blue natural elements um natural wood and this is second one a little more contemporary lots of bright white I'm seeing a lot of you know patterns like striped patterns here some plaid pattern there and then this is the last one nice bright airy these white slipcover chairs are awesome this great plant here so you can kind of see where I got my inspiration from there she also sent me a Pinterest board so this is kind of all of her pins that I'm assuming are for her living room I can kind of show you the products I chose for her room and kind of some of the alternative alternative products that would work as well so since she said her priority was her coffee table slash Ottoman for the mate the main part of the room here I decided to kind of use that as my splurge and so here's the coffee table right here and I chose this piece because she said she liked natural wood I thought it'd be a great surface for them to play games and for her daughter to play on and it also has storage so she can put toys and games and that sort of thing in there here we go this piece is from Restoration Hardware and it's actually probably more than half our budget at close to $2,400 so that is quite the splurge I'm not sure if she's gonna we could go for that because it's quite a lot of money it's a really cool piece but I also gave her some other options so let's go check those out here's another from another one from Restoration Hardware which is almost as expensive but it just kind of gives a different look which I thought was pretty cool now for a little cheaper alternative this one's kind of fun it has open storage so she can put some bins and you know the bottom down here maybe and that's only you know five hundred and thirty dollars or I'm she did talk about maybe doing an ottoman so I thought you know maybe this one was a good option the only thing with an ottoman I'm worried about is that it's hard to draw and that sort of thing on but it is you know nice for extra seating and this one has a little bit of storage here with this drawer and then you can tuck some bins underneath okay moving on I chose these chairs for the design because of this inspiration picture so I thought this chair was very similar to the ones I chose also in her before picture here it's not a huge space so I didn't want to take up too much room with some more seating so I thought these chairs were kind of nice and streamlined so they fit nicely right here I think under this window so I also gave her a couple of other options the original chair that I chose for her was actually only three hundred and sixty-four dollars but here are some more options that might work if she likes the shape of these a little better or if she was looking for something a little more comfy and substantial these ones from Ikea are only three ninety-nine they also have a slipcover so you can take that off and wash it so I thought that was a good choice - okay moving on to the rug situation you can see here she has kind of a small rug going on I thought it'd be nice to kind of do a bigger one in this space just as like a base layer a nice neutral rug that way it's a little softer for her daughter to play on and it also kind of plays into this rug here in her inspiration room so I chose this nice natural rug here from overstock and it's an amazing price for an 8 by 10 it's only 160 not too bad and a great neutral layer or I gave her this option for this kind of jute braided rug from just 237 a little bit more but has a nice texture and then after that to give some color to the space I thought it'd be fun to do a little layered throw rug over the top of it you know and that kind of goes in with you know the stripe drug here this great throw at rug is 5x8 and it's round one 157 or if she's not into the pattern so much this one has less of a distinct pattern and also it's a steal at eighty six dollars for a five by eight or another striped option for one thirty has kind of like a gray and navy so that might help tie in you know her gray sofa here it looks like a gray sofa it could be navy either way it'll it'll work just fine next up we have this classic awning stripe rug so that's kind of a nice choice as well any of those would work nice okay next up is this accent table if you can see here in our inspirations image there's this nice antique looking full down table I didn't think her room had enough space for that it's possible but I thought this fun little pedestal table would make a nice touch in the room and it kind of ties in with all the nice natural wood accents so this piece is from house and it's actually 201 so not too bad I also gave her this option which is a little cheaper for 126 and it's more structural kind of more contemporary so that would work nicely in the space as well and then we also have this end table here and I thought that would look good in this corner here to replace what I think is a matching and table to this coffee table that were replacing and the reason why I chose this one was because the wood tones match the rest of the wood tones without being too similar and also it ties into this kind of cross detail in the inspiration image that she sent so that one's 135 and it's from Target so that's not a bad price she wanted something a little more feminine with some curved detail this one would also tie in nicely and it's cheaper at only $90 okay next up I thought it would be fun these these chairs actually come with just like a neutral lumbar pillow I thought it would be nice to add some blue color to ten a tie everything in and I really liked these these check pillows I thought they're really really fun and if you we go back to her inspiration Pinterest board you can see that she kind of pinned some of these patterns too so that kind of all ties in together so those would go on the chairs I found those on Etsy they're $28 each it's a good price she didn't want that pattern I found this kind of nice tribal pattern that's not too tribal so it could definitely tie in with like the coastal feel of this room and those are $35 or if we just go back to targets we have these on sale for $14 okay next up is this throw pillow here I thought that would be fun on the sofa here to kind of you know tie everything together and she could get two of those or you know she can mix match with some of the other pillows I recommended but I just like this one the best for $55 then we have this one from Target which is half the price for 25 and the tassels are kind of fun or if she doesn't feel like doing the Buffalo check on the lumbar for the chairs she can do it on her sofa here and then t.j.maxx also has this great almost it's like a shibori look and those are on sale for 17 dollars so that's a good option too or she can just kind of go with like a classic beach house kind of woven striped pillow and these are from overstock and they're only 32 dollars so she can kind of mix and match there or you know just pick her one or two either way they I think they'd all work very well together and it kind of reminds me of this kind of mix-and-match going on in this inspiration picture that she sent then I picked this nice striped throw from Target it's 100% cotton and I thought it would be a nice touch for her sofa so I added that too the design or if she likes this classic awning stripe one a little better that would work as well or here's one with kind of like a variegated stripe any of them would work in the space okay moving on to artwork the reason why this was my first choice in the room was because I like the fact that there was a set of nine they're framed they're complete and they kind of have that beachy coastal feeling that she was hoping for with the starfish and shells here and I just liked how the natural wood kind of tied in with the tables also I noticed in her Pinterest board she had pinned this for this image right here with these pelicans and I kind of I liked how the set kind of worked so I thought that would be kind of a fun addition if it's just a little too kind of beachy for her I gave her some more updated options here's this fun kind of watercolor triptych from Target and they're actually all three for only $65 and that's kind of a little more updated that would work just just as well for these kind of shibori prints if you Honda wants to go more tribal with it these are fun two for two for $80 also a good price now let's move on to the accessories I really like this oversized vase I've seen it in person and it's huge and it would be perfect for some you know flowering branches on the on the coffee table there that one's from world market I think it's might be on sale actually it's on sale for $28 so that's a good choice or she doesn't like that Taylor piece this one from TJ Maxx 425 is great has this nice ceramic whitewashed texture or she wants to go kind of more graphic with pattern and blue she can use this one next up is did this kind of candle bowl with multiple wicks I have it in white and I actually really liked it it makes a nice statement and I thought the blue color would be nice she could put that either on the coffee table or on the end table so yeah that's a good good option there and then this nickel silver Lantern here for only $23 the reason I chose that is and as in the accessory was because of this inspiration image we have this Lantern pendant in the room and next up I actually suggested this faux fiddly fig in the space to kind of go with the inspiration image here this one from my goals is awesome it's $50 it looks really real otherwise she can get a real one if she has a green thumb to go with that I actually my first choice was this basket from world market I thought it was kind of a fun way to tie in the natural white kind of theme that we have going on here so you could put the fig in in that basket I'm that one's $35 or we have this one from TJ Maxx for 15 so either of those work so the grand total for the space was in at 40 for 12 which is just a tiny bit under her budget of 4500 oh and let's talk about the paint - I wasn't sure she wanted to paint her room if she did I don't know this bit this color it can't quite tell because the color is kind of off in this picture it could work or she want to kind of go white I like Benjamin Moore's decorators white it's a nice neutral white that wood has kind of cool undertone but it would work really well and it kind of opened up the space and just make it a little brighter or she wants something with a little more tone Benjamin Moore misty gray is also a good choice it has a little more tone so it's like a kind of gray with a blue undertone to it so that would look nice as well so I bet that's about it for this week's design dilemma I hope you guys enjoyed it you know II think in the comments below or by giving me a thumbs up and I hope you subscribe to my channel because then you'll get notifications and next one comes up so stay tuned and I'll see you back here next [Music] 
hi there Rachel Broussard here and today I wanted to talk about JCPenney home quick dry towels now I actually discussed a couple I got I ordered four more we liked them so much and I'm giving them to the mister as a Father's Day gift as part of his Father's Day gifts because he really enjoys these towels and the reason why we like them they're quick dry which they say and they really are quite dry so that's really nice one day saying when they do what they say they're going to do right and they're 100% cotton which is a must for me we we've been using Turkish towels which I'm a huge fan up to but the mister likes something a little more flesh than the Turkish towels and these fit the job nicely there there's this nice kind of waffle weave pattern and they're so soft and and they're pretty thick I'm surprised at how thick they are because usually when a towel is quick-dry it means it's as thin as can be right so so these work really well and I really recommend them you know hence the fact that I ordered four more so so I got him this white one another white one for me I ordered him these two white ones used to right here and then used these two pewter gray ones today I wanted to talk about some towels later a favorite and a copycat she counseled and they are these JCPenney home quick dry towels and you know if in the past we usually use Turkish towels because they're quick dry and I really love church towels they come in so many fun patterns and but they're not very plush and so the mr. kind of missed his flesh towels so we tried these out I actually got sent a sample from JCPenney and we really enjoyed them so so I had to get some more some more so I ordered the mr. s'more for for part of this Father's Day present so anyway the deal with these towels are 100% cotton which is great I hate using towels that are 90% cotton it just that they don't see them as absorbent and these even though their cotton they're really super soft so you know I think he's we really like that part about this they're soft and they're they dry quickly which is obviously their purpose but but they really do so there's this really nice kind of waffle weave pattern and they just they look really nice they look like a super you know expensive kind of plush towel when they're on your hooks or on your towel rack and and they're actually just really reasonably priced and they work really well so thumbs up 
[Music] hi there Rachel Broussard here and today and bringing you the next design dilemma if you didn't check out the first one go ahead and check out the link below or the playlist and let me know what you think but today's space is for Sarah Eisler and she actually just got a new home and needs to outfit it from top to bottom so we're gonna be working on her great room today which is basically the combination of her living room and dining room her budget is around $3,000 so it's a little bit tight but we're gonna make it work so she needs all the bits all the fixings all the pieces from sofa the dining room table chairs etc check out the blog post link will be below for all the sources and for alternates and just more information and the cool thing is that I actually follow Sarah on Instagram her Instagram handle is city girl equestrian and she runs an equestrian apparel shop so go ahead check her out on Instagram and take a look at the room I designed for her and let me know what you think ok so let's go ahead and get started here is the design I did for Sarah's great room with her tape budget of around $3,000 it was a little hard to get a lot of accessories in there so I mostly focused on the big-ticket items so let's see yeah we did it for a total of three thousand $198 okay so here is her before picture this is actually not her furniture this is how how it looked when she bought it that you can see the two rooms are combined the living room and the dining room for inspiration images Sarah actually sent in a couple of examples of previous room designs I did for other clients so here's the first one I really like the the accent color I used in this one so I tried to pull that in to Sarah's design here's the second one they both have that kind of same color family in common that kind of teal color and then she picked a more neutral living room she liked Danny's living room I have to admit my favorites too and then she also picked Anne's living room which has a lot more drama and contrasts but let's go ahead and start off with the first main item which is the Far loft sofa for $6.99 this is a new slipped covered IKEA sofa that I'm so excited about I've seen it in person it looks great also its lip covered so you can take it off and wash it which is perfect when you have kids around next up are these side chairs that I picked they're from world market and they're on sale for like a crazy amount right now they're less than $90 so I added two of those to her design you can see in one of the inspiration here we go and Danny's living room I use those so I figured she'd be happy to see those in her design as well next up we went with this nice kind of modern looking coffee table I thought it kind of tied in a lot of like the black accents I kind of used all all throughout so that's that's a good choice and a good price for 120 and we went with this rug here which is also an amazing price for an 8 by 10 it's 145 now as you can see in her before picture she already has rugs those are those are nice she has wall-to-wall carpeting those are nice but I always like to throw an accent rug on top just to kind of to bring some interest to the floor so you get interest from like the ground up so yes I used this rug as kind of a base to kind of anchor her living room area then we're moving on to the dining room rug I thought this rug from Urban Outfitters was a fun way to bring some pattern into the space so yeah that'll sit underneath her dining room table and that also serves to kind of protect the wall to wall carpeting because it's kind of hard sometimes to have carpet in your dining room so this can easily be switched in and out okay this is the mirror that I picked for over the fireplace area right here let's see so I imagine it would take the place of this gigantic painting here I chose the black because there it looks like the facade on the fireplace has some black accents on it and then I tied it in with you know the furniture here and some of the decor next up we have a good art piece for the dining room area well here it is right here and I meant for it to go in place of this piece right here to just bring some interest to the the wall in that in that part of this space and that's a great sized painting for a good price from world market okay moving back to the living room this is the matching end table to the coffee table that I chose and at $70 it's it's a steal now for the dining room table world market is currently having this sale on their their furniture and so it's only three hundred and eighty-five dollars for a great sized dining table and I think it'll I think it'll look pretty great in that room and then to kind of keep the space light and airy he'll take a look at it I thought these white Windsor chairs from world market would be a good choice and for a set of two four hundred dollars they're really reasonable and then for the heads of the table um I chose these lip slipper chairs as like hostess chairs so they they will go on the ends right here now in place of this chandelier here I'm not sure what's going on there if she likes it or not but I thought this would be a fun piece for her as well and at great price okay back to the living room I think we're going into kind of accessories now so I chose this lumbar pillow for the sofa and that kind of helps tie in the wall color and some of the art here that's on Etsy and it's handmade it's so adorable oh and here we go here's like an olive tree option it's a quick growing olive tree and it's fifty dollars that would be fun to kind of bring some you know greenery in some interest now for the thrill the throws around $29 it's off of Amazon and it kind of ties in with the blue theme that we have going and this horse bust I thought would make a fun decor item in the living area Sara's actually AM runs a equestrian shop that's her job so I thought it'd be fun to kind of bring in a teeny bit of horse accent and you can see I did it with this trophy cup as well and it's thirty-six dollars this black marble bowl is also from Target and I actually thought that would look nice on the dining room table as kind of like a centerpiece option to fill with seasonal items so there you guys have it that's the full design for around $3,000 which was Sara's budget it was pretty hard to work with such a tight budget to outfit two major rooms with all these substantial pieces so I am put together what the room would look like if we had a little bit more budget this space actually costs around fifty three hundred but I think it just looks a little bit more complete and this is something Sarah can kind of do as time goes on she can invest in some more pieces so I will share those sources with you I also have a bunch of other sources listed on the blog post for other items just in case she didn't want like one particular item I gave her some options so here's one of those options is sofa it's actually the sofa I own and I love it so if she wanted kind of a more substantial sofa for her living area I thought this would be a good choice next I chose these grey velvet wingback chairs just because I thought they pretty gorgeous and I thought they look great in that living room area right there they were a little bit more expensive than the ones that I chose and the first design they're around $500 each so that's an investment but yeah I think it would be a worthy investment next up we have this fabulous coffee table I love the detail the wood detail on it it just brings so much interest from the zinc door and it's around $1,000 so that's quite the splurge but I think definitely worth it and then this mirror from Zee gallery is similar to the cheaper option I I chose here so this is the Z Gallerie mirror and that's the cheaper option this one is just substantially more tall more tall than the other one so I thought it would just be a little bit more dramatic in that spot and it's not too much more expensive it's 399 so definitely doable so for the side table for this coffee table I chose this kind of gold tone one from Target 486 around 86 dollars it's actually not that expensive but I just thought it worked in this version of the room a little bit more so next up we have this olive tree in the cheaper version I actually gave her a live tree but if she doesn't have a green thumb she can always use this faux allof tree it's more expensive but obviously a lot easier to take care of and then in this version I gave her this little ladder rack I thought it would be fun to throw the the throw blanket on and kind of lean against the wall just bring some more interest to the space at $25 it's a steal she can use it either either option either room design and then these little staghorn fern wall decor items from Target I thought would look great in the dining room right here just a couple of them kind of lined up on like sidewall like so maybe over here I kept the same artwork in this one because I just think that one's really pretty and it'll work really well and then last but not least this hammered gold tray I thought it would tie in with a side table and I thought it would look great on the coffee table so there you have it that's the more expensive version so she can she can kind of use both and kind of take what she likes from either one you guys liked it go ahead and check out the the blog post I created for it because there's a lot more options and it's just fun you can see you can find all of the sources there and I also gave a lot more options thanks for watching today's video I really hope you liked it if you enjoyed it give me a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe below because you'll get notifications every time I post a new one so stay tuned and I'll see you back here now [Music] you 
take this out right here yeah yes we got brave oxidizer yeah before after are you getting it awful Jesse to eternity Arden you want to blow it out we have to change again like stuck in here yeah yeah not sure that happens to me sometimes too it's okay i know i like very fan of the cake so never found it why do these awesome raspberries have all this stuff but you can't get to it oh yeah me about the birthday cake oh yeah I guess set of cake for everyone only slightly touched Oh you Oh Riley ok we keep my feet up 
one more home product that I want to talk about is this poof and not sure what line it's from it's a bit oats the threshold line and it's available online um you can find the link below it's actually on sale it's 4499 and that's pretty cheap / poof I don't know you know if you've been searching or not but that's a great price and the reason why I want to talk about this one in particular is that it's filled with these like small styrofoam balls um and it actually keeps it shape which is you know pretty rare in a poof especially for one that's you know 4499 and it's a cute pattern the fabric itself is actually pretty thick and it's like a woven kind of material um like a woven canvas and overall I I definitely would recommend that um if you want to put that actually stays you know keeps its shape 
hi there this is Rachel Broussard with copycat chic today I want to bring you my latest target home and the reason I went to Target was I wanted to find some products that I could review for you I get a lot of requests about that on the blog so I thought it'd be really helpful if you could you can't see it in person this is kind of like second best okay the first products I'd like to talk about our couple from the Nate Berkus line everyone knows and loves the Nate Berkus line at Target so let's get started now I'm a huge fan of Nate Berkus as basket fans I you know they've they've had a few this is I think like the third or fourth rendition and wanted to talk about this with you guys because I actually you know as soon as I saw this online I thought it would be really fun so I rushed out and went and got it um you know I actually missed the boat on the first Nate Berkus basket band I know you guys know which one I'm talking about every blogger seems to have it except for me of course anyway so I wanted to get this one I really liked the powder in the black in the natural like weave on it but one thing I think is kind of funky about this is the handles they're super long and I'm not sure why it's not like I'm gonna wing it over my shoulder like a person but anyway you know who you're gonna store stuff and it makes it awkward it's like these handles definitely getting away other than that though it's it's kind of angling it's a cool basket I think it's it's full price right now it's $34.99 so that's you know that's definitely a you know not not a cheap amount that's for sure I I probably wait until it goes off it goes on sale just because of the handles I'm not a big fan next product I was talking about it's a smoke lamp from Nate Berkus um it's actually on clearance for thirty to forty eight which is steel it's not online though anymore not available online so if you want this lamp you better rush to your local target and pick it up cuz they're going fast anyway this piece is great it doesn't come with a lamp shade which is kind of a bummer but that way you can customize it right no harp which you know is the structure that the shade it's it's long it does come with the light bulb though which is kind of cool the piece itself is pretty substantial it's made of a metal you can hear that it's hollow inside which you know kind of helps it keeping it light I guess the bottom is this kind of foam paper so it's like a foam material amount of paper I'd say but that makes it so it doesn't scratch your furniture right now I I've been a big fan of this petition it online and I think I probably I've used it in like a roundup or two but now after seeing it in person I'm not sure I would recommend it it's also on sale for 1248 and the reason why I'm not recommending it is this the pattern on it is supposed to be some sort of like like a dye pattern and you can it's like it's obvious it's a printed pattern on this pillow the the print is and not a very good one either it's it's a pretty pixelated so not too successful also the fabric itself is very lightweight it almost feels kind of like a pillow insert fabric not it's not an actual like cover pillow with a cover on it which it's not I guess but anyway even for 12:48 I'm not sure I would I wanted to find these neighborhoods office products for you because they're cute right now they're trending everyone has them everyone loves on this gold stapler was actually the last stapler at my target so if you're thinking about getting these office supplies by Nate Berkus I would definitely go out and get them now either order them online they're still available online or go to your local Target anyway this this stapler if you've seen the picture online looks horrendous it looks nothing like the picture online let me just take about the case here so it's a gold stapler and it's actually by Swingline and swingline's you know pretty great name brands of stapler it's full metal not plastic which I know I don't know why I'm expecting plastic maybe for the price the price is actually good the staplers $15.99 so for a solid metal stapler with you know this great gold finish it's a very shiny finish so if you're into the like matte kind of aged look probably not for you but but pretty fun nonetheless next up is the infamous Nate Berkus gold scissors now this is this is probably a keeper in my book I love the scale of these scissors they're they're huge and they're also made of let metal and I guess it's a zinc alloy and these were 1699 so a little bit more than the stapler but definitely a keeper and you know what I actually noticed I don't know if you guys can see this I'll try to do a close-up but the finish on the scissors is a little bit more of like a reddish gold and then you know the stapler is more of a yellow gold I'm so I'm gonna finish on the scissors a little bit better it's it you know if you had them both it's so my new you probably wouldn't even notice one last thing the office supplies for by Nate Berkus are these gold paper clips there's like jumbo paper clips and I thought they were kind of fun in it $2.99 and they come with five in a package and then be kind of fun you know to store my paperwork like client work swatches that sort of thing they're just you know they go along with the whole collection so anyway thanks for us something that I had watched my video I hope you learned from it I hope there was useful for you guys there and I definitely plan on doing some more so if you have any requests or me that feel free to let me know in the comments below or just give me an email thanks 
hi there Rachel Broussard here and today I'm going to take you on a little tour of my bathroom and more specifically the linen closet in my bathroom because the linen closet my bathroom is pretty decent-sized and it's um it holds a little bit of linens but mostly it holds our toiletries and our toiletries have gotten out of hand so I'm going to go through it today and kind of declutter and Cole um and just pare down to what we actually use and need so as as you can see from the before pictures it's kind of a disasters so I'm going to first off I'm going to show you how I'm decluttering it I'm going to take everything out and then just go through every item one by one and analyze it um first of your friends me joy another if I actually use it and lastly if it's tool tool used in warp

need to use razor heads just extra supplies nail polish remover without acetone in it some extra like lotions and things and here I have more tools some more nail clippers lasers that sort of keeps it all nice and organized and put away so that's it for this shelf okay next I'm going to talk about our new toothbrushes and toothpaste from quip they're actually a toothbrush and toothpaste subscription service and then so basically they send you these toothbrushes and they're actually electric so you just press it right there hear it and it runs for two minutes with 30 second intervals it kind of reminds you to switch whatever section you're working on in your mouth so it actually comes with a sticky strip I'm not sure you're supposed to stick it on to like a mere or something I'm not sure where I'm going to help them yet but anyway so after three months they send you more toothpaste and they also send you a new head so here is an example any kind so you just take this one off and snap that back on and you're good to go and along with your subscription you also get a little travel size oh and I forgot to mention these are super create to travel with mom so they're not actually electric they're battery-powered and then you snap this base off it actually takes on but then you stick it in there and it's a travel cover so you can bring this in your travels along with your travel two days so it's very convenient that way you don't have to charge it does take a triple-a battery but you can just buy rechargeable batteries and switch it out as you go so charge one set and use one set okay and this shelf I keep all my hair supplies first up I have this bass player bass brush and comb set and I really love it because these are bamboo bristles so it really helps to keep my hair looking sleek and moisturized and then it also doesn't make it frizzy next up I just got this amazing curling iron iron from t3 and I love that the whole white and it actually works really well and I actually just read that you're not supposed to store like that so oopsie have to figure out a better way to store that this is my blow dryer from Ixtapa and it's white as well so keep that in there this is a microfiber hair towel so I like to use that on my hair after the shower over here is just some water I use sometimes to style my hair and then I have a little bit of hairspray from Giovanni and makes a travel sized single fuse year's parade very much this I live by I love this stuff it's my living from dry shampoo and it works um next up by living proof styling Thunder so I usually put this on right before I blow dry up and that helps keep my hair style the way I want it last but not least this Roubaix dry texturing spray it's great after a couple of days after I can I'm like straightening my hair it can kind of flat so this works really well it gives it like volume again so those are my favorites for her hair and then back here are some things I am not sure which I've done yet see I love this little container though it's actually concrete and then here is a little bag this is just like samples and stuff yeah just like travel samples so when I run out of a like travel size and of like my face wash or something I can refill it with this month so and the last thing here actually this epilator I think it's all they got from here of our image a while really I got this to not shave I guess get rid of the hair on my legs and I haven't really used it very much but I need to I just usually use my razor but I think this is a better tool so just keep it around because actually use a different kind that is this little zippered case of you to just earplugs so when I travel I choose those and that's that okay well thank you for watching my video

hi there Rachel Broussard here from coffee cat chic I know it's been a while but I figured I'd come back with a bang and talk to you about the nordstrom anniversary sale for those of you who haven't heard of the nordstrom anniversary sale it's the biggest sale of the year for nordstrom and it's coming up in just a few days but if you have the norm credit card like wha you have access to the pre-sale which started a couple days ago so I ventured over to my local nordstrom and I'm going to share with you today what I got so let's get started so I'm gonna start off with all the home items I got because I know you guys love your home items so first up is this faux fur flokati pillow I'll have links below buy it by the way I'll have links below for all of the products so you can you can check them out anyway this pillow was i think twenty dollars and it's amazing the the fur is so soft and fluffy it feels like a real flokati so i absolutely adore this pillow and for twenty dollars you can't go wrong I actually think you can go back and get another one next up i got this picnic blanket now those of you with kids will know that you have to always be ready to set up shop for snack time lunch time part time whatever time so I always keep a picnic blanket in my trunk and this one's a great one because it's my favorite white and black and I love this fluff load check so this side is kind of like a soft furry fleece and then the other side is actually a waterproof a lot of good material or some sort so that makes it perfect when you lay it down on the wet grass and it won't get wet so great to have in your trunk and I think I think it was only thirty dollars so love that next up i got this marble and wood cheese board isn't it adorable uh it's great i I think it's always nice to have couple of cheese boards cutting boards like fancy looking nice trays to have around so you can just quickly throw cheese platter together fruits crackers that sort of thing and this was an adorable I love the stripe pattern with the wood and the marble so goodbye right there next up i got this gray soft super soft throat and it has these great pom-poms on me on each corner and I just thought they were adorable the throw itself is really soft it's some sort of like chenille I thought that was really fun and it kind of goes with my color scheme of cream and gray in the living room so you'll be seeing that around the blog I'm sure ok so now for fashion items first up are these skinnies that I got there SP Black Label they were thirty eight dollars and there's this great kind of faded soft color and I really like it and they're really they're stretchy I don't know if you can see that they're stretchy they're comfy and they've just got a great look I love the little distressing right here so for thirty-eight dollars not bad next up this is actually my favorite item of what I got the other day uh is this kale t-shirt I just think it's so adorable and I tried it on and it actually fits like really well it's a nice lightweight t-shirt and it's it has length so it's not too short I'm not not a big fan of the crop style because it just doesn't flatter my body so anyway super excited about my kale shirt and I love Kayla obviously next we have this striped shirt from BP and I can't quite remember I think it's all its twenty dollars or less anyway it's this really nice stretchy lightweight fabric it's long sleeve but I you could totally wear this during the summer as well as layering it in the winter and I really liked it because it has is like slit detail here and the back is actually a little longer than the front so it just makes you know it makes for a nice wardrobe staple okay now let's talk about shoes I actually got several pairs of shoes got a pair for Arden I got a pair for Conrad and I got a pair for me but let's talk about Conrad's first because they are just too cute here they are these adidas I'm a big fan of adidas I I always tend to get adidas and I just couldn't resist these bright blue adidas I think Conrad's gonna look super cute in it and he's kind of like a shoe hound like he loves his shoes he loves his boots his shoes and he liked hats so anyway I thought these were kind of fun for him next up for Arden I wanted to get some good back to school shoes for her so anyway I got these pumas and she loves them they're adorable because they have this really cool glitter effect but they don't the glitter doesn't rub off at all so that's amazing because we've had glitter shoes where the glitter rubs often it's not a fun situation these I think you're going to last a while because the the fabric that they're made of will not get dirty I mean it won't show dirt and you'll get dirty but it won't show dirt so I think these are a great option for back to school the last item I got in the store or these and hunted issues for moi now the thing about these these were actually in the kids Department I were a size 7 if you wear size 7 or smaller you can actually wear kid shoes so in the kids Department I wear a size 5 and half so these are size 5 and a half the great thing about buying kids shoes too is that they actually are cheaper most of the time and I just really like this colorway like oh I'll do a close-up of the detail of the fabric here but it's it's a really fun kind of pattern so I thought fun so I actually went into the store the other day and got all of that but then I came home because i couldn't find everything that i wanted because i browsed online first kind of decided what I wanted to check out while I was there so there were a couple items that didn't that weren't in my store my local store so I came back home and ordered them online I'm going to talk about him even though I don't have them in hand yet I'm going to still tell you why i order them so first first product is this point I'll panel sweater from Topshop and I just I thought it was really adorable I love the kind of graphic appeal of it the only problem is the the only size it came in I think was a size 4 which is not my usual size I usually wear a size six and I think it runs a little small so we'll see i might have to return it but i just thought it was too is too adorable to resist so we'll check it out okay now i ordered this perfect hair day set from living proof i actually haven't tried the shampoo or conditioner yet but i've tried the dry shampoo and i love it oh and i've heard great things about the shampoo conditioner so i'll let you know how I like it but I'm excited to try it ok the next couple of items I got were actually for Arden and Conrad and it's for for this upcoming fall and winter I ordered Arden this cute little North Face rain jacket and teal which is kind of her her favorite color right now Thank You Elsa anyway she needs a rain jacket so I thought this was a good option and she actually has some teal hunter rain boots so I thought that those would work together nicely next up i got these these teal northface winter gloves for Arden as well they kind of matched her hole teal team going on she doesn't have any gloves for this upcoming winter and I thought these were fun because they also have a fingertip where you can use smartphones so she can still use her iPad which is very important to her that's for Arden then I also ordered the same gloves for Conrad but in black so he'll be able to use his ipad 2 I wasn't quite sure what size to order so we'll see what those look like when they come in so that's about it that's my hall for today let me

hi guys um today i'm bringing you my latest target haul this is for my last trip at target the last video and I've been meaning to record this and I finally got around to it so anyway um I just want to show you guys what I got okay so the first item I got were these place mats which I featured in the video I got four of them and I absolutely love them although when I got them home I looked closely and it says spot clean only they're one hundred percent cotton but spot clean only so um I don't know about you guys but spot clean only is not gonna work for place mats on our dinner table that's for sure so these are going back today which is too bad because they're so cute um ok the next thing I got em use em I got these uh for chalkboard buckets from in the dollar spot um I just thought they'd come in handy with kids crafts around and actually I got a bunch of stuff for kids crafts today so hopefully you're interested in that next to the dollar spot I think you might have seen this in the video I got a bunch of these caddies what I got one of these bigger caddies of three dollars and I thought that behold like art supplies and then two of these smaller ones for a dollar each um not quite sure what those are going to hold yet but I'm sure I can find something if you don't know by now I kind of have a thing for organizers I have like an organizer fetish love i love bins and boxes and that sort of thing next in the dollar spot i got actually some glitter for Valentine's Day coming up I thought we could do something crafty I got gold and silver for a dollar and then I actually got a red and pink one too but we were too used it so anyway those were coming in here I got these pipe cleaners at the dollar spot very a Valentine's Day ish so find something to do with that um I also got these little heart gift bags at the dollar spot they were one dollar each 420 um so we actually made some play-doh and actually Arden did a little video I haven't posted it yet but um she is obsessed with everything youtube so now she wants to be her own um she wants to have her own YouTube channel so anyway we made glitter pink play-doh and she's going to be giving that to her terror friends and these little bags for Valentine's Day and we also got these really cute valentine's day cards from pear tree greetings if you read my blog you've seen them they're so adorable they have her picture on it so um the next thing I got from the dollar spot where were these glitter glue pens and these come in really handy for like toddler art projects oh alright then we'll love that I also got these stickers frozen stickers I mean who what little girl doesn't love frozen right and actually her birthday is coming up so and we're having a frozen themed party shocker I know we're actually having Elsa calm so that'll be interesting anyway so this little sticker book was a dollar for four sheets of frozen Snickers next stop at the dollar spot was this cute little clutch I think I showed this in the video I couldn't resist I think was three dollars um and right now I keep my receipts and in my purse so it helps them helps keep everything separate and helps me not lose receipts because I always lose receipts so hopefully that won't be a problem anymore okay um well one thing I did want to talk about um I know in my target video that I showed you guys earlier I said my favorite item was the mug life mug and actually did get that but I also gave it to my friend as a present so I'm not able to show it today but totally love it so cute I think I need to go back and get one for me ok so now I want to talk about some of the clothing I got not a lot but just a few deals that i saw i saw this gray sweater has hope you can see it if i do close up or not but it has a grey with little like black stitching and i thought it was really cute it was in the sale section of the womens department and it was fifteen dollars and I grabbed it and bought it without trying it on and I brought home and it turns out it's men's sweater so that is going back unfortunately um then I got a couple things for the kids um for Arden I got a black and white striped maxi skirt in the children's department I'll see if I can find a picture of it online because she's actually wearing it today so I couldn't show it she loves it she begs to wear it every single day and that could be because I have the same skirt too and she always wants to be twins so um I got this for Conrad it's a pink floyd shirt and it you can't really tell from the video but it's like a really soft kind of lightweight material it's a teeny bit big for him right now but pipe it was so cute i couldn't resist i think i was eleven dollars ok the next thing I got were these on circo socks now Conrad wears these socks already in a smaller size and I love them so much um because they're super soft they're stretchy and they actually stay on so these are the next size up so he'll be wearing those soon um ok the next thing I got were these method cleaning supplies they were having a little sale the target has this display oh I forgot what it's called something like clean clean something i'll try to look it up but anyway they had a sale on method stuff and all these other eco-friendly brands like mrs. meyer's so i decided to mix up your usual routine instead of you getting lavender I got the method all-purpose um natural cleaner in Clementine and the foaming hand wash in orange ginger so anyway that should be fun okay I think that's it for today um feel free to like my video and I'll be you know if you like it i'll post some more and as always feel free to leave me a comment um where you want me to visit next and i will see you guys soon bye
