So in love with our Fireclay Tile!. #ad Remember during the holiday season last year when some friends and I helped to refresh a community centre on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in NYC? Well  as a way to celebrate my birthday in a few weeks' time  my heartmate and I are going to be volunteering once again with Habitat for Humanity NYC here in the city! Just like last time  I'll be bringing you guys along for the experience with me. If you are looking for volunteering opportunities in your local area  check out the State Farm NeighborhoodofGood.com website. #MakeYouSmileStyle. Happy as a clam in the beach house! Today on the blog I’ve shared five of the things I learned from doing my first top-to-bottom home renovation  including why our Trane HVAC system was a key investment. #ad #MakeYouSmileStyle https://www.brightbazaarblog.com/2018/03/trane-hvac-system.html. This month for Grandin Road I styled bedrooms for three different design personalities - organic  luxe and playful. Organic was my favorite! Stop by the blog to see all three and learn how to recreate your favorite! #MakeYouSmileStyle https://www.brightbazaarblog.com/2018/02/bedside-table-three-ways.html. Travel has always been a catalyst for my decorating inspiration back home  just like these incredible blues of the Mediterranean Sea. Visiting unique and beautiful places  such as the Balearic Islands  inspires me to bring the feeling of my adventures home by redecorating my spaces as a nod to where I’ve stayed.

Living with anxiety doesn’t mean you can’t achieve greatness in life. I remember the days when it weighed heavy on my shoulders and I didn’t believe I could ever live life to the full.
*
It's difficult to put into words how even the most basic of everyday tasks - going to the barbers  standing in line at the post office or getting on public transportation - would feel like mountains to climb and felt like a weight on my shoulders that stopped me achieving all that I could. All too often they were peaks that were too high to conquer. My palms would sweat  my heart would race  I'd feel like I was going to pass out. Sometimes I almost did.
*
I know there’s likely some of you out there right now that feel that way. So  I’ve partnered with Head and Shoulders to share my experience and my advice for overcoming this obstacle. My hope is that by sharing my personal experience from this part of my life I might be able to help anyone else who suffers with anxiety  so that you too can overcome the obstacle in your life and start on a positive path to achieving your full potential in life.

•
That same month I joined Pinterest and one of the first pictures I ever pinned was of Ålesund  Norway. The moment I saw the picture I was captivated by it  and immediately looked up more information on it. I discovered that it was at least two flights away from England (where I was living in 2010).
•
At the time  I could barely afford my monthly rent payments and I remember feeling deflated. I was working so hard and felt like I couldn’t afford to keep a roof over my head month to month  let alone travel to what seemed such a charming and magical place.
•
Almost eight years later I found myself in Ålesund  Norway  standing upon a mountain to take the exact same photograph of the city that I’d pinned on Pinterest all those years ago.
•
I felt emotional because I remembered how hopeless I felt back in 2010. How I dreamed of being able to see more of the world and experience new cultures. Standing there  looking down on a place I’d longed to visit for so long  I realised how far I’d come  and how much further I’ve yet to go.
•
That’s the amazing thing about travel. It can take you away but it can also transport you right back to a place you’ve been before. It makes you feel emotions both old and new. It gives you hope. It makes you feel that anything is possible. 🌟 #MakeYouSmileStyle. Snow day in New York City! Hope everyone on the East Coast stays safe and warm!.

There’s something special about this captivating neighborhood that is alive with new builds and construction. From the amazing 56 Leonard Street building (affectionately called the Jenga Tower!) to many other smaller condo buildings there’s a draw to buying and living in TriBeCa that I can’t deny. I love that it feels so calm amongst the cobbled streets  as well as its proximity to the water and the One World Trade area. If you’d also like to buy in TriBeCa  consider borrowing from HSBC who can provide financing in condominiums and cooperatives across all neighborhoods in NYC. #MakeYouSmileStyle #ad http://nyti.ms/2qGp7cz.

Definitely want to incorporate a farmhouse apron sink like this beauty in our beach house kitchen renovation!. Every time I visit the rooftop of the Metropolitan Museum of Art on the Upper East Side I can’t help but stop and photograph the incredible view over Central Park. In fact  it’s my favorite #MakeYouSmileStyle view in the entire city and always has been! Hearing the birdsong from the trees below mixed with the iconic beeping of NYC taxi horns is a wonderful melding of city and bucolic life. I often think to myself how lovely it would be to live on the Upper East Side and be able to experience this view everyday. If you are as charmed by this view as I am and would like to buy property on the Upper East Side be sure to explore a mortgage with HSBC. Even if you're from another part of the world  HSBC works closely with buyers who don’t have U.S. credit history. As an expat from the UK who has gone through the house buying process without long-term U.S. credit history  I can’t stress how helpful this is! #ad http://nyti.ms/2qGp7cz. The first time I visited New York City  I walked over the Brooklyn Bridge and across into the Dumbo (Down Under The Manhattan Bridge) neighborhood. I felt instantly drawn to the historic warehouse buildings and cobbled streets. However  it was the breathtaking view of the Manhattan skyline across the East River that stopped me in my tracks. There is just something about the Manhattan skyline that never fails to inspire and energize me. It's truly a #MakeyouSmileStyle view! This is one of my favorite neighborhoods in the city and while I don't live in Dumbo right now  I would love to do so one day. If you are looking to buy a place to live in Dumbo or elsewhere in NYC then HSBC offers a range of mortgage options. #ad http://nyti.ms/2qGp7cz.

Brands that show support for our community during Pride Month is wonderful - as a gay  small town boy I would have felt very comforted to see a major brand displaying the 🏳️‍🌈 in their stores and products  but it's those companies that visually declare their support and donate to LGBTQ charities and equality efforts beyond the month of June that I am truly grateful for. 🙏🏻💯 #MakeYouSmileStyle #SayHi. The Flatiron District has always had a special spot in my heart so it’s no surprise I considered living in the neighborhood when I moved to NYC. My relationship with the area goes back a number of years to when I published my first book as the publishing house was located in the famous Flatiron Building. I remember sitting in a meeting with the publishing team in a conference room right at the tip of the building’s tenth floor  looking out over the city and thinking to myself: “One day  I’m going to live in New York City”. I think that was one of the key moments in my life that inspired me to make the move to NYC  and it’s why I’ve always felt a strong connection to the vibrant and energizing Flatiron neighborhood. For anyone looking to buy property in Flatiron or elsewhere in NYC  HSBC can provide you with a dedicated mortgage consultant who will help you every step of the way  from start to finish. #ad #MakeYouSmileStyle http://nyti.ms/2qGp7cz.

The Dove Men+Care Elements Treehouse was my first-ever treehouse decorating project and I love how the space came together! As a #DoveMenPartner  I sought to bring together the perfect balance of nature’s charm with modern amenities. The sage from the Dove Men+Care Elements Minerals + Sage range was a big source of inspiration for the design throughout the treehouse  so I introduced soothing green accents across pillows  vases  and artwork to evoke an overall sense of calm. #DiscoverElements #MakeYouSmileStyle.

For the design of the Dove Men+Care Elements Treehouse  I took inspiration from the elements in the new Dove Men + Care Elements product range: the art on the wall was drawn in charcoal ✍🏻; nods to the calming properties of sage were incorporated throughout  including the bedroom decor and bedding 🌿; and the wooden bed frame is a reference to sandalwood 🌲. Raise your hand if you would like to spend a cozy night here sleeping amongst the trees! 🙋🏻‍♂️🌳🙆🏻‍♂️ #DiscoverElements #DoveMenPartner #MakeYouSmilStyle. I had so much fun exploring the beautiful Renaissance New York Midtown this week as part of their Global Day of Discovery. As I travel a lot for my job I'm always keen to stay in hotels that defy conventional travel and offer an unexpected experience with great design moments. That's why I love their #BusinessUnusual approach to hotels  which are curated with discoveries and design that celebrate the neighborhood. Just like the luxurious  jewel-like purple woven wall in the lobby that nods to the garment district around the Midtown property. I also loved the bar area  which has a  elegant yet edgy feel thanks to a juxtaposition of smooth millwork installations and polished marble surfaces against the rough texture of exposed concrete walls. So happy to have discovered this #MakeYouSmileStyle hotel - love! #renhotels #renhotelspartner. I had so much fun exploring Florida’s Emerald Coast with VISIT FLORIDA.

hi folks will from bright bizarre here what better to do on a freezing November day then head into store actually spring summer press show to see what they've got in store for us next season I'm excited so come join me when understand our collections from the new spring summer range is this coastal range which I think it's great for modern space this is the Collington armchair which they've updated with a Wallis fabric in the sea spray colorway and it being a great statement piece for a coastal space another standout piece from the coastal range is this marina dart lamp what I really love about it is that you can personalize it because it's like almost like a kiln ajar you can open it up and then place whatever you want inside so obviously here there's pebbles which gives it a real seaside theme but if you want to do something a little bit different why not put in some mementos from your kids to really personalize it now join me in the Pais Garden room set which I think it'd be a favorite with my mum thanks to the Chyzyk and Mansfield fabric prints they've got a beautiful combination of dove gray cranberry and serese-- pink which makes a really fresh look for summer another great piece from Laura Ashley spring/summer collection is these made-to-order dining chairs you can get them in four different shapes three different leg colors and 21 different fabrics okay you now join me in my favorite look from Laura Ashley spring/summer collection called Bloomsbury and it's actually reinvented from their original Bloomsbury collection in the 1980s to celebrate their 60th anniversary it was actually 1987 which is my year of birth so I kind of feel like things have gone a little bit full-circle there's some really great key pieces such as this bars here which would be great stuffed full of some spring flowers and these paint pots which i think would actually look really nice full of stationery on a desk is kind of a fun take on the pen pop even better on the Milton writing desk mixed in amongst the collection are these great statement pieces such as this sofa which you can then accent with any fabric you like across four different sized lampshades in the collection well folks that's a wrap from inside the spring-summer press show I can't wait for it to hit stores next spring my favorite pieces have to be the coastal lamp and the updated Wallace fabric I think it looks fantastic tell me your favorite pieces in the comment section below see ya 
hi guys welcome back bizarre here welcome it's my colourful apartment I thought I'd share these dates and tips for wetting your kitchen into shape for the spring season just over there I've got brand new cabinet from my house doctor and until home is quite industrial peace but of course that we might usual colorful spin I thought I'd share that with you today in case you wish to do the same in your own kitchens so grab a finger cut a few English tea welcome to a small corner off the bright bizarre kitchen this is the cabinet in question that we're gonna talk about today it's 1930s industrial spots and it's a really great piece because I want to show you how you can use industrial pieces like this and marry it was colorful elements and for real stylish impact first thing I did is I painted the inside of the cabinet white is a great neutral backdrop to the pastoral trains I've been laid throughout the inside of the cabinet okay so the first thing to bear in mind when you're starting a kitchen cabinets they need to balance style with practicality and I've done that here by putting elements from across the kitchen that you'd use on a day-to-day basis so as well as you usual ceramics we've also got and recipe books are storage jars tea towels roasting pans milk pans stores trays you Nina what I've done is I've tried to pull together a unique mix of products but all have one red thread through them my top tip for getting a consistent look when you start at the cabinets and pick a color palette and and roll with it what I've done is like one for a personal thing as well I've laid in mint pink and soft Primrose yellow tones but then what I've also done is I have shots of citrus colors like this yellow crap here just to break up the palate a little bit it's convenient e-force finally when it comes to placing everything inside the cabinet try approach it in as an organic way as you can so don't just place things in even numbers place them in odd as well as look as bad or Thrones look off and give it more of a natural relaxed look and also place things in unique ways what we've done here is placed a mark inside a bottle you wouldn't normally do now imagine it it just gives an interesting shape and form Oh huh until next time folks keep it up you 
I think people should buy breakfast Arabic is it's a really fresh take on interiors where I've incorporated a lot of my own personal photographs to show how color doesn't need to be something that's daunting it's actually something that you can be inspired about in everyday life you don't need to be a scientific expert or a decorator by trade it really can get color right by looking at the natural environment than your personal memories to see what colors you like and then how you can incorporate them into your home there's lots of new and exclusive content in the book it was something I was really passionate to make sure that the book achieved so that we included locations that haven't been shot for homes before so we've got the co-founder and creative director of fab calm his upstate New York home John Flanders Shelter Island home and many other homes as well that have never been photographed in a book before including my own which I'm really excited about because it's showing this really diverse lacan interiors across the world whether you live in a small apartment in Stockholm or huge house in the Hamptons so we're giving that real diversity in showing how color can be used in all those different spaces which i think is really inspiring we're really fortunate to be able to travel to seven different countries to capture all the 14 homes that are in the book and there's a real diversity in there so there's a rustic farmhouse in north of Spain due to a family home in upstate New York and then his apartments all over scans I chose his homes in the book after a long period of our three months of location research because I had a bracelet a big vision of the types of homes they wanted I wanted to make sure they reflected what wipers are stands for which is creating a home that has personality in it and reflects how you live your life so this is a very diverse mix in there because we all have very diverse personalities so the book really shows you how you can create a home but it reflects how you live your life and in personal way this is the first time my home's ever been shot before so it's really exciting to see it in physical form in a book because they've only ever sheds sneak peeks on my book before and I think the pictures in the book look really great and it shows my personality and how I decorate so true bright bizarre Stella make you smile style is exactly what it says on the tin it's probably lost inside out which is creating homes that make you smile because you they reflect your personality you feel happy and you just really enjoy being now
