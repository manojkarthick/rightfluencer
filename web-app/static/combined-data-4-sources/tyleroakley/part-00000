- Hey everyone, my name is Tyler Oakley and today I decided to do
something a little different. You may have seen one of my
previous Spooktober videos where I did four DIY
costumes for Halloween, but those weren't scary. I wanna do something scary this Halloween, so I want a transformation. So this week I decided to get transformed into two of the scariest
things that I can think of, which also happen to be my recommendations this month for Audible. As you guys know, I have a
little book club on here, and I do a new recommendation for Audible every single month. Audible makes getting
books in your life so easy. You can listen to them at a workout, on a train, on a plane,
whatever you're doing, it's the best way to take in a book. Audible has an unbeatable
selection in audiobooks, but this month, I am
recommending "It" by Stephen King and "The Walking Dead: Search and Destroy" by Robert Kirkman. You can get those books or any other books with audible.com/tyleroakley
and if you start your free 30 day trial, you
will get a free audiobook if you use that link,
audible.com/tyleroakley. Thank you so much to Audible
for sponsoring this video, we love you. Okay, so based on those recommendations, I think you have an idea of who I'm being transformed into today. I am going to two places. First, I am going to
Universal Studios: Hollywood for Halloween Horror Nights where the AMC's "Walking Dead" is turning me into a walker, which should be terrifying. And then, I am going to
the Cinema Makeup School where I am gonna to be dressed head-to-toe as Pennywise from "It"
because that was the most terrifying thing that I saw all year. I am ready for a makeover, let's go. (wind howling)
(witch cackle) - So I just got to Universal
Studios: Hollywood. I am so excited because
I am here at Scare Base where they make everyone into the ghouls, and the zombies, and everything. I'm about to get my makeup done. I'm ready. Oh, hey. (spooky music) - So I'm here at Cinema Makeup School, getting my look done (laughs). I'm super excited because when I got here, I saw a bunch of monsters and creatures that have been all over Hollywood and some of the most iconic movies and I knew I was in good hands. It feels very appropriate to
get turned into Pennywise. I'm gonna be legit. I'm excited. (magical, whimsical music) - (laughing) That is so weird. That is so spooky. - So you guys, I am obsessed. I can't get that excited actually. My makeup is very tight
on my face (laughs) and I'm trying to not
smile, it hurts when I do. So, this is the look. I feel like it's cute, I feel
like it's very gay bar chic. I think it's like three
AM after the gay bar. (laughs) I don't know if a gay boy would be wearing this if he were a
zombie, that's all I'm saying. - So this is the (laughs) look. I feel the most creepy, wait can you show my entire outfit because from head-to-toe, I am giving you glamour,
elegance, eleganza. So clearly I have this prosthetic head on, this is not my (laughs) normal head, but it's kind of heavy and I'm petrified to lean a certain way. Imma go just live my damn life. I feel the most me right now. Before this, I was just a
shell of a human, you know? I found how I was always
meant to look (laughs) (creepy music) - How incredible were those costumes? I just wanted to stay
in that all day long. You know I love a makeover,
but that was truly incredible. So I wanna know, what is the scariest thing that you can be for Halloween? I mean, I did zombie, I did clown, but if you could see
anything down an alley and be terrified of
that, what would it be? Let me know in the comments below and if you like this
video, be sure to give it a thumbs up and subscribe. And of course, I could not
have done any of this without some incredibly talented people,
so I gotta give some love. First, for "The Walking
Dead" transformation, thank you so much to Universal
Studios: Hollywood for making this happen, AMC's "The
Walking Dead", and Skybound. If you wanna check out everything about them, the links to them are below. And for the "It"
transformation, I have to thank the Cinema Makeup School
and specifically Wen Zheng, she killed it, and if you wanna follow her on Instagram, the
link to that will be below. That's all I have for you guys today. I will see you guys very soon. Okay, later. 
- Hey, everyone, it's Tyler. So I just got to San Francisco
for a little vacation trip, and I am so excited because
my mom is meeting me here. I have not seen her for like five months. And we're going to celebrate
Mother's Day together. So my mom is somewhere around here. Gotta find her. Look who it is! So we just got to the hotel
and my mom, I think, was a little surprised. What'd you find? - Look at this, it says "Welcome Tyler "and Queen Jackie!" - Okay. Thank you, Fairmont Hotel for
all the sweets and treats. Okay, yes, work. I am so happy to be back in San Francisco. Mom, are you happy to be here? - I'm so excited because
it's so pretty today. - Do you know what we're doing today? - No, what are we doing? - So, do you remember
my vision board video, and the little Sprocket I used to make it? - Yeah, yeah. - So, do you have the stack
of postcards I gave you? - Yeah. - Okay, well today what
we're going to do is go to each of those landmarks, take
a picture in front of it, print it out on the Sprocket, peel it off, put it on the back of the postcard, and send the postcards
to my nieces and nephews, your grandkids. - Aw, they'll love that. - Don't you think that's cute? - That's an adorable idea. - It's tiny, fits in your
pocket, you can take it anywhere. You get the app and it's
free for any type of phone. So you have your Android and
my iPhone, it'll work on both. You like to add stickers
and frames and things to your pictures. - Yeah, yeah. - Well you can do that in the app. Select your picture from
your camera mode, you send it to the printer through the
app, and it prints right there. No ink, it uses like this
zero ink, Zink technology. (laughs) And I would say it's like the
perfect Mother's Day gift. - Is that my Mother's Day gift? - Do you want one? - Yeah. - I'll get you one. - Okay, yay. - Okay so we're waiting for
Korey, who's about to pick us up and we are about to start
our little adventure. - I can't wait, babe. - It'll be fun. (upbeat music) - Hey guys! It's Queen Jackie and
we're here in Muir Woods. - This is stop number one. - It's beautiful.
- I wanna hug a redwood. I'm a hugger, and when it comes to nature. - Oh, Lord. - I love all my mothers,
Mother Jackie, Mother Nature. (laughs) (upbeat music) - You can't...it says "Please
stay on the boardwalk." - [Korey] "Stay on the boardwalk." (laughter) (upbeat music) - You should go in there. (laughter) (upbeat music) Cute! - That's really cute. - Okay mom, who is this postcard going to? - This one can go to Maddox. - Okay. - Oh, how stinking cute is that? - (upbeat music) - So we're here at the Golden Bridge. (laughter) What is it again? - So we're here at the Golden Gate Bridge. And I like this spot because
you can see the entire city. You can see Alcatraz, you
can see the city, you can see downtown, you can see
Twin Peaks, you can see the whole bridge. It's like you get everything
in one little spot, and I feel like there's no
better place to show this woman my favorite city in the country. (upbeat music) The last time we came here,
we did a jumping picture with the bridge in the background. And I feel like we have to
do a jumping picture again. Apparently, she's in. Let's do this. - I love it. - Cute. - That's so cute, I like this. - Yeah, easy breezy. - Let's send this one to Aiden. - Aiden? - He'll love it. - Okay we're gonna give this one to Aiden. (hollow instrument percussion music) My favorite part of all San
Francisco, obviously, is The Castro, because it's
the gayest thing possible. I used to live here. It's like home to me. I would wish anybody across
America, around the world, to be able to come here,
who identifies within the community because it's
like there's a sense of freedom and safety and a security net. - Even if... (laughs) - I love sharing this place with you, mom. My home away from home. (hollow instrument percussion music) So this is where Harvey Milk used to live. Do you know who Harvey Milk was? - Yes. - Did you see Milk? - I did see Milk. - So if you guys don't know,
Harvey Milk was the first openly gay elected official
in the United States. And to me, I find him really
inspiring because he showed the world that just because
it had never happened before, doesn't mean it can't
happen in the future. And I don't know if I'm ever
going to run for office, but somebody like that
inspires me to think, okay, maybe I could. I really love it and I loved
walking by it every day when I lived here. (hollow instrument percussion music) So cute! - I love it. - Oh my God, that is actually adorable. (hollow instrument percussion music) - We're gonna send this one to Harper. - Harper, watch out in the mail. (hollow instrument percussion music) So I feel like the perfect
way to end the day is at Dolores Park, which is
one of my favorite spots to have a little picnic and
have all my friends just hanging out, looking
at the beautiful city. It feels like a nice community here. (hollow instrument percussion music) Let's stick it. Who are we sending this one to? - Olive and Delilah. - Olive and Delilah, the twins. They're getting a love
letter from San Francisco. Mom, did you have fun today? - I had an awesome time, honey. - Did you? - Yes. Thank you so much. - Okay, so we're gonna go. We have the whole weekend
ahead of us to hang out - Woo hoo! - And enjoy and celebrate Mother's Day. And there's no one else I'd
rather do it with than you. Thanks for joining us, we love you. Mom, if they like the
video, what can they do? - Thumbs up, baby. - Baby. We'll see you guys soon. Thanks, Sprocket, for sponsoring
this video, we love you. And if you want to get a
Sprocket, you can check out the description below. - Bye. 
- Hey everyone, my name is Tyler Oakley and I recently asked you guys to send some questions with
the hashtag ask Tyler anything. Here we go, that was very Lady
Gaga of me, but here we go. Donna says what does it
feel like to be famous? Donna, I think this question is a trap because to answer it is to imply that I think I'm famous,
which a lot of people would argue with. But so I'll only talk to my experience. It's very weird to have
people know who I am and me not know who they are. It's very weird to have
people have opinions of me that I've never met or heard of. The weirdest thing is
to walk a red carpet. Okay, I think it perfectly
encapsulates the whole weirdness of fame because it's so fake. It's so weird, it's so stupid, it's so like produced! Like you are standing on a carpet smiling in an outfit that you didn't pick for an event that you
probably would rather stay home instead of going to and you're smiling at these strangers who are screaming your
name to take a picture of you to put on a website so
that the website gets clicks. When you think about it all, it's just, it is a circus. There are a lot of things
surrounding fame that I enjoy. I like having a voice that is heard and being conscious of what I'm saying and hopefully trying to
do good in the world. That is a cool thing of fame, but the circus of fame
is an eyeroll and a half. It's silly and weird and fun and stressful and it's a job. That's what it is. It's a job. Nobody ever says it's just a job, because everyone from the outside thinks it's like this thing! But at the end of the day, it's a job. I hope that doesn't come
across like I don't like it. I just am trying to explain it. I'm trying to like, it's
weird to even think about. I don't know. Does that make sense? Ooh, I should ask my
friends about this more because I think it's so interesting. And I think it's something
that none of us talk about. Should I drop out of school? Just say the word, I'll do it. No! Eh-eh, don't drop out of school. Education is important. How dare you? Audrey says what level
are you on Best Fiends? Best Fiends is a free
puzzle adventure game where you upgrade your characters by defeating evil slugs. It is one of my favorite games. It's actually like the only
game I have on my phone and I am obsessed. Last time I played it in a YouTube video, I was like level 50-something? I am now level 120, so. Okay so this is the game. See that big evil slug up there? I need to kill it. Wait, I might beat this level oh my god. Oh my god y'all, if I beat this level, I swear to you I have been working on this level for so long! Did I just beat the level? I just beat the level! Oh my god you guys, I have been working on that level for so long! Oh, I would just like to thank Best Fiends for sponsoring this video. I'd like to thank all of
you for getting the app. It's free in the app store. The link is below. Also, Best Fiends just became more social which means you can connect to Facebook and brag to your friends that you just beat the level, which I'm about to do! Hogwartstyler says Tyler, what is your favorite song on Joanne? You guys, the new Lady
Gaga album is so good. I just need to have a
little frivolous moment. I love Dancing In
Circles, it's incredible. Self love anthem. Sinner's Prayer, Come to
Mama, Grigio Girls, A-Yo? If you haven't listened
to it, go listen to it. I'm gonna put my favorites on my Spotify. The link is below. Layne says have you kissed
any other Youtubers? Uh duh! I have kissed my fair share of Youtubers. Feel like myself, I'm
like blushing right now. My favorite kiss of any
Youtuber if I had to pick one would probably be me and Zoe. Look at us, straight people, doing it. Olivia says tell us about
the new Binge cover. You guys, Binge is coming
out next week in paperback. If you want to get it, the link is below or it'll be in bookstores or
Target or Barnes and Noble or airports, it's gonna be everywhere. Please if you see a
copy, send me a picture. I'm gonna freak out and
retweet you if I see it. But it's got like the candy on the cover. It's got this like really adult
picture of me on the back. My friend Luke took the picture. Luke Fontana. My favorite thing about
it is that it's $8 cheaper than the hardcover which
I love because it means more of you can get the book. And it has a bonus chapter
in it which is only in this paperback version, so go get it. The link is below. AffectedOakley says what movie
should I watch next weekend? If there is one movie you
make sure you see this year, so far, the movie that I've loved the most, it's called Moonlight. It was good to begin with, but it's also like the best LGBTQ plus movie
I've ever seen in my life. Laurie says are you
ready for Thanksgiving? I am so ready for Thanksgiving. My friends and family
do Thanksgiving so big, so I'm gonna go home. I'm gonna be with family,
and all my friends and it's gonna be great. It's exactly what I need,
especially after this month. Thank god the elections
happen during the holidays because then we can all just go home and hug the people that we need to hug. Thank god. Okay so that's all the questions
I'm going to answer today. If you like this video, be
sure to give it a thumbs up. If you would like to see my latest video, click right there. If you want to hear my latest
podcast, click right there. If you want to be my person of
the week, click right there. I will see you guys very soon. I hope you're taking care of yourselves and go tell somebody that you
love them if you love them because it's important. Okay, bye. (clicking tongue) 
- Hi everyone. My name is Tyler Oakley, and I just got back from Amsterdam. I had the time of my life at VidCon. Y'all saw last week's video. If you haven't yet, you
can click right here. I had so much fun at VidCon. But, that was only half of
what I did in Amsterdam. This video, is everything else that I did with all my YouTube friends. There are so many fun little cameos. So, if you spot anybody, screenshot it, and Tweet it to me, 'cause
I wanna see who you find. Now, before I show you all
my Amsterdam adventures, be sure to give this video a like. I'm gonna love you forever, if you do. It's that easy. Everyone in Amsterdam is so nice. I had so much fun. And, this is what happened. So, we just got to Amsterdam, and we already ran into
a couple of people. I'm just so happy to be here. It's been forever. And those girls told me
that Mamrie's already here, and Grace is already here. All my friends are in Amsterdam, and I'm so excited to see everybody. Welcome to Amsterdam. ("Human Touch" by Betty Who) - Hi! - Hey, welcome to Amsterdam. Or as I like to call it, AmsterGlam. - Oh yes, yes. - You can name it (speech
drowned out by background noise) - I'm giving you that. There's the I Amsterdam. Here I am world. - Here, I'll interview you. Ready? Tyler Oakley. - You're pointing over there. - What, I don't know. Let's just give the people what they want. - [Tyler] What do they want? - Just me in slow motion, follow me. ("Chariots of Fire" by Vengelis) - So, the best way to see the city, is to ride on a bike. (upbeat music) 15,000 bikes fall into
the canal every year. And today we find out if
it's gonna be one more. Oh, that ramp. I sure hope I don't get hit by a car. (screaming) Oh my God. Beautiful Amsterdam has so many (speech drowned out by background noise) Tight squeeze. Bonjour. Bonjour. Bonjour. Goedenmorgen. This is the most narrow
bridge, in all of Amsterdam. Oh God. I love Amsterdam. We did it. Amsterdam is beautiful. And, I didn't die. So, it's like a win win situation. So, the last time I was in Amsterdam, Korey and I had these
delicious little snacks called Vlaamse Friet. And, it's like french
fries, but in a cone. And you can get, like cheese on top, or like bacon on top,
or like chili on top. And I wanna find 'em. I'm on the lookout for
men, and Vlaamse Friets. In that order. Vlaamse Friets are close. I can feel it in my soul. Vlaamse Friets, look. Why's that fat child pissing? Or is it a muscular child? I have been craving Vlaamse Friets. All my life. It's been years. So good. Here we are, at the Heineken Experience. I'm all hopped up. - I can barely bottle my emotions. - I can barley believe we're here. - Beer. (upbeat dance music) We just found out how they do it. Now we're gonna show them how we do it. - Ha ha. (laughing) - Drinking. - Consume. Prewst.
- Proost. - Oh Proost, sorry. I feel like we can't go to
Amsterdam without going here, and getting a beer. - I know, it's just a couple
of buds drinkin' some suds. - So right now, we're doing a canal tour. Or as we like to call it. - Pokemon Go. - That's beautiful. ("Human Touch" by Betty Who) I'm all flower. We're about to do the swing. Over all of Amsterdam. They're really not having
us sign any waivers over here in Amsterdam. I sure hope there isn't
any drama on this swing. Nooo. Smelled like pork up there, because the kitchen wafts just straight that way. So, we just finished the boat tour. Amsterdam is hot as hell. - Let 'em know, let 'em know. Keep goin'. - I can't get enough. - Oh, me neither. (laughing) - That's all. So, we had a big day exploring Amsterdam. And now, a little group
of us are going to explore the Red Light District. Which I'm very excited about, because I love that
Amsterdam is so sex positive. So, my favorite spot in all
of the Red Light District, I think, is this gay bar. And, you might just walk
by it on the street, and not even know it, but it's got like cultural history to it. Because, it was the very first place, in all of Amsterdam, where guys could dance with guys, and girls could dance with girls. And I feel like, that is
something to celebrate. It was owned by this lady. And she apparently is
the most badass of all. Everyone in town was
apparently afraid of her, because she stood up to everyone, who tried to like, bring down the gays. So, we're gonna go inside. We're gonna get a beer. So, we're going into the, like deep within the Red Light District, and you're not allowed to
bring cameras or video cameras. So we're turnin' it off. This is the last you get to see. So, those were my adventures in Amsterdam. I had so much fun exploring the city, and getting to know the culture there. And I love doing that. I love making little videos
about places where I go. But let me know, where
should I go to next, and make a video exploring? I'd love to do more of these. Let me know in the comments below. Put where I should go, and let me know what I should do there. And, if I do your thing, in your town, I'll put your comment in the video. If you like this video, and
you would go to Amsterdam, give this video a thumbs up. Maybe, we can go together, and become besties there. Anything's possible. If you wanna see my video
about VidCon in Amsterdam, click right there. I had so much fun. It was probably my favorite
convention in a long, long time. And you'll see why when you watch it. If you wanna check out the
latest podcast episode, click right here. It's got the one and only Connor Franta. And, if you wanna be
my person of the week, click right here. But, that is all I have
for you guys today. Thank you so much for letting
me go on these adventures, and coming along with me for the ride. I love ya. Have a good life. That's all. Bye. Prewst. - Proost. - That's a... Oh, dammit. I felt like I knew
everything, but I don't, ever. Proost, that's how you say cheers. - Cheers. That way you can edit. (laughing) 
- Hi, everyone, and hi, guys. - Hi!
- Hey guys! - We're here wrapping presents
at The Container Store in LA and we asked y'all to
come bring some gifts, and we're gonna wrap 'em up and donate 'em to a local charity for kids. Are y'all excited? - I'm so excited.
- I'm pumped. - I love wrapping. - Wow, same. (laughing) (energetic music) - Okay, so I'm gonna show
you a little technique. (cheering) - Oh wait, wow! - Isn't that great? So much easier than that. - Goodness, me. - Woohoo!
- Seamless. - [Woman] Yass! - Now wasn't that nice? (laughing) - [Girls] Hi! - [Tyler] Hi! - Does that look right? - I'm actually struggling. - Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. They're gonna yell at me. - No, it looks great. That looks amazing.
- That looks incredible. I think we nailed it. (laughing) - Yeah! - Good job! Bam! - I know you (scissors obscure her voice). - I'm killing it. - Very cute! It's a square, too. Can you imagine messing up a square? I'm definitely gonna mess this up. - This is hard! What am I doing wrong here? This person's just gonna get a two-part. What the heck! - Well, I don't really know
what the hell I'm up to. - No, hey do you want me to do it? I know how to do it. - We're all out. (laughing) Please, teach me. - No, Tyler! - Yeah, yeah, you need double the amount. - No! - Trust. - He's making fun of my wrapping skills. - I actually am very impressed
with your wrapping skills. - 'Cause see, it's like
too short, we can't tie it. - And, then watch. And then... - Really, Tyler? - I don't know what's happening. That's good, I think! Shopkins could never. What is a Shopkin? - I'm alright, I'm a little nervous. It's a lot of pressure, because I feel like it's a competition. There's lots of gifts to wrap. I wanna make sure it's seamless. - Now, let's turn it under. Oh, you glued it to that. - (laughing) Oh my God! - Okay, want me to start over? - Yes, I don't wanna ruin it. Okay, so let's turn it under. Pick a smaller present. - That was a read. - So, do we just put it in? I feel like that's all we do. - I guess so. - I think you nailed it. This is the easiest gift
I've wrapped all day! - Is this for Rey? This is amazing! - Who is she? - What? It's Rey.
- Oh! - Is that Rey? - Star Wars!
- That ain't Rey. - How great is this? - It's not for you! - [Kyle] I just love it! - Okay, I'm about to wrap
a Teen Wolf figurine. (laughing) It's so cute! - What is this? A coaster maker set. - Oh, yeah. - My children will love this. - Very iconic. - Oh, a roller coaster. I thought it was like
coasters for their alcohol. (laughing) My toddlers love to protect
their wood cabinetry. - You know what-- - Him? I love him. - You stabbed me? - I stan you!
- Oh, stan me! - Why would I stab you? - I was like, two years ago, did you stab me?
- No! - So, two years ago, we met in 2015 at my documentary--
- Snervous. - Snervous premiere, and look at us, babies. And now we're together again. Thank you for coming. - Always, always.
- We did it. - You brought this?
- Yeah. What is it? A toy? Thank you so much! High five! Bam! Thank you! So we are hard at work. I feel like we are Santa's
little elves right now, wrapping presents, meeting y'all. This is so fun! I didn't know if anybody was gonna come, and so many of y'all are
bringing toys to donate, and I feel like that is
the coolest thing to do during the holidays. So thank you for joining us. Thank you for hanging out. It's so much fun. - Finishing touch. - Beautiful, woohoo! - They're taking over my vlog. (laughing) - I'm weak, I can't even hold the camera. - Oh my God! - You wanna see magic? (music muffles her voice) - Ooh! - I know. You were unimpressed. She goes, I don't like
this part, you're doing it. Okay! We love a demanding queen. - No wait, let's do... We're team working it. You know, I like this gift wrap. It's like Hanukkah. She celebrates Hanukkah,
she celebrates Kwanzaa. She's a worldly woman. (paper rips) - You like that? - Do you want ... ? - I'm just supervising. This looks terrible. - That's so rude. (both laughing) - Nobody said I was here to be nice. - I wasn't gonna say it, you said it. - Wow! I'm so excited about this. I already have my tickets and everything. - You really think
you're about to do that? - I'm very sure. - Brock's ambitious. - I learned from Priscilla
Charlelie, the biggest-- - Who? - My mother.
- Oh. (music briefly stops) Tug a circle route. - Tug, I don't really know what means? You kind of didn't really
explain it very well. - No, just kind of woop! - [Man] Micheal! - I'm doin' good, you know. Comin' across a little difficulty on this, this expert level gift, but I recovered fast. - You're doing amazing. Me to you, while you're wrapping. You're doing amazing, sweetie. (energetic music) - Yay! Bam! So we're wrapping our final gifts. Kyle's hard at work. Eva's hard at work. We just wanna say thank you so much to everyone that popped
by and donated things. They're going to a great cause, and I'm gonna link everything
in the description below. But also, there are ways for you to
help in your own community, so if you wanna find a
place to donate toys to, there are places that need them and people that need them in your towns, in your
cities, in your states, so I'll link to some stuff
in the description below, but thank you so much. Bye friends! 
- Hi everyone. My name is Tyler Oakley
and I am so excited because today we are having
a very special edition of the Tyler Oakley show. It's time to celebrate Frozen. Ah. Oh my gosh. (laughs) Today on the show we have special guests, Anna and Elsa themselves, Idina Menzel and Kristen Bell. There's laughter. There's crying. There's hugging and I'm here, Olaf. Hello. So enjoy. I am joined today by the very special Kristen Bell everybody. (cheers) - Hello. - Thank you so much for joining me. - Thank you for having me. - Of course. My pleasure. I am a huge fan of you and everything you do, but my nieces and nephews are
obsessed with you for Frozen. - I thought you were
gonna say House of Lies, but then you said Frozen. - House of Lies, actually. They're huge fans. Is there any news we can
get about the Frozen sequel? - I wish there was, but I don't actually have any news about-- - Don't lie to me. - See, I'm dead serious. - House of Lies right here, right now. - Uh oh. What we have been doing is we're doing an Olaf special next year. - Oh my god. - And we have recorded
music and dialog for that. - I am so ready for that. There has been so much like
fan-made things about Frozen online and there's been
speculation on the internet about Elsa potentially being a lesbian. Can you confirm that? - Whatever Elsa wants to do is up to her. - I love that. - And it's up to us to support her. - And Olaf, obviously, also is... - That's my take. Well, for sure. - Yeah, I mean. I identify as Olaf actually. (laughs) Because you have achieved
my dream of being in an animated movie, I thought
we would play a little game that is testing our
knowledge of characters and who voices those characters. - Okay. (dramatic music) - First up, do you know? - Yeah. - Oh, I know.
- I know too. Let's say it at the same time. Three, two, one. - [Both] Jonathan Taylor Thomas. - Who I was in love with. - Of course.
- Of course. That's how I knew I was Olaf-oriented. - Are we playing?
- Oh, shoot. Yeah. Sorry. - Mila Kunis.
- Dang it. - Angie Lansbury. - Oh. - Ellen DeGeneres. - Okay. - Who's Adele Dazeem? - I'm just gonna let you ride this wave. Who don't you know? - Amy Poehler. - Wow. Eddie Murphy. Thank you, I needed one thing. - Owen Wilson. - Wow, even a car. - Steve Carell. - I'm just... - Chris Rock. (laughs) - Oh, Tim Allen. - Oh. - Ah, thank you. - Nathan Lane. - Who? Oh, yeah. Angelina Jolie. - Oh, wow.
- Thank you. - Mike Myers. - Oh, yeah. Oh, James Earl Jones, thank you. Gosh. Mmm. Yeah, no. - Ray Romano. (laughs) - John Goodman. Will Arnett. - Ah. Mmm. - Oh, Ed Asner. (laughs) And I did remember. - You don't have to hit me. You clearly won. - I didn't know I was
gonna be so good at that. Honest to god. I watch a lot of cartoons. - I guess my favorite thing
now is just seeing you scream celebrity names
while shaking your head. That, I think, should be your brand. - Brad Pitt. - That's beautiful. (laughs) I wanted to take a little
moment to talk about something that you do that actually
is helping save the world. And that's these granola bars. - Yes. - I wanna talk about 'em. Tell me everything you know about 'em. - Well, one of my best friends,
Ryan Devlin, came to me with this idea of why isn't
there a give back on food items? So he and a couple of
us created this company called This Bar Saves Lives. - It's so good. - The cherry chocolate is my favorite. This is dark chocolate,
cherry, and sea salt, but this one... - Madagascar vanilla, almond, and honey. - And if it's warm a little bit, like if you happen to accidentally
leave it on the dashboard of your car and it tastes
like a Rice Krispie treat. - And then like ice cream on top. - For every bar you buy, we
donate a lifesaving packet to a child in need and we just passed our million dollar mark,
so we have been responsible for helping save the
lives of 8,000 children. - Well, thank you so much
for sharing this with us. Thanks for playing my little game. - I loved it. - Frozen. Today I am so happy because I
am joined by an all-time fave. We have Idina Menzel everybody. (cheers) - Hello. - Thank you so much for joining me. - Thanks for having me. It's my first time on your show. - I'm so honored for you to be here. I need you to know, to be here
with you means a lot to me. - Thank you. - From a drama kid. - What would you listen to? - We sang For Good at my graduation. - You did? That's nice. Were you Glinda? - I was all of the characters. (laughs) I heard that when you were
onstage for a long time, something particular happens to you. You face a little issue if
you're onstage for a while. - Where (laughs) - This is word on the street. - I sound like Donald Trump. I was just about to go like,
"Where did you hear that?" - You like start sniffling
like Donald Trump now. (laughs) - I'm sorry about that. Where did you hear that (sniffs)? (laughs) What were we talking about? - We were talking about when
you're onstage for a while. - Oh, yeah, I pee in my pants. Is that what you're getting at? - Yeah, that's what I heard.
- Jesus. - Is it true. - Yeah, it's just like, I don't know if it's a genetic thing. - Is it a full situation? - My mom, my sister, and I... Is it a full situation? - Like, is all of the bladder? - Well, ever since I had a child perhaps it's even a little worse. - Oh gosh. - But when you're doing eight shows a week and you're drinking water all the time because you're singing, - Oh my gosh, yeah, that makes sense. - And if you're, you know, a lead role and you're onstage for
long periods of time-- - I can't wait for the first
time I pee my pants on the show and I'm gonna like run off and be like... - Oh, come on, you know you do. You're gonna get me an ad, like a commercial for
Depends or something. - That is a brand deal. Depends, if you're watching, call us. So you are not only known on Broadway. Frozen is a huge hit. Is Elsa a lesbian? (laughs) Can you confirm, can you deny? - I cannot confirm or deny. - I figured you wouldn't be able to. - If I tell you, I would have to kill you. I think in Frozen one, she was young and so she's still, you
know, figuring stuff out. - If Elsa were to have a
girlfriend, any Disney character. - Oh my gosh. - We got Pocahontas, we got Ursula. - This is such a good
question, but I'm not prepared. - Anybody is... - Ursula? - Well, love is love. (laughs) You can't help who you
have a connection with. - Like Tinkerbell? - Oh, Tinkerbell. That's cute. You know what? I ship it. When Kristen Bell was here,
we played a little game called Your Face Rings A Bell. She dominated. - Oh really? - I knew nothing, apparently. - Oh, I'm not gonna know a lot of this. - Okay, so it might be an even match. Are you ready? (light music) - Oh. Cameron Diaz. Tom Hanks. - Oh. - Oh, that's Albert Brooks. - Oh, Mindy Kaling. - Eddie Murphy. - Eddie, well. - Sorry, and my boobs are shaking. (laughs) That's, what's his name, hard... - Jack Black. - (beep) sorry. (laughs) You can swear here. - Oh, Ty Burrell. - Who's the beluga? He is? I love belugas. Kristen Bell. - Oh, Mandy Moore.
- Mandy (stutters) Patinkin. (laughs) I wanna say Mandy Patinkin. - Oh. - Oh, that's um... Mmm. That's what? James Earl Jones. - Is it?
- No, Jeremy Irons? - James Earl Jones is Mufasa. - Oh, oh. - To apologize. - That's John Leguizamo. Leguizamo. - Right off the tongue. (laughs) Well, you guys, thank you for watching. You should get the album now. It's in stores everywhere. I would get a physical copy so
you can have it in your car, live your best life. - Isn't that a novel
idea, a physical copy? - Again, Cake is so good. - So there's really pretty
like, the lyrics are in here. - I opened it. I was like, "I thought
this was gonna be a prop." - Does anyone your age ever
actually like look at the... - Yeah, you open it;
you put it on your wall. - Go like this and enjoy this experience? Like, "Look at the lyrics. "I can really see what
she's singing about." - And the bonus pictures. - And, "Oh, look at the pretty pictures." - I liked this one, you giggling. - "This is such a nice experience." Oh, well. Just go download it, dammit. (laughs) - Get it anywhere and thank
you so much for joining us. - Thanks for having me.
- This was so much fun. You guys, that was so much fun. Thank you so much for joining me. I am obsessed with those women and I love them as much as I love Frozen. If you like this video, be
sure to give it a thumbs up and let me know what

episodes in the future. Put it in the comments. Also, if you want to see

Celine Dion, Seth Rogen, Ellen DeGeneres, you're gonna love it. So yeah. Thanks y'all. Bye. 
- Three sisters. - How are they? Oh, are we three sisters? I thought you were saying
you have three sisters. - I was like, okay, cool. - I do, but-- (jazz music) - Hi every, I'm gonna say hello. (laughing) Hi everyone. Oh, oh okay. I'm joined today by my dear
friends, Colton and Kevin. Say hello. - Hi! - What's up? - We're here in a cat cafe
because why the fuck not? We're here at Crumbs &amp; Whiskers. It's the first and only cat
cafe in Los Angeles, and there's also one in D.C. so you can go there if you wanna go. Kevin, what do you know about these cats? - So here's what I've learned about them. - I've learned that Crumbs &amp;
Whiskers have saved over 1,000 cats from the shelter, and
they take some of the cats. And they're here. And people can come in and play with them and get to know them,
and they can adopt them. - Are you gonna get one? - No. - Oh. - Why do you hate the cats? - I love the cats. (meows) I speak cat. Sometimes I'm walking
down the street I, yeah. - No! - I've meowed by myself to cats, and they turn the other way. - Oh, I thought it was like to people. - Dude, was that you or the cat? - Yeah, see? - It sounds just like it. - Thank you. - Boys, how are you? - Good. - How good? - Like really good. - A scale from one to 10,
I'd say I'm a hard eight. - How hard? - A hard eight? - Extremely hard. - A hard eight? At this hour? - Good for you. - So, are y'all cat people or dog people? - Dog, but there's one cat I love my ex's cat. But since I've started to love his cat, I now like cats more. - I used to hate cats, I think. - Do you still hate cats? - I think I still do. No, I mean as of right now, they're fine. Nobody's pissing me off. I grew up with a cat, and my cat sucked. - Were you mean to the cat though? - Everyone was mean to everyone. - What was her name? (laughing) - My home was a broken home. Everybody was-- Pira. - Oh yeah she had the-- - She looked like a pirate. But she was gendered as such, Pira. What's new? What's going on boys? How's married life? (all talking) Thanks for the transition. - Married life is amazing. It's so much fun and you just feel- - Shut the fuck up. (laughing) This aint The Talk. How was the wedding? - It was incredible. - Did Kris Jenner officiate it? - Kris Jenner did yep. - What the fuck? - Jeff's been working, you
know, been friends with that whole family for years and years and years and yeah so she did the wedding
and everyone was balling, crying she was so good um she's so nice. - That's the most LA wedding-- - They're a nice family. - Yeah, they are such a nice family. Let me just explain the story okay? So at the wedding my mum may have taken a little bit too much Xanax and drank a little too
many bottles of wine. Prior to walking down the aisle. - Kevin every day. - Yeah. So there were petals, bags of petals to throw as we
walked back down the aisle. And my mum didn't know that you open the bag to throw the petals. So there's a slo-mo
video of me walking down, everyone's saying congratulations, and this bitch fucking chucks the bag and hits me in the fucking face. (laughing) Hits me in the face and
I look at her like this And I was like, it's on camera and then I had to like smile
and walk down the aisle and she chucked a bag
of flowers at my face. - Amazing. - And she was like I panicked
I didn't know what to do. Mum, like what are you doing? - What do you hate the
most about married life? - It's been like a week. - Exactly you must hate something - I think the thing I hate
most is I like to feel like in a lived in situation and I sometimes I get in trouble if I leave a cup that's
not washed in the sink. Or a fork. - In trouble? - Not in trouble but just I get reminded. - What happens? - There's two safe places for me- - Safe places? - Is this a cry for help? - It's not a cry for help. - Safe places to be dirty. - I'm a little messy so
I can be messy in my car - Messy, messy boy. - This is gonna turn into
some thing that it's not. But he's really awesome and just like fun. (laughter) - He's so nice. - Well I'm jealous of your love life. Good for you. - I mean, it's about damn time. I was single for like five years. - Well if you know anyone
to set me up with hello. - What's the type? Have you got types? - No types, help me. - Do you go on a lot of dates? - How do you meet people? - Are you a serial dater? - Can the 411 please cease and desist? - Tell us more about this - Get out of here. I feel my face going red,
I hate the two of you. - All of us can turn red
really easily so this is good. - I haven't seen you go red. - You haven't gotten to me yet. - So Kevin-- I just joined Bumble. - What is that? Do you do like the famous one? With like where you sign up and- - Yeah but it's all models. Are you on it? - I used to be. - Uh huh. Did that work out for you? - I made a lot of really good friends. (laughter) - Okay so if you were single what would be your dream first date? Do you want it to be like mushy
or would you want it to be? - I want to go like hiking
or I dunno, go to Yosemite, or like do something active. - Yosemite's a commitment. What if they're a murderer? - Yosemite? That seems like a trip. - They take you to the woods and then-- (all talking) - I like the idea of like,
you know, long dates. - Oh my god, no. - And just like really
getting to know that person. - Hell no bitch, I did
Disneyland as a first date. Like a three hour drive there and then like while we were
there just waiting in line being like well we've
touched on everything this is not going anywhere. - Oooh that's terrible. - It was not good. - I think I like to be connected-- - And you're like we should go on a trip. (all talking) - Yeah I went on this date, hopefully she doesn't watch this. She's kind of famous, no. - (laughs) what? - I went on a date with
her and then like bailed. I took her to Wendy's - That's my favorite
place in the whole world. - My mum and dad met at Wendy's. - Well if someone took me to
Wendy's I'd be like 'fuck yeah' I then ditched her cause I was-- - Oh well that's-- - I was like 'We're going to Wendy's uh I'm going to take you home now' - Nooo. - Yeah I was like 'I can't, I can't'. I was rude and she was so nice, like one of the sweetest
people but I was just like-- - Wow. - Do you want to be in a relationship? Or do you want to be single? - That felt pointed. - Do you think that right
now, with your schedule and your fame and all your success, that you can hold down
a relationship right now if it were to happen? (laughter) I'm just asking for the people, like possible suitors out there watching. Tyler is available and
he's ready to, you know-- - Are there any sort of qualifications. - They must be nice. - Do they need to have like a job? - Please. I don't care how far along you are as it comes to like achieving your dreams but just have some dreams. - Is there an age-ish? - I would like my age or older. - Okay, cool. - Definitely not trying to
date like a 21 year old. - Okay, 34 on is okay. - 34?! - I know, 36. - 28 (jazz music) (no dialogue) - Thanks everyone for watching. We wish you a good life. - Subscribe, like, um comment below if you guys have any other

weekly segment just of like - Called Kevin and Colt - Yeah Kevin and Colton's confessions - Oh - Where we talk about things about Tyler. - Yeah - Great - We tell all of Tyler's secrets - Well this has been great. Goodbye. 
- Hey everyone! My name is Tyler Oakley and today I am doing something
that I once did before and y'all seemed to love. I am reacting to embarrassing
and cringe-worthy pictures from my last decade on the Internet. Specifically on Facebook. Because you know how they
always pop up memories that you never wanna see and you're like, "What was I up to?" If you haven't seen the
first time I did this, I'll put the link below. I think these ones are
even more embarrassing than the first time. So without further ado I guess it's time to
share all of my things that I would never want
to show the Internet, to the entire Internet. Let's go. Ooooh! Okay, this is
like, beyond precious. This was my very first show back when I was in high school. I literally look like a
fetus. I could not be younger. Let's talk the contour. I look like a drag queen who's doing drag for the first time. The very harsh cheek lines. I was Eugene in Grease. Who you're witnessing right
here is twink du'jour. I have never looked more like a twink. Nowadays, I'm a "twonk". Don't. Oh, this picture! So, this is me as a
house elf. I was Dobby. This could be a book opening? Like, launch party at midnight. This could also be a Harry Potter, like, midnight showing? We
would go to all of them. Not because I am, like,
crazy about Harry Potter, because all my friends were. And any opportunity I
had to get in a costume I would do so. I will say, I might be making fun of this, but this was like, what
'ya did in Michigan. There wasn't much else to go to, you don't have a red carpet to go to. Like, here in L.A., there's
an event every Tuesday. Back then in Michigan
there wasn't much to do. This was like, the highlight
of my month, I'm sure. Oh my-- (laughs) No! At first, I was petrified because why did I even upload this? It's blurry, who took this? What is happening here? And then I read the caption. The caption says: "See the hickey?" First of all, why did I get a hickey? Second of all, why did I think I should have a picture of the hickey? Third of all, this is zoomed in! As if I want people to see the hickey! I don't know who I was to think that a hickey is anything you should even want! I probably asked this boy for a hickey. I was probably like, "Oh
yeah, give it to me." But nowadays, if someone even like, comes close, I'm like,
"Get. Don't touch me." Next picture. No! (laughs) No! Oh my God, what am I up to? Okay, so I loved this outfit. Because it was coordinating
grays and yellows. So when I saw this sleeveless hoodie from American Apparel, I had to buy it. But back then I was working on like, an Arbie's budget. So this
was a big purchase for me! I remember I saved up for this! And then I would also pair it with this American Eagle, like, knit winter cap, and it also had elements
of gray and yellow. I loved this color
combo. I am telling you. I look like a damn ass bumblebee. (sighs) I was a lot in high school. (chuckles) Oh my-- I don't know why this is my look. I look like a real princess! This is when I worked at McDonald's and I decided we needed to have
a community building night! And so I invited all of the McDonald's employees over for a game night of Pretty Pretty Princess and here I am wearing all of the jewelry. Because either I won,
or I wanted attention. Let's all guess which one it was. Okay, next picture! Okay, so this, there's
nothing wrong with this! This is me and Dolan. We are
hanging out at McDonald's because when we worked at McDonald's, the four of us worked at McDonald's. Me, Dolan, Rachel, and Eric. And we would hang out there even when we didn't have a shift! I am wearing a track
jacket that I remember I drove 4 hours to go to Chicago to go to the closest H&amp;M to go buy. I saw it on their website, but I did not want to pay for shipping. But somehow in my head, it's cheaper to spend that much on
gas to go get the jacket. Even when I wasn't working I loved hanging out at McDonald's. I genuinely loved my job at
McDonald's. Next picture! Oh, this is like, who are we? I had dyed my hair black. This is the summer between
the first year of college, and high school senior year. Dolan and I took a road trip and this looks like we are
doing "Lady and the Tramp". I was probably more into it than he was. You can see it in my damn eyes! I look like I'm about
to go make-out with him, he's posing for a
picture, but I'm thinking, "Here I come, 'bout to give you "the kiss of your damn life, Dolan." (laughs) I can't tell a difference
between my shirt, the Cheetos bag and my face. I am so beyond sunburned,
this is what happens! When you are so translucently white and you decide to lay out
in Vegas for a full weekend. I remember this clear as day. I had blisters on my
ears, I was disgusting. This is a mess. This is a mess in 2007. I've learned since then,
I don't go outside. But I still eat Cheetos. 0 trans fat. Okay, next picture! No! (laughs) I look like my mom! (chuckles) This is-- Oh my God. We were cleaning my grandparent's house, and these are two things we found. I think, a Hawaii themed porn VHS tape, which I am mortified by because this was my grandparent's house. And this wig, that my
grandma wore all the time. So me and my brother,
Travis, for some reason we decided to a photo-shoot. With me in the wig and the porn. May both of my grandparents,
rest in peace-- I do nothing but honor
them with this picture. I love y'all, but good Lord, heaven above! Okay, so I think that's all for today. That was not as bad as I thought, but watch the first time I did it. That one was even more cringe-worthy. The link will be below for that. If you liked this video and you want me to do more "reacting to things" videos give this a thumbs up! Let me know what I should
react to in the comments below. But yeah! I will see you guys very soon. Thanks for watching, I love 'ya! Good luck with your lives, later!

anywhere else in my life. I gotta go. 
- Hey everyone, my name is Tyler Oakley, and back in February, to
celebrate Black History Month, I made a little video called Eight Black LGBTQ+
Trailblazers Who Inspire Me, and I talked about the
power of representation, acknowledging intersectionality, and the response was so great. In the comments of that video, I saw so many of y'all telling
me, "oh, I love this so much, and I would want another version of this, for this specific community
within the LGBTQ+ realm." Asian Americans have been
misrepresented in media, been largely left out
of school curriculums, and have been especially excluded while talking about LGBTQ+ history. So today, to celebrate
Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, I am
gonna tell you about eight Asian LGBTQ+ trailblazers who I believe deserve recognition for
their incredible work. After years of serving in the military, Dan Choi decided, "it
is time to be honest." When he revealed that he was gay, he was discharged, and he
immediately took action. He wrote an open letter
to President Obama, he was arrested three times for doing protests at the White House, and he became the face
of the fight to repeal the don't ask, don't tell legislation. After so much hard work
and never giving up, less than two years later, he
was invited by President Obama to the White House, to
witness the president sign legislation to repeal
don't ask, don't tell. A single person can change
the course of history, and Lieutenant Dan Choi did that. Evan Low was the very first
openly gay Asian American to be elected to city council
of Campbell, California. And at the age of just 26, he became the youngest Asian American
mayor in all of the country. In a country that has
historically been run by old, crusty white men,
Evan is the perfect example of somebody who's like,
"um, no, I belong here too." I just love that there's
somebody my age-ish that is an absolute boss
and is running stuff, and I'm obsessed with him. When Cecilia Chung began to
transition at the age of 28, she was fired from her job, and she was cut out of her family's lives. This directly resulted in homelessness, a dependence on sex work, which for her was often dangerous and
violent, and even drug abuse. Despite all of this, she persevered through the unique economic strains and the lack of protections
that transgender people face, and she went on to join the San
Francisco Health Commission, where she was directly responsible for making San Francisco the first city in the entire country to cover
gender confirmation surgery. Almost all people in the LGBTQ+
community face aggression and adversity just because
they're trying to be themselves. But Cecilia inspires me because, not only did she persevere
through all of these challenges, but then she turned around and decided, "it's gonna be my life's work to make sure that what I went through,
nobody else has to." Ifti Nasim was an openly
gay, Muslim, Pakistani poet, who came to America to escape persecution because of his sexual orientation. Ifti is probably most
well-known for writing a book of poetry called Narman, which is said to be the
very first publication to ever have any gay themes
in the language of Urdu. He pushed the conversation
of LGBTQ+ tolerance in his community, and his
work went on to inspire an entire generation of Pakistani poets who focus on honesty and identity. Like, think of all the gay
haikus now, because of Ifti. Poems are hard to write, like haikus, who even knows how to do that? Five-seven-five, let's go, okay. Margaret Cho is an openly queer comedian who uses comedy to show
how false constructions of race, gender, and sexuality
operate to demean identity. She embraces the intersections of her female, queer, and Asian identities, and uses them to challenge
stereotypes and demand equality. While her frank and blunt
humor might be controversial, she speaks her mind, and
she does not hold back, and that is what I appreciate. Ongina was on the very first
season of RuPaul's Drag Race, and I always loved her, I
thought she was so great. While she was on the show,
she came out as HIV positive, and that was one of the first
times I witnessed somebody that I really looked up
to speak openly about it. Ongina has spent her entire
career being open and authentic and visible, and she
works to give a platform to LGBTQ+ people living with HIV, so that they can share their experiences. RuPaul always talks about how
you need charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent, and
Ongina has all of those, but I think she especially
exemplifies somebody with nerve, somebody who stands up, who's unafraid, somebody who's brave in
everything that they do. I just, I love Ongina. Kiyoshi Kuromiya was born in
a Wyoming internment camp, and he committed his entire life to racial and sexual orientation equality. He was extremely active in
the civil rights movement, and he was even Martin
Luther King Jr.'s assistant, which I never learned about. One of the most powerful
stories I read about Kiyoshi was how he protested napalm
use in Vietnam in 1968. This was brilliant. So he made this huge announcement about how he was gonna burn a dog alive at the University of
Pennsylvania's library. Thousands of people turned up to protest, only to find a note from Kiyoshi. Back in 1968, that was like a mic drop. It's easy to care about only
things that directly affect you and your personal life,
but I think Kiyoshi is the perfect example
of somebody who stands up for all disenfranchised voices,
not just his own community. George Takei is a Hollywood legend, and most people probably know
him for his role in Star Trek, but I love him because he has such an intentional use of his celebrity. It would've been easy for him to just ride out being a celebrity, getting likes and retweets
just by being relatable, but he stands for something, and he is an active representative
of the LGBTQ+ community. Since he came out in 2005, he has not stayed silent
for about a half a minute. He has spoken out about marriage equality, the employment non-discrimination act, gay conversion therapy,
equality in the Boy Scouts, LGBTQ+ homelessness, and so much more. He talks the talk, he walks the walk, and he inspires me to take a
stand when I know I should. Okay, so that is all I
have for you guys today. I feel like that's a good list, but there are so many other amazing people within this community that
I want you to know about. So if you have somebody that you love that I didn't get a chance to talk about, let me know in the comments below. Tell us all about why you love them, why you look up to them,
I wanna learn more. I believe representation is so important in so many different ways, but I wanna especially give a little love to the people in my little
world, on YouTube, on Twitter, the people that I love to follow and who inspire me and teach me within the Asian LGBTQ+ world, so I'm gonna link to those people below. But like I said, if you
have somebody you love, let me know in the comments. Okay, so that is all I
have for you guys today. If you liked this video, be
sure to give it a thumbs up, and I hope you have a great Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, and thank you for watching,
and good luck with your lives. Okay, bye. 
- Hi everyone, my name is Tyler Oakley, and today I am doing
something a little different, I've never done this before, but I have been on
Facebook for over 10 years. It has been a decade of
questionable, embarrassing, cringe-worthy memories. So today, I am reacting to
the most embarrassing pictures of them all, I haven't
see them yet, let's go. Oh my god. So, this picture, this
is a fun little memory. There I was, Cogsworth
in Beauty and the Beast, and behind me, you can see my friend Eric, who I talk about in my
book, he was the beast, even though he is like my height. We didn't have tall people, okay? And he looks like the
least beastly person. I don't know what I'm doing, I'm like sprawled out on the chair, but also I am giving you wig, I am giving you high school
drama club budget costuming. This, to me, is Tony worthy,
I think this deserves costume of the year,
Broadway could be jealous. Next picture, the first one
wasn't bad, the second one, oh. I remember this day
clear as day because me and my friends Eric and Sarah, we hosted a Saint Patrick's Day soiree, so it was green themed, obviously 'cause Saint Patrick's Day, and you had to come
with a green food item. And so, there I am testing
somebody's food item, and you can tell that I'm testing it because in my hand I have a pen, I was a judge for the contest. If you couldn't tell,
I liked to brunch it, and I liked to judge people. And as far as judging people
goes, nothing has changed. Oh my God. Okay, so this picture,
this is how I proposed to somebody for prom back in the day. I was asking Anna Zillinski,
who was one of my dear friends, to prom, and for some reason,
I don't know why I did it, maybe we had an inside joke or something, but in my head I thought it
was the most brilliant idea. I took a bucket of butter,
scooped it all out, put a message at the bottom,
refilled it with butter, and then put the bucket on
her front stoop with a spoon. I left a message that said scoop bitch. And I think at the
bottom it just said prom, I have no clue why,
maybe it was like a pun, maybe there was like prom
would be butter with you? I don't know what I was
thinking. Promposals on a budget. Oh my god, this is homecoming,
I mean, what is there to say? I'm bent over, it appears as
if I am getting it from behind, this is my friend Kelly
who I'm still friends with, this was us in a nutshell. This is back in 2006, and
I am giving you dominated, power bottom extreme, and I'm
not sorry for it, I love that. You know what, I was
what, 17, 16 or something? Denouncing myself of the masculine norms, here I am taking it up the butt
from this dominatrix bitch. God bless. Speaking of gremlin, oh my god, oh my god. So, here, this is not a cute picture, this is not flattering,
I'm sure this was like my MySpace picture at
one point, here I am, we had made a fort in yearbook class, I am holding up some coins, I think I was doing a
Gollum impression, which, to this day, is one of my go tos. I am actually quite certain that this was one of my MySpace pictures. And back then, this is before
like, Facebook was big. This is how you met the local gays, okay? So, you had like your best
pictures, you had your top eight, there was a hierarchy involved. If somebody fucked with you
in your group of friends, you moved them from your number one friend down to like number four,
this was like drama. This was my MySpace picture,
and for some reason I thought that this was gonna get me
a boyfriend in high school. Spoiler alert, no boys took this bait. Who am I? This is Connor
Franta wishes he was in 2006. Tell me that isn't the
same picture, Connor, I see you, you wish you were me, bitch. This was on a field trip,
we were going to Chicago, which is like a big deal
when you live in Michigan, this is right after I
was eating a burrito. I guess my memory is not that
bad, when it comes to food. There's the burrito, that is too funny, 'cause this is like five minutes later, this is my burrito, memory
is like a steel trap. The caption is I fucking ate
the whole thing, bitches. Me in 2006 is me in 2017. Another shoot from our Chicago field trip. Here I am indulging, how you
can see, my baggy ass jeans. If there's one thing y'all know about me, it's that my biggest splurge
is like an airport massage. And here I am, 2006,
finding a Sharper Image in a damn mall in Chicago,
just to recline for free, and get line five minutes of like that pressing all over my body. I'm not gonna lie to you, if
my mall had a Sharper Image, you think I'd be sitting
here filming a video? I have places to be,
I'd be there right now. Next picture, oh my God. Okay, so this was my
first trip to Hollywood. You know how they have
like the Walk of Fame with the stars and all the celebrities, the only picture I took with
a star was Kermit the Frog. Here I am with his
star, and you know what, I wanna collab with
Kermit the Frog, someday. You know what, I'mma put it out there, it's gonna fucking happen. Before this picture is 10
years old, so by July 26th. I have like a minute, I do not have that much
time, Kermit, call me. I, this, you know. See, this is not embarrassing
because I would do this today. The caption is senior picture, we must have done like a
shoot that day in the park, 'cause this is not my senior picture. I think this is like the last
day of school, sophomore year? And we went to the park and
did our mock senior photos, as if we were going to go have
our senior photo photo shoot. If there's any senior
pictures that I have to react to today, they are
the most embarrassing, I don't want you to see those, 'cause this is like a joke of it, but my senior pictures themselves
were embarrassing enough. Oh my God, no, I don't wanna see this, this is beyond, I can't. So, this is one of my senior pictures, this is one of the outfits,
and when I say one of, it's because I had two days
of shoots, one with long hair, one with short hair, 10 outfits both days, and then an on site picture with my dog. I was high maintenance. This pose, I look like some type of hussy, not that there's anything wrong with that, but what was I, 14, 15? Lounging, giving you full
crotch. I feel so come-hither. This, to me, is like a power
stance, I'm giving you loins. I love reading the comments
from my friends 10 years ago. My friend Chris says you
look like a man whore. True. Well, I never wanna see any
pictures of me ever again, I think those were the most
embarrassing things of all time. If you liked this video, be
sure to give it a thumbs up, maybe if 100,000 of you
give this a thumbs up, I'll do reacting to more
embarrassing pictures or something, who knows, maybe not, I never
wanna do that ever again. But if enough people like it, who knows. If you wanna see my latest

(upbeat music) Hi everyone, it's Tyler. I figured I'd put up a little highlight to let you all
know I'm back in town and I miss all my friends

send you a little heart. (laughter) Oh. So I feel like we should

too, but you know she's just gonna always like drop a surprise. That's the problem, so
we'll just like have to do an emergency episode
as soon as she drops it. She's gonna drop it and then
you're gonna be like, "wow, new Beyonce." If she dropped an album,
I'd be all like, awesome. I'd be all like. (laughter) I'd be all like. I would be, like, happy tears. Okay, well I'll see you

everything's been done but has everything been done together? And so we were like,
what about clown mermen? A concept. I think Pennywise, but look
at the stuff, isn't it neat? Is he swimming in the sewage? Okay, we're on to something. (laughter) Anthony Padilla, my mer-clown prince. I love him. I had so much fun catching
up with my friends and I feel like next time
that maybe I can catch up with one of you? So, if you want to win

- Hey everyone, my name is Tyler Oakley and welcome to The Tyler Oakley Show. Today I have a very special guest. Singer, songwriter, actress,
Zooey Deschanel everybody! I gotta say, welcome back. You just had a social media break, which I'm sure was super refreshing. - Yeah, I'm not a committed social media-- - I feel like, God bless. It must be so nice to step away. - It did feel really nice. - Right, and while you were gone I have to say you missed something. - What did I miss? - Instagram introduced a new
thing called Insta Stories? Have you ever done one? - I have not. - Well thank God because today we're doing our first one ever, it's so easy. - I feel like I was like
user number 10 of Instagram. - [Tyler] Oh really? - I mean I was definitely like early on, like everyone was like what is that? - You led the charge. - And then I like had a-- - Then you were like deuces. - No no I love Instagram, I just like haven't posted anything
in a while, you know? - It's super simple. All you gotta do is,
it's just like Snapchat. Do you Snapchat? - No. But it's really cool. (laughs) - Okay, we'll just-- - I've seen all those things. - We'll just say hi, okay? - Hi. - Hello, oh so sultry! Hello everyone.
- Hello. - How are you? - Good. (laughs) - Wait that was adorable, okay I love it. - Perfect. - We'll post that, it'll be great. People will love it. I have to also say congratulations on your sixth season of New Girl. - Thanks! - That is incredible, and you
directed the first episode. - I did. - What was that like? - It was really fun. I had a great experience. I was really happy when I was directing and not acting, but when
I had to direct myself that's when like there
were like blurred lines. - How do you even? - I felt like whoa. - I can only imagine. - I'm a director but I'm an actor. - Well your character is
notorious for how nice she is, I would say, so I thought it would be fun to play a little game
that we call compliment wars. - I love that! (upbeat music) - We're going to put
a minute on the clock. - Okay. - And we're going to take turns with random celebrities,
giving compliments. - All right, I may not
know who a lot of the-- - I'll help you. One minute on the clock. Okay. - Beyonce, you're so
beautiful and talented. - Donald Trump, you have
such luxurious fluffy hair. - Justin Timberlake, you are an amazing music producer who I got to work with! - Yeah. David Hasselhoff, oh um
beautiful chest hair. You could just live right in it. - Ellen DeGeneres, you are the most hilarious lady in the world. - Taylor Swift, ooh. Country princess, queen of pop. - Joseph Gordon-Levitt,
you're a great friend, and a talented guy. - How many compliments did we do? 11 compliments.
- That's so nice. - Spreading the love.
- Yeah I love it. - Beautiful.
- Great. - Okay so to celebrate
your brand new album Christmas Party, She &amp; Him. I thought it would only be appropriate to make our own little
ugly Christmas sweaters. - [Zooey] That's a great idea. - Okay so I need you to kind
of lead the charge though. We have tons of things. Are we going super ugly? Are we going ritzy? - We're gonna go ugly and ritzy. - Okay take me on your journey. - So, I'm gonna just make kind of like a little shoulder pad thing here. And then I'm gonna do symmetrical. I'm gonna put another
one on the other side, kind of like a little
Joan Collins, I like this. - Thank, thank you, it's
like an Olaf you know? - Love, I love.
- Thank you. - My baby plays Jingle
Bells on the record. - Oh, wait that's adorable. - Yeah my husband held
her and then we gave her the jingle bells
and then she played it. - That's like Blue Ivy on
the soundtrack with Beyonce. - Oh really, what did she do? - I think just kind of whimpered. - Aww. - So yours, your feature
was a little more-- - Oh yeah and then she does kind of, she did make some noises
which we mixed in. - Oh cute, perfect. You're no stranger to soundtracks. You were on the Elf soundtrack. - Yes. - And 500 Days of Summer soundtrack. - Uh-Huh. - Which I need to say, for the record, 500 Days of Summer is my
favorite movie of all time. - Thank you! - It, I could watch it
over and over and over. (laughs) I mean you do the math. Yours is cute! - Thanks, so is yours. - Thank you.
- I like it. - Well for all of your-- - They're not supposed to
be cute Christmas sweaters-- - They're ugly Christmas sweaters. - Supposed to be ugly Christmas sweaters. - That's so true. You know what, you can take
these for your music videos. - Thank you. - For your ugly Christmas sweater parties. - Thank you! - I'm just here for you. - Thank you, you're so nice. (laughs) - I've never looked happier. Cute, awesome. Um you guys, if you're watching, be sure to get the new album. It's on iTunes, it's on

- Hey everyone, my name is Tyler Oakley, and I am here with famed homosexual JC Caylen. - Woo! I'm here if you just say, "Bagel Bites." - Yes, we did. We're both going to
summer camp this summer. - Yes.
- Are you excited? - Yes. Yes. Yes. [Slow Motion] Yes. - Okay, so one of my favorite places at camp was the little bead station. You can bracelets, you can make anklets, you can make necklaces. - Headbands. - Hell yeah. [Both Laugh] So today, we're gonna make some jewelry that we're gonna give
to our faves at camp. We got colorful beads, we
got little jewel-ish beads. - Smiley faces. - Smiley faces. We got everything. Last year, I got a whole bunch of friendship bracelets that they gave me. I kept them. This one says, "pride." Oh, this one's very you. It says, "she slim thick." What does that mean? - It's like, "oh you slim
thick with a cute ass." - I would say that you're a
slim thick with a cute ass. [Both Laugh] - No, not slim thick with a cute ass. Slim thick with yo' cute ass. - You are slim thick with yo' cute ass. - Yeah, that's pretty good. - Thank you. - I wanna make my own. - Okay, let's make some. I really like this sea lion. I don't know how to
incorporate that into one. [Bead Drops] - Oh. - Do you wanna be careful
or you wanna be reckless? - I don't know what I want to put. - This one's gonna be for the girl who supports sea lions most. [Both Laugh] - That's me.
I like sea lions. - Well then, you've got a
lot of competition, girls. If I call you "sis". - What does that mean? - Like sister. You're like my little sis. Hey sis! If you were to see me in the street, you would just scream, "hey sissy girl." Say it. - Hey sissy girl? - But say it. - Okay.
Hey sissy girl. Like that? - I have to say, my sea lion appreciation
bracelet is impeccable. That is a beautiful bracelet. For any of y'all that come to camp who demonstrates
the most love for sea lions and you are wearing a shirt
to support the sea lions, if you're a sea lion at the talent show, if you sound like a sea lion when you're going down the zip line, I'm gonna give this to you. What's that one say? - "You got a purdy mouf." P-U-R-D-Y. And then "mouf". - [Together] M-O-U-F. - Whoever is getting that
bracelet at camp, I pray for you. - How did you tie this? It's hard. - With finesse. Done.
- This is mine. I'm giving this to the person
with the prettiest smile. - It's gonna be so
awkward for all the kids when I fucking get that. - I'm gonna make a bracelet ... - A cat! - I was going to do, "Forever &amp; Always" like
what's that one movie? Fault in Our Stars. - No, the term is, "Always?"
"Always." - Oh.
[Bead Dropping] Dammit. - You got some jittery butterfingers. Oh, spoke too soon.
- No. - JC, when was the first time I met you? - Am I supposed to know this? - I don't know. We went on tour together. What was your first impression of me? - I probably thought you
hated me or something. - Guessed right. I feel like I've always had
a special place in my heart, despite you being a mess. - Oh my goodness. Oh, this one's just going to be dope. - So this one says, "Cat Queen," with a little kitty inside of the middle. This one's going to the
coolest cat at camp. - The coolest cat at camp. - The cat queen. - Okay, this is literally just
a lot of different emotions. I want to give this to the
person with the most emotion. - The person who's energy
you're gonna remember the most. - Yes. - Perfect. Help me find more flowers, will you? I like, "A Lilac Moment." - What's that mean? Oh lilac blue? - Yeah, purple. All I do is make fun of you. You're easy. - Easy?
I'm not easy. - To make fun of. - I play hard to get sometimes. - Why are you judging mine? - I like yours.
It's different. - That's shady. [Both Laugh] This looks like it's about to
get baggy on somebody's wrist. Sometimes it's slim, and then sometimes it's thick. This looks more like an anklet. - That's huge! - Well how thick is your ankle? Show me your ankle. See, that is the perfect
size for an anklet. - That is an anklet. - The person who blows me away at the talent show is
getting this talent anklet. - The winner of the talent show? - There's no winner of the talent show, everybody's a winner. - Everyone gets a bracelet. - No, the winner is all of us in the audience getting
to view such talent, but I think I'll give this to the person who just blew my mind. - It says, "Yo I'm Cool." - "Yo I'm Cool?" - This goes out to the person ... - You sound like you're
doing a radio request. "This one goes out to my girl." - This goes out to the person
that is the best dressed, who has cool style. - The person who's fly as hell? What are you doing?
- You dabbed. - What am I doing?
- You're dabbed. - You're dabbed.
- You dabbed. - Okay, so I think we have some cute ones. - Yes. - Mine may be cuter than yours, and I think my favorite is my
sea lion activism bracelet. - I have a feeling someone is going to actually wear a sea lion shirt. - You know what? If you do, God bless ya. Okay, so I guess we'll
see you guys at camp. If you wanna come, the details are below. I'm excited.
- I can't wait. - It'll be fun.
- I wanna go zip lining. - Can we zip line together, do you think? Just a couple of girls,
clutching each other. - Like that? [Slow-Motion] Yes. - If y'all wanna find JC,
where can people find you? - Online. - Wow, you're really selling yourself. - Everything's JC Caylen. - Okay, I'm gonna put all of his links in the description below, and I think I'm gonna have him
and Kian come on the podcast. Y'all want that?
- Let's do it. - If you do, let me know. I'll give this video a thumbs up. Jay-Z.
Jay-Z. JC, thanks for hanging out. - Hey, thank you. - Mm-hmm. This has been fun. - That's what I do to my cat. I spank her. She loves it. - That's all.
Have a good life. Bye! [Blows Kiss] 
- Hey everyone! My name is Tyler Oakley and I'm here with the one and only Nyle DiMarco. (heavenly choir) We were hanging out and
we were talking about how important accessibility is, and y'all know that I caption my videos. I think it's really important for everyone to be able to enjoy content. But we were also talking about how, when you're maybe out and about, and you see somebody
you want to flirt with, there are different ways
to approach the situation, especially when you're coming from a different perspective. So I thought Nyle could maybe teach me how to pick somebody up at the bar. I'll teach you! Will you teach me? Okay. Okay, let's do this. Okay, so first, I feel like
you have to introduce yourself. So, hi. Yeah. I'm Tyler. (fun music) Yeah. I knew that. What's... your name? This is name. So then this is Hi, I'm T-Y-L-E-R. What's your name? My name is Nyle! Why do you get "Nyle" and
I have to T-Y-L-E-R? I have to GIVE it to you. Oh, you have to give it to me. We'll get there. Do you come here... What was that? How many? Often? Do you come here often? (laughter) Always. Can I... buy you a drink? Oh, that's easy. Tell me... a little about you. Too much? A lot, too much to tell me. So if you're flirting, and
you want somebody's number... Number. (laughter) Want to go back to your place? your place... his/her place... my place... Yeah. My place? Your place! (laughter) I feel like it's also important to talk about why accessibility is important, and I feel like I can't
speak for everyone, so I want Nyle to tell me himself. Accessibility is important because it is inclusive, which means more people are involved. It makes them feel important. I'm always inspired every time I meet hearing people and find out they know sign language. Our friendship also develops a lot faster. I believe everyone should have access so that way they have equal opportunities in everything. Okay, now you have to
tell me what you said. Nyle is working with dosomething.org to fight the stigma against disability. (laughter) Young people are two to three times more likely to get bullied. That's bad. We want to focus on our best ability. So if you want to get involved with Nyle's campaign with DoSomething, you can go to the website. The link is below, and you can get one of these. We're challenging you to post a picture with this, and you're going
to write your best ability. Include the hashtag, and we're
going to be able to find you. I wrote "Seeing the best in others." What did you say? "Working with different kinds of people." So if you want to know more about Nyle and stalk him because he's really pretty, you're on Twitter? And Instagram. The links will be below. Thank you so much for watching. Thank you. Duh, of course. (laughter) What is that? I'm thirsty? (laughter) Oh, great. Okay, wait. I'm thirsty. (laughter)

- Hi everyone, it's Tyler,
and who am I here with? - I'm Korey, why are you gonna push me? - I was going for a high five. (screams) Korey and I have done
many videos in the past, we also have a podcast together, Korey, what is it called? - Psychobabble! - How can people watch or listen? - Oh, everywhere. - If you wanna check out the podcast, it'll be in the description. - Yeah, I'll cut. - Every single... - Episode. - It comes out every... - Tuesday, it's fun. - And it's... - Fun to listen to. - There you go. What I love about Korey is, you are one of my closest friends and I feel like I can talk
to you about anything, you're one of my girls. - Yeah, I'm a girl. (laughter) - So today I wanna do something that I've never done on my channel. - Like make a good video? - Today we're doing something
that I've never done, and that is a XXX sexy truth or dare. - I only wanna do truths. - Oh what do you mean? - We'll see if I do a dare. - So thank you so much to Durex for sponsoring this video, we love you. I learned from Durex that
sexually active young adults are using condoms less frequently, which has led to an epidemic-level
rise of STDs and STIs. - Girl, that's no good. - That's no good. I feel like all throughout
our time together, we have always been really open and honest and helpful to each other, we give each other advice about sex stuff and talk about like how
important it is to have safe sex or how important it is
to get tested regularly. So today we're gonna do a little video where we do all
adult-themed truth or dares. So all you gotta do is flip a condom if it lands on this side it's a dare, if it lands on this side it's a truth. Okay, so like. I would have to do a what? - Dare. - Good answer. - Are you going first? - Is that me, is that what I have to do? - I think so. Get spanked by the other person. - Nah! (laughter) - This is a punishment for me. - I know, well I think
it's a punishment for me. - You like it. How hard do you want it? - I mean give me, ah! (laughter) - 'Cause I'm so nervous. - Why are you nervous? - Oh, dare.
- So what is that? Oh a dare. Whisper the naughtiest
thing you can think of in the other person's ear. - Oh, this is so easy. - I hate this. (laughter) - [Both] Truth! - What was the best sex you ever had and what made it awesome? - If I'm gonna be real... - Always be real! - The best sex I ever had was
probably like two days ago. - What? - Yeah (laughs). I've just really been living my damn life. I'm getting into a rhythm
with this gentleman. - Okay. - And I feel like we're more and more comfortable with each other, and I feel like the more confident I am when I'm with a partner, I feel like not only do I get what I want, but I'm also able to
have real conversations like are we comfortable with this? Or have you been tested? And I feel like confidence is linked to being able to have safer sex, and more enjoyable sex. - Is it my turn? - Get it. - Dare. - Eat a banana as seductively
as you can (laughs). - Eat it seductively,
what if you get turned on? - Is that seductively? (screams) Just go all the way and
swallow it, don't chew it. (laughter) - [Both] Dare. - Get handcuffed and
tickled by the other person until you can't handle it. - I sure hope I don't
have to do this (laughs). - Where is your tickle spot? - I'm not telling you that. - I know your feet are ticklish. - No they're not. Ah, no I guess that is ticklish! I was expecting a feather! - Text someone to remind
them to get tested. Oh that's sweet, that's precious. - My roommate just texted
me and I was gonna text him. So I'll say, be sure to get tested. - Testes, not testes, tested. - Be sure to get tested. - Truth! - What is your first thought when someone offers you a condom? - God bless, let's do it. How easy? I love that. Just to have that out
in the air it's like, oh good, okay, we're on the same page. Because I feel like with condoms there's awkwardness
when you're buying them, awkwardness when you wanna
bring it up with a partner, so to have somebody be
like, right off the bat, just bring it up, I'd
be like oh, thank god, we're on the same page. Oh!
- Truth! - Describe the first time you had sex. - The first time I had
sex was when this guy that I had met and been
talking to for a long time. It was fun and we did a lot of things and it was in college on my futon. - Work. - I wasn't gonna do it on the top bunk. - Futon lovin', that's my new single. - Crouton lovin'. - That's my new single. - Ugh, dare. Make your most authentic orgasm noise. - We live together so I feel
like you've probably heard it. - Was that when you
were crying in the club? (screams) - I think mine is (squeaks). Wait, what if you do the dolphin noise? (dolphin noise) That's it, that's me. - Ugh, truth. - What is your favorite
type of condom and why? - I actually don't know
if I have a favorite one. - Sure. - Because I feel like nowadays
there's so many different. - There are, look. Real feel. - XXL. - And I feel like between all
the different condom options, and their latest campaign, Durex has all the tools you need to confidently enjoy healthy, safe sex which is like a good thing. - [Both] Truth. - What is your biggest turn on? Little bit of this? - Stop it. If they're like leaning over me, and like on top, and I'm below them and I can see their arms
are flexing, I'm like. Dare. Sketch a picture, no, of
the other person naked. - Oh, I would love to paint you
like one of my French girls. - What was that squiggle? You know I'm lean. The more you draw, the more I'm concerned. What are you writing? - I drew your legs pointing the same way. Okay I'm ready. - I'm not. - Take a peak. - I hate you (laughs). - That's your butt. - I do have a beautiful thigh moment, oh look at that ass! Dare. - Reenact a random sex
position from this book. - Wait wait, what is that? Why are they butt to butt? This is the most intimate
thing we've ever done. - Oh my god. Don't fart. - I'm not! I can't believe I'm
feeling this right now. Don't! - [Both] Dare. - Put a condom on a cucumber blindfolded. - The cucumber is blindfolded? - Go! Are you ready? - I'm ready. - Well I am impressed with you right now because you are just
going right, gliding down. - I mean, stop! - Truth! - Have you ever filmed a sex scene? - In the past, with a partner. - I did not know this. - Make a video. Well I didn't add like transitions
and like, ukulele music. - Is it on your channel? - No! Dare. Give the other person a lap dance. No, no (laughs). What's my safe word? Hee-haw, hee-haw! Last one. - What's your favorite sex position? - My favorite sex position probably is like when I am on
top and I'm like (bleep) and then they like (bleep), and then we also like (bleep). But it was like that, and I learned that that was the one. - You just... (laughter) - Well that was fun, Korey. - I had an okay time. - You loved it! - I loved it. - I feel like it's so great
to have these conversations because even with like just a friend it makes me feel more
confident in my answers and I can actually think about how I would approach certain situations. So if you guys wanna play
a little truth or dare game with Durex, you can go to durexusa.com. They have a game you can
play with your friends, with your partners, and learn more about what you
are into, what they're into. - I also think playing truth
or dare with your friends is an easy, fun, casual way to actually have these conversations that sometimes seem intimidating, but they're really not. - Thank you everyone for watching, if you liked this video
give it a thumbs up and don't forget to practice safe sex and have these conversations
and get tested regularly, all those things are really important so for your health and
for your confidence. Bye friends! - Bye! Why was I making claws? - I don't know.
- Bye!

Nope. We get it, we get it. Nope. - I'm done. Go back. I'm vegan, I'm vegan. I keep getting scared by black walls. - It's just a box. He's going through it. I'm so sorry. - Don't... don't... something scary! I can't tell... (screams) - Noooooooo. Don't hit me. - I'm sorry, it was a
reaction... are you okay? - I'm an ally, I'm an ally. - Are you going to wake up? - Through this box... she seems... (screams) - I didn't see you coming...
I did not see you coming. (screams) - I thought she wasn't real! We have to go, we have to go. - Is this the end, is this the end? - Good luck, good night. - Oh, this is scary. This is a bathroom, this is scary. (screams) - What what what? (screams) (laughs) This doesn't seem like
something I want to do. - Bye, thanks for watching. Okay, okay, okay, okay I don't want it. (screams) - Nope, fake, fake news.
All fake. All fake. - This is so Hollywood, everybody fake. - Ah! Oh, just a saw. Just a saw. - Are you a real door? - That's a door, that's

(screams) - I even saw you, I saw you. No! Oh my god. - Look at my face. - I'm disgusting. - I'm disgusting. - We survived. I'm sweating...
I'm just drenched in disgust. - I'm wearing clinical strength
and I'm still sweating. - We survived. You guys...
- Did we? - We did it-ish... I never
want to do that again. Good luck with your life. - Good luck, see you again, bye. - Never see you again. Alright, thank you Liza for making it. If you don't know Liza,
I don't really get it, but subscribe to Liza...
the link will be below. Okay, that's all we
have for you guys today, let me know who I should go
through a maze with next year. - Nobody's gonna wanna... - Nobody's gonna wanna do
this... it's just too scary. - I think my eyebrows are on your face. - (laughs) Is it? - I mean, I'm surprised
mine are still on, yes. - Oh my god. Okay, bye y'all. - Bye! Bye. I hate you, I hate you so much. 
- Hey everyone! My name is Tyler Oakley, and today I want to make a little video because it has been six months, I don't know how it's been six months, like time flies, but it has been six months since I put out my first book, Binge. And, when it first came out in October of 2015, y'all got the book, and made it number two on The New York Times Bestseller List, which means that it was the number two book in the country, of all the books that week, it was the number two book. Which like, blows my mind. Thank you so much. And since then, it has stayed on The New York Times comedy book list for the entire time that it has been out with people that I really look up to, and whose books that I really love, lik Aziz, and Tina, and Amy, and Mindy, and all of these people that I'm like flabbergasted that I am right next to. So thank you so much
for supporting the book. Thank you for getting the audio book, and the ebook, and the physical copies. Thank you so much. I appreciate you. You are the best. Etc. Etc. Etc. But that is not why we are here today. Today we are here because I got an email from the people that I
made the audio book with, and they were like, "Hi, I don't know if you want this, but" Here, there's gonna be a noise. (book thudding on ground) "I don't know if you want this, but I have the outtakes and bloopers for when you did the audio book" And I was like, "Oh, God." I do not need to hear that, it's just gonna be me like swearing, and asking for help, and being like, "Is this a typo?" It's a mess, I'm sure. (clears throat) - [Voiceover] Introduction. (laughing) - Oh, my God. Right off the bat, I'm like the gayest. I'm sure it was first, Sutton's first word, like first thing I've
recorded for the audio book. And I'm thinking, "How do I even make an audio book? I'm not professional." And great. Me, right off the bat being like, "Introduction". - [Voiceover] Let's hear this, it sounds weird. Academia. Aca-dee-mia! Aquacide. Aquasense? Aquasense? Acquiescence. Charabic? Charabic? Cherubic! - This is all okay, when you say a word over and over, it stops sounding like a word. - [Voiceover] Septuagenarian Septa, sep-septuagenarian. Septuagenarian. Jesus Christ. Uninhibitedly? Uninhibitedly? Uninhibit. Uninhibitedly. - Unin-hibba-dibbedluh. I don't even know how to say it now. Uninhibitedly. Unin-hibba-dibba. Uninhibitedly. I think that was it. Unin-hibba-dibb. Listen, unin-hibba-dably is a very difficult word to say. Even when I was recording it, I was like, this is like impossible is there a synonym we can
just like pop right in. And now, months later, nothing has changed. Uninhibitably. I recorded that book uninhibitably. - [Voiceover] I hurriedly, hurriedly, hurriedly. Hurriedly? I hurriedly, hurriedly? I hurriedly, fuck. - You can hear the pain in
my voice in the last one. I'm like, 'hurriedly'. - [Voiceover] Fuck me! Ooh, fuck me. Lavatory. Ooh, fuck. Fuck me, one second. - I am sorry for all the 'fuck me's. - [Voiceover] Okay, I got it. I held my vomit. - What part of my book
was I talking about, "held my vomit"? Oh, I remember. Never mind, got it. (grunting sounds) - [Voiceover] Thank you
for believing in me. Can you check half a page Pages half, half a page, the half a page. I'm sorry, what page was that again? Ooh, that's hard to say. Is that spelled right, then? Ladies, man. (laughing) Worse, my butter. Ooh, it's so hard to read. I spent Oh no. I'mma just cut that line right out. - What did I just like cut
because it was too hard to say? Typical me, if something
wasn't going right, I would just probably like, get rid of it, who needs that chapter? The people don't need it. Well that was fun, I think. Did you guys like that? I think that was ridiculous. I'm a mess. Me, especially, when I'm like, what page are we on? Typically, me lost and confused, recording my audio book. What's new? But yes, that is all I
have for you guys today. If you like this video,
and if you like my book, be sure to give this video a thumbs up. You can get my book as a
physical copy, an ebook, or as you guys know from
now from this video, the audio book, but you can also get it as like a CD boxed set thing, and it's like a bunch of
Cds of the audio book. I don't know if you want that, but you can get that. And because I have like
a whole stack of these, I want to give some of these away. I'm gonna sign them and send them to you. All you have to do is give
this video a thumbs up, and comment below what
you love about Binge, or why you want to get Binge. Anybody can comment anybody can win. But yeah, I'm gonna send out a whole bunch of these. I think five of them
to people that do that. So if you want one, you can do that. So yeah. I'mma get going. I love you guys. I hope you have a fabulous week, and I can't wait to tell
you some things soon. I've got some surprises coming up. Be sure to follow me on Twitter, and Snapchat, and FaceBook, and Instagram. All the links are below. And you might find out before other people if you follow me on those places. So, I love you. I will see you soon. That's all. (kissing sound) (light bright music) 
- Hi friends, it's Tyler Oakley, and look, I'm here at the Olympics. You guys, I'm here in
Pyeongchang with P&amp;G, thank you so much for
sponsoring this video. I just made it to Korea,
and I'm so excited. I'm about to go see some
events, meet some Olympians, and take in all things Olympics. It's the best time ever. I'm so happy. (cheerful pop music) You guys, so this morning, P&amp;G surprised me with
the best surprise ever, tickets to the women's
figure skating event, and I'm so excited. I feel like, out of everything,
of all the winter events, I'm probably most excited
for all figure skating, all of these beautiful
women giving it their all. I am truly mystified. So down there, they're
about to make history, dreams about to come true. I'm about to cry, probably. It's gonna be everything. (cheerful pop music) (crowd cheers) Hello, from yet another Olympic event. It is 22 degrees here tonight. I am absolutely freezing. But I got my ticket for
the bobsledding event, and we're here to root on Aja and Elana, who are on Team USA, even
though it is 22 degrees. I am literally so cold. But I'm super excited to see them and root for them, because I love them. I got to meet Aja and
Elana here in Pyeongchang, and they are so sweet and amazing, but also strong, beautiful
women, which we love. So let's see how they do. (bobsled slides) - [Announcer] 41. - If you're watching from somewhere warm, girl, I am telling you what,
it ain't the Winter Olympics unless you're freezing your butt off. - That's why you have to
try it on, because it's-- - May I? - [Aja] Yes.
- Yes. - This is a real Olympic medal,
and it is so heavy (laughs). This is so impressive. (cute pop music) - Look who I found. - Hey guys, what's up? - What it is like to be here, and what does it it mean to you to have all these people
here to support you? Who's here rooting you on? This little pup. - This is a given. Lucy's always with me. - I think Lucy might be the
star of the Olympics, so far. - Oh, yeah, she definitely is. She's an internet sensation. - Shouldn't she do some training? - Yeah, she got some training
for the Bounty commercial. - How's that like? - I mean, she was really the star, but I was in the commercial with Lucy. - Sure. - She's a little overweight right now. - Same, relatable.
- Don't judge. - Lucy, say hey. Oh. (cute pop music) You guys, I am here at the Team USA house, and I don't think I've ever
been more starstruck in my life because look who I found. Soohorang. Oh, my God. Okay, wiggle, yes. My faves, say hello. Hello, hello. Oh, my goodness gracious. God is so good. I just met Soohorang. I'm so happy. I don't know why I'm so obsessed, but I'm literally starstruck. I've hung out with all the Olympians that have won gold medals,
but this is, to me. Soohorang, I'm so giddy. (upbeat electronic music) So, I found a store that
sells everything Soohorang. Look at all the things,
stuffed animals and sweaters, and shirts and mugs, and
everything you could ever want. So I just went into the superstore. I got a whole bunch of
stuff that I cannot wait to take home, even though I
am so not a souvenirs queen. But while I was in there, I was like, I feel like y'all would've
wanted some of the stuff, too. So I got enough stuff for
three little care packages that I'm going to send
to some of you guys. All you have to do is
comment on this video with your favorite thing
about the Olympics, give the video a thumbs up, and all the other details about it are gonna be in the description. But I think that's all
you're gonna have to do. (upbeat electronic music) Good morning. I'm super excited because I'm
about to go watch my babe, Gus Kenworthy, perform, compete, kill it. I just met his mom, who
is the the most lovely. Wait, you guys, look. We're coming up. This is pretty impressive. There's a lot going on. Hello. - (speaks in foreign language) - Hello. I got my ticket to the games. - Hello.
- Hello. - Have a good time. - Thank you. I'm so excited to see Gus. I'm so proud of him. Having known him for a couple years now, he's just the sweetest person, and to see somebody that sweet and kind compete and maybe even
be best in the world warms my little heart. Which is something I need,
'cause it's freezing right now. Look at that hill, girl. He is about to do that. Wait, oh, my God. Look who it is. - Hi, Tyler. - Y'all, look what I found. Not Gus. Gus doesn't matter, but
look at Gus's nails. - You got it. - Just fashion, the best. The most stunning. - Since I've been here, I haven't talked about being gay, really, at all, publicly. So I would do my nails
to let everyone know. - We're all curious why
you haven't mentioned it. How did you do this,
and why did you do this? - I didn't, a little Korean
lady did it for me in Seoul. - Oh, wow. - Well, it's because at
the Russian Olympics-- - Baby, you're chipping.
- I know. - What's going on? - I know.
- Take care of yourself. - It's work. I should've done crystal gel. In Sochi, there was all those
crazy anti-LGBT laws in place, and they were like, everyone
coming to the Sochi games is subject to the same laws
that Russian citizens are, and we don't want any
showing of pride or protest. And I remember, in my head
I was like, oh, my God, well, now I want to
paint my nails rainbow. And I was in the closet at the time, but I was just outraged by it. - So you did. - So then, this games, I
was like, you know what, I'm gonna paint my nails. It's less protest, it's just
kind of pride this time. But it's the first time my
nails have been painted. - It's cute. - Have you had your nails painted? - I've done it before. I'm not good at it. I need somebody who really can give me a whole jejing, if you will. - Well-- - Not well. - I've never done it in my
life, and I have a broken thumb, but I think that I'm more than qualified. - Will you give me a make over? - I would love to. - Oh, my God, Gus. Wait, really, right now? - Yes, bitch.
- Oh, my God. Okay, okay, okay. So I'm here with Gus's mom. Say hello. - Hello. - I wanted to show the
world your beautiful gloves. Can you show them? Now these are-- - This is my mom. - Can we talk about these gloves? - Oh, fashion. - A lovely woman who made a lovely man. - Hi, thanks.
- Hi, thanks. We brought our rainbow flag, obviously, 'cause we are here,
rooting on everybody gay. I love the amount of pride that I feel like I've been
witnessing this Olympics. What has it meant to you to be able to come here and be your full self? - Yeah, I don't know. I feel like in Sochi, I didn't
really get to be myself. And so, I got silver,
and that was amazing, to win a medal for the US. But I feel like I didn't really enjoy it because I wasn't being true to who I am. And so this time around,
just getting to be myself and share myself with the world, it's been a much more
rewarding experience. - Good luck.
- Take care. - Have fun.
- Love you. - Love you. I love Gus, because I feel like it's a friendship that I made, where I didn't really
get to see him shine, and now I'm here, in his realm,
and I get to see him shine. So I didn't even tell
you guys why I'm here. I'm here with Procter &amp; Gamble because they did a campaign
with the Olympics this year to support a whole bunch of the athletes with this campaign called Love Over Bias. And it's all about the power of love, and how much that is more powerful than anything else out there. - Well, P&amp;G approached me,
and I was very excited. As soon as they started telling me what they were trying to
do with Head &amp; Shoulders, I realized that it was
such an obvious fit. They wanted to do a commercial
that featured a pride flag for the the first time
in history, and that-- - It's the first time
an Olympic commercial ever had a pride flag? - Any commercial ever had a pride flag. - What? - Yes, isn't that crazy? - This is 2018.
- I know. Well, I think the Olympics
is all about love. It's about love of the
game, love of the country. People are here representing for everyone that's stood behind them along the way, and there's a lot of love about it. And just 'cause Adam and I are gay doesn't mean that our
love is any less worthy. And I don't think it's this anomaly where now you're seeing gay
athletes for the first time. It's like, no, honey, we've been around, just now we're standing up. So it's not like you're
gonna see less of us, you're gonna see more of us. - Even though it's not at
all about Gus being gay, it's all about his talent, it is still remarkable
to see somebody so queer succeed and be celebrated,
no matter who he is or no matter how he identifies. Especially, in a world
where a lot of people look down or even try to demean people in the LGBT PLUS community. To see somebody be on top of the world and celebrated, really cool feeling. And the fact that I get to
be here with Gus and Adam and celebrate them, and
celebrate what they mean to America, as the first
openly gay US Winter Olympians, it's incredible, and I'm
just so proud of them. (meditative guitar music) Hello, from the closing ceremonies. Tonight is our last night here in Korea, and it's pretty bittersweet. I have had the best time ever,
and we're about to go inside and see all of the farewells
from all the Olympians and all of Korea, saying
thank you and goodbye. It's crazy to be here. It feels so historic. So let's go inside. That is the torch of the
Olympics that they light at the beginning of the ceremonies,
at the opening ceremony, and then, they're gonna put it out tonight after everything is done. So right now, it's the parade of athletes at the closing ceremony, and look at all these beautiful people from all over the world, united together. (electronic dance music) At some point, this turned into a rave. Martin Garrix is performing. All the athletes are right down there, living their dang lives. The flame went out, the ceremony's over. We'll see you at the next Olympics. So I'm back at the airport. It is my last moment in Korea. I'm about to get on my flight. But I just wanted to say this has been such a fun little adventure. I feel like, what a once
in a lifetime opportunity to bring you guys along
for an adventure in Korea. And not just Korea, but
to go to the Olympics, to take y'all along for the
ride, to go to all the events, to meet all the Olympians,
and to be here with P&amp;G. I'm just really grateful
that P&amp;G chose me, because my number one thing is always taking you guys on adventures with me, and they were so great in letting me do everything that I wanted to do. So if you like this video,
give it a thumbs up. Maybe in some time, I can
go to the Summer Olympics. Maybe. Okay, that's all I have
for you guys today. I will see you guys very soon. I love one creature,
and one creature alone. (hip hop music) (thunder bangs) 
- Hi everyone! My name is Tyler Oakley and I'm here today with Kurtis, Miss Fame! - Thank you for having me, I'm so excited to
actually be painting you. - I am beyond excited. I've never done any type of drag before. - Well, it's a good place to start. - With Fame?
- Yeah, of course. - Anything's possible.
- Yes, anything's possible. - Okay, let's get started. (upbeat pop music) - So we're going to take some glue, and we're gonna hide your brows. - I feel like this is the
most like, well-known part. - Yes, I think it's the
most impactful part, because you're eliminating
natural features of the face. So, you've never done drag? - Never in my life! How's my eyebrow look? Ooh! I wanna look like, a messy queen. For the people at home, can
you tell them what drag is? - Drag is just the ability
to kind of showcase the essence of what you feel you are. It's an element of expression, it's amplifying who you can
consider yourself to be. - What's the worst drag
name you've ever heard. - No.
(laughing) I can't, because those
people still are alive. - What are some of your
favorites you've heard? - I really like, Misty
Weiners, Hedda Lettuce... - So my brows are laid. (gasps and laughs) - [Kurtis] You're going to
look down towards the ground, we're going to tape this,
they eyebrow will go up here. - I can't see that far. - Looking down. - [Tyler] Do you remember the
first drag queen you ever saw? - Probably when I was
living in San Luis Obispo, where I grew up, Ethalina Caine... - Ethalina Caine! - Ethalina Caine, she
used to come to the bar and I was always intrigued but
frightened of drag queens... - Well yeah, drag queens are intimidating! - And she had used her
own chest, breast tissue, to create actual looking breasts with a good cutlet inside, so
I saw boobs, and I was like... - I don't even think I can
close my eye right now. - [Kurtis] That's the goal.
- Oh really? Oh.
- [Kurtis] Isn't that weird? - Yeah. How did you get your name? - I originally was Fame Fatale, and then Brittney had album out, and I just pulled the Fatale
and I said, Miss Fame. Come on, eyelids glued shut. - That's my aesthetic.
- [Kurtis] Yes. There ya go. This is beating the face, I'm going to be very
delicate on the nose-- - I'm noticing that! The eyes. - [Kurtis] Wow, she's contoured. - Is it a natural look? - [Kurtis] Compared to most
drag, this is no makeup. - [Tyler] How long does
it take you to get ready? - [Kurtis] Three, four hours. - [Tyler] Holy macaroni. - [Kurtis] Which is a
little bit crazy-sounding, but it's standard for a lot of the queens that are out there. - [Tyler] What's the most annoying thing you have to do?
- Just time. - Shaving, and then getting out of it, you're like, it feels great
but God it just takes, even that's time-consuming. - Why do you think drag is
important to the kids nowadays, why should it be? - [Kurtis] I feel
powerful when I'm in drag, and I feel like people really see me, and for a lot of us in our community, especially in LGBT, we need to feel seen, we need to feel like we are worth that. - How long do you want to do drag? - As long as I can carry it well. I don't want to do it and
feel crunchy and dusty. - You're clearly an artist,
you're clearly creative. Why drag? - [Kurtis] It's the
medium that grabbed me. I was trying to be a model as a boy, I went to New York at 26. I wasn't getting paid
beaucoup bucks to be Kurtis, you know, but when I got
painted as Miss Fame, the room was like, gravitating towards me, everybody was like, God you look great, you should do that, and then bookings started happening.
- It just made sense. - The universe wanted me to be Miss Fame. - People in my family think drag queens are people that are trans, or people, like you have to be gay-- - For me, drag is definitely,
it's a costume for many, it's a way to be like,
I'm embellishing myself, to put on a show and entertain you. - Sure, there can be
transgender drag queens, being in drag does not
dictate your gender, your sexuality... - I don't use it as a seductive
ply to get what I want, as much as I'm using it as a vessel to kind of inspire others. - [Kurtis] It's a lot to work,
to getting lips overdrawn, because if you don't if
you don't have a framework, you've got to create it. - She doesn't have the framework. - [Kurtis] Framework makes the dream work. - It does feel like you're
up to my nose, painting. If there's like a little
gay out there in the world, that's like, "I want to do that," what's your number one tip? - Do your research, we have the internet, you have no excuses to do
bad drag at this point. I'm putting a mole on, it's on this side. - (gasps) A mole? (laughs) Oh my! (laughs) - [Kurtis] It's almost so tight that like, I could give you a break, come on. - So we just put on the
corset, the bra, the fake tits. - Yes. - I do feel like, businesswoman
meets Born This Way, meets ruffles. We had to lube my arms and shoulders up, it's all natural! (laughs) - We are just going to do a
little martini glass contour-- - A little dab'll do ya. - [Kurtis] A little dab'll do you, hmm-mm. - I have always said my drag name would be Primatur Fetusse, my
friends call me Preemie. I'm giving you Paul Blart-- - [Kurtis] Publina Blart! - Publina Blart! - [Kurtis] Oooh! And then, forehead in, she's ready, she's so ready for this. Okay now, release your
hands, and lift your chin. I'm ready for my girl! - [Tyler] Is she ready? - She's so ready! I can't wait to see her! Oh, isn't she lovely? - I feel, I don't think I've
ever felt prettier, honestly, I feel like, incredible! (laughs) - I love my drag daughters. Publina Bart! - It is not Publina Blart! You know what, maybe if
you have a name for me, like leave it in the comments below, what should my drag name be? - And I am so impressed with the way you're carrying the look,
I know how hard it is to wear latex and corsets. - This corset is, I will
say, a little bit compacted. - Yeah, as a superfan of
drag and drag culture, this is beyond an honor to
even be hanging out with you, let alone to like spend
a few hours to chat about why drag is important,
that was like, thank you. If you liked this video, what can they do? - They can follow, like and subscribe! - Yes, oh, yes honey! - Yeah, they just click on those buttons that you place in places
you want them to see. - Right there.
- Yeah, uh-huh. - And, if you want to get
the T-shirt for this week, it's right there. All the information about
the charity it goes toward, is in the description below, it's a good cause! Get yourself a new shirt. Okay, thank you so much for watching, this was the most fun,
we'll see you guys soon. - Love you so much.
- Bye friends! - Bye.
- Mwah! 
- Hey everyone, my names is Tyler Oakley, and welcome to Tyler Oakley Show. Today we have a very special guest, Democratic candidate for Vice President, Senator Tim Kaine everybody. - Hey Tyler. (cheering) - How are you? - I'm great, I'm great. So excited to be here. - I think you, you might
be my first senator. (ding) - Hey. - Everyone that I've met,
that knows you or has met you, says that you are the nicest, and I can confirm so far, pretty nice. But you also have a little
nickname on the internet, America's step-dad? - Yeah. - What's your response to that? - Well I didn't even know
dad jokes were a thing. - Great, that is the
most dad thing of all. - Look in politics it can be pretty tough, so if that the worst
they can say about me? - [Tyler] That's not so bad. - That's affectionate so I like it. - Right. There are some people that are at home, they know that they're not here for Trump. - Yeah. - But they're still kind
of unsure about Hillary. - Yeah. - And I know some of them
were Bernie supporters. If you could talk to them right now. - Yeah. - What would you say to them? - Do you believe in climate
science or don't you? Do you believe in LGBT
equality or don't you? Do you believe in immigration reform? Do you believe that we
ought to make voting easier, not harder? Do you think women should be able to make their own
healthcare choices or not? Hillary and I do, Donald Trump doesn't. Those are five issues where
people have their opinions. - Bam, bam. - Hillary and I are with ya. - Well I think one way we
could kind of get onboard with maybe the millennial generation is to speak their language. (trumpeting) Do you know what on fleek means? - On fleek? - On fleek. - I have no idea what on fleek means. - You know I actually don't know if I know the real definition. I think it's like on point. - Oh, okay. - Like this campaign is on fleek. - You could say on fleek? Okay, yeah. - Do you know what a bae is? - B, A, E, bae. - I think it stands for
like before anyone else. So you would call your
girlfriend or your boyfriend, or your partner your bae. - Yeah. Your first among firsts. - Whose your bae? - My wife Ann of 32 years. - Beautiful. Must be nice. Do you know what this word is? - Yas. - Ahhh. Yeah, and do you know what it means? - Ah, no. - Yes you do. It just means yeah. - Yeah it means yes. - But like if you're like yas. - Like super yeah, okay. - Yeah. - Now did I get the pronunciation? I mean is is yas? - That was actually perfect in every way. - Do you know what squad goals are? - Squad would be like whose your crew? - Yeah. - Relationship goals is, you
see somebody's relationship and it's kinda cool, you say relationship, I wanna be like that so I wanna be like somebody's squad or I wish I
had a squad like that person. - Yes, you are like. I
would day yas to that. - Yeah. - So this would be squad goals. - [Tim] Oh yeah, now that is a shot. - [Tyler] This is squad goals. - And Dave Matthews was there with us. That pretty cool. - That is squad goals right there. - Now that's on fleek. (ding) - Do you know what a TBT is? Oh, that was good. - Throw back Thursday. - Yeah, I've seen you
post them on Instagram. - Yeah. - [Tyler] This is a good
throw back Thursday. - [Tim] That was me at 21. - [Tyler] Look at you. Just living the life. Do you know what bye Felicia means? I would just say you
could say this to Trump. It's just kinda like yeah. - Oh is that right? So it's kinda like it's over? - Right, yeah, yeah. - Hey, bye Felicia. - That's perfect. Well we are less than two
months away from the election. I wanna encourage
everyone that's watching, please get involved. - If you wanna vote, and
you're not sure about voting, go to Iwillvote.com. You don't have to be a registered voter to make a phone call
and persuade somebody. - Speaking of which. (telephone ringing) It's my mom. (ding) - Ha. Where does she live? - Michigan. - Hey mom, what's up? I was just hanging out
with a very special someone who wanted to give you a call and remind you to so something, so. - So you're not my mom so I

- Hey everyone! my name is Tyler Oakley, and I don't know if
you know this about me, but I am such an athlete and such a jock and I love sports, and
touchdowns, and football, and flags on the play (laughs) and other things. I wanted to wear like a football jersey but I don't have one so the only thing I have is a basketball jersey. Anyway, this weekend is the Super Bowl which means, for people
like us, the halftime show! Which I'm very excited for. So today, I decided to take
a trip down memory lane and see all the things that have happened in the halftime in the years past. This year is the 52nd Super Bowl, so there are a lot of
halftime performances that we can go dive into. I have no clue what I'm about to react to. I'm excited to experience this with you. Hopefully I don't hate these people. Okie dokie, let's go. I have no clue what I'm about to see. Oh, this is Beyonce. Living legend. ‚ô™ Baby, it's you ‚ô™ Oh, I literally just got chills. I have to say, that silhouette, when they showed that,
I'm like, the fact that I know Beyonce from just
that silhouette says it all. Oh my God, look at her hop. I'm just wondering,
thank God, do people know the gravity of being alive
at the same time as Beyonce? Like, what a miracle, alive. Kelly and Michelle, popping
out of nowhere, I love it. You know what, I'm happy that they're here though where are the other
Destiny's Child girls? This is truly iconic,
she has so many bops. Oh, this is old and blurry, that's M.J. These graphics! And you know what, back in the day, they were probably like, oh my God, there he is, oh, that's very Lady Gaga or is Lady Gaga very Michael Jackson? Now, I think what happens from M.J. is he just stands there for like a solid three minutes and people just clap. If this is the same
performance, like that, that's how you know you are a legend, you are an icon, you are
a universal performer. I think this is the moment. This bitch, I love it, he
literally just stands there and everyone just screams and
applauds for three minutes. Here's the thing about this fucking shit where everyone in the audience has to turn around something
and it makes an image. I hate that shit. I get it, like it's beautiful and like, this we are the world moment, yeah, cute, I guess, the
children are the future. The real victory here is the fashion. Everyone is really sporting something. Enrique, and Xtina? This is very early 2000's, this is so, what's going on here with these drums? Oh! Was the halftime just a Disney show? 'Cause this is some Tarzan shit. That's Phil Collins, I think. What in tarnation? There's a lot going on. Who's this (gasps)
Black Eyed Peas, Fergie, Queen Fergie, thank god
Fergie had a halftime moment. This bitch, she better, I love this shit. Okay, something about, who's
that man with the guitar? Slash, perhaps. I'm not ready for Usher. Is Usher part of this Fergie situation? Oh, it appears so. Oh bitch, not a bit, I like this. Oh, this, see, like they made bops. - Are you ready to roar?
- You're kidding me. If we're gonna talk about bops, I have to give respect
where respect is due because when Katy Perry
was gonna do the Super Bowl I thought, is she a legend yet? And then she fucking performed hit after hit after hit after hit. Lenny Kravitz, we love, yes
ma'am Pam he can get it. And this was the birth of Left Shark! A true legendary moment
in pop culture history. I was happy with the
Katy Perry performance. I was like, I was skeptical at first and then she delivered, she had the hits, she did the performances,
she really laid it out there, and then Missy Eliot, yes. This moment, this like star shooting, the more you know moment (sighs) sometimes things are better on paper. Me, flying home from the gay bar, two a.m. Ooh, Prince, RIP. This is Purple Rain. Is it raining, oh that's,
wow, did they plan that? Was that God? He knew what to do, that bitch God. Who the fuck is that?
‚ô™ Baby you can drive my car ‚ô™ Oh, what's his name? Paul McCartney. Some performances are not for me. I'm sure it's great. ‚ô™Hey Jude ‚ô™
- Okay. ‚ô™ Don't make it bad ‚ô™
- Okay, you got that. ‚ô™ Nananana ‚ô™
- Not the na in the audience. No, bitch, if I were in that audience I would, no, I'd be sitting. No, no, not him doing this. Yeah, cute.
‚ô™ Hey Jude ‚ô™ But, Beyonce. Seems like an old ass band. That's that dude that people
say Harry Styles looks like. What's his name? Mick Jagger, yes, the good sis Mick. Now this, I loved. I love Bruno Mars, I am ready
for his Vegas performance. I am gonna go, bitch, I'm
going to see his residency. I was in the audience,
maybe you'll see me. Now this is a true new
reigning prince of pop. He can sing, he can
dance, he's got the songs. I was happy with this. I mean people were skeptical about him but I was like all on board. What in tarnation is, oh, Red Hot Chili Peppers, perhaps, I think? Too bad he didn't do it nowadays 'cause CardiB could have came out they could have done a Finesse moment. That would have been cute. Is this U2, or Green Day, or a men band? This is U2, he's got those glasses. Can you imagine wearing those glasses and that being your brand? (sighs) Can you imagine wearing these glasses and having it be your brand? I see you, U2. Remember when he forced all of us to have his damn album on
our iPads, or our iPods? You might be too young. Oh, here's Madonna. I'm open-minded. Oh, there's LMFAO I'm close-minded. I hope I'm not wearing
my emotions on my face. Yes, bitch, Nicki! And M.I.A.? Is that Cee-Lo? (laughs) Oh thank you, world peace. She did that. Can you believe she accomplished world peace, what a legend. Cold Play. Again, I understand people love them. Doesn't somebody come out for a second? Beyonce, I think. Oh, and Bruno Mars is here. Beyonce, I think is right here, yes bitch! In this like, Michael Jackson look, it's an homage moment. Yes, hon. I guess, oh yes bitch, oh! See, here's what happened, they had Coldplay out
there and they were like, ooh but we need something for the gays, and then out of nowhere, bitch. Doesn't she almost fall soon, I think? Ooh, right there, oh but a recovery. Oh, great, believe in love. Thank you. Wait, did *NSYNC headline the Super Bowl? Because that is iconic, especially if they did it
and Backstreet Boys didn't. I wonder if Justin is
one of the only people that have done the
halftime more than once. Yes Britney! Britney's due for another halftime moment. Oh Justin's jacket, honey. (gasps) This is the performance. Janet is about to have some
type of moment with Justin, and let me, we just need to talk. The world was against Janet, when it was Justin's fucking fault. This is the moment, she
was wearing that, yes. Justin's about to pull
that something off her tit. I swear to God, if Justin doesn't bring Janet out during his
Super Bowl performance, that would be wrong. That, that was not an accident! And then they were all like, oops, my bad, blah blah blah, and they
got in so much trouble. Janet was the one that
had to bear the brunt of all that backlash and I
am still not here for it. ‚ô™ God Bless America ‚ô™ This is, you know how many
times I've watched this? This has one of my favorite moments. One of my favorite Lady Gaga moments. She goes, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty,
and justice, for all. (laughs) It's just like So iconic, whenever she goes For all I say that all the time. And then she's wiggling down, yes. It is what champions are about. She knew. I was more nervous for
her performance of this than I am for when I have
to perform in some capacity, or if I have to be on a stage. I just didn't want her to fuck up. As a super fan, it was
a lot of stress for me, and then as soon as, and then the end, when she had to catch the, you'll see. Oh, here she goes. She's about to go catch that football. How stressful. After all that perfectly, imagine not catching
the ball, what a relief. Well that was fun. Thank you so much for watching this video! If you liked it as much as I did, give it a thumbs up and let me know, who is the best Super Bowl
performance of all time? Is it Lady Gaga? Is it Beyonce? Is it gonna be Justin Timberlake? Let me know in the comments. I cannot wait to see your opinions. That's all I have for you guys today, if you're not subscribed, be sure to push the subscribe button, and you can push the little bell thing and you'll get notified
when I make a video. How sweet of you to do that! You should do that right now, push it. Okay, that's all. Love you guys, later. 
- Hey everyone, it's Tyler,
and look who I'm with. - It's Hillary. - Oh my God. (laughter) First of all, you are incredible. You were so good today. I just watched her speak, and I was like, moved to tears, literally. - Oh my God, Tyler. - So I'm kind of a, - Thank you. - Of course. - I'm so happy to be here with you. - Oh my God. - And talking to everybody who watches. - Yeah. You know, the election's tomorrow. There's some people that
are still undecided. - Well, please, you do not want to wake up the day after this election
and really feel bad. - Right. - Because everything you care about, and we could go down a long list, but everything you care about
is at stake in this election. - Women's rights, LGBTQ+
rights, immigration. - Gun violence. - Gun violence. - Climate change. - If those things are important to you, then you have to get out and vote. And there's some people that are watching that might be underage, or
might maybe live abroad, and they still want to get involved. - Well, there's lots of things you can do. - Okay. - You can talk to everybody
who is eligible to vote, and say hey, you know what, every election's about the future, which means it's really about your future. - Totally. - And you've got to get everyone you know to understand that. Maybe you can volunteer,
take people to the polls. - Mmhm. - Go in and make phone calls
to get everybody out to vote. So, there's something to do, because gosh, the stakes are so high. - The stakes are high,
and every vote counts. I think some people think oh,
Hillary's got it in the bag. - No, please don't think that. (laughter) Because I've seen too many elections where people who supported candidates say oh she doesn't, or he
doesn't need my vote, so they're gonna win. And then they don't. - Right. - And that's why I don't want you to, - And then November Ninth, you'll wake up, and you're like why
did I not get involved? - See, Tyler and I want you to have a really good November Ninth. - I am so excited. - What this is all about. - Right. Also, it's not just
voting for a president. - There are people running for governor, people running for the senate, people running for the congress, and I need people I can work with. I don't need people who
say no to everything. - Right. - They're such downers, and
they don't want to do anything, (laughter) they don't want to make
college affordable, they don't want to help you
pay back your student debt. They don't want more new jobs. I need people who want to get to work, roll up your sleeves, and actually let's make our country even greater. - We are stronger
together, and if you think that your one vote doesn't count, imagine if everyone thought
their one vote didn't count. Together, we can make a huge change. - Well that, you are 100 percent right. - Stop. (laughter) - And boy, did you say that well, because we are stronger together. - Right. - And then the other thing this election is going to prove is love trumps hate. - Yes. - Don't forget. Thanks everybody. - Remember, go vote
tomorrow, tomorrow's the day, and tell everyone you know. - Please. - Okay. Bye friends. 
(soft acoustic music) - [Tyler] It ain't easy being
LGBTQ+ in the United States. Trans people can't use the restrooms they identify with in public. Queer kids aren't
protected in their schools from discrimination. And in many states, you can be fired just because of how you identify. But in some places around the world, even existing is punishable
by jail, torture, or death. Our chosen family extends beyond borders and I wanted to share the
stories of inspiring people in our community from around the world. I met Shadi and his
fiance Ian at their home in Boise, Idaho. Shadi left his entire life in Syria after his father caught
him with another man and threatened to kill him. First, introduce yourself. - Hi. (Tyler laughing) - Who are you? Where are you from? - My name is Shadi Hassansmail,
originally from Syria. The process for refugees is not easy. People think oh I'm coming to America. Yeah, tomorrow you fly. - [Tyler] But it takes years. - Years and you're not legal working. You can't work because you're a refugee. - [Tyler] Let's go back then. So when did you come out? - I think I always inside me confusing if I'm gay or straight. For us we don't have something called gay. Gay you die. It's very simple. It's called death. You know like it's like
religion don't accept it. Culture don't accept it. - So this is something that has been just the way it's been for ever. And even today, if you were
to come out in Syria... - The government law protect you because they don't have thing
to kill you because being gay. But they will cover it. - They'll look the other way. - [Tyler] When your family found out, - Oh boy. - [Tyler] Talk to me about that. - Well, first time my dad
saw me, it was not funny. - Set the scene then. So you're 16 years old... - Yes. - [Tyler] You're hanging
out with your friend. - Friends and we you know
friends experience stuff. - Sure. - And my dad caught me. He like walked in on us
and take me downstairs and my brother was there. They took me to the store we have and made a big show out
of me with the stick. Break on my hand and then he
take like a what's it called? You remember I explained it to you before. - Oh like a metal rod. - And he started beating me with it and he asked me brother
to give him the scissors. My brother was working and my other brother was smoking hookah. Give it to him and hold me. And my dad cut my hair
like this from here. And sorry. (soft music) Sorry. - [Tyler] Don't be sorry. You're good. - And then my dad take the charcoal and burnt my hand. This was my first time. Yeah and he promised if I do this again, I will be killed. Being in my position and
I hope you never been. I hope you never be in
my position like that. Now if I write to them and I know my dad he
promised he would kill me and I know when he promised, he will because I know my dad. - [Tyler] Right. - I know my dad. And then I just run. I really just run. (soft music) - [Tyler] Before you came to America, all these times, whether it was in Syria
or Jordan or wherever, was there always that feeling? - Yeah, always. Always feeling not safe. I will be killed somehow. Always feeling I am looking around. Like you know if anybody
I know will know me. - And like that's so hard
to wrap my head around because usually the fear
is people you don't know. (soft acoustic music) What did coming to America mean to you? - Everything. - Yeah. - Like really everything. I want to put it this way. I belong somewhere finally. Be who I am without faking anything. - So with everything that's
going on politically, with Trump and sentiments toward refugees or travel bans, what
does it feel like for you as a refugee from Syria? - First of all I am proud being here. This is first thing. Two I'm scared at the same time because well after Trump take over, it's scary for any refugees. Like now all refugees I think are trying to get their citizenship
published because they don't know if tomorrow will knock
on our door to leave. - [Tyler] What does it
mean to you to be American? - Everything. Being American, being who I am,
being proud, care in my name like yes I am American and yes I am gay. It's my country, you know. Showed me a lot of love here like they really don't
care what you go sleep with like with who you sleep. - There's no judgment. - No judgment. They care how you treat me. - Here's what I wonder. What do you miss about Syria? - Well a lot of stuff. First I miss speaking Arabic where I think because in English hard for me still. I translate sometimes. Other than that I
remember when I was child before my family find out I'm gay, I was a happy kid. Like I lived a good life but when they find out I'm gay, everything changed. So I miss that. (soft acoustic music) - [Tyler] I loved meeting Shadi and Ian. Their love was so present and so pure and you could tell that
Shadi was more patriotic than most Americans I've ever met. They're freedom to love was
never taken for granted. And living their quiet life in
Boise meant the world to him. (soft music) After meeting Shadi, I wanted
to hear another perspective on queer life as a refugee. I met Sharifa in her home
in Baltimore, Maryland. Sharifa fled Uganda fearing
for her two daughters lives after numerous threats
of kidnapping and murder. Tell me who you are and tell me about you. - I was born in Uganda
in a village called, in the Mukono district
so I'm a mother of two and they mean a lot to me. Even if I have a big big
family back home in Uganda, but when I'm talking
about who the real me, it is my daughters. - I love that. How old are they? - One is 17 and another
one will be seven soon. - Oh my goodness. When did you come out? - Actually I already knew
as long as I can remember. - Same. - I always knew that I was gay. - Tell me about Uganda. - I love Uganda as a country and I love Uganda as my motherland. Sometimes I feel like
Uganda is the worst country to live as a gay person and if one day comes that
accept me the way I am, I can go back. - [Tyler] What is it like for
somebody who is gay there? - I'll be honest. Being gay in Africa or in
Uganda is the worst thing. So in 2013, the act was
put like was tabled, it was going to be really tough that if they get homosexuals,
it was life imprisonment, death penalty. When they tabled that
bill, we all said no. We know Ugandan views. We know stuff like that. They don't last. So in 2014, the bill was passed into laws and the president signed the bill. We were like we are now dead. (soft music) So before we had been
getting threatening messages because I'm a parent and they said if a homosexual bring up kids, those kids will grow up knowing
that homosexuality is good. Since they were threatening
to kidnap the kids. - Your kids? - Yes, to kill us and stuff
so we had to run to Kenya. - [Tyler] So you thought,
we're just going to chill here. - [Sharifa] Yes. - [Tyler] And then eventually go back. - Mmhmm. - [Tyler] Once everything settled down. - Yes. We didn't go with anything. I carried just a backpack. And we went. - [Tyler] What were your thoughts before you came to America about America. - I didn't even have time
to think about America. The only thing that I was thinking about was to go to the safety. To take the kids to the safety. Go away from Uganda, from Kenya. Because Uganda, Kenya,
Tanzania, it's the same. Regarding homosexuality. LGBT people in Africa, they are not safe. They are moving in fear. They have been beaten. They have been raped. Boys, girls, transgender. And it's really hard. (soft music) - [Tyler] Tell me about your daughter and how she feels about
you being a lesbian. - I remember when I
came out to my daughter, it was really tough. - It's so silly because usually
it's the other way around. - Yes. - Where a kid is like so
afraid to tell their mom. - Yes, so I had to tell
her slowly by slowly. I remember I mentioned the Ellen. I told her do you remember
the show I like on TV and she said yes. Because I knew the moment I
mentioned a powerful person that she knew on TV, at least she would know
that they're out there. They're someone powerful
who is like my mother. - It just like proves how
important representation is in media, in seeing
character's in TV shows, or in movies. It's vital. It's life-saving. It's life-affirming. - And then she said,
yeah mommy, I don't care. As long as you are happy,
I am happy for you. So I gave her a hug and
I was so so relived. - [Tyler] I love it. So now that you're here, what
does America represent to you? - I think America is a
peaceful country as a country. People are looking more about the colors and not loving each other and stuff so I think America can
do better than that. If we can do, we can think,
we can sleep all of us and think that we are one person. Like we are one person without looking at you are wearing green, black, red, yellow, so I think if America does that, it will be the best country in the world. (uplifting music) - [Tyler] Sharifa and
Shadi's stories remind me of just how much work
there is left to be done around the world. But also here in America. While they are ostracized
in their home countries for being LGBTQ+, they are also threatened by the leaders of our country
who villainize refugees. These people aren't here to
steal jobs or to cause trouble. They just want to go to bed at night without worrying about their
kids getting kidnapped. They just want to feel like someday they can fall in love
without having to hide it. They want the same things that we want. Shadi and Sharifa
exemplify queer resilience. And I am so proud to now call them members of my chosen family. Thank you so much for watching this video. If you liked it, be sure
to give it a thumbs up. I had such an incredible
time hearing the stories from Shadi and Sharifa. It was an absolute honor to get involved for World Refugee Day. I want to use my platform to shine a light on people that are misrepresented or often not represented at all. So if you want to get involved
for World Refugee Day, you can do a couple things. You can celebrate by being open and loving and honest toward all people
on social media, in person. You can share this video on
your Facebook, on your Twitter. You can get one of these shirts. They are helping benefit the IRC which is helping people
like Shadi and Sharifa find safety and homes
all around the world. Okay so that is all I
have for you guys today. I have another video
coming later this week that I am so excited for you to see. It is featuring a bunch
of my YouTuber friends. And I think you're going to love it so until then, have a good life. I'll see you guys soon. 
- Hi everyone! My name is Tyler Oakley,
and since the holidays are coming up and the
holidays are all about spending time with each other, I figured what better way to spend
time with all my friends than maybe doing something
good in our little community. So this morning we are all at L.A. Kitchen preparing some food for the
people that might need it in our home of LA. I figured if we're all
gonna be hangin' out, we might as well be
hangin' out, catching up, and doing some good. (upbeat music) - So what you'll be doing
today is part of our Impact program where we
work with local farms and supermarkets and they donate product that they can't sell, either
because it's a little bit blemished, so they donate it
to us for us to transform it into healthy meals that we then distribute to different senior centers, needle exchange programs,
homeless shelters. - So today we're gonna
be dicing and cutting some red bell peppers in half. I'm gonna use them two different ways. We figure that even if
you're getting that meal that's being handed out to you, it still should be delicious as well as healthy. - The claw, the claw.
- Oh my! - She's leaking. - I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. (upbeat music) - [Tyler] How's it goin', Alex? - I'm still on my first pepper! Don't look at me! Look away, look away. I'm not doing good right now. I think I'm doing it wrong 'cause my forearms are getting sore. - Look at those muscley forearms.
- I don't think that's supposed to happen. - Oohwee!
- Oh yeah, oh yeah! Oh, it's a good one right here. It's a good one. - Will you show me how you can tell when a pepper is good? - The firmness. Here, squeeze this one but very gently. Now listen to it. (laughs) (upbeat music) - Ladies and gentleman,
please welcome to the stage. Diced Darling, no Miss Bella Pepper. - So it's called L.A. Kitchen
but what I really like is that you talked about
how we're all in LA and we're all neighbors for each other, and so the program is
helping people who maybe have had something bad happen
to them in their past or who weren't born with a
lot of resources or privilege and it's about neighbors
giving back to one another. - Someone might look at
this dang pepper and say, ooh look at that, I don't wanna eat it, but look at the rest of the pepper. There's still so much left to use, and they talk about how that is the same way
with people in society. That you might look at somebody and think, wow, that person has a past
that I don't really wanna trust or be around, but that
person has so much potential or maybe wants to do good with their life, and they're not defined by their past or not defined by the blemish that you might see in them. - Chef Joey at your service. - Does she have a technique? - Yes, I was being taught
to grab it from here. - Ooh. - And cut forward. - Ooh. - Oh yes, it's a forward
motion, and she reminded me to breathe, 'cause I wasn't breathing. I only passed out on the knife. (laughing) - Chop it, chop it.
- Split in half. - And if you don't have the
time to come and volunteer one morning, you can also
help by just donating. Whether it's something in your cabinet, or you can call ahead of
time and see what they need. There are ways to help
even if you don't have hours and hours to give. And the foods that you
donate actually makes a huge difference and goes to
help people in your community. - It's very important
and helpful to donate because companies like us,
we wouldn't be able to do what we do without the help
of the public and companies. So their donations help us
feed a lot of people every week and it would be impossible
for us to do it without. - I feel like a lot of
homes just have stuff that they don't eat, or it's
just sitting in the pantry. Even though it's still good,
nobody even touches it. And it's like, if that could
come to a place like this, and feed people, that could
make a huge difference. (upbeat music) Okay, so we're wrapping up here. I had so much fun with my friends, and we actually did a little bit of good, which is like, a cool thing. And I know sometimes it feels intimidating to try a new thing or to
come to a place like this, but it was so easy and so welcoming and I learned everything I
needed to learn within the time that I was here, and I
was able to feel like I did something in my community, and I would want you
to feel the same thing. So in the description, I'm putting a whole bunch of resources
on how to figure out how to volunteer in your community and if you guys do, let me know. Tweet me pictures, and send
me updates of how you are maybe doing a difference
with your friends and family in your community. Thank you so much to L.A.
Kitchen for having us and hosting us and teaching
us a little bit about how to give back. If you wanna learn more
about them, I'll put them in the description. I hope you guys have a
really great holiday season, and enjoy the time with
your friends and family and if you need something
to do, why not volunteer? Cinch for the call. Volunteering, it's a cinch. (laughing)
Bye!

pretty important work. - This really awesome
organization called I Am That Girl contacted me. It's for women, by women. It just kind of teaches
girls to be who they are rather than being who they're
expected to be, you know. - I feel like there's
plenty of people out there that maybe feel alone in
their own communities, so having something like
that really opens the door to conversations that they might need, the resources that they might need. - Go to IAmThatGirl.com. - Well thank you so much for joining us. - Thank you. - This was so much fun. - Thank you so much. - Bam (clap).

- My meet and greet. Look at all of my fans. Good morning! It's day one of VidCon Amsterdam. I just hit my head, and I'm so excited. Though the jet lag is happening, I will make it through. It's going to be a lot of fun. I'm so excited to see you guys. I guess I need to like
get my life together. I need to wake up. I need to get ready. And I need to go to VidCon. They're beautiful. My Boomerang. So my very first thing of the day is the Power of Community Panel, and it was going to be me,
and Grace, and John Green. But Grace has food poisoning, and apparently she got it from
whatever I ate last night, so anything could happen on the Panel. Let's go! Hello! My name is Tyler Oakley, and ... (crowd cheers) I've had my fair share of internet drama. Why do you look at me like that? (laughter) Am I allowed to swear John? Okay. (laughter) We did it. So we just finished the Community Panel, and it was so much fun. I think we had a good conversation. John was so insightful. Katie asked amazing questions. Grace had food poisoning. It was a success all around. So I just got my aura read, and at first I was like,
"What are we doing?" It's a project called Radiant Human, and they're redefining what
it means to take a selfie. They take a picture of your aura instead of like who you are
to the rest of the world. And this is my picture. (giggles) So I'm about to do a Q&amp;A out on stage. My manager's out there, Lisa. - Oh hello. - She's going to interrogate me. (crowd cheers) - Hi! Hello everybody. Say hi to my vlog. (crowd cheers) I have had so many sweets. Everybody's giving me those
caramel waffle moments. I feel disgusting. - If you could name your own country, what would you name it? - Something gay. Something real gay. (laughter) Biggest pinch moment. VidCon Amsterdam. Never in my life. So we just finished the Q&amp;A. I had so much fun. I love doing things like that where I actually get to talk to y'all. And I'm so excited because that was like a little bitty preview of everyone I got to see at VidCon that I'm going to meet
tomorrow at my meet and greet. My favorite thing about Amsterdam is you get shoved into
cars at other conventions. Here they put you in a boat and they just send you off into the sea. So we're heading to my meet and greet, and I feel like it's the first time I get to actually hug
my Amsterdam friends. My Amster-fam. - I'm Marleen and I'm from
Groningen in the Netherlands. He gave me the strength to come out, and I just couldn't thank
him enough for that. Netherlands is such a small country and I never expected him
in the world to come here. - I've stalked her on Instagram. - Tyler's one of my favorite YouTubers, and I really love him, so I
really wanted to draw him. I'm just so happy that he saw it. - I'm obsessed with her. Thank you so much. - I'm Mace and I'm from here, Amsterdam. He makes everyone feel
special about themselves, and he doesn't exclude anyone. Reassured me like I just have to be me. He makes me feel special
in a way no one else does. - My day's been great
because I just met Tyler, and he's been one of
my greatest inspiratons and my idol for the past three years. I'm pumped that he actually
came to VidCon here, not knowing what it would be like, not knowing what to expect, but doing it for his European fans means a lot to me. - Bye fans. So we just finished my meet and greet, and everyone was so nice. I love Amsterdam so much. Well VidCon, it's been real. So we just finished VidCon. It was so much fun. Thank you Amsterdam for having us. I had a blast. Everyone was so sweet. I hope you liked the video. If you did be sure to give it a thumbs up, and let me know which country

I hope you have a good life. Okay, bye. I stole a piece of bread. I put the bread in the box. What is there to say? A delicious meal, wonderful friends, and some bread to go.

Say hello to my friend, Tyler Oakley.   I've loved you since the day I know you-   -Stop it! (laughs)   You have a great energy, and everyone thinks that,   everyone you know.   Your joy is just contagious.   Continue! (laughs)   Yes   Well, that's why I wanted to make a program with you,   because you now have your own show for something like 9 years old, right?

It has been a crazy adventure.   It is amazing! (audience applauds)   So, tell what you are going to do.   You get celebrities as guests.   You've had Kerry Washington and Celine Dion,   with whomever you kissed.   -O my God, do not exaggerate.   So, yes, I'm going to hang around   with people I never dreamed of   that I would meet them   and then I make clips with them,   where I interview them, play games with them ...   Like you said, I did a piece with Celine Dion   and she insisted that we kiss.   So, right from the start, go for it!   -It was something from your 3rd guest.   Well, let's see a bit   of what is about to happen, it starts today.   - OK   I'm here with the only real Celine Dion!   Kerry Washington!   Carrie Underwood, everyone!   I am so pleased that I met you now!   Ssst, do not say that!   Oh my God.   - It is genetically so dirty.   It's like an ice cream!   -It is awesome!   (shouting)   (music)   (audience cheers)   -I mean...   -I mean, it's just what you feel like.   I say so, do what you want to do   because I am a fan of it   and I'm so glad that I'm working with you now,   you can start the first episode of   "the Tyler Oakley Show" on Ellentube from today.   -People!!!

funniest people I know. And that I appreciate you. - [Hannah] I am crying! - No! - [Hannah] That's so nice, this is like the only serious conversation I think we've ever had, it made my day! - Oh my God, well you make my life, so thank you for being a

- Hi everyone, my name
is Tyler Oakley and today I'm so excited to tell you
about a little trip I went on, that was so fun and it was a
place I had never been before. I had some much incredible
food, I met so many nice people, and it was like, breathtaking
because it was so, ancient. I was in Tel Aviv, and
I went to Jerusalem, and I am so excited to
show you what happened. P.S. if you like it when
I take you along on little vacation give this video a
thumbs up and let me know in the comments where I should go to next. I'm always looking for new places to go. Enjoy. Good morning! It's our first day in Tel
Aviv and I am so excited. But, I'm a little exhausted. I am half jet lagged,
half feeling bonkers, but I am not going to
waste a day in Tel Aviv. So, we got a tour guide for today, we're going to go see Tel Aviv
and see all around the city. And then, tomorrow, we are
going to check out Jerusalem. (upbeat music) So we just got to Jaffa,
it is so pretty here, every single spot looks
like a perfect spot for a photo shoot. This is all Tel Aviv, but
this is a little neighborhood called Jaffa and I'm so
excited to explore it. Lisa's no longer with us. (Lisa laughing) Come back to me! ‚ô´ On your worst day,
you're still beautiful. ‚ô´ So goddam beautiful. ‚ô´ Everything - So we're here in the Carmel Market, trying new things. We've just got this Druze
Pita, it is so good. I'm just eating everything I see. ‚ô´ Hiding who you're meant to be. Oh, no ‚ô´ Baby what you don't - So these are Carobs, they taste just like chocolate,
it's really delicious. And inside, the little
seed, here's a fun fact, they found that they all
weighted a fifth of a gram, and that's what they started
to use to weight things, and that's where karat comes from. So like, 24 karat gold,
came from a carob seed. Fun facts. ‚ô´ Everything right now, you can't let go - Hi. ‚ô´ Beautiful. You're so beautiful. - So we just got to Jerusalem, we're doing a tour of the entire city, seeing everything that you've ever read in any type of Bible, I feel like every single spot
has little stories to it. And, yeah, let's go. This is apparently the tomb of Jesus. So even though I'm not
really that religious, I am honored to be here
because it means so much to so many people. ‚ô´ Hell yeah, because you are beautiful. ‚ô´ Eh, et, et do you - Who do I look like? - You look like Mr. Trump, you know, the new President of America. - I look like Trump. - No, no but you are more
beautiful. (Tyler laughs) (upbeat music) - He's trying to sell us a rug. It's beautiful. But how am I about to travel with a rug? I'm just not in the market for a rug. Thank you. Jerusalem has been an adventure. ‚ô´ When I look into your eyes, I know ‚ô´ Yes, love can make you whole, - Oh - [Offscreen Male] He's
the best with al-i-ma. - Imagine if I sneezed. We're on an adventure. To find the best kabob. (upbeat music) We got some lamb, we
got some beef, onions, tomato, hummus, pita, yogurt. Mm. Delicious. (upbeat music) So this is the Western
Wall, it's the holiest spot you can possibly go and
you write a message, a note, a wish, a prayer
whatever you want to write. You put it in the wall and
even if you're not Jewish, or even if you're not
religious, you do it, and that's apparently respectful
to the religion itself. So, I did it and I made a little wish, and it's in the wall now. (upbeat music) So today has been an amazing
day exploring Tel Aviv, and Jerusalem and seeing
so many places that mean so much to so many people. It is wild to me that I
get to leave the places where I'm from and
travel the world and see, places like this that are ancient, that, have so much history to them, so. Thank you for joining me
on this little adventure. If you like this video be
sure to give it a thumbs up. And, um, let me know where
you think I should go next. I want to explore the entire
world, so, let me know. 
- Hey, everyone, my name is Tyler Oakley. Sunday morning when I woke up, I saw the news of what
happened in Orlando. - We interrupt our program this morning because we have some
breaking news to bring you out of downtown Orlando. - There's breaking news
at this hour from Orlando. (unintelligible) - [News Anchor] A shooting at
a downtown Orlando night club. - The FBI says they're
putting every resource that they have-- - [News Anchor] Everyone get out of Pulse and keep running. - I have never been so
thrown or so torn up or so deeply impacted by something as much as this. And I think about the
people that were killed, it is so fucking unfair. I remember where I was
when I saw the news. On June 12, a gunman killed 49 people in the Pulse Orlando night club and injured countless others. It was an attack on the
LGBTQ plus community with many of the victims being latin-x. My stomach dropped. My friend, Raymond, flew to Florida the day after the shooting
happened last year and so, we decided to
return to the city together to see where the community
had settled one year later. (soft acoustic music) We wanted to visit The Center, the local Orlando LGBTQ plus safe haven which acted as ground zero during the days after the shooting. - It was a safe place. It was the place that the
community knew they could come to be around others who were
feeling the same way they were, to get that hug or to say,
"What can I do to help?" And we ended up, within
the first four days, with 35,000 cases of water. We had cars lined up around
the block about three times. We had volunteers get their
donation out of their cars, brought them in, and as fast as we got them in,
they went out the front door and we got them down to the
first responders, the hospitals, you know, the blood banks. - I think that your story
and what happened here demonstrates the importance
of having a physical LGBTQ community center in every community. - When Pulse happened, there was no LGBT, there was no heterosexual,
there was no Muslim, there was no Jewish,
there was no Catholic, it became Orlando. - Mmm. - Just Orlando. - So, a place like the center
obviously is so important regardless of if a tragedy
like Pulse happens. - Right. - What types of resources
do you guys provide here that somebody can walk
in and just expect to count on? - We're the largest HIV
tester in the state, we're doing 500 tests
a month at The Center. We do hep C, we do STD, we have 16 community groups who meet here, transgender groups, and it's place if you're having a bad day, you can come in and get a damn hug. - Mmm. - You know, we get people in all the time that just come in and they're
having a bad day, you know, that's why we put in
counseling in five days a week. We just want them to know
that this is the place that they can come in where it's warm and you might be having
that really bad day, which we all have, but we'll get you laughing
by the time you leave. You know? We'll get you laughing and
we'll get you fixed up. - When it comes to the tragedy of Pulse, it's important that we acknowledge what happened and what that tragedy was. It was a terrorist act, it was a mass shooting, but it was also the worst
hate crime inflicted against the LGBTQ community
in United States history. But also, Latin Night was especially important for local queer latin-x
identifying folks who live and work in Orlando, who were still trying
to find that safe space. And even a year later, the wounds are not healed. But even when the wounds healed, they have left serious scars and this community will need support long after the one year mark after Pulse, the 10 year mark. These scars will last a lifetime. - [Tyler] Pulse, like The Center, was a sanctuary for young gay people. It was a place to watch
drag queens perform, where you could make
friends and meet boys, where you didn't have to explain yourself, and you could just feel alive and at home. (soft piano music) So, what was the feeling the
first time you went to Pulse? - You know, it was the
first time being around so many gay people, I was
like, oh, my god, I'm a freak! (laughs) So, it was, you know, it was a good time, it was a very happy, happy time, yeah. - Can you take us through maybe that night? - That night, I barely danced, I conversed with everyone,
I hugged everyone, I kissed everyone, I just, you know, it was a nice, calm, chill night and two of us in the first shot, first shot happened. And people were falling around me, I grabbed the lady next to me, I grabbed her hand
'cause she was screaming. You know, I kept on telling
her it's gonna be okay. I all of a sudden hear footsteps coming in and it's getting closer and closer and I'm holding on to the lady next to me and then he shoots the lady next to me. And then, you know, there was a pause then, I can feel his presence behind
me, I mean, he was there and I kept praying and
then I stopped praying and that's when I got shot over here a few times. And about 15, 20 minutes later was when
the ambulance came to get me. And then from there on,
it was kinda like a blur. - Mm-hmm. - We're coming up now
on the one year mark. How are your spirits? How are, not just how's your
healing but how are you? - You know, I have my days, you know? I'm always smiling, I'm always positive, but I do have my days, you know, where I break down very randomly here and there with my mom. I don't want this to happen again. - Yeah. - I don't want another
family to go through, you know, what my family has gone through. It's hard for them to see me how I am now 'cause I was very active, I used to jog twice a day, every day. I used to, you know, I
used to be on the go, everywhere, here and there, now I can't do any of that anymore. But, you know, eve though I break down,
I always, you know, keep my head up, smile, I show positivity, I try and, you know, show as much love to the other survivors 'cause it's hard on them as well. And you know, a big
thing of this as well is forgiveness. (ambient piano music) - [Tyler] When I think about Pulse, one number always comes to mind: 49. But behind every number is a person. One of the stories that struck me the most was that of Christopher Drew Leinonen. Drew was at Pulse with
his boyfriend, Juan, and best friend, Brandon,
the night of the shooting. While Brandon escaped and survived, Drew and Juan did not. - So, Drew and I met, well,
our first meeting was a date. And so, we sat down at
this place and, you know, we'd known each other very little, you know, through text
message, like new generations. - [Tyler] Mm-hmm. - And the very first
question out of his mouth was "Do you feel like our for-profit
health insurance system "takes advantage of patients
or does right by them?" - Oh, we would have been best friends. (all laugh)
- This is like, Raymond, that is how Raymond talks. - Yeah.
(laughs) You know, so I was honest with him and I told him my opinions
and so we went back and forth and I think that was the
basis of our friendship. - And when did you meet Juan? - It was Drew's birthday, this kid shows up with a gift for Drew. And so, of course, immediately
I'm like, "I don't like him." He said, "Why don't you like him?" "He has a gift. "He's intruding."
(laughs) Right? Being the unnecessary best friend. - Yeah. - But over time, it was
impossible not to love Juan. So, he wore me down and wore me down and after about a month
I'm like, "Okay, fine, "he can be my best friend too." And we kinda became the three amigos and started traveling
together and all of that. - [Tyler] That's great. - Yeah. - So, I'd like to talk a little bit about the night that Pulse happened. - Okay. So, I had met someone, his name is Eric and we're
actually still together today. June 11th came and Eric texted me at like, seven PM and said, "I really wanna go out," and we kinda debated back and
forth about where we would go, we thought we would go to Parliament House and we ended up changing
our minds to Pulse. So, we got to Pulse, it was really busy. I don't know that I had
ever seen it that busy. And Eric was really awkward and not loving me. (laughs) And, you know, so we started
to loosen up with drinks and chat with each other and we
went out to the patio and Drew could sense the awkwardness 'cause Eric and I are
standing next to each other but not speaking.
- Silence. - So, he put his arms
around me and Eric and said, "You know what we never
say enough to people "is that we love them. "So we're gonna go around the circle "and we're gonna say I love
you and I'm gonna start." And so, we went around the circle, we did our I love you's,
we gave a big hug, and then we went inside and we finished the night by dancing. Eric and I said hey, we
gotta use the bathroom, so we're gonna go to the bathroom and then we'll call an Uber. You guys can wait here and then we'll just leave
here once we're done. We went into the bathroom and that's the last time that I saw Drew and Juan. - [News Anchor] But I wanna
go back to Orlando right now, Christine is joining us
from Orlando right now and Christine, I understand your son was in the club last night? - Well, they said there's a
lot of dead bodies in the club and that's a crime scene. (somber piano music) When I got up at three in the morning and Brandon had posted on Facebook, "There was a shooting at the club, "I hope my friends got out okay," and I'm messaging him back, "Was
Christopher with you?" He said yes, I said,
"Well, where are you?" "7/11," so I run down there at
four o'clock in the morning. - And Christine said,
"Well, I'm gonna go wait "at the emergency room, "'cause I assume if
he's gonna be anywhere, "that's where he'll be." And I think that's when she had her first emotional breakdown, just asking anybody to know anything. "Can anybody tell me where my son is?" - My level of hope,
- Yeah. - that I could find Christopher and that he would be
alive, that was my hope, that was, I wasn't reaching out so that people would tell me that my son had died, I was reaching out and saying, "Please, if you know that
he's somewhere, tell me." You know, and to tell a mom,
"Yes, your son is in surgery. "I wanna let you know he's in surgery." 'Cause they had, the
hospital had over two dozen people in surgery that were... - Still not IDed or anything? - Not identified.
- Yeah. - At this point, Christine's plea for help had reached millions of people, so it wasn't as if people
didn't know who she was or who her son was and she's sitting in this place and she had our friend, Jose, with her and she's getting more and more agitated. - So, they took me in a
room, they threw everything, just like that, there
was stuff on the table, they threw everything off the table and I sat down, they sat down, two cops and me and Jose and they're like, "Your son is dead." Just like that. (somber acoustic music) Christopher should have been having just another 50 years, or longer, of being just happily ordinary, just being able to live his life as a happy gay man who
was looking forward to getting married in the future,
having kids in the future, it's clear, since
Christopher's horrific murder, it's clear that you can't
just have gay community and you can't just have straight allies. You have to be activists. There isn't any other way around it. - Drew was known in high school for starting the first Gay Straight
Alliance in the school. So, we got together, there's
a group of four of us, and we said why don't
we make a non-profit? And we can help other people the same way
he would be helping people. We actually have created a system, we partner with several LGBTQ
organizations in Orlando and we establish and sponsor
Gay Straight Alliances in public schools, to give
kids a safe space to be. - It was, the Drew Project
actually came from nothing else but love for Christopher, from love. So, how could it fail? - You know, I think that's
what I've taken away from Drew is not only we don't tell each other that we love each other, we
don't tell ourselves that we love ourselves enough. So, I think the biggest
thing that you can do to honor these 49 lives with action is to throw your long arms around somebody that's next to you and remind
them that you love them. (passionate acoustic music) - [Tyler] The effects of June 12th are still palpable in Orlando, but I was surprised by how, a year later, it manifests in compassion and pride. Orlando was shaken by a tragedy. They have grounded themselves in love. Seeing the tenacity of this community reminded me of the
strength that you can find with those around you. Orlando exemplified queer resilience and I decided to end my trip with a celebration of queer life, both open and unapologetic. I don't know if I've ever
met such a strong, resilient, unified, intersectional, incredible...
(crowd applauds, cheers) (passionate ambient music) Thank you so much for watching this video. Obviously, it was really
important and special to me and I didn't even realize how
powerful it would have been until I went to Orlando and I
met these incredible people, maybe taking something
away of inclusion and love and honoring these victims and not forgetting what happened at Pulse. And hopefully, you take
something away from this video. If you did, please share it. Push the share button and
share it with somebody else in the community that you think might take something away from this too. Thank you so much to the people in Orlando who helped make this video possible. Also to the Human Rights
Campaign for partnering with me on this video and helping
me make action items for things that we can do as a community to help honor them with action. I'm gonna put all of those
in the description below. It's a list of a few things that we can do and incorporate into our
own lives to make sure that we don't forget what happened at Pulse, but also make the world a better place. The first thing you can do is text "unite" to 30644 to join HRC's
mobile action network, that way you can keep
up to date on everything we should know about to
make sure we're involved. One of the biggest things
that I got from this trip and from talking to all of
these amazing people in Orlando was to never forget the victims, but to also honor them with
action and to do something that maybe will make the world better. This week's t-shirt is
supporting the Drew Project which, when I first heard about it, I knew I wanted to help
in any way I could. So if you get one of those,
you are going to be supporting creating safe spaces in GSAs in schools, which I think is an incredible thing. Thank you so much for
supporting this video, I love that this channel is a place where we can do dumb, silly, stupid things but also maybe talk about
important things too. If you like that type of stuff, subscribe, and we got a new video coming very soon. That's all. Bye, friends. 
(siren blares) (techno dance music) - Thank you so much for
joining me on my adventure to Disneyland today. I had so much fun! If you like this little
video, give it a thumbs up and let me know in the comments where I should go next,
and maybe I'll take you. That's all. Okay, love
you guys. (blows kiss) Oh, you want to say, "Hi?' (group excitedly cheers) - Oh, my god! (girl shrieks) We gotta go! Okay, bye! 
- Where do you look when you do this? At camera? - Yeah.
- Okay. - No, I look into the distance. Just look over there. Well, I think that's it, I think we got it, that was the video. (cheerful lively music) Hi everyone! My name is Tyler Oakley and I'm here today with the one and only,
famed gay, Gus Kenworthy. - Hi everyone, I'm Gus Kenworthy! - So today, I figured, we
will talk a little about coming out, because it's
something that both of us did and still do, nobody
questions it anymore for me. So Gus, you came out how long ago? - I came out publicly
almost two years ago? In October of 2015 on the cover of ESPN. - So like, subtle. - It was subtle. Yeah, I was like, "everybody... I'm gay..." - So, when you came out, it
was a couple of years ago, but, you had come out before then. - Yeah. - So like friends and family right? What was that like? - I came out to a few friends first and the very first friends
that I came out to, I was like crying, I was a wreck, it's like really emotional. - Wait, so they knew? - They already knew. They were just like, "got it." They understood. - I love that they didn't
bring it up to you. - They didn't pressure me at all and when I finally told
them, they were like, "we're so glad you told us,
we've been waiting to tell you." In sport as my job, being
a professional skiier, that was when I was
really nervous to come out and I was scared to come out and it took awhile to figure it out, that I was like ready to do that, because I always thought it would be like after skiing, I'd be able to come out. Like, I'd ski till I was done and I'm like once I was on Olympics and stuff, I would then have a
boyfriend or a husband. - So tell me about the day
when your cover came out. - I was like, "oh my god, I'm so excited, I'm going to be able to
go to gay bars and stuff." - Oh! - And then, when the actually article was like coming out, the night before I like, couldn't sleep. I was like, "tomorrow, nothing's
gonna be the same anymore." - Today, I want to play a little game where I'm gonna ask you
a series of questions about firsts and you have to tell me one word to describe that. - Hold on, do you have a lisp? Firsts. - First date with a guy. - Comedy Festival. - That's two words, you
already have failed. First kiss with a guy. - Scary. My first one was really scary,
I thought he was straight. - First time you had sex with a guy. - Flip. - I'm thinking like those pretzel flips. - That's what it was. - Yeah, I got it. - The first time we had
sex, we then had pretzels. - Hot. First time you watched gay porn. - 14? I used to watch gay porn and then I would like feel guilty
that I had just done that, so then I would like,
go watch straight porn and be like, this is gross. But like, pretend that
I was into that too. - I'd like watch straight
porn and be like, "yes, yes, I like what she's doing also. But, what's he up to..." Do you have a favorite gay pornstar? - I like Austin Wilde. - That's my favorite! - Is that your favorite?
- Oh my god! Wait, are you kidding? I can't believe we're competing for him. It's so weird, I'm gonna have to kill you. Since you came out, how has being openly gay changed your work
life and your dating life. - Everything's just been like, completely enriched since I came out. Work life, I think, I just got to compete like uninhibited
and unencumbered and haven't had this sense
of having to hide myself. I just got to be me and
the year after I came out, that following season,
I had my best season that I've ever had and I think that a lot of that success, I can attribute to just coming out and just feeling free and happy and like this huge
weight off of my shoulders. And then, in my relationships, I think it's made a huge difference. I mean my first
relationship was five years, but it was a hard relationship to be in because we were in the closet. We never could talk to other people about our relationship, we were never able to open up and vent
to do all these things. Since that relationship, the relationship that I'm in now, it's just so nice to just like, hold hands
and walk down the street, show our love and not care. - Do you have any advice for, maybe there's a young queer kid out there that is questioning things and they don't know or they are curious. - The one thing that I
could say without a doubt, is that life is so much
richer on the other side and that I'm not pushing you to come out at any time that you're not ready because it's such a personal thing that you need to do it when you feel safe, when you feel comfortable,
but that it does get better and I know that sometimes it feels like it doesn't, but if you
can find it in yourself to talk to somebody, to tell somebody whether it's a friend, or a parent or a teacher or whatever, the weight that you're gonna feel being lifted off your shoulders, is so freeing and so exhilarating, that you'll then want to tell more and more people. There's always the fear of losing friends or losing family members or whatever it is that you're afraid of, you're gonna have a whole new community, you're gonna have an amazing new set of friends. All these things that are gonna happen and the people that don't accept you and can't accept you and don't want to are the people that you are gonna realize you do not need in your life. - If you need a little
posse, we'll be your friends. We'll love you. - We're here for you. I don't know. - That's beautiful, bitch. - Thank you. - That was sweet and tender. - These stereotypes that get perpetuated get stopped once there's representation. For me, I was like my
sport is so homophobic, that everyone called
everything that was bad, gay. Like, this was so gay, the
judging's being so gay right now. But then as soon as I had come out, and there was like actually
someone gay in the industry, and they realize that, "oh,
that's just not cool to say." - It changed?
- It stopped. I didn't hear it at events anymore and if like got someone, I
would hear someone be like, "that's so... Lame." - It literally will change lives when somebody like you with a platform that doesn't have to come out, nobody's forcing you, like it's not an obligation, I don't think. But I think it's an incredible honor to be able to do that and to
be that for so many people. No, I'm not even just
eating your ass right now. There's so many kids
that will have somebody and I think about when I was younger, like who did I have to look up to. The list was so small and by
being your authentic self, you are expanding that list for a future generation to feel
like, "oh, I see myself, oh, I see somebody who can
accomplish their dreams and feel like, okay, it's not the end of the world if I admit it too." okay, so that was so fun. Thank you for hanging out with me today. - Thank you for having me. - This is so much fun! If you guys like this
video, what can they do? - You can like, leave a positive comment, you can subscribe, you
can also follow Tyler on all of his platforms, the
links are in the description. - And how do people find you? - And they can find me, it's just @guskenworthy on everything. - Okay, I will put everything
in the description, go stalk him, give him love. Thank you guys for
hanging out with us today. If you like this video, like he said, give it a thumbs up and let us know, if you had a question or
something about coming out, if you have any concerns or anything, if you need advice,
put it in the comments. This week we are celebrating coming out and that journey and every week we're gonna be talking
about different topics. But, to celebrate each topic, we are gonna have a different t-shirt that will be for sale

organization called, Glisten. They are helping provide safe spaces for LGBTQ+ kids in
schools, in communities. So if you want to support
that organization, the description will have

- Bye friends. 
- Hey everyone, my name is Tyler Oakley and welcome to the Tyler Oakley Show. I am joined today by one of my favorites, Shawn Mendes everybody! (cheering) How are you? - Good, good, I think I

- Yeah, no. - In a great way, like
it's just been so fast. People are always like I

but you're never gonna do anything if you wait 'til you're ready. - That's beautiful. - Yeah.
- Write fortune cookies. Give it all up.
- I will, I will. - You have so many fans. You have tons of people
who have gotten you to the point where you are right now. - Totally. - There's no way to thank all of them but I did want to thank one in particular. - I love that. - Her name is Haiden. Her Twitter handle is Mendes-- - What if she just doesn't-- - Featuring Oakley.
- Featuring Oakley. What if she doesn't believe it's us? - Well then... - [Haiden] Hello? - Hello? - [Haiden] Hi. - Is this Haiden? - Yes it is, oh my god it's Tyler! Oh my god it's his voice! - It's not just Tyler, wait hello, oh god. Haiden? - [Haiden] I'm sorry, I'm sorry! - Hi, I wanted to call you

- Bye! - Bye! I was just on the phone
with Tyler and Shawn! Oh my god! - You say in your Twitter bio that you are a Hogwarts graduate. - Yeah now I am 'cause
I'm 18 now, I'm graduated. - You got your letter,
you did the whole thing. What house are you in? - Gryffindor. - You said that without hesitation. - Of course. - I think I'm Hufflepuff,
Slytherin adjacent. Like I'm evil but like also boring. No, stay. So this is soap or earwax. - I already know the answer which ones worse and which
ones better I'm sorry. Sorry man. - What is it? - You're eating earwax right now. - Is that earwax? - Yeah I'm definitely eating soap. - How do you know what earwax tastes like? I guess that's what earwax tastes like. - The soap actually tastes really good. - One is dirt, the other is sausage. Did you just give me sausage? - I probably would be
fine with both, either. I'm definitely eating dirt. - That's 100% sausage. - Your probably better than mine. - That's not kosher. That's not right. - One of these is either
throw up and one's earthworm. You're about to eat vomit. - Oh my god, vomit. - Right, really bad. - Straight up. - Earthworm isn't also good. Really bad. - Shawn, thank you so much
for hanging out with me. Thanks you guys. (neon crackling) So that was Shawn Mendes, you guys. Did you like the video? This is my sister, by the way. - Hi! - This is Emily. Emily's in town visiting from Michigan and we are super busy, so that's why I'm gone from the internet. But if you like this
video, what should they do? - They should subscribe. - Well yeah. - They should tell their friends. - Yeah, give and give it
a thumbs up right there. Also, if you want to see my latest video which was the last episode
with Senator Tim Kaine who is Hillary's running mate, you can click over that way? And then the podcast is right there and then person of the week if you want to be person of the week, but that's all. Okay, love you guys. - Bye.
- Bye. 
- My friends kept bothering me and telling me I should watch him, and I was like no, no, like I
don't feel like watching him, and then he won like a TCA or something, and I was like, okay I guess
I'll give this guy a try. - Thanks. - Oh my freaking god. (happy music) - Hi everyone, my name is Tyler Oakley, and to celebrate the end
of my Chosen Family series, I wanted to do something a little special with some of my chosen
family, which is you guys. So I am asking viewers at VidCon
to come share their stories but litle did they know that I am going to be behind
the curtain listening, and I'ma pop in and surprise them. Let's go. (inspirational dance music) - [Camera Man] Can you introduce yourself and tell us what's your story? - Uh I'm Stephanie, I'm
from Corona, California. I recently just came out as bisexual, and like I was always like
debating on whether I was, and I was kind of doubting
it because so many people were like, oh bisexuality is not valid. And I was kind of like, okay
maybe I shouldn't say anything, so I came out officially on Twitter. I'm kind of proud to be
like who I am, you know. Once you get to know yourself more and you get to know
other people a lot more, you become like a part of
it, and they become a family, and you're like oh,
maybe it's not all this. - [Camera Man] Is there anything else you'd like to tell Tyler? - Thank you Tyler for making your videos and making people smile,
and making me smile, and you kind of influenced me
on coming out a little bit. So thank you for being you. - Thank you for being you. - Oh my god no way, you're lying. - Come to me. (laughter) - Hello. - No. - I'm sorry. - No. - I was just listening to the
whole thing, you are so sweet. I love and adore you. Thank you. - Oh my god, thank you so much. Thank you oh my god. - Because I remember growing up, I mean I was kind of
afriad to be who I was, and now it's like everyone
can just be who they are, and that's a very beautiful thing. - We're just a bunch of outcasts that have banded together through
all this adversity. Growing up in a Catholic
school in Houston, there wasn't much media for me to consume of people that were like me. So people like Tyler
Oakley and the rest of the Five Awesome Gays, showed me that like, there is an outlet, there
are other people like me, and I don't have to be like
a stereotypical version of what the current media is showing me, I could be just like
myself, like Tyler is. - Yeah definitely, thank
you, I mean I don't think... - Hi. (yelling and laughter) - Y'all are so cute. Also were you like grabbing each other's butts behind the camera? - A little bit. - The camera was this high. - Thanks for coming. - Ah bye. - I'm Brooke and I'm from
Toronto area, Canada, and I'm proud that I'm in the
community because it's just an accepting place for
me to count on people. Like I can talk to my friends or like I could talk to my girlfriend. Oh my god! - Hi, wait come love me. - Oh my god. - Wait come here, hi. - You scared me so much. (laughter) - I'm not sorry. I'm so proud of you. - Thank you. - I'm so proud of you. - I am bisexual and I just
feel like a lot of people are just so iffy about
people who are bisexual because it's like, oh you can't choose, you just have to pick one or the other. It's been a long road actually
being comfortable with it, and like being in the community, really helps a lot with all of that. - I've been having to
hide my sexuality since I was around probably eight years old. Recently I did come out
basically to most of my family, and they're now really accepting, so from then I just felt more
comfortable and more happy where I am and with the community. - Y'all are so sweet. - Oh my god. (laughter) - I am like gonna cry backstage. I was going to let you finish but I literally couldn't, I'm sorry. Thank you for what you
said, you are so sweet. I'm so proud of both of you. Hi, happy VidCon, happy Pride. - My name is Brianna Peralta. - My name is Courtney. - I'm Debby Hill. - When you're in the
closet, and you're not talking to your parents, who can you talk to? And I would go on the
internet and talk to Tyler. - You know Tyler really
encouraged me to be more of an activitist
for the LGBT community. - I'm just seeing such beautiful people with just lots of love, and
not separate from any color, or gender, it didn't
really matter ya know, it was just another person,
they just chose to love their same sex if that was the deal. - You're the reason why I'm
in school doing what I'm doing and being a communications major and trying to find a
voice for other people. - You've made a huge difference
in my daughter's life and she's there, done that,
for lots of other people, and helped lots of people just by following your example as well, so I want to thank you for that. - Thank you. (laughter) - That's so sweet. - Thank you for being someone that other people can look at and be like, you know what, if Tyler Oakley can be the most awesome dork on the planet, then I can be the most awesome
dork on the planet as well. - You can be. - Shut up, Tyler. Stop. - Come to me. - Tyler you are not here. - Oh my god. (laughter) - Hi, how are you. Thank you for being an
activist and an ally, and your friends should
be so grateful for you, so thank you. Thank you for coming and
thank you for what you said, you're the sweetest. - My name is Freddy Widmer, I'm 22, and I've seen the progressive change from being born in the late
90's to being alive now. I mean marriage equality,
and rights for trans people and trans kids in schools
and stuff like that, I think it's just really
amazing to be a part of a group of people that are
seeing their rights pass, it's so empowering that
someone who started just with videos on the
internet 10 years ago can have the voice that you have. And it's an inspiration. - You are so sweet. You are so sweet. Hi, how are you? - I'm so good, how are you? - I'm good, I'm like about to cry, you're so sweet. - I'm an ally and I'm
so proud to be an ally just to support equality
and what I believe in. I think that we're all born equal and that we should be treated equally. - Being a part of the LGBT
community, I'm asexual. So asexuality doesn't always get the awareness that it deserves. But it's nice to know that
we are getting recognition, and people understand it more now. - The number one thing I did
was watch coming out video after coming out video. And seeing someone like Tyler Oakley was really inspirational. And he really proved that
there will be someone for you, and that no matter who you
are, you were born this way, and you should be proud of that. - I love that so much, that was so cute. (yelling) - Hi. (gasps) - Thanks. - Oh my freaking god. How are you? - It means a lot. - That's so amazing. Wait are those my glasses? - They are. - Work. - I'm proud of you. (laughter) - Stop. - Oh my god! (laughter) - Thank you so much. Hi. (laughter) - Hi Tyler. - Hello. - Oh my god. - Hi. - So that's it, we are done. This year's Chosen Family
series is all finished. I hope you loved it as much as I did. What I would love is if you
would let me know in the comments below, what queer
topics I didn't get to cover. Because obviously I
couldn't cover everything. There's so much more that
I want to talk about, so if there's something
that's important to you, let me know in the comments, and maybe I'll make a video
about it in the future. Thank you to everyone that helped make all these videos possible. So much love went into all of the videos, so if you haven't seen them all, I'm going to put the playlist below and I would love it if you watched it, I would love it if you shared
it, put it on Facebook, put your favorite one
on your Facebook page, it would mean the world to me. Until then you can buy the very last shirt in support of the human rights campaign right now, limited edition. So get it while you can. Thank you for supporting this series, thank you for being in my chosen family, I love y'all and I'll
see you guys very soon. Later. 
- Hi, everyone, my name
is Tyler Oakley and happy fucking New Year. It's 2018 here we fucking go. You know when everyone was like oh 2016 was the worst and then 2017 did that I mean obviously was bad for a lot of reasons in a lot of ways, but we're not all dead so here comes 2018. I hope we don't all die. That would be bummer summer. She hates an apocalypse, but you know what, girl, buckle up. Anything can happen this year. So anyway a Happy New Year, I hope your New Year's was great. I hope your holidays were spectacular. I didn't do shit which was so nice. I have been going home so much to Michigan for the past like few months. I decided all my December was gonna be stuck in Los Angeles
and soaking in the sun. Not doing a single flight. It is weird to look back at 2017 because it's like my that was my 10th year of YouTube. I always I'm thinking like a year which is so arbitrary, but like I think of every year is different
because I have to do my hundred things videos and I look at what did I really do that year and from 2007 to 2012 it was like the start of my YouTube stuff it was all just making fun dumb videos 2013 was when I really went full-time YouTube, moved to Los Angeles, and really dedicated my time to like trying to make this happen. 2014 was like you know Teen Choice Awards, collabing with everyone. It felt like when YouTube
really made a mark on pop culture and I felt
like I was very much a part of that. 2015 was like me trying to do big projects outside of the scope of
what I thought I could do. So book, filming Amazing
Race, going on talk shows, doing the documentary. 2016 was doing the Tyler Oakley show with Ellen and my Warby Parker glasses. Doing the Amazing Race
which you guys all saw. 2017 felt like a return back to what I actually thought I wanted to do as a creator, outside of like hype and surprises and announcements and everything like that I thought about like okay what do I want to make. What do I think is
important and who do I want to make videos with. What do I want to make videos about that actually matters to me. Not that I wasn't doing that before, but like I really always want you guys to be excited with me and I think
there was a moment when I kind of lost, I hate YouTubers talking about YouTube stuff, but here I am. Suddenly this became therapy, but I feel like there was a moment where I kind of lost excitement about what I'm making and a sense of pride in the stuff that I'm putting out in the universe and I feel like 2017 was a really cool moment of me making shit that I think means to actually exist. Which is a cool feeling. I think about Chosen Family and like The Trailblazer
series even Spooktober where I got to like do stuff outside of my comfort zone and it kind of made me realize that like even 10 years into YouTube you can still like have fun. Not that I wasn't having fun, but you can still do stuff that feels fresh and as a creative person I feel like sometimes people that always are putting stuff out into the universe feel like everything's already been done, I've already put everything out there that needs to be put out, I've said the things that need to be said, what left can possibly be said even when I wasn't gonna turn on this camera I'm like, girl, A, I've said it all I said all the things that I need to say. B, who cares, but clearly
somebody cares if you're watching, I hope you care, I hope this wasn't an accidental click. If so, bitch, you have
watched a long intro. But, hello, shabbat shalom,
I hope you subscribe. What was my point? There's still stuff to be
made and that was the exciting realization in 2017. Moving into 2018 I feel like I have this mindset of okay, bitch, there's so much that I did, there are
so many accomplishments that I feel like we have done together that I'm really proud of. Whether it's big screen or big project or like small vlog or small collab or anything like that. I feel like I can find a
happy medium of things that I'm proud of and going into 2018 I'm gonna fucking do that. Going into this year I have
a few little goals even though I don't fucking like
New Year's resolutions. Girl, if you want to do
something just do something. Don't wait for the new
year and I feel like I say that every year, but I just like. Especially as a YouTuber it's like you have to have like here are the goals and like as an adult I don't know what I want for lunch, I don't know what I want to do tomorrow, I don't know what is going on in my life, or
what's that Cher tweet? What the fuck is going on with my career? Same, me, but I also feel like it's all of us, but like there's this like expectation to have these goals or
like a five-year plan and I'm like, girl. In this year, in the
next foreseeable future if we don't all die
from the apocalypse, my goal is I started a production company that I signed with an agency WME and I'm really excited about that. I'm going to be making
cool fucking amazing shit. Whether it's big screen, small screen high production, smaller docu-series stuff, I want to make cool shit and this production company is gonna allow for that and I'm really
fucking excited for that. I'm gonna finish my second book if it's the death of me. Oh my God, there's nothing
like writing the second book after you write the first book and think damn I really fucking
did that well, bitch, I'ma fucking do it again. Another thing I'm gonna do is carry over something that I really did last year and that is take care of myself and that is in the sense of like fitness. I really tried to take care of my damn body, girl, it's the only one you got can you believe this sack of skin with bones inside is the only one you fucking got. I was thinking about this the other day there I was in the shower thinking oh my God, my body, there's a bag in your body that just holds pee and then your brain decides release the pee. It is a wonder how the body
works so I'm trying to take care of that body (laughs). But this year I really
want to carry on what I've been doing last year and that is actively trying to take care of myself in a healthy way. And that is like changing the way I consume, changing the way I am active, so yeah I'm going to the gym working out, and taking care of myself. Trying to feel cute in my body in a good way and not because like I'm doing it for anybody else, but doing it for me. That's a good feeling,
that's a cool thing. In my old age a new thing
for me to do, how fun. You know what I would like to do? I'm gonna just put it out in the universe. Bitch, I'm ready for like
a solid good relationship. Mmm. Can you imagine? Love, don't know her. So yeah that would be nice. It's not like I haven't been dating in LA. It's just I always make the excuse of okay I am so busy with
traveling blah-blah-blah and this and that,
whatever, work, whatever that I don't dedicate enough time to developing meaningful relationships more than platonic and I would like to do that so, bitch, I'm gonna do that. If you're watching this
you're not eligible unless you're like really cute. Anyway so I hope you
guys have a good year. I know I'm going to. It's just a choice you make, I think. Even when shitty things happen. Even when the year feels blah. I do want to say thank
you so much to the people that have been watching. Honestly, this past year's worth of stuff, the people that have
clicked the videos that are most important to me, that is the coolest feeling because this year I feel like has been my best year of creation. 2017 has been the thing
that I am most proud of in the sense that like
it's worthwhile shit. It is something that I
feel like I would have needed it's something
that I feel like the world needs and yeah I can still sprinkle in like dumb shit that I do on the internet. Like dressing up as the Grinch or like playing with '90s toys. Like yes I can still have
dumb fun and I feel like that's important to have, but like I think as a creator it is a cool thing when I feel the freedom and the ability to make stuff that I think is also important and for y'all
to have clicked those things is rad so thank
you so in that sense I am super excited about this year. I have a lot of fun
things that I've planned for what I'm gonna create that is of course gonna be on my end, but also a lot of it has to do with you guys. If there's things that you
guys want there's things that you wish I would cover that I didn't do in the last year, if there's topics that you think are difficult that you wish a YouTuber would touch on I want to be that TouTuber
you know what I mean? I want to be the one that takes risks and I want to be the one that dabbles in things that might be more serious or might be harder hitting so let me know in the comments what you wish to see in the new year. I have so many ideas,
but I of course always am inspired by y'all so let me know what you would like to see me do. Maybe we can do it together. Okay, that's all, Happy
New Year, I hope you have a good life, I hope we all don't die tomorrow, and if we do push the thumbs up button now, like what's it gonna hurt. If we're all gonna be dead you might as well just press the thumbs
up button for this video. Thank you, that's all, okay.

Umm but you can like move it and like I don't know. This is the coolest toy. Imagine if you had this like when you were growing up like I feel like I'm Shouldn't be doing that but I'm allowed to Ahh! *Giggles* But it's the craziest thing how these things are made I don't even know what I'm up to When you do like a close up of the face and you wanna do like a bigger version And you can take apart the different Come here!

This is- I don't know if you can tell- Korey wait, can you hold this? It is so big. I heard it's like the biggest character they've ever made for stop motion. And it's gonna be right here Well I wear like 7s, but like at Soul Cycle I wear 7 and 1/2 But this is, this is pretty big If you can't tell Korey: What size do you think? Tyler: This would be... Well if this is 7 I don't know math, 21? A subtle 21 Tyler: This is like the ultimate arts and crafts project I don't know if you can tell but these are individually made leaves Turning into this boat!

- Hi, everyone! My name is Tyler Oakley
and I am on an adventure. If you listen to the podcast, you've heard my updates about this. I play Pokemon Go still. I'm the only one. The point of the game is simple. You have to catch them all. I have 235 of them. Some of them are regional. I have made the trek. I flew from Michigan, five hours to LA, then 13 hours to Brisbane,
then 2 more hours to Melbourne. I am here, I am jetlagged, and I'm gonna get my Kangaskhan. [Folk Guitar Music] So as you play Pokemon,
you can see what's nearby. There are no Kangaskhans nearby. We are wandering endlessly. Catching this Kangaskhan
is of vital importance. I am only in Australia
for less than 48 hours. If I do not catch this
Kangaskhan in this trip, I don't know when the next
time I'm gonna be in town is. I don't know when the next time I'm gonna be in the country is. There's a Natu, which I
don't need, but I'll get. It's escaped my ball. It's like I don't even want it, but now I have to get it out of principle. So I'm not seeing any Kangaskhans. Just seeing a bunch of shit. Natu, I don't need you. Oh, and it hit my ball away. Great. This game is just a series
of things that I don't want but I'm too stubborn to let go. Oh! Another Natu, great. I'm hatching a Pokemon. I guarantee it's gonna be nothing good. I love games that are fun. I only have, like, 20 more minutes left before I have to head back to the hotel and get ready for my meet and greet. And as soon as I'm back
at the meet and greet, I'm stuck in that convention center for the rest of time that
I'm here in Australia, and I'm a little stressed, because if I can't leave,
I can't find my Pokemon. If I don't find the Kangaskhan
while I'm in Australia, like, it's not gonna be
the end of the world, but I definitely will hate my life. Meh. Okay. It's on the radar. Oh my God, oh my God, oh my
God, oh my God, oh my God. Okay, it's on the radar. We're going. [Intense Music] (whimpers) It ran. Okay. It's okay, I'll just get this Magikarp. We have time. I didn't
just run for nothing. Y'all, this is not a failure. I have to go back to VidCon, I have to go do my meet and greet,
but we will be back. I'm not playing, y'all. I need it. So I'm at VidCon, which
obviously I'm happy to be at, but it's bittersweet! I just want to go hunt. Not that I don't want to spent
time with y'all at VidCon, but y'all know my priorities. (screaming and applause) - What's the thing you've wanted to do the most in Australia? - If I could do anything in Australia, it would be to catch a Kangaskhan. Does anybody know how, where
I can find a Kangaskhan? [Soft Orchestral Music] Do you play Pokemon Go? - I do. - Do you have a Kangaskhan? - I've got one! - I haven't found it yet. - My best advice for
anyone coming to Australia is when you get off the
plane, just stay in inside, lock your doors, don't go anywhere. - I need to find my Kangaskhan. That's my number one
priority in Australia, so I have to go outside. She's out there. Now you may be wondering: Tyler, you're 28. Why are you
playing this? You're very old. You should be using your
data on important things like updating your LinkedIn or something. I have an addiction and I
have since I was, like, 11. I used to go the video game store and compete in Pokemon tournaments. I never won, which is just like today. Still not winning. We are searching. There's nothing on my radar, so I'm ... Like, I don't even want to touch it, I'm too nervous. Oh my God, oh my God, oh my
God, oh my God, oh my God. My heart is racing. Now is the moment. Now is the time. (laughs) I traveled 20 hours for this. If I don't get it, I swear to fucking God. Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. I'm, like, shaking (laughs). Hoo-wee. Okay. So bitch, we're gonna use a strong berry. Yes, bitch. You're mine. Cross the finger. Bitch, I swear to God. God is good! Oh my God, oh my God, oh my
God, oh my God, oh my God. (sighs) I would just
like to thank Niantic. I would like to thank Virgin Australia for flying me here, even
though I paid for the flight. God bless ya. I would like to thank my
SIM card that I had to buy for $30 'cause my internet
wasn't working in this country. I would like to thank my Pokedex. Honestly, I could fly home happy. Next stop, Asia. We need
that fucking Farfetch'd. 
- Hey everyone! My name is Tyler Oakley. My favorite thing about being gay is the family that it comes with. You might have a blood
family or a community that might not get you, but there's always this chosen family that LGBTQ+ people get to have. You can connect with them, so today I wanted to be your
proverbieal big brother. So I asked you on Twitter
to submit questions, that you might have
about the LGBTQ+ world, and today I'm gonna try to help you out and give you some answers. - Hi Tyler, how are you, my name is Lee Livvy. I have a childhood friend who's gay, and he really wants to
come out to his family but is terrified. How do I help him, and
show support towards him, when I'm not a part of the community? - I love that you care so
much about your friend. That is a great first step. If they've already come out to you, be there for them, don't act
like you know all the answers, be a listening ear, and if they
haven't come out to you yet, but you think that they're gay and you still want to help
them out, don't rush it. Drop some hints that you are an accepting, welcoming person to all types of people. They'll know that they can come to you. Hey Tyler, I'm Jenna, and I was wondering, how do you deal with
hearing homophobic slurs-- - This is tough, because for me, I am so comfortable with
myself where I'll just be like, "Hi, we don't use that language," so if it's your friend,
they should want to know why that language can be
problematic or hurtful. I think the best way to do
it, is to explain to them why language like that is often
used to demean people, and hurt people, and even if
that's not their intention, a closeted person will
hear that and be like, "dangerous person,
can't come out to them." I feel like if you tell
them that, they'll be like, "Oh, I didn't even think about that," so yeah, it's about telling
people how to do better. - Hey Tyler! My name is Kelly, and my question was, if there's any books or
documentaries on either how to get involved in the LGBTQ movement, or the history of it, so
I can learn all about it. - Kelly, that is a great question, especially because so many schools don't even give you any education
about the LGBTQ+ movement, I feel like it's great to
take that into your own hands. As you guys know, I recommend a new book on Audible every single month. To answer your question Kelly, I think the most appropriate book for this month would be, The Velvet Rage. So many of my friends love this book, so I'm going to listen to it, if you would like to
listen to it along with me, you can use audible.com/tyleroakley to get the first 30-day trial free. They have hundreds of thousands of titles from every type of genre but
they have so many LGBTQ+ books. Thank you so much to Audible
for sponsoring this video, we love you and thank
you for providing so much good LGBTQ+ content for us to listen to. - Hi Tyler, I was wondering, were or are you ever
nervous to get tested? - I remember when I first got tested, I was so nervous and so positive that it was gonna come
back with terrible results. It just takes you going and doing it, to realize it's not that scary. Regardless of the results,
it is better to know how you are and what your body is up to, so that you can take care of it. - Hello Tyler (laughing) I'm going to my first Pride
Parade very very soon, and I don't know what to bring? - I love this question, how fun! Everyone's first Pride Parade
is like the best day ever, because like you get to be
surrounded by all these people that just get you. I would bring maybe like a rainbow flag, that's a good thing for any pictures you wanna post on Instagram,
an extra battery for my phone, (claps loudly) ooh, body glitter! You could just like, slather it on! My number one tip though,
is don't be afraid of color. It is going to be rainbow
central, so you can be as bright and shiny as you possibly wanna be, if anybody goes to Pride this year, I want to see pictures of
what you wear to Pride, or your posse at Pride, tweet me pictures. - Hi Tyler, I'm Keith Reeves,
a professional educator and author just outside of Washington DC. I've long been concerned
with meeting the needs of my queer students, and
I'd like to know what advice you have for other professional educators, be they straight, ally,
queer, or otherwise, on how we can improve the quality of life for our students in schools. - I mean just the fact that
you were already conscious of making safe spaces in
your classrooms or schools is an incredible thing
and I want to thank you. I remember in my high
school, there were posters that people would put on their doors, where there was like this pink triangle, and said, this is a safe space,
and that can sometimes be the life-affirming thing
that some child needs to see. You are letting them know for a lifetime, that who they are is okay. That's really developmental,
and to take it a step further, I have heard from so many
young LGBTQ+ people that say, they have never even
received any LGBTQ+ education in their classrooms, and
if you ever have a chance to include queer narratives
in how you teach, I think that is going
to make a big impact. - Hi Tyler!
- Hey Tyler. - I'm Kiana and I'm bisexual,
and this is my cousin. - I'm Rhianna, I'm also bisexual. - How do you come out
to judgmental people, because our Grandma is really judgmental, and we're both really
scared of coming out to her. - First of all, I love that
you guys have each other, a lot of times people feel like, "Oh, I don't have anyone to talk to, but thank God you all have
each other to be like, "Ugh, Grandma!" Listen, when it comes to old people, they don't always get it, because they have spent an entire lifetime thinking this certain way, but if you really love her
and value that relationship, communicate that with her, and be like, "Listen, this is who we are, "I love you so much that
I want you to get it," and you gotta remember, old people, they grew up in a time
where nobody was coming out, so that's just how they grew
up, and what they learned. Sometimes, it can be you that
changes their perspectives. Regardless of what your Grandma says, I think you all are great, a
precious little cousin duo. - Hey Tyler, I've always
felt a bit awkward around straight guys, I was thinking, if you had any advice
on how to get over it, and be comfortable around straight people. - Straight people! If you're straight, I accept
you for who you are (laughing). In all seriousness, a lot of times, the fear with friendships
with straight guys is, they think you want to date
them or do them or whatever. We, in our heads, think
that that's how they think, and regardless of if they do or not. Being open and honest and be like, "I'm not trying to date you. I'm gay, you're straight, big
whoop, but let's be friends." And then to be friends,
finding those things that do overlap, is a good way to like, find the comfort in that friendship. - Hey Tyler, how do you think people should get more involved in LGBT politics? - Get involved locally. I think there's ways where you
can call your representative. People in government work for us. They only know what to fight for, based on what we tell them we care about. Calling your representatives actually does make a difference. One of my absolute favorite
websites, 5Calls.org, is a perfect way to know who to call that represents you in government, so I am partnering with 5calls.or
to curate a list of issues that are really important to me that have to do with LGBTQ+ rights. So if you click the link below, it'll take you to the website, use it, love it, call your representatives and tell them what matters to you. - Hi Tyler, my name is
Simon and I'm from Germany. How do I or one, connect
with other members from the LGBTQ+ community? - Find out if your school
has a GSA, and if they don't, start one, you can be the person who starts that phenomenon at your school. Your community might have
an LGBTQ+ resource center, see if that exists, and if so, go to it, and if you live somewhere where
you feel completely alone, you can turn to the internet. I am going to make a little
hashtag, #TylerPrideMeetUp on Twitter, you can introduce yourself, and maybe you're gonna
meet your new best friend. Like I said, I don't have all the answers, but I hope this may have helped you out, so if you have a question
that you want answered that maybe I didn't get to,
put it in the comments below. If you feel like you
can help, let them know. So that is all I have for you guys today, I hope you liked this video. If you did, give it a thumbs up, thanks for hanging out with me, and be sure to go in the
comments and help each other out. Okay, love you guys, bye! 
- Okay so before I get into anything, I just realised that I
filmed this entire video and I didn't give any context what I'm actually talking about. So if you don't know, if you
haven't seen what's happened, over the weekend there
were two different events that I'm about to talk about. Number one, Christina
Grimmie who was a musician, a youtuber, a contestant on the voice. (sniff) Had performed, a tour
was set up in Orlando, and then was shot while
she was meeting fans after the show, and she died. And then, the other event was, 50 people, there might be
developments after this comes out, but 50 people were killed at
a latino night, at a gay bar, during pride month in Orlando. So these two events are what
I'm about to talk about. I don't have all the answers, I'm probably not gonna
say everything right, I'm probably gonna forget
to say some things. Please forgive me, I
just wanted to talk about what's going on. Hey everyone, my name is Tyler Oakley. I'm kinda losing my voice, I
was at gay price this weekend and I was hootin' and hollerin', so I was kinda like screaming, so I'm a little bit, forgive me. But that was Saturday night, and Sunday morning when I woke up, I was supposed to go
to the gay pride parade I was supposed to have a book signing, I had a big day planned, and
Sunday morning when I woke up I saw the news of what
happened in Orlando, and it really struck a
chord, and it really hit me. I have never been so thrown or so torn up, or so deeply impacted by
something, as much as this. I didn't know these people. Obviously, there are
people out there that are much more personally affected by this, because these people are in their lives. But the thought of something
like this happening, between a creator in a fan
interaction environment, or during pride month,
to LGBTQ plus people where they feel most safe, these two things independently hit me, and all in one weekend, It
just felt like, I don't know. It really, it really fucked me up. And I think about the
people that lost their lives who had so much ahead of them, who were just celebrating life in a place where we should feel safe, and I think about other places
where we should feel safe that things like this have happened like preschools or churches, it boggles my mind, it boggles my mind. And so I think about all the people that might be watching this, or who might be seeing all
the news and feeling scared. I feel scared too. And that is why I just
feel like, you are magical, I love you, I think you're
valid, you're great, you're experience is worth living. I don't want you to
see this and feel like, you live in a world where
you can't be yourself. And I think about the
people that were killed, and how some of them
might have been closeted, and their friends and
their family are just now figuring out who they really were. Because they're seeing them on a list of people that
were shot at a gay bar. You know that I mean? Like that is so fucking unfair. And I just want, I don't know. I just wanted you to know
that I think you're great, and I think that you have an
incredible life ahead of you and you deserve to live that life. Being in this community. Being somebody who is in
the LGBTQ plus community is a fucking blessing. There is nothing wrong with you. It doesn't matter what
people might tell you. They may want you to the very core, think that you are terrible,
or that you need to change. They may want that from you. And they may do things
that are so despicable like literally kill people, just like us. But I want you to know that they're wrong, there's nothing wrong with you, and no violent act is gonna change that this life that we
are living is a blessing. And I always think about
rainbow road from Mario Kart and how that was one of the hardest levels when I was growing up, and
I always think it's like such a good little metaphor. That this little journey, this little route that
we are blessed to take as people in the LGBTQ plus community, nobody said it is gonna be easy. That's just, that is
the hand we were dealt on this specific planet okay? Like that is just how it's
really kinda gone down so far. We're here, we're doing it. LGBTQ plus people are
strong and resilient, and we're gonna make it through this, and we're gonna fucking change the world. We already have, we
will continue to do so. We're gonna keep showing up, we're still gonna go celebrate pride. We're not gonna go away. Straight people thank
you for supporting us, and amplifying our voices during this time when it's been really
challenging for donating blood, when you can, where you can. Because a lot of places, we are not able to give blood as gay men. Which is just another
thing, just another thing. Isn't it crazy that people in Orlando, who's best friends might
have just been shot, can't go donate blood to help save them. There are things that need to get fixed. There are things that need to get fixed, that's the point of this. So in the description,
I'm gonna put some links and some things that you can do. Because I feel like right now, I felt afterwards, I felt like, what am I supposed to be doing? Like what can I do? Like I feel like I should
be doing something. Whether you have one follower, or ten million followers, whatever. If you wanna get in
involved, I think you should. You can contact your government officials. You can tell them what's important to you. If that is LGBTQ plus rights, if that is gun control, if this is this or that
or whatever it might be, I think you have the power to do that. So yeah, I'm gonna put some
resources in the description. What I would like, is
for you to feel okay. Because I didn't on Sunday, I didn't. And I needed to grieve. If you are feeling this deep connection to whatever's going on, it's okay to grieve,
it's okay to take moment, and step back and take care of yourself. I really do feel like, If you can't take care of yourself first, you can't help others. You can't help the community. As much as I wanna help you guys, anybody that's LGBTQ plus, I can't do that unless
I'm making sure that I'm dealing with all of it too. Honestly it's helpful for me
to kind of articulate all this. My mom called me on Sunday and, (sighs) parents shouldn't have to call their kids to make sure they're alive. (sniff) Fuck. And shame, ooh! Shame on fucking politicians, who will offer thoughts and prayers, instead of actually doing something from their place of power. That's why we need to do something. If I were shot and killed, heaven forbid, and a politician that spent
their political career wanting me to not have rights and protecting the gun industry, instead of protecting people, if a politician that did those things offered my family thoughts and prayers, what a... just vile. You can offer thoughts and prayers, if that's what you wanna
do, but do something. With your place of power do something that's going to actually change, and prevent it from
happening to anybody else. That's what I think, that's what I think. You will not all agree with
me, but that's what I think. Okay. Okay, okay okay. Thank you for the kind words and for all of the love. But I truly believe we need
to actually do something. So all the links are gonna
be in the description. But that's all, okay I'm gonna go. I know there's things that
I've probably forgotten to say. That's all, okay I'll
talk to you guys soon. Goodbye. Okay, for real. Bye. 
(rhythmic electronic music) (pleasant piano music) - Y'all. (group laughing) Thanks for joining me today, I wanted to do a little
hangout brunchy moment and talk about all things queer. - Thank you for having us. - [Kat] Yeah. - It's good to be here. - My pleasure. In the center of the table
are a bunch of questions that anybody can feel free
to jump in and take one and pose it to the table. Hannah, give us a question. - Alright, let's get started. Oh, what is one misconception your friends or family have about your identity? That there's a man in my relationship, that one of us is more the
man in our relationship. But then also looking for a dynamic, like a power dynamic that they can gender. - To like fit into heteronormative. - Yeah. Like when I wear heels,
people are always like, what? But aren't you like the
man in the relationship? I'm like no, there is no
man in this relationship. - I think my family thinks that because I'm feminine, that
I'm always the bottom. - Does your family comment
on whose bottoming? - What about your family, King? - My parents are lesbians so I feel like I avoided that whole dynamic aspect of questioning my relationships
and like power roles. And with my extended
family, I'm not that close to like be having these conversations. - No? - So I don't know what they
think and I don't really care. (upbeat jazzy music) - Who is your pop diva? - [Tyler] Gaga. - I love this. - Janet. - Janet? - That was my first concert ever, Janet. - I love Janet and Janet
like birthed Britney. - Yes, tell the truth. (group laughing) - Tracy Chapman. - That's crunchy granola. - I'm crunchy granola, that's how I am. - You've got a fast car. - Describe your first kiss. - Awesome. - Heart racing. - Forgetful. - Forgetful? - I don't remember it. - I'll give you a good one. - Dylan give me a question. - A question? - A question.
- Okay. Wow.
- Oh god. - [Kat] Is it deep, is it heavy? - I hope it's fun and light. - It's fun and light, are you ready? - [Hannah] Yeah. - First inanimate object
you put inside you. - What?
- Oh my god. Oh my goodness, actually no,
I shouldn't tell that story. - Please.
- Yes, tell it! - See this is why I shouldn't
be allowed a platform because immediately as you're like, I'm like yeah, I'll just fucking tell you. - Go, I wanna hear it. - [Tyler] I'm like, I got
three in me right now. - I've got five stories, I
have a butt plug in right now. - [Hannah] Oh my god. - It's just such a bizarre story. So when I was younger, I
was very curious about, you know, sex.
- Orifices. - Orifices and what sex would be like. There were these toys
that we had at day camp, there was like this little seal toy, it was like a foam like toy. - A seal? - [Kat] No, it wasn't a
seal, it was an otter. - [Hannah] Oh, at least,
you know, you mate for life. - Long story short, I felt for a while that sex was just not a
thing I was interested in. What I thought sex felt
like was this terrible like foam otter thing that had like all these like kind of
like prickly ends on it. Yeah, I mean, that was the first thing I stuck inside of me,
I've never told anybody. - Is everyone clenching? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. (calm electronic music) - Cutest small thing someone
can do to show they care? - [Kat] Aw, that's adorable. - Ask you questions about you. And I feel like a lot of times, I've gone through so many conversations where people just don't
ask questions about you. - [Tyler] Right. - It's just like, great, I'll
go with what you're doing but that to me is like one of the biggest practices
of love and it's tiny. - I like when people notice small things. Like if you get a haircut or your eyebrows done, have a new shirt, they just notice that something
is different about you. - I think my number one thing is time. Just being able to be like oh, let's just hang out on the
couch for an hour and just chat. And like that to me is so
much better than if we were to do like a fancy dinner
or anything like that, like that to me is just time together. - Quality time. - What shows me you care. - Describe your coming out
experience in one word. I will start, unsurprising. - I think my one word would be relief. - Mine was awkward, my mom called me and asked me to just
say the words, I'm gay. And it was weird because
like in high school and prior to that moment
I had always talked about guys I thought were cute, like it was just a very casual thing. But she really wanted to hear those words, I guess just as a parent
to like vocally hear it from your child makes a difference. It was awkward for me. - This one is, do words have power and what words make you cringe? - For me, my like cringe word is pussy. I hate when people call somebody a pussy. - Same girl. - Oh my god, wait. - I can't even imagine saying it. - It's just so anti-woman. - Yeah, it's very misogynistic, I think things like
that do make me cringe, phrases like that that
really rely on misogyny. I hate when people try to act like words like are just words,
they don't mean anything. There's been a lot of conversations I've been having recently about slurs and there have been people
who say things like, well you know slurs are not the same thing as like someone physically
punching you or something. And it's like, yeah I get that, but oftentimes slurs
are like the last thing you hear before you're punched, you know? Words have been used to exert violence, especially against the
LGBTQIA plus community, so I feel like words
definitely have power. - I mean I'm trying to
figure this out right now with something that I'm working on, which is like how do you have
conversations with people who so firmly disagree
with you and even hate you but you want to know like
where's the human behind that? - Where's this coming from? - Almost practicing radical empathy, to be like you're a
human who just said this, you were taught to believe these things. I don't want to approve of
it but I want to know why, because knowing why,
it's not like knowing why will help me shut it down, because shutting it down
performatively online is not actually going to
make that all better, right? I think opening up,
asking people questions, saying why did you send me that message? Why did you call me that? Gives them the opportunity to be like oh, whoa, why did I do it? And then if they have an answer, it's continuing to interrogate. - Is there a part of queer culture that makes you uncomfortable? - I don't love that a
lot of social aspects of being gay, at least, are
rooted in like getting drunk. - Well speaking from my sober standpoint, I was very active obviously
in the drinking culture, and doing crystal meth, and doing blow. Now that I'm 10 years sober,
I'm not uncomfortable anymore but I will say I was just on
a flight to France this week and every single person on
the plane was drinking wine and it felt like I was in a gay bar, just the aroma, like the actions, the romanticism of drinking. I just find it challenging in
the early years of my sobriety but now that it's been some
time, I'm more willing, I just don't necessarily go to bars or I'll go for like an hour
and stay for a little bit and once everyone's on a different level of existence, then I'm out. - I would just like more safe queer spaces that aren't rooted in getting
fucked up in some capacity. - When I came out, I thought
I was going to leap off into a beautiful like foam
bed of like-minded people. I really learned quickly
that that was not the case, specifically as a queer
person of color, right? In so many gay spaces, and I
use the word gay, not queer, but like gay male spaces,
I have felt invisible for being an effeminate
queer man of color. You learn this thing that is unfortunately a part of so many
marginalized communities, which is a preference of
members of that community whose features, whose attitude most mimic that of the oppressor, right? There is a preference of light
skin in communities of color. In the queer community
I see a real preference for cis masculine white men and the further you are from that, the more invisible you are. - In the past few years, even, like I was an ignorant white kid from a Southern state and grew
up in a conservative family, Republican-ish, and like I
have said problematic things. It wasn't until Twitter
when I started following pretty much like 70% POC people, that I was like opening myself up to being like I am a problematic mess. And I learned so much about like, just terminology and how
to like open up a space and how I have privilege
and I am so grateful for the queer community and
for the queer POC community because it is teaching
me and educating me, which is not even their job to do, but they just do it by existing and I willingly follow and learn every day and I am so grateful for that. - Did anybody learn anything
about queerness in high school? At all?
- Nope, 0% - No. - I think there was
probably a small sentence that mentions Stonewall. - If that.
- If that. - No education about queer
history or like sexual health. There's no engaging in terms of like, A, like spectrum sexuality,
and B, like respect. I learned everything about
sex from erotic fanfic. - Same and I wrote my
own, too, I'll link you. - Wow.
- Same. - Dylan, give us one last question. - First queer crush. - Britney Spears was performing
Oops, I Did It Again, where she rips off her clothes. - Okay.
- Iconic. - And I felt physical arousal. Like I was like 13, I was like. Then I was like, then I was
like whoa, and it was so scary. - Nearly every single person on Degrassi, I had Craig, Jimmy, Spinner, Marco, I wanted them all to
have me at the same time. - Maybe Jonathan Taylor Thomas, I just wished that I
went to school with him and I wished that he would
confide in me that he was gay. - I used to really like have a thing for the guy who plays Hercules,
like I just wanted him. - The live action? - Yeah, the live action. - Kevin Sorbo. - That's funny because
I liked adult Simba. - Adult Simba.
- Adult Simba. - Which is a little problematic. - You didn't feel the love tonight? - I can feel the love tonight. Friends, colleagues. - [Hannah] Yay, family. - Family, thank you so
much for hanging today. For queer people, safe
spaces often are formed around who you choose to be around and that to me is my queer friends and the people that I can confide in and the people that I don't
have to explain myself. And having these open conversations is really important to me and I hope anybody watching can find
their own chosen family. Shut up, thank you, thank you, please like and subscribe. - Like and subscribe. - Thank you so much for
watching this video, I had so much fun with my friends, hanging out, talking
about all things queer. I feel like those types of safe spaces are where we learn and where we grow. So if you like this video, be
sure to give it a thumbs up, maybe I will do more
of these in the future. And let me know in the comments who you would wanna see
in a future round table. IF you want to support this week's cause, all you gotta do is get
one of these shirts, it is benefiting the
International Rescue Committee, which is helping all
refugees find more safety. Thank you so much for watching this video, I will see you guys very soon. 
- Hey everyone, my name is Tyler Oakley, and welcome to the Tyler Oakley Show. Today we have three time Grammy award winner Kelly Clarkson, everybody! How's life? - It's good, I'm so happy. - I just saw you in concert
for the first time last year. Kelly! (Tyler squeals) Oh my god! - Was I pregnant yet? - You, it was the show where
you announced your pregnancy. - [Kelly] Oh that was a rough-- - And you were literally like I don't know if I'm even allowed to say it up here and I immediately was like she's saying-- - I wasn't. My husband was like you can seriously not keep anything in, 'cause we hadn't told our whole family. - Oh my god! - And I just, I thought these people are gonna think I'm crazy 'cause I was so emotional and I just have like super duper pregnancy moments, like where everything is 100 times yeah-- - I was witnessing it first hand. - Yeah when you see me live, you probably saw this, I for some reason dial a rotary phone with my left hand. - Like this? - I, it's literally like who am I calling? - It's been 14 years since American Idol. - [Kelly] Yes. - Is that, is it mind boggling? - Hashtag old! - I, listen I was all
the way back there too. I was watching them. Do you have advice for who
you were then, nowadays? - Run! - [Tyler] Run? - Not kidding. (laughing) No I love my life now.
- It got you where you are-- - But my 20s were all broken roads. - But it got you here. - It did, it did. - All good things maybe. - It's a positive ending, but-- - Yeah I mean it's, I can't imagine a better situation now you have kids. - Well we have a 15, nine, two year old and five month old, so yeah. - What's it like to have-- - We're gonna start a band! - That going on, that's
borderline Hansen right there. - Right, it's like except
my two year old can't sing. - Is it just crazy every single day? - I'd say 99% of the time it's like yeah this is so magical,
then there's like that 1% where you're definitely crying. - I saw, oh gosh. I saw a picture on Twitter of you getting your eyebrows waxed while holding was it River Rose? And her face it's just-- - She was like, she
literally what you can't see is her go boo boo. - She's like don't do this. - She's like why are you
doing this to my mother? And I was like it's
what we do to be pretty! - Of course, somehow you have
found time to join Snapchat? - Oh my god I love it! I never have anything to do. - So you're just laying
there at all times. - They're like please,
you know social media is the key to the future and I'm like oh, like 'cause who cares? - Sometimes it's work, but
you actually like Snapchat. - I like it! - We're going to play a little game today where I'm going to witness
you doing this first hand. So the first one is a filter, so it's going to tell
you what filter to use. The second one is an action. And you have to do whatever
it says with this filter. - I'm so gonna epically fail this. - Are you ready?
- Yes. - Okay let's do this. - This is the action. - What do we got? - Give us a daily affirmation,
oh with what filter? Okay, silly nose slash lips with a friend. - Okay silly, okay. So we're getting in is that us? I think that might be it. We're beautiful. Affirmation.
- Oh my god. I look like Steven Tyler. (laughing) You are your own rainbow. - You are a stunning creature. - You're so beautiful every day. - A chosen human. - From Steven Tyler to you. - And this big ol' nose. - Wa ka ka ka ka! - What was that wa ka ka ka ka? - Steven Tyler ka ka ka ka! Are you serious? - I guess I'm unfamiliar. - Ah I'm so sad for you. - Well now I have to look it up, but now I'll only remember, that's gonna haunt my nightmares. - I did a photoshoot with him one time. He was like this close to my face, this side of my face and I was like this is the hottest moment of my life! Make up a personality for your filter. - Okay so then the filter--
- Make up a personality. - Will be. The bunny with a friend. - The bunny okay and we-- - That's easy. Hello.
- Hey where's my carrot? - I would like a carrot.
- Hi! - Give me the carrots. - Carrots everywhere. - Oh wait where'd they go? (yells) - We did that one! - I just, I felt you
getting ready to scream. I just love the thought
of everyone at home being like what are they up to? Frowning face with slow motion. - I love frowning face! - Okay. - Say the smartest thing
that comes to my mind, or comes to mind, well I'm
not smart 'cause I can't read. - Well only time will tell. - I am a published author. I don't know if you know this. I'm an intellectual. This is my intellectual-- - I'm a published author,
are we both smart? - We are both smart. - So smart.
- So smart. - Okay so now we also
need the slow filter. Are we both smart? - We're both smart. - Before we go, I gotta give some love to you being a published author. - I know, don't worry about it. - Congratulations. - I didn't plan on it, dream I didn't know I had, there you go. - Really? - I did I wrote these little
stories for my daughter. We were traveling and I literally
just wrote them for her, so when she started reading she could like see the pictures and the stories-- - That is like the sweetest thing. - And they, my husband and nanny were like you should make a story. - Let's just put this in Barnes and Noble. - That's what they, yeah, and I thought no one's gonna want that, but
apparently Harper Collins did. - The people want it, I want it. It'll be in stores right now. It'll be online also, so it'll be in the description below,
but congratulations. - And if you were confused
on whose book it was. - I saw the glamour shot on the back, I'm like why didn't my book have like the best picture of me? My next book I'm putting this. - Glamour shot! I'm just missing the fur
or the gold sparkly jacket. - I love it, thank you
so much for joining us. - Yeah thank you.

Hey everyone (laughter) I've been doing like eleven thousand different types of intros Because I'm like everything sounds weird So I was like 'what if I spin?' Yet...here we are. Did this make the cut? If so that was the best thing I could do So today I'm going to be answering a few of your questions, you guys sent them to me on twitter And I thought 'wow, what a bunch of great questions! I should probably answer them' Michael would like to know "what type of grouting is the best for the downstairs toilet?" Is this some type of sexual innuendo? Because if it is... Girl I can give you the best grouting for your downstairs toilet I don't know... I gotta go Sofia would like to know 'How was Jimmy Fallon?' One of my favorite things that happened while I was on Jimmy's show was we did a face swap And this is what happened: Tyler: Ahh! Jimmy: Alright stop. It's pretty good Tyler: That's horrifying Jimmy: No it's not. Look. (laughter) And if you want to see the interview and everything else that happened while I was on the show you can check the description below, It's gonna have links to my appearance, but it was so much fun I love doing talk shows. How cool are talk shows? Like the fact that I get to go because you guys watch my videos? That's a pretty cool thing. Funny story: I had never met Jimmy Fallon before I was on his show, but 4 years ago in 2012 He messaged me on twitter and said "met some pals of yours. You are loved" And I was never able to message him back and ask him what he meant because he didn't follow me at the time So I've always been like "What is he talking about? Who are these friends? What was going on that day in 2012?" And so after I was on his show when we cut to commercial I was like "P.S..." and I explained this all to him And he was like I have no clue what was going on or who I was talking about So you know if you know if you're that friend! If you were the one talking to Jimmy Fallon 4 years ago Thanks for expressing your love for me Jess would like to know 'what do you recommend on Audible this month? I've just finished your audio book and I need something else' Jess, good job listening to my audio book, I highly recommend that, but if you just finished mine I would now recommend 'Grace and Style' by the one and only Grace Helbig She is iconic.

A cat with a purple wig or a pig with a purple hat?' I don't....know?! Um...I think I'm gonna have to consult 'Grace and Style' to see what's more in. I'll get back to you on that. Liz would like to know 'Are you aware of Nyle DiMarco?" I am....so aware of Nyle DiMarco! He is SO fine! He was on 'America's Next Top Model'. He won, and currently he's on 'Dancing with the Stars'. He's SO hot! I would spend the rest of my life with him. Jamel would like to know 'What is the one thing you would grab if your house was on fire?' Nyle DiMarco. Sorry I'm not sorry. Babs would like to know 'Who is your next collab?' I just crossed somebody off my bucket list of people that I wanted to collab with. One of the original YouTubers of all time, Phil DeFranco ...I feel like I just called you really old, Phil...sorry 'bout that. We got together, and we filmed a video for his series, called 'This Week On Fire'. You can click right here if you wanna watch it, or it's gonna be in the description below.

And be sure, if you go watch it, to comment in the comments of that video that I sent you, and that you love Phil and that's all and yeah. Give it some love. V-Ron says 'Quick! A zombie apocalypse has started! The thing to your right is your weapon!' I don't know how useful this is gonna be during the zombie a- ahhhh! Jesus! (laughter) Just imagine me, like, floating down the river while the entire shoreline is lined with zombies. I'm just on this little flamingo being like "Hey, y'aaaalll!" There is no way I'm surviving the zombie apocalypse. Liza would like to know 'Do you know any Russian words?' Oh, I know TONS of Russian words. Speedy....Quickly.....Hasty....Fast. Uhhhhh....zzz.....Zippity (laughter) I don't know! That's all I know. Get it? Russian? Like, quick, like you're rushiiiiing? No? Ok. Macey says "If you had to be any historical figure, who would you be and why?" Now, my answer is Gustave Le Bon and not for any reason about who he was as a human because I've read that he's like actually a terrible human. But! There's one thing that I really liked about him. I read that, in the 1800's, he would always have these, like, dinner parties. with all of his friends, and all these people, and, like, he would host them, and then, anytime somebody had, like, a bad opinion that he didn't agree with, he would, like, ding this huge bell! During dinner! Until they shut up with their dumb opinion! And I'm like 'How amazing and iconic would that be?' "Oh, Donald Trump is the best possible candidate for the presidency!" "Biiiiitch?!?!" DING DING DING DING DING! "Oh, white privilege does not exist." "Biiiiitch?!?!" DING DING DING DING DING! "Oh, Carly Rae Jepsen didn't have the best pop album of 2015." "Biiiiitch?!?!"

- Hey everyone, my name is Tyler Oakley and I am here with Adam Rippon. He is an ice skater and he is incredible. And I am going to the Olympics
this year, did you know? - Me too. - Oh my God! I just felt like, what
better way to prepare for the Olympics since
I'm going this year, than to hang out with an Olympian himself and learn his thing? (Adam laughs) Ice skating? So today, Adam is gonna
teach me how to skate. It's been years since I've hit the ice. I'm a little nervous. - I think you're gonna rock this. - Bitch... - No, you've got the skater's body, (Tyler gasps) skater's mentality,
(Tyler sighs) you're destined for great things. - Thanks, babe.
- Yeah. - Let's go. (suspenseful string music) (suspenseful string music) - Look at us. - Look at you. - No, look at you. - I know. - No honestly, look at me. (Adam laughs) - [Adam] No, you're doing so well. How do they feel? - They kinda feel like what
I've always been missing. (Adam laughs) You know? - Yeah. And it's like, when you
start losing the feeling in your feet, you realize,
"I didn't need them." - Feet? - My feet, yeah.
- Oh. (both laughing) - Do you wanna do like a two foot spin? I feel like you could do that. So you're just gonna be right here. Yeah, and you're just
gonna march in a circle like this and then you'll
just pull your arms in. (both laughing) Prayer position. If you start out here, right,
and you're just gonna like march in a circle, and once
you kinda get some momentum, you'll pull your arms in like this. Oh, damn. (Tyler laughs) Kwan? - Wait who? - Michelle Kwan! (Adam laughs) - Who did you look up to when
you were growing up, skaters? - Oh, I loved me some Michelle Kwan. - Yeah. - How can you not? - What about Tonya Harding? - I mean...she's rough around the edges. (Tyler yells) I am too. (Tyler yelps) Oh shit. - I'm really dizzy though. - Are you really? - That is a lot. Don't you have to like-- - No, usually I just kind of like-- I'll like focus, just kinda down. - I'm real dizzy. My vertigo! - (laughs) I believe you. - So it's a pretty big deal that you are, what is the official title, the first openly gay
Winter Olympic Athlete? - Yes. - Damn, I nailed it. How does that feel? - You know what, I'm really proud to be the first, but
honestly it feels so weird. It's 2018. It's so hard to think that I'm the first openly gay winter athlete. - Are you on Grindr? - Well (scoffs) of course I've been on it, I don't have it now. - Of course I've--are you a torso? - Yeah, well, yeah. - You don't show your face? - Well I didn't, 'cause
I was like, I don't want anyone to know that it's me. - Yeah, that's why you
don't show your face. - Right. - I get that. As a gay, do you feel like you experience more challenges in the sport
than people that are straight? - I think my challenges
are just different. - 'Cause like, you think super sporty shit is like super hypermasculine, but then-- - Yes. - Stuff like this, it might
be inverse in different ways. - Well, I think in this
sport in particular, that it's sort of like an
eye roll, you're like, "Of course you're gay,
you're a figure skater." And I'm like, well. - Well? (both laughing) - You have a point. And I think for so long,
you try not to be that, and you're really
embraced when you're not, because you're different, and it's great, and not everybody is
gay in figure skating. Man, maybe I wouldn't
be fuckin' single then. Yeah, I think my struggles
have been different and I think a lot of times
you wanna be something else, you wanna be that
all-American sort of athlete. I mean, now that I'm older, I
now see it on a larger scale, and it kind of feels like
more than just me skating, that it's like a bigger
platform for me to show who I am and that you can be successful. - Live your damn life. - Yeah, exactly. - And succeed. - Yeah. For me, at least, it's really
important that I'm open and share who I am, because I remember being that really young kid
who didn't know who they were and didn't really have
anybody to look up to. I'm from a really small
town in Pennsylvania, and I kinda wanted to be
that voice that, you know, you don't have to hide who you are, you can be who you are,
and you can be successful, and you can be really good at what you do, and people will still embrace you for the work that you've put in. I'm actually really impressed. (Tyler yelps) I think you can try backwards. - No, okay well show me. My one cold hand. - (laughs) This one's a quite warm-- we're doing warm to warm, cold to cold. - We should've thought that through. - We didn't. Okay, so now turn. - Mhm. - Okay. - Well, that's 'cause you push me. - You got it, though. - Hello (yells). - Okay, good. So just kinda shake
your butt a little bit. (Tyler laughs) Oh, this isn't your first rodeo. (both laughing) Look, our grip is
loosening, cause you're-- (both laughing) - How do you speed up to go backwards? You're just pushing me. - I'm not, though. You're pulling me. You're a puller. (both laughing) I'm actually just stationary. - You're not. - I am. - Wow. - Yeah, you have a lot of
strength that you didn't know-- inner strength. - You are definitely pushing me. - Now I'm pushing you. (Tyler laughs) I'm pushing you to be
better than you were before. (Tyler yelps) And look. - No. (both laughing) (Tyler gasps, sighs) Thank you. Where are you from? - Scranton, Pennsylvania. Greatest city in the world. - (laughs) Office. - Yeah. - And you. - And me, and Joe Biden. - Speaking of vice presidents... - I'm in a current war with Michael Pence. When he was just a lad from Indiana, he was trying to fund
gay conversion therapy. And I was asked how did I feel on him leading the delegation. And I said, you know, we're
talking about Mike Pence, the same guy that tried to
fund conversion therapy. And me as a gay man, I'm not gonna go out of my way to
try to meet Mike Pence. Mike Pence actually had
someone from his office, the office of the Vice President, say that the allegations I was making are completely false and untrue, but in spite of that he's still excited to go to the Olympics. - Cool. - And that's great, baby,
thank you, can't wait. - You know what I love? I just feel like you
embrace you on the ice. - [Adam] I do, yeah. - Like you bring the fire, I was watching out there, and you were
like, feeling your damn self. Are you gonna do that in South Korea? - Hundred percent. - I love that. - You know what, I think
that when I came out, and I really started to embrace myself, and I got way more confident,
sort of like you right now. (Adam laughs) But that's like when my
career started to take off, a little later in life. - When you lean in to what makes you you. - Yes. - That totally makes sense. I feel like anybody out there
that is doing their thing, when they embrace what makes
them an individual about it. - Yes. And when you have four minutes to show the judges who you are, if you don't know who you are
how are you gonna do that? - Have you ever been told,
"You have to tone it down?" - Yeah, I've been told to tone it down. Now, my response is, "What do you mean?" - Tone what down? - Tone what down? (Tyler laughs) I want details, show me the receipts. - You're like, give me details of what I need to tone
down, and then you turn each and every one of those up. - Oh, like-- (both laughing) When I was young, I would
take it so personally that it was an attack on who I was. - Well, it is. - I mean, yes. And now I take it as fuel. Fossil fuels, if you will. (Tyler laughs) Being who you are is one of
the best feelings in the world. It's so liberating, and it
gives you a lot of confidence to be who you are and and not really care what other people think. - Yeah. - What I love about
being involved in sports, is that you're judged on the
hard work that you put in. And everything else
should be put on the side, and shouldn't matter. So if you do work hard,
you really can do anything. There've been so many
times where I've wanted to take my skates, walk
to the nearest trash can, lightly put them in, and
be like, "It's over." - No. - And I'm so glad I didn't. - Right. - Because I just gave myself that chance to make mistakes, and I
think so often you're afraid to make mistakes, and once
I told myself, it's okay, the ice is slippery, life is hard, but if you don't try,
you'll never succeed. So I would say, give
yourself a chance, and try. Set goals and work really hard. (upbeat techno music) (upbeat techno music) (upbeat techno music) (upbeat techno music) (upbeat techno music) - That was so much fun, thank you Adam! - Oh my God, thanks for coming. - Of course. If you guys wanna follow Adam, you should follow him on
Twitter, Instagram, everywhere? - Yeah, everywhere. - Imma put the links in the description. I can't wait to root
for you at the Olympics. - Oh, I can't wait for us to go together. - Babe. It's gonna be so much fun. I wanna know, what is
y'all's favorite sport to watch at the Olympics? I feel like I found my favorite, I truly-- - I think you've always
known what your favorite is. - I didn't know but now I know. - Yeah. - Now I know. - Let me know in the comments, I wanna see what you guys are excited for, and be sure to give this video
a thumbs up if you love it. And that's all! I'll see you guys soon, bye! 
- Hey everyone. My name is Tyler Oakley
and today I was think about how often I get to really cool things which I'm very happy and grateful for but what I don't like is that y'all can't go on these
adventures with me. So I decided to do a little video that's kind of like a day in the life, but it's a couple days of my life, of fun things that I got to do this week. So there's two things I want to show you. The first thing, if you follow
me on Twitter or anywhere, you'll know that I am
obsessed with my podcast. I've been doing it for over two years now with my best buddy Korey
and now we have a whole set that goes with the podcast, but I feel like you guys should
come see what it looks like. So, here is a little day
of filming the podcast. (slow pop music) So we're here at the podcast. We're about to record on our new set. Isn't it beautiful? Say hi Korey. - Hi Korey. - So we already just recorded an episode. It was for Korey's birthday. (laughing) - [Korey] Does that say 50? - [Tyler] 51. (slow pop music) Good morning Corey. - Why are not saying it? You're holding the holding
the longest breath. - That's me. - [Korey] I see a crown over there. Who's that for? - This is for me. So that you can read happy
birthday the whole time. (laughing) Here we are on set for the
podcast and now we have a set. Before we just had like a tiny little room and because it's visual now, we were like, "We want it to be cute." So when we told them what
we wanted it to look like, we said, "Something like
silver daddy, loungey." This is the fireplace. It's a screen with like a fire, kind of like it's not a real fire. And then every episode there's a new picture with
us photoshopped in it. (laughs) That has been the funniest thing. We wanted like old,
renaissancey medieval paintings, but with us in them. Over here we have a little bar set up. So if anybody, if it's a guest comes on and they wanna get fucked
up, they can get fucked up. And then look at this
little montage of pictures, but I love this because that's the tattoo Korey and I both have and so it's like a little cute
thing between the two of us. So if you wanna listen to the podcast, you can still do it on
iTunes and Soundcloud just like normal, but
if you wanna watch it, you can get the Fullscreen app. I'm gonna put the details about how you can get one month
free in the description below. But yeah, it is one of the
most fun things Corey and I do every week and I am so excited that it's now turned
into something this big. It's been so much fun. Thank you for listening. Thank you for watching
now and yeah, that's all. How cute is the set for Psycho Babble? I am obsessed with it. Thank you for supporting the podcast. I feel like I am the
luckiest boy in the world, because I get to do that
fun thing with my bestie. How fun. And the other cool thing that
I wanted to show you guys this week was a little
interview I got to do with somebody who I
have always looked up to who's interview skills I
admire and I would love to even have a tenth of the
talent of what he's able to do. So to be interviewed by him was just crazy and mind-boggling. So this is what happened. (relaxing music) So I am here backstage at Larry King Now and I'm about to go on and get interviewed by
Larry King which is crazy. He's like an actual legend icon. The room is like filled with
pictures of his legendary, iconic guests that he's had in the past. So there's like the Dalai Lama and Oprah and then now there's me (laughs). So I'm nervous and excited. It's about to happen. Hello. - [Larry] Tyler Oakley. - [Tyler] Hi. - Hi Tyler.
- Nice to meet you. - Grab a chair. - Thank you so much for having me. - [Man] And Larry. - Welcome to Larry King Now. We've looked forward to this. Tyler Okaley. How did all this start? - Oh my goodness. Well I, back in the day, this
is my tenth year of Youtube. (upbeat pop music) (laughing) - Now plaids, I got that (laughs). (upbeat pop music) I am still freaking out. That was the coolest
thing and I went to dinner with Larry on Friday night. The stories he told me. He has been working in
the industry for 60 years and he has literally interviewed everyone so I just felt so honored and lucky to now be friends with him. That's so weird. That's bizarre. So Larry, if you're watching, thanks. So if you want to watch the full video of Larry interviewing me, it'll be below. He made me blush a few
times so I feel like he was asking me things that I
have never been asked before. If you want more videos like
this where I am showing you what I actually do in my
day to day, let me know. Give this video a thumbs
up and maybe I'll do more. If you want to be my person
of the week, click right here. If you wanna hear my latest
podcast, click right here. If you wanna see my latest
video, click right here. I really like it. It's
me doing a vision board. I think you guys will like it too. Okay, so that is all I
have for you guys today. I hope you have a good life. I will talk to you guys soon. That's all, okay. Love you. Bye. Hi everyone. 
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready. (Tyler laughs) Are you ready?
- Are you ready? - (whispers) What's he going to tell us? - Hi, everyone! My name is Tyler Oakley,
and I am here with the one and only Janet Mock. - Hi! - How are you? - I'm good, I get to be here with you. - Calm down, shush. (Janet laughs) So for the people at home
who might not know you, describe yourself in three words. - Oh my god, that's really hard. - You started with "Oh my
god," that's it. (laughs) - Oh my god, there it is. - Tell the people at home what you do. - I'm a writer. - Work. - I tell stories largely about feminism, about gender, about trans rights,
about all of the things. My new book, Surpassing Certainty, is about my twenties, about the experience in my life where I really took the time
to concentrate on myself before thinking about advocating or helping anyone else. - I love that. I can't wait to read it. (Janet claps) It's adorable, the cover is beautiful. Look at this. Look at us. (both laugh) - Tickle the cover! - And it's available on Audible. Thank you, Audible for
sponsoring this video. You can get it on Audible, If you use Audible.com/TylerOakley, you can get your first book free. I would obviously get this book, or your first book's out on Audible, too. - It is. - So you have options. There's no excuse. You can get that or any other title if you use Audible.com/TylerOakley, you get your first 30 days free. Again, go support Janet Mock. Iconic, beautiful, stunning, hilarious, et cetera. So today I wanted to chat with you, because I look up to you in so many ways and I learn from you in so many ways, about ways to be a better ally. Because I feel like there's
no better way to learn than to hear it from the person you want to be an ally to themselves. So let's chat. - Yes. - What are some ways that
you think people can be better and more helpful and
use their privilege for good for the trans community? - I think that one of
the most important things is a recognition is that ally is not a noun, right? It's not something that
you put on a bumper sticker or on a button or you
like wave a flag for. It is an action, it is a verb. It's something that
involves you taking your education upon yourself
and using that education to check and challenge the spaces in the conversations that you're engaged in. - And it's not like you are that, like once you did something, it's like you have to keep doing that. - And also, the part of keep doing it is you're taking a risk and
you're being vulnerable and you're putting yourself out there. And then the next layer
of that is to realize that the people that you're
looking to partner with are not the folk who have to educate you about their experience. You need to take that work and do that education on your own. You have Google. - Or Bing! Ask Jeeves! (both laugh) - You don't want as a partner or an ally to marginalize folk you
don't want to go and make them do that work for you. You don't want to make them have to do the one on one work for you
because then it takes away their resources and their
time to do the work that they need to do to work toward their own liberation and freedom. Another great point is,
too, that being a partner and an ally looks so many different ways. You can donate your time. You can donate your resources. You can signal boost. You can show up to protests. You can help people who are protesting by bringing pizzas. - I love that! - There's so many ways
that we can be useful. - That is the cool
thing about the Internet is that there are many different ways for you to find your outlet. Like you don't have to be a YouTuber. You don't have to have podcast. You don't have to be a writer. But find what you do,
and if there are ways to infiltrate that with
goodness for the world of being a voice or an amplifier of voices within your own little world, it's just finding ways that
you can be a better ally with however you are in the world. - I think a big thing, too,
that we have this thing called call-out culture, in the sense of people love to find a moment
when someone has messed up and hold them accountable to
that moment forever and ever and not see that they've
changed and evolved and grown. And so I think that
accountability is great, but I think that we also have to learn a sense of kindess, I
think, and compassion. That we're all individuals
who are having a human experience, that
are going to mess up, and all that stuff. - Are there specific things,
if somebody wants to be a better ally to trans people, that should just be no-brainer stuff? - Yeah, so I can list
them off really quickly. One is to realize that
all of us have our own gender identities and sexual orientations that we all come to that. Number two is that we
should not expect people to come out to them or explain themselves. Number three is to
respect people's privacy. Four is just to have some kind of tact, to be respectful in the sense of, don't ask people about their bodies and their medical histories. - Like you wouldn't ask
anybody that, right? - You shouldn't, right? Because we have to recognize
that people's bodies and their identities are their own. They're not there to satiate or to satisfy our grandest curiosities. Again, you can go to Google and search all of the surgeries
that you want to search. Look at all of the bodies
that you want to search for. - (laughs) If that's
your MO, you can do that. I'll put all the links
in the description below. People to follow,
organizations to support, any ways that you can get involved, because having those
voices on your timeline really does change how you think. - And it's really powerful
to have these people in your lives every
single day in this space, especially like, for a lot
of folk, there's a sense of, that most people don't
know a trans person. So what the Internet
does so well is that it enables you to know trans people on so many different levels. - How important are pronouns especially with not misgendering people? Because a lot of people are
like, oh what's the big deal? - Because gender is such
a building block for the ways in which we
categorize and interact with one another, pronouns become one of the first things that people
make assumptions about, about all of us. You see someone with
short hair, you assume that they're a man. - Without even thinking, like that's just how your brain works. - Exactly, and so to
know, to recognize that we all make these
assumptions every single day and so one of the greatest
things that we can do in an interpersonal space
when we introduce ourselves is to say, "I'm Janet, and
I use she and her pronouns." - God bless. I'm Tyler, I use he/him pronouns. - See, and so then you
set the tone in that way. And so it's a great kind
of situation where you're not expecting the person that you're introducing yourself to,
to tell you that stuff. Instead, you put yourself
in that space to say even though I may be a cisgender person, that I'm going to make
myself vulnerable enough to pronounce and proclaim
who I know myself to be. A lot of our people are not
heard in the ways in which we're able to be heard, and so, I feel really lucky and blessed that I get to do this work. - Well, I appreciate
that you're in the world. I appreciate the work that you do. Where can people find you? - They can find me on Twitter,
Instagram, and Facebook. At Janet Mock! - I'll put all the links below. Become her friend, follow her on Twitter, get the books, listen to the podcast, you will fall in love. If you've never met Janet before, have Janet all over your timelines. You will love her, that's all. - Aw, thank you Tyler. - Of course. Thank you for hanging out today. Thank you sharing your wisdom. - Thank you for having me. - We love ya. - I love you, too. - Shush up! Okay, we'll see you guys later. Bye, friends! - Bye! 
- Hey, everyone. My name is Tyler Oakley, and welcome to the Tyler Oakley Show. Today we have the already hilarious Kellie Pickler, everybody. (audience cheers) - Welcome, how are you?
- Thanks, I'm great. How are you? - I am splendid. You came in here like
a tornado of happiness. I was like, oh my God, what a queen. - Spread the love. - Spreading the love,
I have been surrounded by so many country queens. - Oh, yeah? - I met Carrie Underwood,
Kacey Musgraves, and now you. - I'm in some good company. - Yeah, who would you geek out over? - Dolly Parton, that was a big deal because I grew up on her music. - I went to Dollywood. - You did, did you love it? When'd you go? - I was 12 years old, I had a bowl cut-- - Oh yeah, we all did! (laughs) I had a bowl cut. So you're like a roller coaster rider?
- We did it all. - Are you an adrenaline junky like I am?
- I am, are you? - Oh, absolutely, you give me
a plane, I'll jump out of it. - You did just go to Japan. - Yes. - Did you do any adrenaline things there? - Um, we had a lot of sake. Sometimes that'll get it goin'. (laughs) But no, we had the best time. We got to stay with locals there. - Will I be able to see the
Japan adventure on your show? - [Kellie] Yes. - I went to Japan five
years ago, or something. - [Kellie] Oh, you did? - I did the whole shebang, I did karaoke-- - Oh, yeah, we did the karaoke, too. - What's your go to karaoke song? - Oh my gosh, well we busted
out some Meghan Trainor, and some Taylor Swift. I tried to find songs
that were in the catalog that were in english, 'cause my Japanese I'm not very fluent. - No? Did you learn any? - I did. - What do you know? - Konnichi wa, which is hello. And the most important is kanpai. - Oh, that's cheers.
- Which is cheers, yeah. (laughs)
- I know that one. Between the Japan trip, and your show, and you just living your
life to the fullest, I feel like you need to take a spa day. - Are we gonna have a spay day? - We're gonna have a little spa day. (relaxing music) (sighs) So, we have a bunch of things that we have collected over the
years on the Ellen Show. - Little contraptions over here. - Contraptions. - [Kelly] What is that? Fun, it says fun. Fundies?
- I don't know what these are. Fundies, underwear? - I just saw fun, and I thought, it looks like a good time to me. Fundies, the underwear built for two. - Oh my God, ooh. (laughs)
- Twi-- (laughs) Half the fun is gettin' in 'em. The other half is up to you. (laughs) - Could you see the situation. - Whoa, there's so many holes. - Thank you. - Which way? (laughs) Ladies first? - Yeah, you go in. - Okay, hold on. Let's see if we can make this work, here. - Can I help you in any capacity? - Oh my God, I need more than help. - Oh. (laughs) - I might need a cocktail. - Okay, so I'm going in also?
- So, then you go there. - Oh, goodness gracious. - [Kelly] Oh, Jesus,
my husband's backstage, he's probably--
- I'm gay. I'm not making a move. (laughs) Oh my...
- I don't know if I've got enough coverage back here.
- This is it. - Yeah, look at us go. - So, if you need a pair-- - And now what? - Now we're just havin' fun. (laughs) - Now we just, where's my cocktail? Where did you find this (bleep)? - In the box. - What's Ellen got y'all up to? - Take those home for... - Okay, what are these, underwear hands? (laughs)
Handerpants. - You just love all the underwear. - Let's see what is...
- What is this? - I don't know. - Um, oh. - Whoa, you be careful. (laughs) You got blue balls on your...
- Oh, thank you. Mm, not the first time, not the last. Edit it out. Can you feel that? - Oh, yeah, I'll give
you 30 minutes to stop. (laughs) Koala. - Koala. - Koala hydrating mask sheets. - Are you ready? - Oh, I'm ready. Was born ready, baby. (giggles) - Oh, oh, oh, this is a... - Do I look intimidating? - Sunsation. You look incredible. (laughs)
- It is refreshing. - You've never looked better. - It's actually really refreshing. - This is actually quite nice. - [Kellie] Yeah. - You guys, we gotta
go live our best lives. - Yes. - Thank you for joining us. (laughs) Bye, everyone. - [Kellie] You never been to Nashville? - [Tyler] Never. - [Kellie] You have to come, and I'll take you honky-tonkin'. - [Tyler] What is honky-tonking? - [Kellie] Oh my gosh, I'm
gonna break you in real. 
- Hey everyone, my name is Tyler Oakley and welcome to The Tyler Oakley Show. I am joined today by seven time Grammy award winner, Carrie Underwood, everybody. - Hi! (audience applauds) - I saw you last night in concert. It was everything. I was going through all
my Tweets to see all the things that I've said
about you from all the time that I've loved you and I
wanted to show you this one. - [Carrie] "My updated Lady Marmalade." "Gaga, Robyn, Nicki, Carrie, Beyonce." - If you could recast Lady Marmalade, who would you want in that? - Maybe Ariana Grande. - Okay. - Who are the kids
listening to these days? (laughs) (upbeat music) - Obviously, we need to
celebrate your new single. It's called Dirty Laundry. - I like to fold things. - I've put like a good... Oh, well then you are in luck. - Yeah, okay. - Each item has a question
attached and we'll go back and forth and maybe learn
each other's dirty laundry. You pick one first. - Go for that, ooh. - Oh God, Ellen underwear. - Straight for the undies. "If you could trade places with "anyone in the world, who would it be?" I would like to be one of my dogs. (dogs barking) They get to sleep in the big beds. - [Tyler] Thou art the dream. - [Carrie] And kinda lay around all day. - While you're doing 30 songs in a row. "Have you ever made out with a fan?" (laughs) You know, I don't know. (laughs) I would hope that anybody that I... - I don't know? - I would hope that
anybody that I enjoy... - This is a diplomatic answer. - Adult time with would
be a fan of my passions. - Yeah. (laughs) - So, same question to you. Wouldn't you hope that your
husband is a fan of you? - Yeah.
- Then there you go. - No, he was. I met him in a meet and greet. Yeah. - You just made out like
a bandit on that one. - Yeah, I did.
- That's great. Okay, next one.
- Made out. (laughs) (drums) "Who is your celebrity crush?" - Ooh. - Other than my husband. - Yeah. - Chris Pine. - Ooh. - Like, I don't ever wanna
meet him because he is a crush. You know what I mean? - Right, it would change the dynamic. - Just stay pretty on my screens. (laughs) - From a distance. - Yeah. - You know who I think is so adorable? Nick Jonas or Joe Jonas. They're both handsome men. - Yeah. - Yeah, have you met them? - Yes, Nick saved me
from bouncy balls at a... This is so weird. - Tell me everything, now I need to know. - Remember those giant blowup
balls that people have? - Was one coming at you? (laughs)
- They were everywhere. I forget what award show it was, confetti like showering over the audience. - Oh, they were coming
down from the cart, okay. - Yeah, you're just like,
"No, like please don't!" - [Tyler] And Nick Jonas saved your life? - He saved my life. - Wow.
- Saved my face. - That would be my Twitter bio. - Yeah. - If that had happened to me. - Yeah.
(laughs) - [Both] Nick Jonas saved my life. - "Do you ever go commando?" Never. - No.
- No. - No, I have shorts on
underneath everything I wear. - Oh, really?
- Yes. - Well, I was wondering
'cause your tour outfits. - I have shorts on right
now under this, yeah. - I was like, she's like
twirlin' and prancin'. - Yeah, I will not have
a wardrobe malfunction. - I was positive nothing
was gonna happen, but... - I was like that, I hope I never have a wardrobe malfunction. - Fingers crossed. - But of that magnitude, no. - Got it, okay. - No. - Thank you so much for joining me. - Thank you.
- This was so much fun. Congrats on the tour and
congrats on your life. - I fold better than you do. - Listen, I'll get to this. (laughs) I'll fix all of this. If you guys are at home,

- Hey everyone, my name is Tyler Oakley and I'm here with Hannah Hart! - Yay it's me!
- Hannah? - Tyler? - This is gonna be the end of our lives. - This is the end of
our friendship for sure. - So today, to celebrate Halloween we are here at Universal Studios Hollywood Halloween Horror Nights. Are you afraid of anything? - Everything, I don't do this stuff! - But like specifically, like clowns? - Yes. - Chainsaw?
- Yeah! - A Trump supporter?
- Yes! - All of the above are inside right now. Hannah's here to promote her book. It's the best thing
ever, what's it called? - Buffering: Unshared Tales
of a Life Fully Loaded. - You know, Hannah, I think the only thing scarier than not having
the book is what's inside. Are you ready? - I'm not at all ready. - Let's do this. I don't like it already. - I don't like this at all. It's okay, what if he's real? - This is fine. (screaming) (laughing) (bleeping) I'm sorry, I didn't mean to. - I can't see anything! Okay. - Okay, we're good. (screaming) No! - Tyler, stop saying we're good. You're jinxing us! - I don't like them. - I don't like any of this. Oh my god! Oh my god! (yelling) - I'm over that. - I don't want to see it. Thank you for your time. Great gig. - It's loud.
- Okay, okay! - It's so loud! (yelling) It's fine, that's fine, you're fine. - Oh my god, get some Winterfresh. Oh, oh this is nice. - This is fine. This is fine, this is fine! There's nothing in
here, it's just a swamp. I hate it. - I hate it so much. - I hate it, I hate it. - Taking a stroll, are you a person? - Hello! - Oh my god!
- Oh my god. (screaming) Don't run backwards! - Other way, the other way,
the other way, the other way. Hello, goodbye. I hate this. I will actively-- - Okay not surprised. - Did you just hear that? - That's okay.
- This is fine. (screaming) Thank you, goodbye, thank you! Okay we're good, we're good,
we're good, we're good. Hannah Hart, we're good, we're good, no. (screaming) - What's that, is that children singing? There's nothing worse than children-- (screaming) - No! They should be chained, okay, you're done. I don't look at her. That's gonna be something. - No it can't be! - That's a mirror. - It's a mirror! - That's a mirror,
that's, they're gonna be-- (screaming) - [Masked Man] Welcome to my nightmare. - [Hannah] So far so good. - We're good. Again-- (screaming) Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Sorry, okay, he's behind a thing. He's behind a thing. Okay we're good, we're good, we're good. Was I just like-- (screaming) Your hand, well I'll just be-- (screaming) You're, we've had enough of you. (yells) - I knew he was there! - That is a--

(screaming) Done, done, oh my god, okay we're good, we're good, we're good. We're good. - Oh what up, what up? - That's a, that's much. (screaming) (laughs) Okay, thank you. - Thank you, thank you very... - We did it, we did it. Is this the end? Oh my god.
- Oh thank god. - I hated everything about it. - I've never been so happy to be outside.
- My throat. Hi. Hi. Okay! - I'd say thank you so much for having me, but I just don't feel that way. - That's okay. If you guys like this video-- (distant shrieking) I don't. If you like this video,
give it a thumbs up and go get Hannah's book. Okay love you guys, bye. - Bye! (electricity buzzes) 
- Hey everyone! My name is Tyler Oakley
and here are some of my favorite obsessions. Let's just go through 'em. alyssa wants to know, "What
is my current favorite song?" I am really liking 11 Blocks. I think it's by Wrabel or Wrabel? I don't know how to pronounce it. If you know, let me know,
but it's really good! If you wanna listen to it,
the link will be below. I'll link you to my Spotify. "What Starbucks drink
are you obsessed with?" I am obviously very into my iced red eye, which is coffee with
two shots of espresso, with two splendas and a
little bit of skim milk and light ice because I am obnoxious. And you can tell that I love it so much because I am almost done with it. It's so good. mandi says, "Are you currently
obsessed with any TV shows?" I am almost all caught up
with Orange is the New Black. Okay, I know I'm like forever behind, but I'm about to finish the last season. This most recent season just came out and I'm not even on that yet. I'm very slow. maggie says, "Favorite
song from Hamilton?" I can't pick just one, so
if I had to pick a few, Helpless is so good, Wait
For It is incredible, but I think my favorite
song would have to be Burn. It's like, oh my god, it's gut-wrenching. If you like musical theater, and you haven't given Hamilton a chance, I don't know where you've been, go listen to it and hopefully go see it. I got to go see it and it
was the best thing ever. I even got to meet Lin, can you imagine? It was incredible. sarah says, "What is
your current favorite app on your phone?" This is so easy for me. So, you guys know Matt
from the Amazing Race? He made a video, sponsored by Best Fiends. When you see a sponsor, you're like, "Is this really a good thing?" But then, I downloaded the game, and I literally was playing
it all 4th of July weekend. I am literally so obsessed with it that I'm now on level 58, I
can't stop playing it. And then I tweeted at them and I was like, "Oh my god, why are you so addicting?" And then they were like,
"We wanna sponsor a video." So thank you to Best Fiends
for sponsoring this video. So basically, I'mma lay it down for you. Best Fiends is like this
puzzle adventure game. You start all the way
down here at the bottom, then you level all the way up, and I have leveled up a lot so far, and then you get all the way right here. This is my current level, and then you choose your little team, and then you press start. You line up these things, and then it breaks these things, and then you use this, and then there's a bomb over here that I'm trying to explode but sometimes it's kinda hard to get the bomb. You see that evil slug at the top? This one has ice all
over it, it seems evil. I'mma kill it, watch. So basically you build up your team, you kill the evil slugs, and if you know me you saw that picture years ago when
I visited Zoella's home, I was holding a slug and
terrified for my life, I am here to kill the evil slugs. If you get the app, which you should, 'cause I wanna know updates of
you guys playing it with me, there is gonna be a
free gift on July 10th. And when I told all my friends
from 4th of July weekend that that was happening, they were like, "What is happening?" So get the game and play on July 10th and you're gonna get that free gift. You can download the game
for free with the link below. There are new levels available now. Bay says, "What's a word you've
been using a lot recently?" Sister. (laughs) If you saw my last video you know why. I've been saying it all the time. I'm sorry, I can't help
it, I'm like sister. "What is your favorite
face or hair product that you've used this month?" I have been using this, it's
Big Sexy Hair Powder Play. You sprinkle it in your hair if you want it to be thickened up and malleable in the
direction that you want, but without it being too product-y. But you can get it any brand. I've used multiple brands, I just get this because it's the one that I could find at the hair place
that's close to my Target. Any type of texture powder
I'm really into right now. I like this one, but I don't know if there's better ones out there. I'mma keep trying them,
I'll keep you guys informed. Mickia says, "Favorite ice cream flavor?" The other day I was very hungover, and you know when nothing seems
to be curing the situation and everything is going
wrong and you're sweating, you have a headache and
noises are killing you, and you try to sleep
but nothing's working? The one thing that cured my situation was an orange creamsicle! And it was the best thing of all-time, and it's like, ugh, it was so good. So I'mma say an orange creamsicle. Perfect for the summer. Jordan says, "What is your
favorite vidcon memory?" There's one moment that I
really loved is with Shannon, and she is an Irish viewer
that I got to hang out with, and we were hanging out
in this beanbag room, and me and Korey and her all lept and jumped into the beanbags all at once. Vidcon can be kind of stressful, but when you have times when it's like, get away and actually get to know people, that's what Vidcon's all about. madi wants to know my
current favorite album. I would obviously have to say Pride Jams, which if you want a signed
copy the link is below, and I don't think I
showed you this before, but the back is so cute. It has all the titles of the songs on it and a little rainbow, it's so adorable. I really love it. A portion of the proceeds
goes toward the Trevor Project and it supports LGBTQ+ artists, so win-win situation and
you get some good music. mckenzie says, "Current
vegetable obsession?" I don't know! (laughs) Cherry tomatoes? I really like a cherry
tomato in the summer. You can pop 'em in ya mouth all day. Delicious, like a grape, it's so good. joetta says, "Favorite board game?" Okay, so if you like Settlers of Catan, I'm really currently into,
it's called Lords of Waterdeep. I used to play it back in
Michigan with all my family, and then I introduced it to
my friends here in California, and we all really like it. We get kind of competitive though. It's cutthroat. nina says, "Favorite
finger at the moment?" I don't know if I have a favorite finger. Maybe this one (laughing) I don't know. kayla says, "What's your favorite
thing to wear right now?" Well, right now I think
I'm a little biased because I'm wearing right now, I don't know if you can see it, it's this Lady Gaga "Born This Way" shirt. It's lyrics from "Highway Unicorn", which is my favorite Lady
Gaga song of all-time. But also, I am very partial to this Make America Gay Again
hat, it's from the HRC. If you wanna get it,
I'll put the link below. "Favorite reality show competition?" Obviously, right now I'm
obsessed with Big Brother. Are you guys watching it? I'm not gonna spoil anything, but that second eliminated houseguest. Can we talk about, like, just ludicrous. Okay, so those are some
of my current obsessions. I wanna know, what is your
current favorite song right now. Let me know in the comments below. That's all I have for you guys today. I love you, I'll see you guys soon. Okay, that's all, bye! (lively music) Bam, boom, got it. 
- Hi everyone, my name is Tyler Oakley and I feel like I haven't
answered your questions in about 17,000 years. It was last June during Chosen Family when I did the last Q&amp;A, so
I asked you guys on Twitter to ask me any questions you have with the hashtag #AskTylerAnything and y'all just had questions for me that were so important
that I felt like, girl, I have got to answer them. So I'm gonna answer
some of those questions. Lily would like to know, if you could live anywhere in the world, where would it be and why? There's this like, island
in the Bahamas somewhere, I read it on the Internet,
probably not true, but there's an island
that's like, all pigs and I feel like I would feel
very at home with my brethren. Imagine me swimming the
Bahamas with all these pigs and they're looking at me like, girl. My new home. If you could have 100 of
one thing in the world, what would it be? Now I'm just thinking about
100 pigs on that island. 100 pigs, I could just eat them all. Am I allowed to say that? If you found out that you only
had 24 hours left to live, what/who would you do? Oh my God, that wording. You know what, everyone's always like, oh, I would just spend it
with my friends and family. I'd be like, girl, no. I spend enough time with them, I would send everyone a
group chat and say y'all, I'm out in less than 24 hours, deuces. Maybe I'll go to pig island. Truly, like, if I had priorities
for my last day on Earth I would have everyone over
that wanted to come over and I would say, all food's on me, and I would literally just order everything I possibly could. That sounds like a really good last day. Maggie would like to know, what is the best thing
you watched this week? Well Maggie, I am currently obsessed with things that make me cry because in this trying time I need, like, things that are good
and make my soul warm. So there's a video that
I watched this week that I really love. So a little bit of
backstory about this video: for the Olympics P&amp;G does this campaign called Thank You, Mom, and it's all about the incredible, amazing,
inspirational, powerful moms behind all the athletes. So the latest video they put
out is called Love over Bias and it's beautiful, it's for
the South Korean Olympics that are happening next year. But I especially liked this video because it shows a queer athlete and the relationship that
they had with their mom and it made me think about
my relationship with my mom and how without Queen Jackie I would not be half the person I am today. So Mom, if you're watching, love ya. I just feel like the Olympics are a time that bring people together and
that is a really good thing and this video specifically
warmed my heart, so I think you're gonna love it too. And I loved it so much last Olympics that they reached out this time and wanted to sponsor a
video and I was like, girl, I would've talked about this anyway. So thank you to P&amp;G for
sponsoring this video. I'm gonna put the video
link in the description, check out loveoverbias.com to learn more and use the hashtag #LoveOverBias to let me know what
you think of the video. I loved it, I think you will too. Makayla would like to know, any new juicy secrets you can tell us? Well clearly if they're secrets
I can't tell you anything, but I can hint that I
recently filmed something for something with people, and it was the best experience of my life, and I can't wait for you to see it. But you won't see it for
like a year, so nevermind. Judy Ann would like to know, tell us the last text message
you sent and read it out loud. Well Judy Ann, you are nosy as hell, but. This is not really that exciting, but Cory was asking me
where the TM emoji is because I always say, like,
oh, she really Did That and I'll capitalize Did
and I'll capitalize That and then I'll put a TM. And to me, that says something. And he's like, girl, how
have you been doing that? So I sent him exactly
where the TM emoji is. Exciting, I know. Judy Ann, was that fun for you? It was fun for me. Maria says, I am so
bored and I need music, do you have any suggestion? Well Maria, do I have a song for you. I have a song I just literally
can't stop listening to. You know when you've listened
to a song so many times it just itches your brain? That is the song. I really like it though and
I can't stop listening to it, it's Sexual by Naked,
Dyo and Oliver Nelson, it's the Oliver Nelson remix. It's on my Spotify playlist,
I'll link to it below, but it's so good and there's a part. I've listened to it so
many times that I know, it's at two minutes and 40 seconds in, it just feels like euphoria. And when I'm on the
treadmill running to it, I just wanna just like, throw
my arms up and I'm like, yes! It is so good, you're gonna love it. I just know you're gonna love it. Morgan says, the most ridiculous
pet name used for you? I'm trying to think like,
things that have made me cringe if somebody called me them. I like, don't wanna tell you guys. Once I was with a guy and he
was like, barely older than me and he really wanted me to call him Daddy and I was like, girl, you're
like a year older than me. Okay, so the next question is, most risque thing you did in high school? Now, I feel like I was well
behaved, but I feel like if somebody messed with me, I just never had any time for anybody and that included teachers. So there was once during class,
this teacher that I hated, she tried to give me half off
of like, a paper or something that I was turning in because
I didn't go turn it in to like, her desk quick enough. Maybe I sauntered or maybe
I stopped at a friend's desk to say hi or something and I was just not quick enough for her and she try to play like, oh, you're getting points off because you took too much
time to get up to me. I like, threw a fit and
I stormed out of class and I like, threatened her job. I was like, Oh, I'm gonna go tell the administration about you. I swear I'm not difficult,
but if you mess with me, I will be difficult. So in the range of things that
are risque, I would say yeah, that's probably it. And the administration
sided with me, so, girl, was it that risque? Lyndsay would like to know, what do your Twitter drafts look like? And most of my Twitter
drafts are just like, promo tweets that I was like, oh, I've probably promoted too much today. If you follow me on
Twitter you probably know. But there's one tweet that is very topical for today's video. It says, "men are pigs &amp;
i was put on earth to play in the mud" - my real
housewives opening credits line. Honestly, probably. I stand by that tweet, I'm
gonna tweet it right now. Everyone loves it, five retweets. Thanks guys. Okay, so that's all the
questions I'm gonna answer today. I hope you enjoyed this video. Plus, thank you for all
the love on Spooktober, I had so much fun making
all those spooky videos. If you didn't see all the videos, I'm gonna put all of those on my channel, they're already on my channel, I don't know what I mean I'm
gonna put them on my channel. They're already there, go watch them. Okay, love you guys, see you soon. 
- Hi everyone, my name Tyler Oakley and now more than ever
representation matters. Some of our leaders are
trying to villianize and dehumanize minority voices, when we should just be listening and uplifting their experiences. The LGBTQ plus experience
is so intersectional and I'm trying to always learn more about people throughout
history that have made an impact but might not've
gotten the recognition that they deserve. And so now, to celebrate
Hispanic and Latinx Heritage Month, which starts next week, I am going to be
highlighting eight Hispanic and Latinx LGBTQ plus trailblazers that I think that you
guys should know about. Raffi Freedman Gurspan is a
Latina, indigenous, Jewish, transgender woman, who
served under the Obama administration and was the
very first openly trans member of staff at the white house. Raffi used her seat at
the table to drastically improve conditions for trans Americans. Proving the importance of
having a place in politics. Plus, she accomplished all
of this before she turned 30, what an icon. In the early 60s, Jose
Julio Sarria, helped found the League for Civil Education. Which provided support for gay men arrested in raids, like
the Stonewall Riots. In 1961, Jose ran for
the San Francisco Board of Supervisors as one of the
very first openly gay men to ever run for political
office in the world. And even though he lost,
he still got 6000 votes, which showed the power of a
unified LGBTQ plus community. Now this was all 16 years before
Harvey Milk ran for office and became the first openly
gay elected official. And while we often remember Harvey Milk for shattering the political
glass ceiling for the queer community, we must absolutely honor Jose's bravery for even dreaming
to break that glass ceiling in the first place. Before Rose Troche created the L Word, representation for lesbians in the media was virtually non-existent. And throughout the L Words six seasons, Rose wrote, directed and produced, despite working in an
industry overwhelmingly run by men. Rose used her lived
experience as a lesbian to create possibility
models for queer women. While showcasing real issues
and important dialogues. Something that was way ahead of its time and still resonates with
the queer community today. Orlando Cruz is a professional boxer who is originally from Puerto Rico. In 2012, Orlando
officially came out as gay, making one of the very
few professional athletes to come out while still
participating in their sport. During the match after he came out he wore both his Puerto Rican flag and the rainbow flag during the fight. He was completely unafraid to show his intersexing identities with pride. Orlandos courage to let
his true self shine, despite the heteronormative
and hypermasculinenized nature of boxing, provides
representation for countless queer athletes around the world. Frida Kahlo is considered
one of Mexico's greatest painters. But I look up to her for
her boldness as a feminist and as a bisexual icon. Frida defied gender stereotypes. She smoked, she boxed,
she won tequila challenges against men, she even wore
a suit in a family portrait. Despite societal pressures,
she refused to alter her masculine features and instead, usually exaggerated them in
any of her self portraits. And the fact that she was openly bisexual makes her an even bigger badass. She never made apologies
and she never made excuses. Her boldness bled into her art and she never shied away
from taboo subjects, like birth or abortions or miscarriages or breastfeeding. She was not afraid to speak her mind. Self love was and still
is a radical statement and Fridas' ability to be
bold in every part of her life was breathtaking then and
still inspires me now. Ricky Martin is a Puerto Rican musician who started his career at the age of 12 when he joined the Latin boy band Menudo. Then he went on to have
an even bigger solo career as an adult, breaking
records with songs like Living La Vida Loca. I grew up loving Ricky Martin on TRL, I used to watch him all
the time in middle school and when he came out in 2010 and cited one of my videos as a
reason why he did it, I was shook. Ricky inspires me to
continue telling my story, as you never know who's watching and the ripple effect that you might have. Sylvia Rivera was a
Venezuelan-Puerto Rican-American, transgender activist. Most commonly known as one of the insiders of the Stonewall riots in New York City with Marcia P Johnson. Sylvia also found STAR
which was group dedicated to helping homeless trans youth and it was one of the first
political organizations to help transgender people in the world. Today, the Sylvia Rivera Law Project is named in her honor. A non-profit that engages in policy work and provides free legal
services for trans, intersex and gender
non-conforming, low income, people of color. Sylvias bravery at
Stonewall changed history. And her legacy today saves lives. As a child, Jorge Gutierrez
was brought across the US Mexican border by
his parents, illegally. Today, he works as an
undocumented queer activist. Hoping to bridge the
gap between LGBTQ plus and pro-immigration groups. In the xenophobic era of Trump, Jorge's efforts have
been primarily focused on providing support for
the 800,000 undocumented young immigrants, who
were previously supported by the Obama era program DACA. Jorge has taken his own experiences and put them into his life's work. And I admire his unwavering dedication to making sure that young
people are supported, despite the circumstances
that they're born into. Okay, so that is all I'm gonna
tell you guys about today. If you wanna know more
about all the people that I talked about, you can
check the description. I'm gonna be putting articles and bios and links in the description
so you can learn more things about all these glorious people. Representation is so crucial. So if you wanna know more
about Hispanic and Latinx YouTubers or people on
Twitter that I think that you should follow, I'll put links to those
people also, below. And I feel like as time goes on, I learn more and more and I'm always open to learning about more people. So if you have people that I
didn't include in this video that you think deserved a spot, let me know in the comments. I'm gonna be reading the comments, I want you to let me know who they are, maybe why you look up to them. I would love to learn more
and maybe love them too. Okay, that's all I have
for you guys today, I hope you have an amazing Hispanic and Latinx Heritage Month and I will see you guys very soon. Muah, later. 
- Hey, everyone, it's Tyler. So I just got to San Francisco
for a little vacation trip, and I am so excited because
my mom is meeting me here. I have not seen her for like five months. And we're going to celebrate
Mother's Day together. So my mom is somewhere around here. Gotta find her. Look who it is! So we just got to the hotel
and my mom, I think, was a little surprised. What'd you find? - Look at this, it says "Welcome Tyler "and Queen Jackie!" - Okay. Thank you, Fairmont Hotel for
all the sweets and treats. Okay, yes, work. I am so happy to be back in San Francisco. Mom, are you happy to be here? - I'm so excited because
it's so pretty today. - Do you know what we're doing today? - No, what are we doing? - So, do you remember
my vision board video, and the little Sprocket I used to make it? - Yeah, yeah. - So, do you have the stack
of postcards I gave you? - Yeah. - Okay, well today what
we're going to do is go to each of those landmarks, take
a picture in front of it, print it out on the Sprocket, peel it off, put it on the back of the postcard, and send the postcards
to my nieces and nephews, your grandkids. - Aw, they'll love that. - Don't you think that's cute? - That's an adorable idea. - It's tiny, fits in your
pocket, you can take it anywhere. You get the app and it's
free for any type of phone. So you have your Android and
my iPhone, it'll work on both. You like to add stickers
and frames and things to your pictures. - Yeah, yeah. - Well you can do that in the app. Select your picture from
your camera mode, you send it to the printer through the
app, and it prints right there. No ink, it uses like this
zero ink, Zink technology. (laughs) And I would say it's like the
perfect Mother's Day gift. - Is that my Mother's Day gift? - Do you want one? - Yeah. - I'll get you one. - Okay, yay. - Okay so we're waiting for
Korey, who's about to pick us up and we are about to start
our little adventure. - I can't wait, babe. - It'll be fun. (upbeat music) - Hey guys! It's Queen Jackie and
we're here in Muir Woods. - This is stop number one. - It's beautiful.
- I wanna hug a redwood. I'm a hugger, and when it comes to nature. - Oh, Lord. - I love all my mothers,
Mother Jackie, Mother Nature. (laughs) (upbeat music) - You can't...it says "Please
stay on the boardwalk." - [Korey] "Stay on the boardwalk." (laughter) (upbeat music) - You should go in there. (laughter) (upbeat music) Cute! - That's really cute. - Okay mom, who is this postcard going to? - This one can go to Maddox. - Okay. - Oh, how stinking cute is that? - (upbeat music) - So we're here at the Golden Bridge. (laughter) What is it again? - So we're here at the Golden Gate Bridge. And I like this spot because
you can see the entire city. You can see Alcatraz, you
can see the city, you can see downtown, you can see
Twin Peaks, you can see the whole bridge. It's like you get everything
in one little spot, and I feel like there's no
better place to show this woman my favorite city in the country. (upbeat music) The last time we came here,
we did a jumping picture with the bridge in the background. And I feel like we have to
do a jumping picture again. Apparently, she's in. Let's do this. - I love it. - Cute. - That's so cute, I like this. - Yeah, easy breezy. - Let's send this one to Aiden. - Aiden? - He'll love it. - Okay we're gonna give this one to Aiden. (hollow instrument percussion music) My favorite part of all San
Francisco, obviously, is The Castro, because it's
the gayest thing possible. I used to live here. It's like home to me. I would wish anybody across
America, around the world, to be able to come here,
who identifies within the community because it's
like there's a sense of freedom and safety and a security net. - Even if... (laughs) - I love sharing this place with you, mom. My home away from home. (hollow instrument percussion music) So this is where Harvey Milk used to live. Do you know who Harvey Milk was? - Yes. - Did you see Milk? - I did see Milk. - So if you guys don't know,
Harvey Milk was the first openly gay elected official
in the United States. And to me, I find him really
inspiring because he showed the world that just because
it had never happened before, doesn't mean it can't
happen in the future. And I don't know if I'm ever
going to run for office, but somebody like that
inspires me to think, okay, maybe I could. I really love it and I loved
walking by it every day when I lived here. (hollow instrument percussion music) So cute! - I love it. - Oh my God, that is actually adorable. (hollow instrument percussion music) - We're gonna send this one to Harper. - Harper, watch out in the mail. (hollow instrument percussion music) So I feel like the perfect
way to end the day is at Dolores Park, which is
one of my favorite spots to have a little picnic and
have all my friends just hanging out, looking
at the beautiful city. It feels like a nice community here. (hollow instrument percussion music) Let's stick it. Who are we sending this one to? - Olive and Delilah. - Olive and Delilah, the twins. They're getting a love
letter from San Francisco. Mom, did you have fun today? - I had an awesome time, honey. - Did you? - Yes. Thank you so much. - Okay, so we're gonna go. We have the whole weekend
ahead of us to hang out - Woo hoo! - And enjoy and celebrate Mother's Day. And there's no one else I'd
rather do it with than you. Thanks for joining us, we love you. Mom, if they like the
video, what can they do? - Thumbs up, baby. - Baby. We'll see you guys soon. Thanks, Sprocket, for sponsoring
this video, we love you. And if you want to get a
Sprocket, you can check out the description below. - Bye. 
- Hi everyone, my name is
Tyler Oakley and welcome to my new home. As I told you guys last week
I am moving, I did move, I done it, I did, I doed the thing. It feels so good to be here
and I am so excited to be making my first video here. I have been scurrying
around my new home trying to figure out where I want to film. So I've been setting up
my camera, I've been like, "Mm, is that cute?" And
I'm like, "Is that cute?" And I'm like, "Is this good lighting?" I think this is a good spot,
maybe I'll do another one, new one next week. Who freakin' knows? Thank you for coming
into my home, welcome. I'm sorry in advance, but
this video is just chalk full of announcements so stick
around, stay 'til the end 'cause I have things to tell you about. What is going on in my life? Last week I went to see Dear Evan Hansen, which was so good. Funny story, when I was
there I was seated and I look over and look who's right
next to me, James Gordon. And I was like, "Ma'am!"
And we embraced and we went out for drinks afterwards
with Ben and just, like, I cannot get over how
good Ben Platt was in Dear Evan Hansen, you need to see it. Go see it, enjoy it. And then what else is happening? Oh my God, the Super Bowl. I don't know if you know this about me, but I am the biggest Lady
Gaga fan in this room, which is currently empty. I was going to say in
the world, but I'm like, "You know what? I'm sure
there's other people that would, "like, really go in for her." I love her, she is my
everything, I would take a bullet for her. But I have to say, the
concert, the halftime thing, performance. The artistry, the vocals,
the choreography, the looks, the charm, the charisma, the talent. I just am so honored and
happy that I stand talent. My favorite part obviously
was when Beyonce came out and did telephone with
Gaga because I recall, very clearly, Beyonce came out on stage, they performed their hearts
out, climate change ended, Trump resigned, everything
went according to plan, I got abs. And that's how I remember it. If anything else happened,
do not let me know. Listen, if Trump fans can
have alternative facts, so can I. And speaking of the Super
Bowl, I got to spend my Sunday on set for the Snickers live
commercial while they were making it with Candy Johnson. It was the most fun. If you want to see the
commercial you can go to snickerslive.com and we had
so much fun because leading up to that live commercial,
for 36 hours they did a live stream and I got to be
a part of it and it might've been the most ridiculous live
stream I have ever been in. I tried to learn how to
juggle with a football player. I hosted an armadillo race. And I got turned into
an actual snickers bar. If you want to see all those
clips and the commercial itself, go to snickerslive.com. The link is below. Thank you to Snickers for
sponsoring this video and for making the most ridiculous
live stream ever happen. I had so much fun. Okay so I want to tell you guys a secret, I have been keeping something
from you for a while now, we have been working on
something and a lot of people have been asking, "What is
the deal with your podcast?" So if you didn't know I
have a podcast with my buddy Korey Kuhl, it's called
Pyschobabble, it is an unfiltered half hour of gossip sessions,
pop culture scrutiny, and stories we've never told in videos. And it's been on hiatus for a minute. We have taken some time off
and there is a reason for that and I am so excited to tell
you guys that the podcast is back today, but not like it was before. You can now watch the podcast
on the full screen app if you want to, or if you
want to listen to it just like you have for the last two
years, it'll still be on iTunes and SoundCloud, but
you can get it a week early on the fullscreen app and
you can watch it for the first time ever. I am so excited for it. Our set it beautiful, I feel
like we're going to be able to do so many more things
now that it has a visual component. Thank you so much for supporting it, we have so much fun making it. It is like my favorite thing
I do every single week. So enjoy it. There's cameras around us. Would you rather be a
brownie or eat a brownie? (mumbles) Feel an oat in San Francisco. - Google home queens. Trying to have a therapy
session with you right now. - Oh, I'm not interested. - You didn't tell me your
budget for fucking Trump. He's going to give you a
briefcase full of money. - I don't want a briefcase. - Why? - My Google Home is being
so fucking annoying. - Your first feud of the year? - I had to raise my voice at it. - (Mumbles) was like a cute hot teenager. - First of all, I'm going to
let you own all of those words. - I can't believe that's
another great episode. - Are we done? And finally, one last little announcement, I have a brand new compilation
album that is out now. If you want to get it it
is called Break Up Jams. It's all break up and
empowerment anthems and a portion of the proceeds goes
toward Planned Parenthood. Just in time to celebrate
love and Valentine's day, if you want to get this, it
is I think my best compilation yet. And there is a bundle where
you can get this signed and one of these hats, but
it is very limited quantities so be quick if you want that. Otherwise you can get
it on iTunes and enjoy. Okay so that is all I
have for you guys today, I hope you have a fabulous
life and I will see you guys soon. Go check out all the links
in the description below and yeah, I love you guys,
I hope you have a good day. That's all. Okay, bye friends. (upbeat music) After the Super Bowl I
went out last night and I have lost my voice, I think
I was celebrating Gaga, but I was, me and my friends
went out and every single time we cheers we were like,
"To the artistry of Lady Gaga" "To the vocals of Lady
Gaga," "To the divinity of "Lady Gaga." We were living. Listen, in 2017 you have to
appreciate what you can get. Times are tough, these ages are dark, and if I have to celebrate
just the little things, I'm going to. 
(creepy horse sound) - This reminds me of Ricky Dillon. Doesn't it? No, don't do that. (deep laughter) (creepy intro music) Hello everyone and welcome
to another episode of Are you ready for... (heavy laugh) What, you were, come back to me. (laughter) Hello everyone and welcome
to another episode of ASMR you ready for this. - Dun dun dun dun, phew. - Beautiful - Thank you. I'm Mamrie
Hart with my co-host - I'm Tyler Oakley and
we're back for a special Halloween addition of our hit show. - Absolute hit. You might
also be familiar with us because of our just
monumentally successful Halloween sounds CD. - Yes, it came out in 2010. It's called Sounds of Halloween. - We were up against a crazy cat man. (laughter) - Did you just throw up? So after the success
of our multi-sale album - Multi-sale... - I think we sold seven to eight - We sold tens. - We did, we had a bake
sale that coincided with the record release. - To buy the cookie, you
had to buy the album. So, to bring this majestic
record to a new age of humans. - Yes - We thought we would do as the kids do. The scares will spook you. The noises will frighten. You will be shooketh. - (creepy voice) We're
going to blow your minds with this ASMR time. (growling) - Pop pop pop. A favorite song from the album. - Yeah. - Was of course - Which one? - "Frightening, Groans &amp; Moans" - Shall we perform it for them right now? - A live rendition. - It's a tango.. - No, not a tango. It's not a salsa. - Cha-cha. (laughter) - A waltz. - Now this one's a-- - Ohh, the weeping willow waltz. (clicking) - You get a cover. (growling) - And here comes the feature. - Yee-haw, I'm riding on my broom. (growling and purring) (laughter) - What the (mumbling and laughter) - And so far, our next
sneak peak of the new album we have "Rattling Chains". Now this is not to be
confused with the new artist Two Chainz. What-- (chain rattling) (gasp) - So this is a chain I bought. - And I will give you a chain reaction. - Word. (burp) (hysterical laughter) - See the hard thing about
a chain is not putting too much rattle in it. Do you know how many
years of training it takes to barely move a chain this much. - Any bitch can rattle this bitch. (metal scraping) (gasp) - Please break me from these chains. I've been in these chains since I died as a little girl. - Help us, from the chains. - So, I would like to
take a moment and talk about this gorgeous set
design that you did Tyler. - Thank you. - You know, I'm not a
major fan of rodents. You keep calling this a
mole but it's definitely a rat and if that's what you think a mole looks like you need
to go to the dermatologist. Tyler, I see that you
splurge for the candy corn that's made with real honey. - Now this is one of my
favorite sounds from the up, it's a new track. - It is a new track. - From the digital release. This is "Candy Corn
(Chewed by Real Teeth)" (laughter) (licking and slurping) (choking and coughing) - I think it should be a duet. - Oh, so now she wants on the track. - I just don't want to be left behind. What kind of cheap ass
dollar store candy corn-- - I'm on a budget. (nibbling noises) - No....no. (crunching) (loud breathing) (laughter) (inhaling candy corn) (coughing) - In this track, we should add, I hate.. I gotta get rid of this. It's as if someone is
eating candy corn alone and then hears a stranger
enter their house who also wants the corn. Hey, I'm, painting a picture. - Thank you. So I'm the stranger. - No, you're the person-- - Well we're both strangers we don't know each other, okay, shh. Now one of my favorite
tracks from the album is of course.. - Probably the most challenging track to record. - It was a doozy, if you will. And that's-- - The story, the story,
the snoozy, let's get to the doozy, 'cause this
floozy's gettin' woozy. - I'm a little boozy, I
gotta go number twosey. - Have you guys been able
to hear him sweating? (laughter) - Now of course we're
talking about our hit song "Blood Curdling Screams" - This was especially
difficult because screaming as an ASMR artist is very
tough, plus I hate the word curdling, and here's a sneak peak. (strangled screaming) - Now, one of my favorite
elements of this song is not just your expertise finger wiggle of the-- - Mmm. - But it's also the
howl from the distance. (scratching and crumbling) (faint hoot) Bitch that's an owl, not a howl. - That's a howlin' owl. - A howlin' owl?! Only on sounds of Halloween. (scratching and crumpling) (faint wolf howls) (growled howl and growling) (laughter) (burp) (laughter) - It would not be
Halloween unless we had a little of my favorite vegetable involved. Pumpkin. - That's a heavy pumpkin. (growled mumbling) Take it away. (carving knife) - Oh my god. - Do I look like I'm
jacking off a pumpkin? - I'm close. - Glenn close. (laughing) - One of the most
exciting things about this release is not just the iconic duo that is Mamrie and I, but, we
also have a bonus track for our Target exclusive with a feature from none other than a guest artist that's flying in now, Beanz Hart. - Beanz has been working on this track for several months, she just
calls it "Wicked Wings" I'm gonna, as you know,
Beanz requires complete silence when she does her ASMR track. - And no looking at her in the eyes. (tongue scraping microphone) (nails scratching microphone) (wing bumping microphone) - This has been so
exciting to give everyone. A sneak peak, I mean-- - It's good to get the
group back together. - You know, I have
enjoyed this very much so. - Thank you so much for joining us today. Be sure to-- - Like and Subscribe, also, I wouldn't... I'd recommend not using
heavy machinery or driving a car for the next hour
or so, because we've put you in such a tranquil state. Audial Vicodin. - Audio minds... - Audio mind. - Thank you so much Mamrie. - Thank you, it's really great to have the band back together. - Have a great life. - You've never been sweaty. - Stop! (grumbling and laughing) - Tears off face. 
- Hey everyone! My name is Tyler Oakley. Today, I am celebrating Valentine's Day because it's like, coming up. And it's the worst holiday of all time. So I felt like because we're
going through this together, let's just address the
elephant in the room. We are all single. It's
fine, it's whatever. And as somebody who is single, I feel like if I want to have a boyfriend,
I gotta put myself out there, and that includes some dating apps. But I feel like me being
single is not always my fault. Though, sometimes it is, I feel like you gotta meet me halfway and the messages that I get on these apps are
not always the most normal. So, today I am going to
be sharing with y'all some of the weirdest,
cringe-iest, not-normal messages that people send me on Grindr. I can't believe I'm about
to share these messages because some of them
are a little bit much. This one, this is a common theme for messages that I get on Grindr. And it's people that seem
to almost know who I am. It's not the superfans that are like, "Oh my god, Tyler Oakley!" It's people that are like, "Taylor!" And I'm like, you were
so close (laughs loudly). This one says, "WATCHA
doing here. TAAAAYLOR" That's not who I am, I'm
not Taylor, but thank you for almost gettin' there with
me. Here we go, another one. This one says, "Oh my fuck. "Please tell me you're Taylor Oakley. "THE Taylor Oakley." (laughs loudly) I wanna be like, yeah it's me, the one and only, Taylor Oakley. Maybe that's my drag name, Taylor Oakley. Please welcome to the
stage, Taylor Oakley. (laughs loudly) Somebody
says, "Shut it down. "If this is Taylor, I have
followed you since forever." Just, a true fan (laughs loudly). (laughs loudly and grunts)
This is another theme where people try to get
my attention by saying that they love me and
that they're a huge fan and then if I don't immediately
reply, this took one minute, they say, "JK, not that big of a fan, "but I still look at your videos." Thank you. You really built me up, and then you really tear me down. This one, okay so, they messaged me, "Hey you're cute what's up?" And then I didn't reply fast enough. People get really upset when
I don't reply fast enough. I'm like, you know what, I don't have push notifications on for this. So, I didn't reply fast enough, and then their next message was, "unsubscribed." Period. (laughs loudly) These impatient bottoms! So, this one says, "Hey!"
And then it's the moon emoji, and it says, "sending you a sexual moon." And I was like, who's pickup line? And Lord knows I probably
sent this to Cory because we always send each
other the shady moon emoji and I've never used like,
the non-shady moon emoji, and maybe it is a sexual moon. Maybe Devon is really
opening up my eyes to this. (laughs loudly) JT says, "Good meningitis" and then corrects himself,
"Morning," I meant morning. That's iconic. Good
meningitis (laughs loudly). Ooh no, no. I think... This is from a trip that
I went on to Seattle. This isn't a screenshot of Grindr. This is a screenshot of me
falling asleep with Grindr open. (laughs loudly) Somebody posted it, they said, "Napping on grindr. Classic Ty." This must've been Cory or
something. I, this is great. This is the most me. Just networking, but falling asleep doing it. (laughs loudly) This person says, "Ur my 4th favorite youtuber!" Who the fuck is on top of me?" (laughs) This message just says,
it's very sweet, it says, "You are hot." But this like... graphic, like, emoticon situation of a naked guy pointing with his dick out. I need to know if this is like, a saved message you send to everyone. Is this always what you lead with? I just say "hey," or like,
"hey hey," sometimes. Or "hey there" with a smiley face. I guess I need to step my game
up, this is like next level. Oh my god! Some of these screenshots are a little bit triggering. This one says, "You look like
that faggot Tyler Oakley." (laughs loudly and grunts) I don't know, are we reclaiming
that word? Not on my watch. (laughs loudly) Somebody says "Hi. Why is
Tyler Oakley ur profile pic?" And then they send me a side by side of them and me, our two pictures. They say, "Little girls
always think I'm him." Sad face, I'm sorry. I get it a lot too. People think I'm Taylor
Oakley all the time. I do get this a lot
though when guys are like, everyone says I look like you. And every time the gay
that's telling me that seems so annoyed, I'm like,
I can't help it, I'm sorry. I feel like there's no better insult than to be told you
look like Tyler Oakley. So, Dear all white gays that
are blonde with glasses, I am so sorry. Another theme we have going on. This one comes from a man who's got a hammer emoji as his name. Does that mean he's gonna pound me? I don't know what that means, but he says, "Why would you use a fake picture? "I doubt a youtuber
would come in to Grindr. "But nice try whomever is hiding there." I wanna be like, you know
what bitch, we need dick too. We need that pound too (laughs). (laughs) This is... The closest that I probably
get in conversations on Grindr to sexting, is something like this: He says, "I'll let you dip
pizza in ranch on my chest." I said, "Oh my god. Do not say
that if you don't mean it." He says, "I'm into it. Just like. "Let it be full fat hidden valley." Which to me, girl. So I said, "Omg." He says, "Anything else is offensive." Which is true! We are really
like, on one right here. I feel like we are connecting, I wonder if this ever turned into anything. I said, "I do not even
know how to respond to you. "You might be my soulmate." He says, "My queen Tiffany HBIC
pollard taught me the way." This must've been my soulmate; did I miss my opportunity with this person? Who was this? If this was
you, I hope that we hooked up. Oh my god! Another critique
on my profile picture. This person says, "You
look like you just farted "and you're waiting for
somebody to smell it." Like, what does that mean? I need to know what my profile
picture was at that time. Honestly this productive,
constructive criticism is helpful. One thing that I hate to see on Grindr is when people are like, no
fats, no fems, no blacks, no this, no that, or whatever. 'Cause I'm just like, girl, imagine being that close-minded to love and possibility and knowing what could be out there. But this one I screenshotted
because I'm like, this is a taste of somebody's
own medicine because it says, "No white guys. Literally anything else." I'm like, girl, after all
the no blacks, no asians, no blah-blah-blah, this might be refreshing for a white guy to see. Oh, this is a Grindr
screenshot that I took but it has nothing to do with Grindr. It was just the moment I
got the push notification that Darren Criss started
following me on Twitter. So (laughs loudly), I was on Grindr the moment
it happened, what a memory. (sighs) This guy says, "So I saw you in weho
the other night. Wow. "You do not even come close
in person as good as you do "in your profile picture on here. "I was shocked how not
good-looking you are in person, "keep working that pic
though, it over sells you." Thank you, Chuck. Thank
you for that feedback. I think I'm cute. You don't gotta. Truly, what is there to say Chuck? Clearly, we didn't vibe in person. Clearly, we're not vibin' on
here. I wish you the best. (laughs loudly) This one just says, "Hey, yo whassup vanilla
face." (laughs loudly) I would love if I were truly
that, because I feel like I'm always just like, red and blushing. We love a business
opportunity. This person says, "Wanna model for us. We pay
$2000 for a solo jack off video" Girl, that's not a bad
idea. (laughs loudly) You know what, that might
work for some people. If that is for you, get your coins. I will link to them in the description if you wanna give them that content. (laughs loudly and grunts) This first message from somebody says... I can't, I don't wanna read
it. It's so inappropriate. "I can fuck you deep and hard "and you can post it on
your YouTube channel." No, thank you. It's sweet
though, it's a kind offer. I just don't know if that's
what we're posting today on YouTube.com, Tuesdays at
noon. It's not the video. It's not next week's
video, it's not the one. See! It is not all my fault
that I'm single (laughs loudly). Thank you for joining
me on this adventure. Please, if you see me on
any of your networking apps, say hello but don't be a weirdo. If you like this video, be
sure to give it a thumb's up and let me know in the comments if you were to message
somebody on Grindr, what is a pickup line you would send? And if I'm gonna be honest,
the best Valentine's gift you could give me is giving this video a thumb's up and subscribing, so if you do that, God bless ya. Okie dokie, that is all I
have for you guys today. I will see you guys very soon. Happy Valentine's Day. Love ya. Later! 
- Hi everyone, my name is Tyler Oakley, and there's people outside, there's people outside my window right now playing Pokemon, I can see them. They're not looking in my window yet. I'm gonna be quiet. I wonder what they're catching,
probably nothing good. Nothing good in my neighborhood, there's no Squirtles or Bulbasaurs, bitch, there's only a Pidgey, good luck. Rachel says, Can you prove that you have King George the Third's range? (giggles) I'm too shy to
sing in front of the camera. Don't make me sing, don't make me sing. (slow piano music) ‚ô´ Bum badum bum bada bum badum bum ‚ô´ Badum bum ‚ô´ I don't remember the words. ‚ô´ Remember we made an
arrangement when you were ‚ô´ I can't do that, I can't do the arr, (babbling) I can't trill my Rs. I will never be King
George the Third. (sighs) Maggie says, how do
you feel about Harambe? Harambe, am I saying it right? I guess I've never said
that name out loud, I've always said Haram-bray. I don't support the murder of gorillas. How much do you charge to Tyle a bathroom? Looking for the best price. If good the job is yours mate. I have never tiled
anything, though the origin of my name, Tyler, is maker of tiles, tile person, person who tiles things, perhaps a grouting moment if you will. I am very interested in tiling. If you need me to tile, perhaps
I will come tile for you. I once did a video maybe
like six years ago, seven years ago, the
challenge for the video was to make a video about Julia Stiles, and I instead made a infomercial for a company called Julia's Tiles. It was a character whose name was Julia and she tiled things, and I didn't have a wig, so
I just put on a grocery bag. It was, listen, it was a
different time on YouTube, okay, things were different then. I'mma link to that video
in the description below. I think I've put it on my Tumblr before. spaceshipoakley wants to know what book do I recommend on audible this month? As you guys know, I recommend a book on Audible.com every single month. If you use Audible.com/tyleroakley you will get your first month free. They have hundreds of thousands of titles from all different types of genres. This month I am recommending
Barrel Fever by David Sedaris. If you haven't heard a David
Sedaris book spoken out loud on an audio book, they're so good. His voice is incredible for storytelling. I was laughing out loud multiple times on a flight because of this book. Go get it, again, Audible.com/tyleroakley. You get your first month
subscription free, enjoy. Thanks Audible for sponsoring
this video, I love you. Amelia says, what's your
reaction when you see that people have your photo on their
profile on social media? I honestly am flabbergasted by
it, it's very sweet and kind. When those people always
reply to me on Twitter, I start to recognize who they are because I am self-obsessed. And the people who do that, I
start to recognize like that. Do you like your muslim fans? Of course. Who would say no? I guess garbage people. Garbage people would say no. I'm not a garbage person. Not that the garbage man is a bad person, but people that are garbage,
see what I'm saying? Jonathan says, The Olympics
are on featuring people with a talent, so why are
you trending you talentless, I don't say that word. (giggles) yeah sure, the Olympics are on, but have you seen Michael
Phelps fuckin' do this? Watch. Yeah, bitch, one at a time. Suck my dick. John says, what was your favorite thing about the Hearts of Reality event? So a couple of weekends
ago I went to an event called Hearts of Reality, which is a bunch of reality TV stars from
Big Brother and Survivor and Amazing Race and all
these shows coming together and raising money for an organization called Give Kids the World,
which focuses on supporting kids with life-threatening
illnesses and their families. So we all came together,
we raised money for them, we did a meet and greet
where all the proceeds went toward the organization,
and my favorite part of the event was there was one day where we all dressed up
like pirates and princesses and got to hang out with
all the kids for the day. We went around and asked
them for their autographs and we got to play games with
them, it was just so much fun, and when a lot of these kids are faced with harsh realities
in their everyday life, I feel like the magic of being
a kid is stolen from them. And when they get to go to
Give Kids the World Village, they really get to feel like a kid again, and I really love that. If you want to get involved
with the organization, I'm doing a little fundraiser for them with my buddy Korey who I
went on The Amazing Race with. If you want to donate, the link is below. It's an organization that does a lot of good, and I support that. Emmablu says, can you copy this yoga pose? Good luck. I don't think I can do a handstand. Oh my god. Oh, oh my god! (laughs) Oh my god. Here we fuckin' go, let's do this. Oh my god. I think I got it. What was that you had to
say about the Olympians having talent, what now? Tia says, what is your
opinion of foot fetishes? Unsurprisingly, I have an entire chapter about foot fetishes in my book. Steph says, do you remember me? I have always wondered what
happened to this child. Thank god you and the
child are still with us. Billy says, have you ever
tried to grow a beard? Is it patchy or full? The only thing I can grow on my face because I'm seven years
old, is this and this. Some guys can do a full scruff moment, and I'm like, yes ma'am, daddy, sir, but this is not a face that can pull that. Kylee says, what heart
emoji is your favorite? My most used one is the yellow one. Let me know in the comments
which heart emoji you use with your Twitter handle,
and maybe I'll tweet you that heart emoji, just to say hey. I hope you have a good day,
I will see you guys soon. Podcast, person of the week,
my last video, et cetera. Be sure to subscribe, okay, good luck with your lives, bye. ‚ô´ You remember when (babbles) 
- Hi everyone! My name is Tyler Oakley and look who I'm with. Tricky Ricky sticky dicky Dillon. Hi. - Hello! - How are you? - Good. - It's been a while. - It's been a while. - Ricky and I are here today. We have only filmed one
other video together, and it was years ago. - Yeah, three years ago. - We did the What's in
My Mouth? Challenge. - It was iconic. - But today I figured
because there's so much YouTube drama, and like conversation
about YouTube in general. - Yeah. - That I wanted to get together
with somebody that I know has been doing it forever, and whose opinions I love and validate... - Thanks. - And who I know will spill some tea. - We do love a good spea til.. (Laughs) We love a good tea spillage. - Say it again. - We love a good tea spillage. - What do you love? (Laughs) So I asked you guys on Twitter if you could ask a YouTuber
anything about YouTube stuff what would you ask them? And here's a bunch of questions. So if you'd like to draw one. Let's dive in. - Okay. - What do we got? - Laura asked... - Hmmm. - I feel like you've dealt with that a lot - Yeah. - When it's with me it's just like it's just more fun I feel like. I've never had anything dramatic about it. - I feel like in general shipping is fine until it like starts infringing
on those friendships. - This happened a lot
with Andrea and Kian. I don't know if I should
be talking about them. But I'll ask them later.
- Go off. - But when they were dating, Kian was big and it was fun, you
know, all fun and games but sometimes like fans were
going really far with it and like Andrea was like... You know she felt weird
about it which that can... - It does, it makes it weird when people have expectations about how you and somebody should
have your relationship whether it's platonic
or romantic or whatever. When people project
those expectations on you it makes it feel, especially
when you have a platform and people are watching and listening and looking at your tags to see if there's any candid pictures of you, it makes you so self conscious
of how you act with them. And it kind of like makes it awkward between you and a friend or you and whoever you're dating. Relationships, whether
romantic or platonic, are difficult to begin with. Like trying to figure
out who you are together in any whatever sense. And then add a million people
having an opinion on it that don't even know you.
- And analyzing everything. - Yeah. So sometimes it can be challenging. Jenn would like to know... - Whoa! Honestly I had a panic attack
the other day about this. - No! Not to like deepen the mood. Sometimes I will get in like
a weird funk with YouTube. Like I'm not doing as well as usual and I don't have any ideas that
I feel good about and like. So to try and get out of the funk I get an idea that I think
will just do really well and put me back like on a track, you know? But the worst feeling
ever is when I do an idea that I don't really like and
then it just does bad anyway. - I know! That's like the worst. - You know what I mean? So what I've come to realize lately is like I'm over that. I wanna just do stuff that I like to make. Sometimes it might do really
well, sometimes it won't, but as long as I like the video, then I'm cool with
having it on my channel. - The worst is when you think
you're following a trend and you look like an idiot doing it because you actually don't care and then nobody cares anyway cause they can tell that you don't care. - Yeah so I'm just, I'm over that. - And especially as
like it's like a career where you always have to be creative and coming up with new ideas. Sometimes it's like, fuck,
there is nothing left that I haven't done. And so it's easy to look
at like Tide Pods trending and being like, "What can
I do with a Tide Pod?" - That was what my panic attack was about. - Really? It's a shitty feeling. If you're a YouTuber I feel like everyone even if they're not even thinking about it might sometimes do it and be like, "Okay well, "what would do good?" Because you want your content to be seen. - Yeah. - That's an natural inclination. But yeah it's an easy trap to fall into. - What's helped for me is like I'll take a trend and I'll
do like a fun twist on it like the Tide Pod thing, I did like a cool skit with Miranda. - Well you made it your own. - Yeah it was fun to make. And the whole eBay box thing,
I made it like a parody. So I think I've like learned
to just make it my own and not just do like the basic thing. - It's totally okay to see
what's trending and just be like, "What would Ricky Dillon's take be on it?" - Right, yeah. - That is like the better route to go. - Hope asked... Whoa. That's a hot question. - That is hot! - It's a difficult question because if you're making videos you're not asking to be a role model. I choose to keep my stuff clean cause I really love it when
parents come up to me at a meet-and-greet and they're like, "Thank you for keeping your content clean. "I can trust my kids to watch it "without having to worry
about what your video is." I love that. - I feel like, I'm an adult. I didn't choose the audience that watches. - Right. - If a 12-year-old's watching I can't stop that or anything like that. I understand and I've learned
this throughout the years that just because I don't intend
for a 10-year-old to watch doesn't mean a 10-year-old won't watch. I understand the
influence that I can have. - What I like about you is you make videos that are
just good to be in the world. They're great. - That's sweet. - You do a lot of LGBT
videos and stuff like that. Like that's good. - That's very sweet. - You know? - But I also like, I'll
talk about sex and drugs. - Well I know but you
don't do it in a bad way like I guess they mean... - I try, yeah, I try to
understand that a young person can watch or listen and
be like, you know what? They can shape their influence based on what I'm influencing them on. - Right. - So I definitely approach
it with that in mind but I don't want that
to censor me in a way because I'm grown-ass man. (Crossover) I don't wanna act like I don't have sex or I don't wanna act like I don't do whatever I do in my damn life. I think that it's the
YouTubers who don't think that glorifying these bad behaviors. - Right. I feel like Logan, you know? He has very young viewers. I mean, can we talk about this? Is that fine? - Yeah, yeah yeah. I don't care. - I don't wanna go too much but like Logan has very young viewers and he is... glorifying bad behavior and stuff that shouldn't be... - And it doesn't even have to be drug use or unsafe sex or whatever, it's like people that are disrespectful acting like that's the way to be and when I saw that video
of, was it Jake Paul? Like jumping on the news van or whatever? - Yeah. - I was just like, "Really?" - And Logan running around Japan and terrorizing people... - To me, that's shitty. - A 10-year-old will
watch that and be like, "Oh my God fun. Let me go do it too." That's bad. - Because not only is it bad for the kids but it's bad for the community as a whole. It makes the whole
community look like shit. - They get these big headlines
about how bad they are and it makes us all look bad. - Right. And I wanna be like, "Listen, I can give you
a whole fucking list "news people, "about YouTubers that are
doing good in the world but people don't click that
- That's 90% of them at least. - Right. So that's frustrating. - Yeah. - Zoe says... That's a cute question. - You! I mean we're friends but
like we never hang out. - Let's go poke... - [Both] Pok√©mon! - Yes. - We were just talking about, I wanna do a video where it's us, and Korey Kuhl cause he still plays and Hannah cause she still plays and you're friend, Shelby. I wanna get us all to go together and hunt Pok√©mon. But even without making a
video that would be fun. - Yeah. Just like hanging out. I'm trying to do it more. - We're doing it. If I had to pick somebody... - Maybe someone we're not
really friends with at all. - Yeah. - Everyone loves me. I'm
friends with everyone. - Bitch. - I mean Liza, like I know
her but we never hang out. - Liza's good. - She seems really fun, fun girl. - Elle Mills. You know her? - Yes. I haven't met her before though. - I wanna be friends with her.
- She seems nice yeah. - There's a bunch of
YouTubers where I like watch from afar and I'm like, "Can you like me back?" (laughs) So Elle Mills is my answer. - I guess Liza. - That's a good answer. - How do you think you pronounce that? - Shiann? - Shiann? Asked... - You know Korey, my friend
Korey used to make videos and he doesn't do it anymore. I would love if he came back. Who else? - More Extra Tyler, what's
your second channel called? - Oh (laughs) Extra Tyler. Yeah he can go on there. - Troye. I want some more Troye
Sivan classis videos. - I know, Troye was such a good YouTuber. - I mean I'm so, so proud of him. He's literally a pop star now but like... - Killin' it. - I miss his personality on the internet. What's crazy is, all the original ones that
I started out watching are still here like Shane,
iJustine, Jenna Marbles. - That's a thing I wanna say, people that are like, "Oh
I miss the old YouTubers. "I miss these like..." I'm like, (claps) go to
their YouTube channel. I guarantee they uploaded this week. - Most of them are still here. - Yeah. If you miss somebody,
bitch all you gotta do is follow em on Twitter. You'll see when they're uploading or if your subscription box is broken. Or if you haven't seen them. - Or your whole page is
full of someone else, just go to the channel. - Go to their channel. Misha says... - So I've been in the slow transition. I'm so particular and stingy about certain
things that are weird. So I've just always edited my own stuff. - That's how I used to be. - But I've gotten to the point where like I'm losing sleep over editing I'm like... - Oh baby, no. - Messing my sleeping schedule up... - Honey, no no no no no no no. - Like it's bad, so I've been testing out I've tried one out, he's great. - When you're able to let
go of control as a YouTuber it's hard but it lets you lean into what you should be doing and being creative and
making more cool shit. I had a really hard time, similarly, where it was like, I feel like nobody's gonna understand
how the particular things that I like and how I like a video to be or like even talking to a camera and then being like, how
are they gonna interpret how to edit this, if I'm
not the one doing it? And I now have somebody that helps with content creation and editing and having that person be here to be able to bounce ideas off of makes me, I think, a better YouTuber. - See, I have Shelby for that. - If you're a YouTuber where
you're able to get somebody who is better at editing than you and will allow you to have the
free time to be more creative, you should do that. - Yeah. Beatrice asked... Oh my god. - Girl. The algorithm stresses me out. Me and Trevor tried to figure it out. We have a funny joke, we call it "Al Gore" and "Al Gore rhythm." We have a meme we send back and forth of Al Gore playing the drums. - Oh my god. Wait, iconic. - If we have a video that's doing well we'll be like, "Al Gore's
playing the drums." - That is so funny. That is funny. When if you ever see us poppin' send us a GIF of Al
Gore playing the drums. - Yeah, cause you're in the algorithm. - That's funny. - Yeah, but (laughs) you literally cannot figure it out, it's just random videos
sometimes just shoot in. - As far as the algorithm goes, girl, you know we're not in
charge of the algorithm. Viewers are in charge of the algorithm. What you click is a vote to
what the algorithm prefers. So if you click something
that's like, "Bad YouTube" or "YouTubers Doing the Worst" the algorithm sees that. It's not the creators that
are making the algorithm it's the viewers, so bitch. - Click on the good ones. - Click on the good ones. - Click our stuff. - Okay so that is half of the questions. If you wanna watch the
other half of the questions, you can go over to Ricky's channel. We put the video up with
some more juicy stuff. The link will be below. And if you're one of my people be sure to subscribe to Ricky because he's one of my faves. If you like this video,
give it a thumbs-up and if you have a question
about anything YouTube that we didn't address,
put it in the comments. Maybe I'll answer some of those questions. That's all. Okay. Good luck with your lives. - Bye. 
- I don't know if you know
who I am, but I am me. (Tyler laughs)
Cool intro. Bitch I'm moving, spoiler
alert, I moved eight months ago. Long story, I'm gonna
sum it up real quick. Eight months ago I was like,
"Dang I've been in this place for so long, I wish I could start fresh." So I just went and moved,
but I didn't bring anything with me and I set up a
new life in my new home. And then I would come here
and this would be my office, and it was really cool because
I had this like, for the first time as a professional YouTuber. I had a work and I had
a home, and the more I would stay and spend time at my new place, the more I realized like
that is where I felt happier. I had been in this place for
a few year which was great, and it had started to
accumulate things and memories of a different time in my
life, obviously, clearly, that was like the past. (motorcycle loudly interrupts) My new place you can never
even hear a motorcycle, things are so better
there, I have a dishwasher, like it's the little things. Anyway so my old place, when
I would come here I would start to realize like this
isn't like, me anymore. It just, maybe it came across
in videos, maybe it didn't, I don't know but I would
come here and I would film and it would just feel
like me two years ago. Every time I would come here
and film here, my background became like a set that
I no longer thought was cute or related to in any sense. And this like grandma
chicness of this place felt less and less of like who I was. I feel like if you no longer
like something of a situation that you're in, or a person
you're with, or a place that you're at, or a job
that you're at, or whatever. If you are in a place
where you're able to, you've got to pluck yourself out and throw yourself somewhere else. So, I'm getting the fuck out of here. This is the last time
you're gonna see this place, say goodbye, and the next time you see me I'll be a whole new man. But yeah, that is all I
have for you guys today, I hope you're having a good
2017, what else is going on? Other things, but I'm not gonna tell ya, because it's none of your
motherfuckin' business. Biatch. I wonder if this, I wonder if I just did this all day long, I could. I cannot believe it's the end of an era, this thing will never see
the light of day again. Crazy. 
- For 10 years I've been sharing my story, but now I wanna share ours. (upbeat music) Ahhh, I'm so excited. I can finally tell you about this incredible series
that I've been working on. I have spent so much time
and traveled all around to make this video series happen, and I could not be happier with what you are about to see all June long. Chosen family is all about
celebrating queer life, amplifying disenfranchised
voices within the LGBT+ community, and honoring
our history while fighting for our future. And not only are we making
videos that are super important to me to share with the world, but we're also selling
limited edition t-shirts each and every week that
are related to the themes of that week's videos that
benefit organizations that help the world in some way. Creating this series has
enriched my little gay soul and I could not be happier
with what I'm about to share with you all. I hope you like the series. Be sure to subscribe, get
ready, it starts next week! 
- Hi everyone! My name is Tyler Oakley, and today, I wanted to
do a little something where I could kind of organize my life. I feel like for a while I've been like, I don't really know what
I wanna do with my life. So it's like good, at least for me, to map it out and visualize it and like, put it into sections. I've made a couple vision
boards in the past, but I decided I'm a make
a vision board for 2017. And what I want out of my life, what I wanna do, and my dreams and my hopes. If you watched my previous
vision board videos, it's usually just me cutting up magazines, but I wanted this one to be
a little bit more special. So I have like pictures from
my own like camera roll. I used my HP Sprocket. This video is sponsored by them, so thank you so much to them for making this possible. I love it because it's tiny and small, you can take it anywhere. On the app, you can use stickers and make them all like, ritzy. You can just print out
pictures on your iPhone or your Android. There's no ink, it's super easy. I loved it. And it actually made the vision board, I think, a little bit better than all of the vision boards
I've ever made in the past. So right in the middle, I have a little section, and it's kind of like the
title of my vision board. It says, "Tyler 2017. "He came, he saw, and he conquered." I hope maybe my goal for the year is to do what I can not to look at what
everyone else is doing, but just do me, and do me in the best way possible. In this little corner, I have like a little moment for like, romance and love, because obviously, like, it wouldn't hurt to meet the man of my dreams. If it happens, it happens. But I'm putting it in
my vision board, okay? I have gentlemen only, because I'm not here
for a petty little boy. I want like a man who knows what he wants. There's like two little porcupine grooms. Gay porcupine grooms. And it says, "Perfect match," because I will settle for nothing less. Over here I have like
a little work corner, because it's an important part of my life. And it says, "Born again and again." This is my tenth year of YouTube. I am old. I have been doing this forever. And I feel like it's important
for me to allow myself to grow and to change. Just because I've been doing
a certain path for a long time doesn't meant I can't be born again and feel like a brand new YouTuber every single time I make a video. And then at the bottom it
says, "Feed your fandom." And I was thinking about
this when I saw it. I was like, you know what? I wanna find that balance of what I love, what you love, and find that happy spot
right in the middle. And then surrounding that, I put a couple pictures. Right here, I did
podcast stuff with Korey, because that's something
that's such a big part of my life right now. I wanna focus on making things that are off platform. And so I put up a picture of me with my Warby Parker glasses, because I wanna do more glasses with them, but I also want to expand what I think I can do. I never thought I could
make a glasses line, but here I was able to. And then down here, I have pictures of times that
I get to spend with y'all. This is super intimate. It's Camp. If you haven't signed up
for Camp, you still can. It's an opportunity for me to spend, like, really one-on-one time with y'all. But then also the bigger things, like VidCon and tours and appearances. And I really wanna spend time focusing on doing those, so that I can spend moments with you guys. Over here, I have a whole category
that is about health and wellness and taking care of myself. Down here I have, I guess like a body. Imagine having a body that you are like, dang, I look dang good. But then, over it, I put the caption, "I
love to look good for me." And to me, that says it all. But I would love to get into a mindset, and maybe this year is the year, where I'm like taking care of myself, and enjoying the transformation that I am embarking on, because I am liking how I'm looking. You know what I mean? And then down here, I put
a picture from when I did my marathon relay with my friends up in Canada. And I really like this picture because it, like, actually
looks like I'm having fun. It doesn't have to be this thing that you dread going to the gym. I am like, happy as can be. And I feel like that is how I want my approach to health to be. And then this section, I have a whole bunch of my queens who inspire me for a million reasons. I have people like RuPaul, Gigi Gorgeous, Hilary Clinton, Beyonc√©, Oprah, Gaga. Like, these people who are
doing incredible things, doing good work, and making the world a better place. And I really wanna do that just like them. So this little section on my vision board might be my favorite part. And it's all about activism. I included things like, "Listen," because to me, it's really important especially now more than ever, to hear the other
disenfranchised communities and try to understand them. And try to think about how I can step up and help and support them. Up here is a little picture from when I went to the Women's March. I have my like, Planned Parenthood sign. I wanna remind myself to get involved, stay involved, locally, nationally, however I can get involved, I want to show up. It's important for me to show up. So that is my vision board. I hope you guys liked it. If you did, let me know
in the comments below what is on your vision board. If you were to make one right now, what's something that you
want to happen in 2017? Thank you so much to HP
for sponsoring this video with the Sprocket. If you wanna get one, all the information is in the description. It's a perfect little gift. I love mine, and it made my vision board pretty cute. If you wanna see my latest video, click right there. If you wanna hear my latest podcast, click right there. Again, you can watch it early if you get the Full Screen app. And if you wanna be my Person of the Week, click right there. But that is all I have
for you guys this week. I hope you have a fabulous life, and I hope you like my vision board. 
(techno music starts out
soft and grows louder) - [Tyler] In 1960s New York, when police could target
and punish LGBTQ+ people for simply existing, the Stonewall Inn was a safe
haven for the queer community. In 1969 a resistance against
anti-gay police raids made Stonewall the birthplace of the modern LGBTQ+ rights movement. Tree Sequoia was there the
night it started in 1969 and he's now worked as a
bartender at the Stonewall Inn for over 30 years. I wanna say cheers, because
this is like the biggest honor to be here with you and to
have you even serve me a drink is an honor. - [Tree] My pleasure.
- So thank you. This has been, you know, (glasses clink) a legendary place for me. - I came in here for the first time when it was the original
Stonewall in the 60s. We only came to bars to dance. We just hung out all night long. We didn't have sex there,
we just had hangouts. You sleep with a guy and
he becomes your friend. And then he introduces you to his friends and the next thing you know
there's eight or nine of you, 10 of you. - It's a family.
- It's a family. - Yeah, I feel like that was
a theme especially back then of a lot of homeless LGBT
people could come into places like this because it was safe. - Parents in the old days
actually threw their children out with the clothes they were wearing when they found out they were gay. - [Tyler] Police raids
at gay bars were common, but on June 28, 1969
the patrons of Stonewall decided to fight back. A riot that led to the start of the modern LGBTQ+ civil rights movement. - All of a sudden we hear
screaming and everything from the other side. We saw the cops coming
in pushing and shoving, but we started fighting back. Hitting the cops, pushing everybody. As they were arresting people, putting them in the patty wagon, everybody was booing and hissing
and calling the cops names and the crowd got bigger 'cuz people looking out their windows
had to come and see. And the word got around
and everybody was coming from all over. And they were shaking the cop car. They pulled a parking meter, with concrete on the
bottom and everything, and battered the doors over there. And the lesbians in there
were lighting their pillows and pillow cases and throwing
them out the window screaming "Come on girls, fight back!" - [Tyler] Gay people
ascended into the streets and openly resisted the harassment and criminal exploitation
of their community; oppressions which they had
long endured in silence. Rich, poor, drag, butch,
gays stood together and fought the mass act of resistance. - The three and four days after that were even more impactful, getting everyone out in the streets. Thousands of people came down
and really stood out here and that's really what sparked it. And what they did
afterwards really to effect how people were treated
years later and to this day is just so impactful. And it's crazy to know that it all started right in this building. - The younger generation have no idea what we went through to
give them what they have. - Yep. - Now they have 100% more than I had when I was a gay guy coming to the village in the 50s and 60s. We had nothing. - A lot of the younger
generation had no idea what happened, they had no idea that people like Tree even existed. A lot of people across
the country were like 'Stonewall, it sounds familiar,' but they didn't know. How are we gonna work
to bring that all back? It is the birthplace of gay rights. If gay bars are the church,
you are in the megachurch. This is where pride began. - Right. - The reason why we have pride
parades all over the country and United States happened
at this bar in 1969. - In fact, to this day, a
lot of the old generation, they don't call it a parade,
they still call it a march. 'Cuz we're marching for our rights. - [President Obama] I'm
designating the Stonewall national monument as the newest addition to America's national park system. Stonewall will be our
first national monument to tell the story of the
struggle for LGBT rights. - I think about every little
kid like me in Kansas, every little person across the country that had such a difficult time, and just gonna be like
oh my god, our president is acknowledging us. Like the leader of the free world is like, you know we have bullies and
people that made fun of us and whatever, he's saying
it's okay to be gay. I think if you come into
Stonewall on any given night you will see everybody. You will see the trans
community coming here, you will see people of color coming here, you will see gay, you'll see lesbian. It really is the melting
pot like New York City of the world. And knowing that yes,
trans women of color, who are absolutely the most marginalized and the group within our community that's the most endangered right now that we need to stand up and support were the ones who led the
way for us back in the day. - [Tyler] Janet Mock is a
trans activist and author who is at the front line of
the fight for LGBTQ+ equality, now almost 50 years after Stonewall. - For me so much of my
work is about paying homage to my forbearers. To all of the people who
have sacrificed their bodies their livelihoods, their
everything in order for me and our communities to
be able to do the work and to be seen and heard on the levels that we're seen and heard. And so for me when I think about 1969 and I think about the Stonewall rebellion, I think about Marsha P. Johnson, I think about Sylvia Rivera, and I think about Miss
Major Griffin-Gracy. Largely young people,
poor people, LGBTQ+ people who were out there and put
their bodies on the line in order to say that we
will no longer be contained, we would no longer have our sexualities and our genders policed, we would no longer have you
telling us what we should do and how we should live
and who we should love. They were like fuck this. - Right! (laughs) - Yeah, we're gonna turn
this all the way up, we're gonna get some Molotov
cocktails, some bricks, and we're gonna throw back. They had so much less resources
than we have had access to resources, yet they still went out and really changed the world. I always say that activism is not this one performative space, right, the picket line, the protest. It is in the everyday acts
of when you hear something going on, you hear problematic language, that you check it. That you use your
privilege and your access and the spaces that you've been given, have been granted to you, to make sure that people think differently and that you don't let this stuff go by because your people are all people, right? And that though you may be different, though you have different experiences, it is your job to use the
education that you've taken on to hopefully resist every single day. - This was founded on resistance, this was founded on standing up. This is what Stonewall represents, smashback stands up against resistance. So you have an opportunity
once in a lifetime to really make a difference. And we need everybody now
and not just about gay rights but about all the others,
whether it's you know our trans friends, whether
you get people of color, whether it's immigrants, whatever it is those issues matter now so this is ... You have your Stonewall
1969 moment right now to stand up and come out
and march and fight back. - We have to stick together,
we have to help each other, we have to fight for each other. Do something and you'll feel better for it because you're helping. They've gotta be proud. They've gotta walk around
and say I am what I am: I'm a homosexual, I'm gay,
I'm a lesbian, I'm gay, if you don't like it screw you. (bouncy guitar music) - [Tyler] We can't forget
what happened at Stonewall and the people who stood
up for what was right when they needed to most. Every day there are people that
need us to stand up for them and it's the Marsha P.
Johnsons, the Sylvia Riveras, and the Tree Sequoias
that make me feel like we can do it too. Thank you so much for watching this video. I am so honored to be at a place like this because without something
happening here in 1969, I don't know if I would have
been able to do something with you guys here on YouTube. I had such a great time
talking to Stacey and Tree, I feel like I learned
so much about Stonewall and the movement and their perspectives. If you wanna learn more about Stonewall and everything involved, everything will be in the description. This week's t-shirt is benefiting
the Human Rights Campaign if you want to get one of
them the information is below, but it's only available for
a limited amount of time so be sure to get it quick. That's all I have for you guys today, I will see you guys soon. Okay, love you! 
- Hi everyone, my name is Tyler Oakley, and today I am doing
something a little different, I've never done this before, but I have been on
Facebook for over 10 years. It has been a decade of
questionable, embarrassing, cringe-worthy memories. So today, I am reacting to
the most embarrassing pictures of them all, I haven't
see them yet, let's go. Oh my god. So, this picture, this
is a fun little memory. There I was, Cogsworth
in Beauty and the Beast, and behind me, you can see my friend Eric, who I talk about in my
book, he was the beast, even though he is like my height. We didn't have tall people, okay? And he looks like the
least beastly person. I don't know what I'm doing, I'm like sprawled out on the chair, but also I am giving you wig, I am giving you high school
drama club budget costuming. This, to me, is Tony worthy,
I think this deserves costume of the year,
Broadway could be jealous. Next picture, the first one
wasn't bad, the second one, oh. I remember this day
clear as day because me and my friends Eric and Sarah, we hosted a Saint Patrick's Day soiree, so it was green themed, obviously 'cause Saint Patrick's Day, and you had to come
with a green food item. And so, there I am testing
somebody's food item, and you can tell that I'm testing it because in my hand I have a pen, I was a judge for the contest. If you couldn't tell,
I liked to brunch it, and I liked to judge people. And as far as judging people
goes, nothing has changed. Oh my God. Okay, so this picture,
this is how I proposed to somebody for prom back in the day. I was asking Anna Zillinski,
who was one of my dear friends, to prom, and for some reason,
I don't know why I did it, maybe we had an inside joke or something, but in my head I thought it
was the most brilliant idea. I took a bucket of butter,
scooped it all out, put a message at the bottom,
refilled it with butter, and then put the bucket on
her front stoop with a spoon. I left a message that said scoop bitch. And I think at the
bottom it just said prom, I have no clue why,
maybe it was like a pun, maybe there was like prom
would be butter with you? I don't know what I was
thinking. Promposals on a budget. Oh my god, this is homecoming,
I mean, what is there to say? I'm bent over, it appears as
if I am getting it from behind, this is my friend Kelly
who I'm still friends with, this was us in a nutshell. This is back in 2006, and
I am giving you dominated, power bottom extreme, and I'm
not sorry for it, I love that. You know what, I was
what, 17, 16 or something? Denouncing myself of the masculine norms, here I am taking it up the butt
from this dominatrix bitch. God bless. Speaking of gremlin, oh my god, oh my god. So, here, this is not a cute picture, this is not flattering,
I'm sure this was like my MySpace picture at
one point, here I am, we had made a fort in yearbook class, I am holding up some coins, I think I was doing a
Gollum impression, which, to this day, is one of my go tos. I am actually quite certain that this was one of my MySpace pictures. And back then, this is before
like, Facebook was big. This is how you met the local gays, okay? So, you had like your best
pictures, you had your top eight, there was a hierarchy involved. If somebody fucked with you
in your group of friends, you moved them from your number one friend down to like number four,
this was like drama. This was my MySpace picture,
and for some reason I thought that this was gonna get me
a boyfriend in high school. Spoiler alert, no boys took this bait. Who am I? This is Connor
Franta wishes he was in 2006. Tell me that isn't the
same picture, Connor, I see you, you wish you were me, bitch. This was on a field trip,
we were going to Chicago, which is like a big deal
when you live in Michigan, this is right after I
was eating a burrito. I guess my memory is not that
bad, when it comes to food. There's the burrito, that is too funny, 'cause this is like five minutes later, this is my burrito, memory
is like a steel trap. The caption is I fucking ate
the whole thing, bitches. Me in 2006 is me in 2017. Another shoot from our Chicago field trip. Here I am indulging, how you
can see, my baggy ass jeans. If there's one thing y'all know about me, it's that my biggest splurge
is like an airport massage. And here I am, 2006,
finding a Sharper Image in a damn mall in Chicago,
just to recline for free, and get line five minutes of like that pressing all over my body. I'm not gonna lie to you, if
my mall had a Sharper Image, you think I'd be sitting
here filming a video? I have places to be,
I'd be there right now. Next picture, oh my God. Okay, so this was my
first trip to Hollywood. You know how they have
like the Walk of Fame with the stars and all the celebrities, the only picture I took with
a star was Kermit the Frog. Here I am with his
star, and you know what, I wanna collab with
Kermit the Frog, someday. You know what, I'mma put it out there, it's gonna fucking happen. Before this picture is 10
years old, so by July 26th. I have like a minute, I do not have that much
time, Kermit, call me. I, this, you know. See, this is not embarrassing
because I would do this today. The caption is senior picture, we must have done like a
shoot that day in the park, 'cause this is not my senior picture. I think this is like the last
day of school, sophomore year? And we went to the park and
did our mock senior photos, as if we were going to go have
our senior photo photo shoot. If there's any senior
pictures that I have to react to today, they are
the most embarrassing, I don't want you to see those, 'cause this is like a joke of it, but my senior pictures themselves
were embarrassing enough. Oh my God, no, I don't wanna see this, this is beyond, I can't. So, this is one of my senior pictures, this is one of the outfits,
and when I say one of, it's because I had two days
of shoots, one with long hair, one with short hair, 10 outfits both days, and then an on site picture with my dog. I was high maintenance. This pose, I look like some type of hussy, not that there's anything wrong with that, but what was I, 14, 15? Lounging, giving you full
crotch. I feel so come-hither. This, to me, is like a power
stance, I'm giving you loins. I love reading the comments
from my friends 10 years ago. My friend Chris says you
look like a man whore. True. Well, I never wanna see any
pictures of me ever again, I think those were the most
embarrassing things of all time. If you liked this video, be
sure to give it a thumbs up, maybe if 100,000 of you
give this a thumbs up, I'll do reacting to more
embarrassing pictures or something, who knows, maybe not, I never
wanna do that ever again. But if enough people like it, who knows. If you wanna see my latest

- Happy holidays! I just turned on the camera. Who knows what's gonna happen? What if this was like one take? It's not gonna be. But happy holidays! How are you guys? I hope you're having a
great holiday season. Did you know there's
more holidays in December than just Christmas? Shocker, I know. Anyway, to celebrate the holidays, I figured I would do a little
holiday themed Q and A. So I asked you guys to
submit your questions. Got an itch. So, submit some questions on Twitter with the #ASKTYLERANYTHING and here's what you wanted to know. Evan says, "Is it good or
bad to wear a Santa hat "as your winter hat post-Christmas?" Imagine the priorities
somebody would have to have to criticize somebody for
wearing a Santa hat in January. Like, girl. There are worse things happening. We saw what happened in
2016, can we not repeat that by focusing on things that don't matter? So, to answer your
question, live your life. Madi wants to know, "What is
the weirdest Christmas gift "you've ever given or received?" So, to answer your question,
I feel like I should just like open some gifts on camera
because, who knows? These might be the weirdest
gifts I've ever received in my life. So, I am working with Spotify for their #2016wrapped campaign and
basically what's happening is they are sending gifts
that are based on artists to the superfans that listen
to those artists on Spotify. So, apparently, these three
gifts that they sent me are based on who I listen to on Spotify. I'm wondering who this is based on? I'm very curious. So, this one is an
original deluxe fruitcake. I don't know if I get it. It came with a card. Fruitcake by the Ocean. Spotify, I see what you did there. Okay, so gift number two, looks like it's a Christmas sweater. Oh my God! This might be the best Christmas sweater I've ever gotten in my life. (laughing) Treat Your Sweater, oh my God. What is this one? (laughing) Okay, so, it's a Santa hat, but it's not any ordinary Santa hat. It's a Sia wig. I am sorry, but I will not get over this. This is the Sianta hat. Like Sia and Santa. So, Madi, to answer your question, I do feel like these
might be the best gifts I've ever gotten. Thank you, Spotify for
realizing that I am obsessed with DNCE and Sia and
Shawn Mendes this year and thank you for the gifts because I will say, I am a superfan. And, apparently, they are
sending gifts like these to so many superfans of so many artists. So, if you wanna see other gifts that people are getting,
go to Spotify's Instagram and their Facebook 'cause
they're gonna be posting about all of those. I'm obsessed with this, by the way. Inkandstars says, "Are you
good at wrapping presents or do you cheat and put
it all in a gift bag with tissue paper?" I am 100% guilty of just
throwing it in a bag and then like plopping
in some tissue paper. It's not about the wrapping. It's not about the presentation. It's what's inside. That's like, deep. Frida says, "When are you
dropping your Christmas album?" Um, Frida, I already did. If you wanna pick up Holiday Jams, it's 12 new holiday songs and the benefits are going to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. So, if you wanna do
some good in the world, and get some new, fresh
holiday jams, you can. The link is below and I
signed a bunch of them, but not that many. So, if you want a signed
version of the album, you can get that. It's the perfect holiday Christmas gift. The links are in the description. Hisoakley says, "Describe
the holidays in one word." Oh, if I had to pick just one word. Hm, hm, hm, hm, hm. I would probably say magical because I'm corny as heck. Watching my nieces and
nephews open presents, it's like the cutest thing in the world. Witnessing that magic, to me, like, that makes me so excited,
I'm about to get real corny. It makes me so excited to be a dad someday because I'm not gonna lie to the kids and be like, Santa's
real, but I will like, make their holidays special. I don't know. I just, yeah, I'm excited for that. Ugh, I could barf, I'm so gross. "If you could choose to
be any of Santa's reindeer which one would you choose and why?" So, there's Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen and Comet and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen. But I would pick Vixen, obviously. Vixen literally means a sexy woman. And I feel like, I mean, hello and shalom. Maria says, "Send me a Christmas card." Okay, so Maria, I'm
gonna DM you on Twitter and get your address and
send you a Christmas card. Okay, that's all. Okay, so Kaileuu says,
"How do you feel about "this bag of chips on the
top of my Christmas tree?" You have got to do the
most with what you got. And if all you got is a bag of chips, then honey, put it on top. Make it work. Devon says, "Do you have
any Christmas traditions?" One of my favorite things
that my family does is every Christmas, in
our stockings, my parents put like a stack of
scratch off lottery tickets and like a penny and then all of us, all the kids and all the grandkids and the parents, we're all
scratching like frantically hoping that we win anything. Every year I feel like
I have the best luck and I'm always like, I got a dollar. And they're all like, you
don't need the dollar. Leggingsoakley says, "Is
fruitcake really a thing?" Hold on, I'm getting a fork. Y'all, I'm about to bust this open. Katherine, oh, the
things that I do for you. Should we try it, should we try it, ah? That's really good. Okay, so if you like this video, be sure to give it a thumbs up and let me know what are your
favorite holiday traditions in the comments below. I wanna hear. If you wanna see my latest
video click right here. If you wanna hear my latest
podcast click right here. If you wanna be my person of
the week click right here. But that is all. Thanks for hanging out with me, guys. I hope you have a great holiday season. And yeah, thank you for an amazing year. I cannot wait for next year. And good luck with your lives. Happy holidays and deuces. I don't care what you celebrate. I just hope you have a great day. I hope it is blessed. I hope a dog wags its tail at you. That is non-holiday specific. Okay, instead of happy holidays, I'm just gonna say I hope
a dog wags its tail at you. That's every greeting for December. Okay? 
(evil laughter) - Hey everyone, it's me, Pennywise, it's your girl Pennywise, and

- Thank you for a wonderful Spooktober, make sure

the Tyler Oakley channel. 
- Hi everyone, my name is Tyler Oakley, and today I decided I
want to do something that maybe, might change the world, maybe. I feel like after the
pandemonium and drama of the 2016 election,
everyone is like burned out, and they don't know how to get involved. In fact, some people are like, I'm done. Can we just wait till the next election? It's so important to stay involved, and to stay paying attention
to the laws that are getting passed, because
these laws affect your life. It's not just who you elect President. It's not just who you elect as your Senator or representative. Those people need to be held accountable. To do that, you can call them and be like; hey girl, here's what I care
about, here's if you want to keep your job next
election, what you need to do, and making sure that they realize their job is to work for us. One of my favorite websites is 5calls.org. It is an incredible
website that lists issues, that you may or may not care about, and if you do care about
them, you can click them, you can read more about the issue. It'll tell you who you can call to make a difference in
your local government. It even provides you with a script based on your stance, about the issue. So if you feel like, ugh,
I want to do something to help the world, but I
don't even know what to say to my Senator, this makes it so easy. So Imma make a few calls today. Okay, so the first call I'm going to make is the very first option on 5calls.org/tyler, and that's to stand up for
transgender student rights, which, obviously, I wanna do. Back in 2016, the Obama administration ordered all public schools
to respect transgender youth, and allow them to use the bathrooms consistent with their gender identities. But just this February,
the Trump administration revoked that, and said, no public schools don't have to protect trans students. Today, we are calling the
one and only, Betsy DeVos, who is the Secretary of
Education, who we hate. You know what, maybe we can
call her, and change her mind. Maybe we don't have to hate her forever, if she listened to us. Okay, I'm calling, I'm a little nervous. [Dialtone] - Sorry, Office of the
Secretary is not available. Record your message at the tone. - We'll leave a message. Hello, my name is Tyler Oakley, and I am a constituent from Los Angeles. I'm calling to express my support for transgender student
rights in our schools, and in our communities, and to ask that the Department of
Education reinstate its federal guidance to
schools, to protect these vulnerable children and teens
from discriminatory actions. Thank you so much for your time. Thank you for listening,
thank you for your attention, and I really hope to see
actual action very soon. Bye, have a good day, easy breezy. So now that she did not
answer my dang call, I mark it as left voicemail, done. Time for another call. The next one on the list is
to let my government official know that they should stop the use of religious liberty, for discrimination. Edmund Brown Junior, my governor. [Humming] Governor? Hello? - Good morning, governor's office. - Hi, my name is Tyler Oakley, and I am a constituent from Los Angeles. I'm calling to just express my concern over anti-LGBTQ+ laws and other
discriminatory legislation, written in the name of religious liberty, and I ask that the governor
veto any such laws. - Okay, I'll make sure to pass along those concerns to the governor. Thank you for calling in. - Awesome, thank you so much. - Have a nice day. - Have a good one. That was a little bit nerve racking. I think I stuttered for half
a second, but it's fine. I think he got my message,
plus he just tallied it, and was like, you know
what, Imma let him know. The deed is done. Next up, take action to
prevent gun violence. This is super important to me, especially after what happened at Pulse. I'm calling Adam Schiff, who
is my local representative. We like Adam Schiff. Adam? I'll tweet you if you don't answer. - Honorable Adam Schiff is not available. - Honorable? - Record your message after the tone. - Hello, my name is Tyler Oakley. I am calling to urge
representative Adam Schiff to support the Disarm Hate Act. Thank you for hopefully
listening to my opinion, and I cannot wait to see
the action that you take. Easy, breezy. The next one I'm gonna encourage
is for my representative to support the Equality Act of 2017, easy breezy, should be a no brainer. We're gonna call Kamala D. Harris. Kamala Harris is one of my senators. We like her, she's great,
but people like that still need to know that we
want them to stick up for us. [Dialtone] Hello, I am calling to urge Senator Harris to support the Equality Act of 2017, because lesbian, gay,
bisexual, transgender, and other queer people still
face significant violence and discrimination at the workplace, in the housing market, and
in every day interactions. Thank you so much for
your time and attention. I cannot wait to see
the action that you take about this, and keep up the amazing work. Have a good one, bye. That was fun, I feel like
I actually did something with my day, and that took
like no time, whatsoever. That may have been a
couple minutes, and I just got a few calls done,
and maybe, possibly even swayed somebody's opinion
that could change lives, or even save lives, and
I don't want to harbor the feeling of saving the world alone. I want to share this emotion
with all of my friends. That is why I am tagging
three of my buddies. I'm gonna tag; Joey
Graceffa, Connor Franta, and Grace Helbig to go to

- Hey everyone! My name is Tyler Oakley and it's October! It's my favorite time of the year. I love Halloween so much. It's basically gay Christmas, because we get to dress-up
and be slutty if we want to. So I have been working on something that I am so excited
to tell you guys about. It is not a trick. It is just a treat. All month long this month
to celebrate Halloween, I am giving you Spooktober. (ominous music)
(eerie laughter) That's right. Halloween videos all month long. We're doing spooky collabs, spooky surprises. You are not ready for the
things that I have planned. So for today's video, I am bringing you four Halloween costumes that you can do in 2017. Or if you're watching
this years in the future, they might still be relevant. Who knows? So without further ado, here are my four costumes for 2017. (upbeat music) Okay, so for my first look, I had to be the iconic character
of the year from Broadway, Dear Evan Hansen. I got the cast. If you see the show you'll
know why it says Connor. I got the shirt. This is the official shirt. And if you're looking for a prop, you can bring a box of tissues. When I saw it, I was
sobbing the entire time. It's like that type of show. I have seen the show twice. I loved it both times. Ben Platt is a goddess among men. He is everything. I was blubbering crying
and so was he on-stage. He had like snot dripping out. (gasps) That is a good accessory, too. If you want to do like snot
dripping down your face. Very true to character. So if you need a Halloween costume, it's pretty easy. Broadway chic. Tony award deserving, I would say. Go with your Evan Hansen. (upbeat music) Okay, so for my next look. This is very echoey in this hat thing. I think, I don't know
what this character is. All I know is it's something
'bout Handmaids Tale. I've never seen the show. I don't know what it's about. I don't know anything about anything, but it seems like a look. Feels very topical. I feel like I see it on billboards. So bitch, I don't know. You can get this cape. I'm sure you can find it on the Internet. (laughs) This. Store-bought is fine, but you can also use
a lampshade, I'm sure. This feels like a lampshade (laughs). I like this outfit, mostly because it shows as little skin as possible. And while every other gay on the block will be in panties and a thong and call it like a cop. A sexy cop. This is like my version of a sexy something. Whatever this is. I feel like this is pilgrim realness. I am giving you (laughs) sexy pilgrim. What are these handmaids? And what are their tales? Allegedly, it won an Emmy, so I guess it's an outfit I can wear. (upbeat music) Okay so for my next look, clearly I am a Pamplemousse La Croix. (laughs) Because, why the fuck not? This is giving you cylindrical. Every body type it looks okay on. It comes with a headpiece which kind of fucks up the hair situation. But you know what, its part of the look. Pamplemousse which apparently
is like French for grapefruit, is my favorite flavor. So this is the actual can, and I feel like I did
a pretty damn good job. This looks identical. I'm sorry, but it looks really good. And if you wanna do like a group costume with you and all your girls, you can all be different flavors. Easy breezy. So even though this looks
like a real tin can, I know, this is actually a hamper
from The Container Store. You just get like a circular you know, moment for your laundry, but really it can become quite a beauty. (upbeat music) Okay so for my last look, I'm a Grindr profile (laughs). I've always thought this
would be a good costume, but like how do you
even go about making it. And so, this it it y'all. I feel like the most me right now. So over here we got the closest person which would be a mirror. So if you're at a party, whoever you're looking at, it be them. It's kind of like a participatory
costume, if you will. I feel like I'm giving
you mask for mask looking, not generous (laughs), preps a fun only vers, top/bottom, looking for a rim job realness. Five foot ten on the profile, but five foot eight when she
shows up at your front door. Foot play a plus. Into water sports, sometimes, if ya nasty. Around my age please,
and please have pics. We got Scott and Mitch, SuperFruit. Here for some group fun (laughs). Down there we got Connor Franta giving you some millennial pink, if you know what I'm talking about. Ben J. Pierce down there
looking for some daddies. (laughs) 'Cause Lord have mercy, anybody's he's dating is
older than him probably. We got my favorite YouTube couple down there looking for a third. Daniel and Joey. (laughs) On the prowl. And who is that discreet torso? I don't know who's body that is, but they must be hiding something. I'm kidding nobody in this, I don't mean anything except
this is a fun costume. I love all of you. Good luck with your lives, bye. Okay so those are some
costumes that I might be, that you could be, who knows if you hate
'em, if you love 'em, let me know. Give this video a thumbs up. Also, I wanna know what
you're gonna be for Halloween. Let me know in the comments below. And I have a special little surprise. I am actually gonna be spending Halloween with some of you all. I will be in the U.K. for the
event called, Hello World. It is not your average YouTube convention. I got so much planned. Here is who's coming. We got Zoey, Marcus, Elfie, Tom Daley. All my favs are gonna be there. Hopefully, you will be too. If you wanna get tickets, the link to that is below. Hopefully, we take some cute pictures. Also, I wanna give a shout-out to Michael who designed the intro
animation for this Spooktober. He also did the Chosen
Family intro animation, which was also adorable. So thank you, Michael. I love you. If you wanna check out his work, you can check his Instagram out below. Okay, so that's all I
have for you guys today. If you are excited for Spooktober, give this video a thumbs up and I cannot wait to see
you starting on Tuesday. Okay, love you guys. Bye! I'm giving you (laughs). Foot pl-(laughs). Looking for same (laughs loudly). Anything really (laughs). 
- Hi everyone. My name is Tyler Oakley, and I just got back from Amsterdam. I had the time of my life at VidCon. Y'all saw last week's video. If you haven't yet, you
can click right here. I had so much fun at VidCon. But, that was only half of
what I did in Amsterdam. This video, is everything else that I did with all my YouTube friends. There are so many fun little cameos. So, if you spot anybody, screenshot it, and Tweet it to me, 'cause
I wanna see who you find. Now, before I show you all
my Amsterdam adventures, be sure to give this video a like. I'm gonna love you forever, if you do. It's that easy. Everyone in Amsterdam is so nice. I had so much fun. And, this is what happened. So, we just got to Amsterdam, and we already ran into
a couple of people. I'm just so happy to be here. It's been forever. And those girls told me
that Mamrie's already here, and Grace is already here. All my friends are in Amsterdam, and I'm so excited to see everybody. Welcome to Amsterdam. ("Human Touch" by Betty Who) - Hi! - Hey, welcome to Amsterdam. Or as I like to call it, AmsterGlam. - Oh yes, yes. - You can name it (speech
drowned out by background noise) - I'm giving you that. There's the I Amsterdam. Here I am world. - Here, I'll interview you. Ready? Tyler Oakley. - You're pointing over there. - What, I don't know. Let's just give the people what they want. - [Tyler] What do they want? - Just me in slow motion, follow me. ("Chariots of Fire" by Vengelis) - So, the best way to see the city, is to ride on a bike. (upbeat music) 15,000 bikes fall into
the canal every year. And today we find out if
it's gonna be one more. Oh, that ramp. I sure hope I don't get hit by a car. (screaming) Oh my God. Beautiful Amsterdam has so many (speech drowned out by background noise) Tight squeeze. Bonjour. Bonjour. Bonjour. Goedenmorgen. This is the most narrow
bridge, in all of Amsterdam. Oh God. I love Amsterdam. We did it. Amsterdam is beautiful. And, I didn't die. So, it's like a win win situation. So, the last time I was in Amsterdam, Korey and I had these
delicious little snacks called Vlaamse Friet. And, it's like french
fries, but in a cone. And you can get, like cheese on top, or like bacon on top,
or like chili on top. And I wanna find 'em. I'm on the lookout for
men, and Vlaamse Friets. In that order. Vlaamse Friets are close. I can feel it in my soul. Vlaamse Friets, look. Why's that fat child pissing? Or is it a muscular child? I have been craving Vlaamse Friets. All my life. It's been years. So good. Here we are, at the Heineken Experience. I'm all hopped up. - I can barely bottle my emotions. - I can barley believe we're here. - Beer. (upbeat dance music) We just found out how they do it. Now we're gonna show them how we do it. - Ha ha. (laughing) - Drinking. - Consume. Prewst.
- Proost. - Oh Proost, sorry. I feel like we can't go to
Amsterdam without going here, and getting a beer. - I know, it's just a couple
of buds drinkin' some suds. - So right now, we're doing a canal tour. Or as we like to call it. - Pokemon Go. - That's beautiful. ("Human Touch" by Betty Who) I'm all flower. We're about to do the swing. Over all of Amsterdam. They're really not having
us sign any waivers over here in Amsterdam. I sure hope there isn't
any drama on this swing. Nooo. Smelled like pork up there, because the kitchen wafts just straight that way. So, we just finished the boat tour. Amsterdam is hot as hell. - Let 'em know, let 'em know. Keep goin'. - I can't get enough. - Oh, me neither. (laughing) - That's all. So, we had a big day exploring Amsterdam. And now, a little group
of us are going to explore the Red Light District. Which I'm very excited about, because I love that
Amsterdam is so sex positive. So, my favorite spot in all
of the Red Light District, I think, is this gay bar. And, you might just walk
by it on the street, and not even know it, but it's got like cultural history to it. Because, it was the very first place, in all of Amsterdam, where guys could dance with guys, and girls could dance with girls. And I feel like, that is
something to celebrate. It was owned by this lady. And she apparently is
the most badass of all. Everyone in town was
apparently afraid of her, because she stood up to everyone, who tried to like, bring down the gays. So, we're gonna go inside. We're gonna get a beer. So, we're going into the, like deep within the Red Light District, and you're not allowed to
bring cameras or video cameras. So we're turnin' it off. This is the last you get to see. So, those were my adventures in Amsterdam. I had so much fun exploring the city, and getting to know the culture there. And I love doing that. I love making little videos
about places where I go. But let me know, where
should I go to next, and make a video exploring? I'd love to do more of these. Let me know in the comments below. Put where I should go, and let me know what I should do there. And, if I do your thing, in your town, I'll put your comment in the video. If you like this video, and
you would go to Amsterdam, give this video a thumbs up. Maybe, we can go together, and become besties there. Anything's possible. If you wanna see my video
about VidCon in Amsterdam, click right there. I had so much fun. It was probably my favorite
convention in a long, long time. And you'll see why when you watch it. If you wanna check out the
latest podcast episode, click right here. It's got the one and only Connor Franta. And, if you wanna be
my person of the week, click right here. But, that is all I have
for you guys today. Thank you so much for letting
me go on these adventures, and coming along with me for the ride. I love ya. Have a good life. That's all. Bye. Prewst. - Proost. - That's a... Oh, dammit. I felt like I knew
everything, but I don't, ever. Proost, that's how you say cheers. - Cheers. That way you can edit. (laughing) 
- Hi everyone. My name is Tyler Oakley. And today, I felt like
just talking to y'all, and answering your questions. So, I asked you guys to
Tweet me your questions, with #asktyleranything. There are some juicy ones. There are some things you
guys wanna know about me. Okay, so before I answer
any of your questions, my question to you is, have you pushed the thumbs-up button yet? Because, if you have,
I'll love you forever. That's all. Okay, let's do questions. Renskey says, "How excited
are you for VidCon Europe?" I am so excited. I hope I get to see you this weekend. Everything that I'm
doing at VidCon Europe, will be in the description. Scott would like to
know, "Are you ticklish?" Scott, why you wanna know? To answer your question, I'm not ticklish. Mostly. Riley says, "On a scale of one to ten, how excited are you to
go to camp this summer with Bethany and JC,
and all of your fans?" I am so pumped. Y'all know know I love camp. I did it last year with Bethany. This year, we have a little surprise. JC Caylen is coming. So, if you haven't
registered for camp yet, you can still come. It's in August. And y'all know I have
like a little crush on JC. So, it'll be fun to
spend the week with him. (laughing) Lexi would like to know, "What do you recommend
on Audible this month?" Thank you to Audible for
sponsoring this video. I love you guys. So as you guys know, I recommend a new book on
Audible, every single month. We've got a little book club going on. This month, I am
recommending Almost Adulting, by my friend, Arden Rose. I love Audible, because I
can listen to books when I am traveling, like on a plane. I can listen to 'em at the gym. You can try Audible for
the very first time, if you use the link

So, honestly, just go searchin'. You'll find whatever you want. Again, use audible.com/tyleroakley. Thank yo Audible, I love you. You have been the best for years. And yeah. Maria would like to know, "Did you have fun on your birthday?" I had so much fun. On my birthday itself, I had just the best, relaxing day. I went to the spa. She got a massage. She got a facial. I, like, enjoyed the anemidies... Anemidies? Amenities. Amenities. I was living my life. Body positivity up the wazoo. Walkin' around naked, at the spa. (laughing) And then, in complete juxtaposition to by body positivity moment, I went to the Cheesecake
Factory, and gorged myself, with disgusting foods. And then to really celebrate my birthday, I went to Vegas. Which was beyond incredible. I went with a few of my friends. And we got to see Brittany, who I have never seen in concert. She was beyond. Like, everything you could
ever want, she delivered. And, I got to meet her. This is what happened. She was everything. What a princess of pop. A true goddess. I was not worthy. And, not only did I get to see Brittany, and then did I get to meet Brittany, but she pulled me on stage. And it was, I mean... (laughing) I have no words. Thank you everyone for
all the birthday wishes. I feel like, I was
getting texts and Tweets, and calls up the wazoo. Everyone was so kind. So, thank you. Psychobabble would like to know, "Will you do a giveaway anytime soon?" Oh my God, Psychobabble,
what a good question. Well, I would love to do a giveaway. I feel like the best way to do it, is to include you, since
you asked the question. Why not give you a little promo too. Ten of you are going to
win a signed, personalized little copy of my audio book. If you wanna enter, all you gotta do is, check out the link below. It's gonna have like all the details. And there are like two
things you gotta do to enter. So, it's super easy, and you might just win a
little package from me. I am going to announce the
winners in my next video, so be sure to push that Subscribe button. Emma says, "How do you feel
about the fact that it takes over two years to grow a pineapple?" Emma. I did not know this. You seem very passionate about it, because I looked to see how
many times you asked me this. You have Tweeted about pineapples
like 50 or like 70 times. You're really passionate about pineapples. So passionate, that I think
you deserve a little gift. So, I got a pineapple. And this pineapple took two years to grow. And this is like a baby. (groaning) You know what I hate? I hate when parents are like... You're like, "Oh how old is your child?" And they're like, "Oh 48 weeks." I'm like, "Don't make me
do math, just say how old." This is 24 months. This beautiful child. This beautiful pineapple child. You know once, I think,
in like 2014 or 15, I took a picture with a pineapple. I looked to see if Emma
was around for that, and she flipped her crap. So, that's how I know she's very passionate about pineapples. And that's why I know she
deserves this pineapple. So, Emma, check your mail. You're gettin' a care package, two years in the making. Emmzee says, "If you had to
eat one food for the rest of your life, every
day, what would it be?" Honestly, now that I know
that about pineapples, I feel like my answer has to be this beautiful pineapple. Not this, just this one. Imagine if I ate this. I feel... This feels so, like, sensual. Okay, so that is all
the questions that I got for you guys today. If you like this video, be

giving you the moment. You're on to your thousandth show at Caesar's Palace coming up. - Yeah, yeah. - Congrats. - That's amazing. - Has there ever been

And I even got to see you. This is us together. There's you, there's me. - Will you autograph it for me? - If you'd like me to, you know, I can do that. Good luck. (laughs) - Thank you so much. - That's our love. - Yeah. The most nerve wracking time is when my family is there or
when my kids are there. - Am I supposed to hold that? - Here I can take this, I can take it. So to become better best friends forever, there are questions in here on seashells. ‚ô´ Near, far, wherever you are ‚ô´ I believe No? Okay, that's okay. - No, keep going! (laughs) Dig deep right here. - Oh my God. (Tyler laughs) - You're there. - Oh my God! - You're acting like
there's something in there. You just gave me a spook. If you were captain of a ship, what would you name it? ‚ô´ I'm invincible ‚ô´ I'm invincible today ‚ô´ I'm invincible ‚ô´ Don't need no batteries today - What's my question? ‚ô´ Have you ever kissed a girl? - I tried it once, it was not for me. Have you? - Should we try? - Should we? - Yeah. (Tyler laughs) - That was everything. - Yeah, the Heart of
the Ocean, it's amazing. Sorry, everything's okay, Rene. Don't worry, that was not cheating. It's just like, spontaneous thing, - What is your life's mantra? - There's only two days during the year where there's nothing
that you can control. Yesterday and tomorrow. - Wow. - So today. - That's beautiful. ‚ô´ We're incredible ‚ô´ We're incredible today - It's all just going down. - Bye bye. - We have the star of
Scandal, Kerri Washington. - Hi. - How are you? - I'm starstruck. - Shush, don't even! - How cute is he? - Stop that. Now, I hear, correct me if I'm wrong, that you are a Disney fan. - Huge. - Huge? - Huge. Like up until I was 30, I cried every time I left Disney Land. - Wait, you're over 30? - Well, just meaning last
week I stopped crying. I love it like, from a
deep, deep core place. I love Disney. - Is there like a first
stop you have to go to? - My husband and I, we're very strategic. Yes, and we sort of, we
approach it like a battle. We're very serious about
it and we keep a pace. We don't mess around. - Well you have to, you have a day. I recently went on a
first date at Disney Land and it was like a test of all tests. - Yes, I dated a guy in
college who was like, "How do you love Disney
Land? You're an adult." And I was like, "Buh-bye." (Tyler laughs) - You do a lot of really important work and something that you've
been working on recently. - I recently learned
about financial abuse, which is actually the number one reason why women don't leave
abusive relationships and even why they go back. So I started working with
the All State Foundation and we do a purple purse because purple is the color for domestic
violence awareness. And a purse is a symbol of where you keep all of your financial well being. - I love that. That's really cool. First thing that comes to mind, exercise. - Liberating. - Ellen. - Best ever. - Yeah, duh. - [Ellen] Best ever! (Kerri screams) - I didn't even know you were here. - How are you? - I didn't even know you were here. - Ellen DeGeneres, everybody. - I was hiding. - I'm glad that was my answer, best ever. - I know. (laughing) - That would have been awkward. - First of all,
congratulations on your show. - Thank you, thank you. - I know, he's adorable. - Both of y'all need to just stop. - No one's ever done a
three-way word association. So you say best ever, and I say Portia, and then your word association. - Stunning. - Scandalous. - ABC. - Disney. - Micky Mouse - Minnie Mouse. - Queen. - Princess. (Tyler laughs) Right away, Ellen. - Fairy tale. - Okay, - Cinderella, Cinderella. - Glass slipper. - Uncomfortable. (laughing) - A suit. - And tie. - ED by Ellen. - Available now. (laughing) - Are you uncomfortable
or are you comfortable? - I'm pretty comfortable. I'm expecting some more
gluten-free pizza from you 'cause that's what I got last time I was pregnant at the Oscars. And it was the best. - Were you in the selfie? - No, I didn't. I was on the other side of
the theater and I tried. - It's okay. Can we do our own selfie right now? - Yes, please. - Cute. - I love it! - We're actually gonna sign off if you wanna sign off with us. - Oh yeah, let's, how do you, do you have a sign off? - You know, I don't. I'm gonna work on that. - Not like Oakley Out or anything? - Oakley Out. (laughing) No, but I just wanna say thank you. - Aww, thank you. - You're the best. Thank you. - You are the best. - Thank you. - You're the best. - Thank me. I feel like all I'm doing
right now is blushing. - Yeah. As if you could be cuter. - Okey-Dokey, we gotta go. - Okey-Dokey! - Okey-Dokey! - No, no, that's not a thing. - Okey-Dokey, adios-ey. - Bye. (laughing) So that was the first episode. Did you guys love it as much as I did? The answer better be yes because we put a lot of work into that. There's gonna be a new
episode every single week. You can see it first on EllenTube and then it'll be on my channel later. But you guys, I am so excited for this. I couldn't have done this without you. Literally, we have had
nine years of YouTube and I feel like it's all
led up to this moment. And I just couldn't thank you enough. Again, if you like the
show, give it a thumbs up and let me know in the comments who you want to see next week. But yeah, that's all. Okay cool, good luck with your lives. Bye. 
- Ding! - We're such jocks. - You're athletic. - I'm athletic. - What am I? - You're here. (laughter) - I need you to make us appear more weak than we are. - I can do that! - You're like, "I can't swim." "I can't see." - Corey, how do we know each other? - Tyler stalked me in college. - So, we were both at
Michigan State University. Corey was an RA. I was a freshman. So we bonded initially over reality TV. - Eight years ago. - Eight years ago. Although, Corey and I met in college, our families go way back. How, Corey? - My grandma beat up his aunt. (laughter) After his aunt pulled my aunt's hair. - It's kind of Romeo and Juliet, but without any romance. And since then, we've made so many videos. How many videos? - I have no idea. - A crap load of videos.
- Tons of videos. - But they've gotten millions
and millions of views. So I think people don't hate us. - So many views that we
started a weekly podcast. - Um hm. It won an award. What did it win? - Best LGBTQ podcast. - Since the podcast, now we've gone on an international tour. The Slumber Party Tour, we put on onsies. The Race will be easy, compared to carrying around
that suitcase of onsies. - It'll be less embarrassing. - Right. - I'm a 30-year-old. - 30, flirty and conniving--
- As a 30-year-old-- Oh, I like that. - Write that down, put it
down on the application. We've done our own competitions. You had for your birthday, a Big Brother for all of our friends, and we were the two that were into it. We're a little competitive, we're obsessed with reality TV. - Are you gonna be as
competitive as I want you to be? - I don't like to lose. I need you to be encouraging. - I'm always full of Christ's love. (laughter) I will encourage you. I would never yell at you. - Mmm.... We're America's um-- - Sweethearts. - We're America's "twink-hearts." - Stop. Do you think you would see subscribers? - Maybe. It surprises me how many
people, everywhere-- - We were in Singapore, and people knew-- - Being in Singapore
or Australia or Japan. - I'm not gonna let them get a selfie, unless they're gonna help us on the race. - Yeah, they're not getting
a selfie unless they help us. What's the worst thing you
would eat for The Race? - I'd eat it all.
- I'd eat it all. - I wouldn't eat a life frog. - I'm actually pretty hungry right now. You would not eat a frog? - A live one, no. - I would eat it for you. - Thank you. - See that's, I mean-- - We complete each other. - Yeah. - Think of how athletic
and ripped we would get running around and doin' things. - Oh, my god. All of the men would love me. - Cast another set of cute gays. - Oh, my god, yes! - And I'll pick-- - And one of them can be single, and then I'll fall in love, and then when I come back
for All-Stars without you. I'll be with him when we're married. - Wow. - That's actually not a bad idea. - Are you ready to race? Get your tennis laced up. - What is this monologue!?! Will you start every leg with a pep talk? - Get those tennis laced up! Okay, are you ready, Big Boy? - Coach, I don't know
if I've got it in me. I'm a little afraid of being on the race, 'cause I don't know if the cameramen will understand our angles. - Girl, what you got every angle. You got every angle. - I don't got every angle. (laughter) Moral of the story, why should I-- (mumbles) Why should they-- (mumbles) Why should they let us on the show? - 'Cause they'd get more of this. - Eh, not a selling point-- - And we would win! 
- Hey everyone, my name is Tyler Oakley, and back in February, to
celebrate Black History Month, I made a little video called Eight Black LGBTQ+
Trailblazers Who Inspire Me, and I talked about the
power of representation, acknowledging intersectionality, and the response was so great. In the comments of that video, I saw so many of y'all telling
me, "oh, I love this so much, and I would want another version of this, for this specific community
within the LGBTQ+ realm." Asian Americans have been
misrepresented in media, been largely left out
of school curriculums, and have been especially excluded while talking about LGBTQ+ history. So today, to celebrate
Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, I am
gonna tell you about eight Asian LGBTQ+ trailblazers who I believe deserve recognition for
their incredible work. After years of serving in the military, Dan Choi decided, "it
is time to be honest." When he revealed that he was gay, he was discharged, and he
immediately took action. He wrote an open letter
to President Obama, he was arrested three times for doing protests at the White House, and he became the face
of the fight to repeal the don't ask, don't tell legislation. After so much hard work
and never giving up, less than two years later, he
was invited by President Obama to the White House, to
witness the president sign legislation to repeal
don't ask, don't tell. A single person can change
the course of history, and Lieutenant Dan Choi did that. Evan Low was the very first
openly gay Asian American to be elected to city council
of Campbell, California. And at the age of just 26, he became the youngest Asian American
mayor in all of the country. In a country that has
historically been run by old, crusty white men,
Evan is the perfect example of somebody who's like,
"um, no, I belong here too." I just love that there's
somebody my age-ish that is an absolute boss
and is running stuff, and I'm obsessed with him. When Cecilia Chung began to
transition at the age of 28, she was fired from her job, and she was cut out of her family's lives. This directly resulted in homelessness, a dependence on sex work, which for her was often dangerous and
violent, and even drug abuse. Despite all of this, she persevered through the unique economic strains and the lack of protections
that transgender people face, and she went on to join the San
Francisco Health Commission, where she was directly responsible for making San Francisco the first city in the entire country to cover
gender confirmation surgery. Almost all people in the LGBTQ+
community face aggression and adversity just because
they're trying to be themselves. But Cecilia inspires me because, not only did she persevere
through all of these challenges, but then she turned around and decided, "it's gonna be my life's work to make sure that what I went through,
nobody else has to." Ifti Nasim was an openly
gay, Muslim, Pakistani poet, who came to America to escape persecution because of his sexual orientation. Ifti is probably most
well-known for writing a book of poetry called Narman, which is said to be the
very first publication to ever have any gay themes
in the language of Urdu. He pushed the conversation
of LGBTQ+ tolerance in his community, and his
work went on to inspire an entire generation of Pakistani poets who focus on honesty and identity. Like, think of all the gay
haikus now, because of Ifti. Poems are hard to write, like haikus, who even knows how to do that? Five-seven-five, let's go, okay. Margaret Cho is an openly queer comedian who uses comedy to show
how false constructions of race, gender, and sexuality
operate to demean identity. She embraces the intersections of her female, queer, and Asian identities, and uses them to challenge
stereotypes and demand equality. While her frank and blunt
humor might be controversial, she speaks her mind, and
she does not hold back, and that is what I appreciate. Ongina was on the very first
season of RuPaul's Drag Race, and I always loved her, I
thought she was so great. While she was on the show,
she came out as HIV positive, and that was one of the first
times I witnessed somebody that I really looked up
to speak openly about it. Ongina has spent her entire
career being open and authentic and visible, and she
works to give a platform to LGBTQ+ people living with HIV, so that they can share their experiences. RuPaul always talks about how
you need charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent, and
Ongina has all of those, but I think she especially
exemplifies somebody with nerve, somebody who stands up, who's unafraid, somebody who's brave in
everything that they do. I just, I love Ongina. Kiyoshi Kuromiya was born in
a Wyoming internment camp, and he committed his entire life to racial and sexual orientation equality. He was extremely active in
the civil rights movement, and he was even Martin
Luther King Jr.'s assistant, which I never learned about. One of the most powerful
stories I read about Kiyoshi was how he protested napalm
use in Vietnam in 1968. This was brilliant. So he made this huge announcement about how he was gonna burn a dog alive at the University of
Pennsylvania's library. Thousands of people turned up to protest, only to find a note from Kiyoshi. Back in 1968, that was like a mic drop. It's easy to care about only
things that directly affect you and your personal life,
but I think Kiyoshi is the perfect example
of somebody who stands up for all disenfranchised voices,
not just his own community. George Takei is a Hollywood legend, and most people probably know
him for his role in Star Trek, but I love him because he has such an intentional use of his celebrity. It would've been easy for him to just ride out being a celebrity, getting likes and retweets
just by being relatable, but he stands for something, and he is an active representative
of the LGBTQ+ community. Since he came out in 2005, he has not stayed silent
for about a half a minute. He has spoken out about marriage equality, the employment non-discrimination act, gay conversion therapy,
equality in the Boy Scouts, LGBTQ+ homelessness, and so much more. He talks the talk, he walks the walk, and he inspires me to take a
stand when I know I should. Okay, so that is all I
have for you guys today. I feel like that's a good list, but there are so many other amazing people within this community that
I want you to know about. So if you have somebody that you love that I didn't get a chance to talk about, let me know in the comments below. Tell us all about why you love them, why you look up to them,
I wanna learn more. I believe representation is so important in so many different ways, but I wanna especially give a little love to the people in my little
world, on YouTube, on Twitter, the people that I love to follow and who inspire me and teach me within the Asian LGBTQ+ world, so I'm gonna link to those people below. But like I said, if you
have somebody you love, let me know in the comments. Okay, so that is all I
have for you guys today. If you liked this video, be
sure to give it a thumbs up, and I hope you have a great Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, and thank you for watching,
and good luck with your lives. Okay, bye. 
- Hey everyone, my name is Tyler Oakley and I am here at the White House. You guys, I am so
excited to be here today. I am here for the Beating the Odds summit. It's the third year
that they've done this. It's an opportunity for the first lady to invite a whole bunch of
college bound students who have you know who have beaten the odds, and you know passed
insurmountable challenges and bring them to the White House, honor them for seeking higher education, and today I am actually
hosting and moderating a panel with the first lady and a whole bunch of other incredible, inspiring people. I'll introduce you to
those people in a second. Okay, so we are backstage,
ready for the event, and look who I'm with. Are you guys-- - Reach higher, go to college. - Already hitting the talking points. - Get some college. - We have an incredible
panel of inspiring people that we will be chatting with all morning and I, I gotta say, I am I
think most excited to see this many people here. There are over 130 college bound students who have beat the odds,
who are redefining success, who are inspiring so many in
their own communities, and I just look out into the
crowd and I see the future and that is the coolest feeling. I just am giddy, so thank you for-- - The future looks good, doesn't it? - Yeah, it's a good look. Hey everyone, okay so we just
finished the panel today. - It was so cool. - It was so much fun. - Yeah, yeah. - Thank you for having me. - Thank you for doing it. You managed it well. - Shucks, stop. So last time we were together was in 2014. I had blue hair then. - You did. - Do you remember that? - I like this. - Thank you, thanks, it's a natural look. - White House ready. - God bless. Yeah we were in Atlanta last time and we were doing stuff with Reach Higher, which you guys can, I'm gonna put the link to that video below if you want to watch that, you should. And today was all about what? - It's about supporting kids in particular first generation kids who
were going to college. - We were both first generation. - Yeah, well yeah absolutely. But this was amazing group of young people all of whom are gonna
start their first years at either four year college
or a community college and we had an awesome panel. We had Jidenna on the panel. - Oh my god, incredible. - And gorgeous too, and
really smart Stanford alum. Secretary King, secretary
of education as well as a former student who
was Beating the Odds participant a couple of years ago, and she was back giving advice. - And she was so great,
but it was 130 students from all over the country who maybe are facing challenges
that you guys are facing where you feel like, oh my gosh, how am I even gonna figure
out how to go to college? How am I even going to figure out, like my parents didn't do
it, my siblings didn't do it. How am I going to figure this out? And I think the message that I was getting from everyone today was like, you can. We did, you will, you can. - This is going to be the best investment that you'll make in yourself. - Totally. - If you want to have the freedom to earn money and support
your family and travel and do great things it all starts with getting a college
education and finishing it, so we were able to answer some pretty good questions that students presented. - They were good. If you guys have questions,
put 'em in the comments below. I'm gonna be replying to like
if you have college questions or how do I apply for a scholarship? Or things like that,
I'll answer some of those in the comments below, but
also, this is a great community. You guys, if you see a
question in the comments, be sure to give your input because I don't have all the answers. So, we're actually about
to see the dogs of the White, I'm so flustered right now. (laughs) The dogs of the White House
are here, and I'm like-- - Tyler's not nervous
about me, the president-- - Well we go way back. - Bo and Sunny. Bo and Sunny! - Well I heard they get
all fluffed up and stuff? - They do, they got their
hair brushed up for you. - Oh God bless. Oh goodness gracious. - [Michelle] Look who's here! - Oh my gosh! Hey puppy! Oh they are beautiful. That's Sunny. - This is Sunny, this is Bo. She's the baby. And Bo's our little old man. They're Portuguese Water
Dogs, or you can itch him. - Oh my gosh. - [Voiceover] It's the
happiest you've ever been. - We're trying to see if the
pups can do tricks right now. - [Michelle] Roll over! - Yay! Almost there. Good enough. If there's one thing you want to tell the people, what would you tell them? - You know, I can't say,
I can't say this enough. I am who I am because I went to college and got an education. It just gives you the
foundation that you need. It gives you the confidence, the skills that you need to go on and
do whatever you want in life and that's what we want for
all of our young people. As Tyler said, the country needs you, but to be able to compete for those jobs of the future in an increasingly
globalizing economy, you've got to have a college education or, again, there are many paths to do it. Two year college, getting some training. - Keep learning, that's I think everyone can take that lesson no
matter what your age, no matter what you do, just keep learning. There's going to be resources on how you can do that in the description below. Thank you so much for having me. - Thank you. - Always so much fun. - You did a great job today. - Stop! Don't make me blush. Yeah, go and go watch
our last video together. You'll see, we look like babies then. - I know, I know, we've aged. What happened? - Oh my god, not that much. (laughs) Okay, we'll see you guys soon. - All right, bye. - So I just finished hanging
out with the first lady and talking about higher education. It was a dream. You guys, it was so much fun
to be here at the White House. To meet the pups, oh my god, so cute. Another great day at the White House. I mean, can you believe
that we get to go do this? How cool. If you guys like this video,
be sure to give it a thumbs up and let me know, what are
your plans for your future? Let me know in the comments below. Be sure to check out
everything in the description. We have some great resources for you. Thank you to the White House, thank you to Miss Michelle Obama
for always being a dream. So much fun, okay, thanks y'all. (pleasant music) It's super chill. (laughing) Well last time we had like a fancy set up and I was like, anybody can do that. - Yeah. - But this is like for us. (laughs) And this, yeah, my arm, yeah that's why. 
- Hi everyone, my name is Tyler Oakley, and today I am so excited because I finally have the
results from my 23andMe test that I took a few videos ago. If you recall, I spit into a tube, I sent it out into the world, and I finally know where I'm from. I am so excited because well, lord knows, I'm probably just gonna be like eight different versions
of white, but who knows? Anything can be in my genes. Thank you so much to 23andMe
for sponsoring this video. If you don't know about 23andMe, it is basically a personal genetic service for you to learn more about yourself. The name 23andMe comes from the fact that there's 23 pairs of
chromosomes in human DNA, and they teach you all about
where you're from in the world, your hair and your facial
features, your taste preferences, how you sleep at night, and so much more. So here's the deal, my buddy
knows the results already. I know nothing, so he's
already reached out to people that are subscribed to my videos
from all around the world, in the countries where
my results say I'm from. These people, y'all, some of you guys, are gonna quiz me to see how well I know the countries
that I'm actually from. Spoiler, I know nothing
about anything to begin with, so I'm probably not gonna know anything unless the knowledge about
the countries is in my genes, and I instinctually know things. It's doubtful, but who knows? So let's see how well I know
the countries that I'm from. Okay so, I'm about to
figure out my results. I'm actually really nervous
and kind of excited, let's see what it has to say. Okay so going into this,
I know that my parents have told me that I am Belgian, Polish, and I don't know how much of
that is a lie from my parents, but this is about to tell me the truth. Okay so, my results are in and I love that it was a breakdown of like percentages of where I'm from, but at the top it says Tyler 100%. I'm 100% me, that's beautiful. First things first, this says that I am
33.9% British and Irish. Now, I feel like I'm
gonna know these countries because I've been to both countries, but let's test my knowledge. - Hi, I'm Matthew Dempsey
and I'm from Wiltshire, UK. Our question is, the British
Navy used which artist's music to scare off Somali pirates
off the east coast of Africa? Miley Cyrus or Britney Spears? - To scare off pirates? Have either of them had like a pirate era? Have either of them showed up to an awards show dressed as a pirate? I'm sure Britney Spears has,
she's the queen of costumes. I feel like, as weapon of torture the Bangerz era could be used. (laughing) I'm gonna guess Britney Spears, 'cause I think she has the power. (bell ringing) Ah, I was right! Look at me, I just know myself so well and my people the British,
the Brits, me, us. Okay next question is all about Ireland, which I have been on
tour to multiple times, so I feel like I know these
people, I know myself. - Hi, my name is Jackson Lanna
and I'm from Dublin, Ireland. Our question is, does Ireland
have the lowest number of annual UFO sightings or
car accidents in Europe? - I don't remember particularly being like afraid of cars on the road in Ireland, nor do I remember any like,
sightings of things in the sky. I'm gonna guess Irish people have the lowest amount of
UFO sightings in Europe? (bell ringing) Look at me, wow! I really know myself. Okay so next result from my 23andMe says that I am 25% French and German. Oh my god. That feels like ritzy,
to be French, my god. Now I have only been to France once, I've never been to Paris,
but I have been to Chamonix when I was on the Amazing Race. It felt a little bit cooler
than I am, like you know it's like ritzy and fancy
and things like that. So I don't know how much I'm
connected to being French, but let's test my knowledge. - Hi, my name is Marine and
I am from Reve in France. Our question is, in France are you allowed
to marry a relative or are you allowed to marry a dead person? - My god. (laughing) Either way, it's not
looking good for the French. I hope you can't marry a dead person, but then I also hope you
can't marry like, your sis. Oh my god, what if you could
marry your dead sister? That's not what we want. That's not the French way. It's only one of those things. I'm gonna guess, marry your relative? (buzzer) You can marry a dead person in France? Girl, y'all, me? I was judging you, but I
guess I need to judge me, So as far as Germany goes, I have only been to
Frankfurt for one layover, so I feel like I'm not gonna
know anything, but let's test. - Hi, I'm Tina and I'm
from Waltrop, Germany, and our question is what
was invented by a German, marshmallows or gummy bears? - Either way, what a beautiful thing. Thank you Germany for your
contributions to the world. I feel blessed by either result, but I feel like Germans
cook up some weird stuff. Are there bears in Germany? Gelatin is in marshmallows, and gelatin comes from
the bones of horses. Are there horses in Germany? Yes. I don't know if there's bears in Germany, so I'm gonna guess marshmallows. (buzzer) Girl, I feel like as we go
down to lower percentages of who I am as far as ancestry goes, I'm gonna know less and less. It's just hard to tap into that small percentage of who I am. So it's not a surprise
that I got it wrong, but you know, you live and you learn. So the next thing is, I am 0.3%, big numbers, watch out. I'm 0.3% Scandinavian. That feels like I should be taller and broader and blonder I feel. - Hi, my name is Ilma
and I'm from Scandinavia. Our question is, in Sweden what is the
most popular souvenir, is it a moose crossing
sign, or a troll doll? - I feel like this is a trick question, 'cause my perception of
Scandinavia is like ice, and icepicks, and snow
and like, moose things. So I feel like I'm supposed
to think it's that, but I bet it's troll dolls. (buzzer) See, but 0.3% Scandinavian. How was I to feel that in my bones? Now even less than
Scandinavia, which was 0.3%, I am 0.2% Finnish. I don't think I could
pick Finland out on a map, so I'm probably not gonna
know anything about Finland. - Hi, my name is Cindy and
I'm from Inge, Finland. Our question is, does Finland
host the world championships of Uno the card game,
or rubber boat throwing? I would not say that I would be an expert in either category, but I have played Uno, I have not thrown a rubber
boot as far as I can remember. If I were to go based on what
I would inherently be good at, I would have to go with something that I've actually already
tried, which is Uno. So I'm gonna guess Finland
hosts the world championship for Uno, but I feel like
it's the boot throwing one. But I'm gonna go with Uno. (buzzer) Ugh, I don't know anything
about any place where I'm from. I only got two out of six right. Well, I have learned some things today. I have learned where I am
actually from in the world, but I've also learned that I know nothing about those places. So I guess I need to go
explore those places. If you live in any of those countries, I'll see you in a minute. I need to go back to my roots. Thank you so much to 23andMe
for sponsoring this video. I had so much fun learning about myself and taking the test, it was a lot of fun. I can't wait to read all
the rest of the results. If you want to do 23andMe, all you've gotta do is go
to 23andMe.com/tyleroakley and you can get kits
for you and your family. Thank you so much for watching everyone. If you like this video,
give it a thumbs up and let me know in the comments
where you think you're from. Also, don't forget to subscribe, if you're not subscribed, how dare you? That's all I have for you
guys today, have a good life. I'll see you guys very soon, later. 
Hey everyone, my name is Tyler Oakley and you guys had some questions so I have some answers Let's go! Rachel says "Are you enjoying the men's gymnastics team?" I...don't mean to objectify men...so I can't answer (laughs) No, I think they're really talented and great...er... ...muscles (laughs) They seem like really kind gentlemen, and I hope that they win gold Ali says "What is your favourite show as of now?" I am liking a lot of new shows right now, I'm really into Big Brother right now, even though this season is kinda annoying me, I'm getting into Unreal which I accidentally watched the last episode of first and I started watching it and I'm like "What is going on?" I was so confused! I was like right in the middle of all the drama, I'm like "Am I...did I miss something?" And then I'm like nearing the end of the episode and I check and it was the finale I'm like "I'm such an idiot" I'm also really into this web-series called Sublets right now, it was made by one of my besties from high-school, Dolan, who I made a video with back in the day of us kissing, if you haven't seen that it's right there. Um, but he made a web-series and, you know when your friend makes a project, and you're like "Ooh, I hope it's good!" because either way I'm gonna be supportive, but like I want it to come from a genuine place, like I actually like it: thank God, I actually like it! If you wanna watch it, the web-series, the link is below. It's the whole first season, it's out right now, it's called Sublets, it's funny, I love it. What else am I into right now - I'm watching this web-series called Summer Break, if you wanna watch that, the link to that is below, erm, but it's about this like group of friends, in Southern California, and like there's summer at the beach, and it really reminds me of, like, the shows that I used to watch when I was growing up, in middle school, high school like the O.C. and The Hills and The Good Beach. It's got tons of drama, it's on three days a week, and I really like it! If you wanna watch it, the link to that is below. Hannah says "What level are you on Best Fiends? I'm currently stuck on level 90." Well, Hannah, I hate to break it to you but I'm level 95! Sorry 'bout it! Audrey says "How do you feel about Psychobabble hitting 100 episodes?" It is insane that we have recorded a hundred episodes, that's fifty hours of podcast, that's nuts to me! Thank you to everyone who listens to every week, or tunes in whenever they can! And, I'm not going to spoil anything but something special is coming with Psychobabble very soon! Claudia says "Salty or sweet?" I am, like, more of a salty type of guy...I like my salt, sorry! She's a sodium queen, what can I say?! Sarah says "Did you know if two people on opposite sides of the world each drop a slice of bread, the Earth briefly becomes a sandwich?" Okay, so if this is true, I looked up what the exact opposite side of the Earth is from where I live in L.A. and it's...the closest thing is Madagascar so if any of you are in Madagascar, let me know and let's like plan something where we both drop our bread ...do y'all got bread in Madagascar? I don't know, probably, everyone's got carbs... Amy says "Do you have serious political views? If so, what are they?" Please don't let Donald Trump ruin my country and I know there's gonna be some people out there who are like "Ugh, I'm unsubscribing because you're you're trashing Trump." I would rather have zero subscribers than have Donald Trump be President... Yeah! Sorry I'm not sorry! So if you wanna learn how to vote, my dear friend Hank Green made a video series on how to vote in every single state. It breaks it down, it makes it so easy, the link to that is below. Please register to vote. "How do you pray the gay away?" Ayyyyyy, girl (laughs) not how you start a prayer! Hey, what's up? Um, how are things?...Good, didn't ask for your life story, so... Down to basics, um, so there's this like thing, here on Earth, people are like upset that I'm gay, um, and it's like... I know, I know! It's not like even a problem with you but they're having drama, so could you just like...make a little switcharoo, not cause I'm upset with being gay. Other people are feeling a little bit, like, uneasy because I'm so special... No, you don't fix that? No, there's nothing to fix? Oh, okay. Well...tell everyone I say hey...I will, yeah, I'll tell them, thanks. Okay, (inaudible) Um, just talked to God, He said not a problem - about me being gay - but he did want me to relay the message: Westboro Baptist Church - literally f*** off. Emily says "How excited are you for camp?" I am so excited for camp, my friend Korey is coming, my friend Dolan is coming, my mom is coming, me and Bethany Mota will be there, I get to hang out with all of you guys, if you wanna come there's still some spots available, the link is in the description below GreenBoy says "Tell us what you know about your episode on the Real O'Neals." So I don't know if you guys know this, but if you follow me on Twitter you would know I am obsessed with the Real O'Neals, I think it's a great show, it's on ABC, the first season was hilarious, And I was tweeting about it and talking about it on the podcast, and then, out of the blue, I got invited to be a cameo on the season 2 premiere, it's gonna air on National Coming Out Day which is October 11th, so if you wanna watch that, you will see me! I got to hang out with the cast that day, and they were so nice and welcoming, it was so much fun, I cannot wait for you guys to see it! Anna says "When will you be coming back to Canada?" I was actually just in Canada, I went for a marathon-relay that I ran It was like in the mountains and the woods, and I gotta tell you a story: the best part about that whole weekend was, after the marathon, they had this huge party, where you would go as teams, and my team, all of my friends, we dressed up in head to toe gold, and you would have a theme song for your team, and ours was Thank You For Being A Friend from the Golden Girls, the theme song we had to compete in a whole bunch of games, but one of the competitions was we had to choreograph a dance routine to our theme song, I was like "Everyone in a line, five, six, seven, eight!" I was like into it. Here's our routine: ('Thank You For Being A Friend' playing) Woooooo! (clapping and cheering) (lots of applause and cheering) So, yes, that happened, which, I mean, to answer your question, I don't know if I'll be allowed back in Canada any time soon (laughs) If you like this video, be sure to give it a thumbs up, and I wanna know who is playing Pok√©mon Go? What team are you on, and what's the best Pok√©mon you've got so far? I wanna know, let me know in the comments below. And I will see you guys very soon, okay? I love you, mwah! Ready? Ba, da, da... (all singing) Thank you for being a friend, Ba, da, da... (all singing) Travelled down the road and back again Ba, da, da... (all singing) Your heart is true, you're a pal and a confidant (inaudible singing)...And if you had a party and invited everyone you knew... 
- Oh, I got it, I got it! (laughter) - My beard! Oh, there's a long one! - [Woman, Off-Screen]
Make a wish! Make a wish! (laughs) - Bonjour! (laughter) Hi everyone! It's Tyler, and who am I here with today? - I'm Alex Wassabi! - I'm here with Alex Wassabi, who is my best friend of all time. - Our parents were close friends. - Our parents were in a group love affair. So we're brothers. - I was not aware. So we could never date
then if we're brothers. - I take it all back! I've made a huge mistake! (laughter) So next month, Alex is coming to a very special event with me. - Mhmm.
- What are we doing? - We're going to camp. - My favorite part of
camp last year was when, every day during lunch
I would serve the people tater tots, and mac n cheese and things. This is me serving. (laughs) And I thought, well, when we're at camp, we should have a day where
we serve lunch together. - Okay, what should we serve, Tyler? (both laugh) - We should make sloppy Joe's-- - (gasps) My favorite. - But, the thing about
camp is, I feel like the friendships you form are so close. Closer than close. And so to kind of
experience that firsthand, maybe we should get so close. So Alex, I think we should become so close that we become one person. I say we duct tape ourselves together. I'll use one arm and you use one arm. - Easy. - And then the rest of
our body will be fused. But I think we need help to become one. - Okay. - So special guest, pop on in! - Hello, I'm LaurDIY. - You got a boyfriend? - No. - Good answer. - Just this one. - (laughter and screaming) - Okay, so you're ticklish. Got it. (audio fast-forwarding) - Yes! We're done! - So like I said, the
friendships you form at camp are closer than any friendship
you'll ever make in life. Almost as close as this. (ding) - First, we need half an onion. - So I'm only allowed to use this arm. - I'm only allowed to use this arm. - So maybe you should hold
it and I'll just whack it? - Okay, go. - No! - Hard, hard. - Oh, wow! (screams and laughs) Okay, so that's half of that. Now you get this green pepper. Give me half. - Okay. - Oh my God. - Hiyah! - Wow. Okay, so now chop it. - (makes clinking sound) Sure, yes, yes, yes, bitch! - This is gonna be the

(exclaiming) Yes, honey, yes. Are you my hype girl right now? - You're so good! - Do you think that's chopped enough? You suck. (laughter) - We got our bowl of-- - You just screamed in Daddy's ear. (laughter) - We got a bowl of onions and peppers. Yes, now what's the next step? - Meat! - I feel like we're kind of like-- bring it around town! - Bring it around town! - Okay, so now we've chopped our veggies, which is step one, but step two is-- what is that? - [Both] Garlic powder. Ketchup. - And mustard. - And one more. - And brown sugar! Mmm. You wanna try? It's good! - So you need 3 teaspoons--
is that a teaspoon? - Yeah. - Oh yes, slam it in. Give the people the sugar! - Oh, that was close. Now some of this garlic powder. Half a teaspoon. There we go, that seems right. (laughter) Bam! And now what, ketchup and mustard. One teaspoon of mustard. - And we need three quarters
of a cup of ketchup. (laughter) - Okay I got it. - Careful with those beautiful teeth. Oh wow. - (singing)‚ô´three quarters
of a cup of ketchup‚ô´ - [Both] ‚ô´three quarters
of a cup of ketchup‚ô´ (beat boxing and singing) - ‚ô´three quarters of a cup of ketchup‚ô´ ‚ô´three quarters of a cup of ketchup‚ô´ - Oh shit, okay now mix it. (laughing) Get me out of here! Wait, do we have a whisk? Come with me. This is whisky business, y'all. (laughing) - Why are you jiggling? - Oh I forgot. I thought it was supposed
to be like a Kitchen-Aid. It's meat time. - Release the meat! - Oh my god, you're really taking it. Scurry on over to the stove. So, now that we've made
all of our ingredients-- - We place the meat in the pan. - I don't think that's what we do. Grab this and now-- - Put that in there. (screaming and exclaiming) - Now it's time for the
meat, Alex's favorite part. Now be so gentle. Oh my god, not gentle at all. Don't move a muscle. What'd I tell you? - Let me flip it! - No, don't flip it. - I 'm a flipper. - Oh my god, just absolutely not. Now, what I'm giving you today is metallic duct tape realness. Category is: cinched! - [LaurDIY, o.s] What's
happening over there with those two hands? - These old things? - [Laur] Look at Alex!
- Bitch! (laughter) Wow, I gotta say, this looks
like a natural delicacy. So, what's cookin' good lookin'? - We got the sloppy Joe, all
we need to add is the sauce. - My arm is not strong
enough for that slowness. Hurry up! There it is! There you have it, a sloppy Joe! (laughing, screaming) Ow, yowzer! I can't wait to make this at summer camp. (laughter) The two of us are about to
waltz out at camp duct-taped. This is actually how we were born. - Is it? - Yeah, don't you
remember? Us in the womb? Okay, grab it. Okay, so I think we did it. (laughs) - Yes! - It looks so, not wet enough. All you need to do now is you
put a little bit on there, so what you're gonna-- (gasps) what are you doing! I'm gonna kill you! (laughs) - This is a collaboration. - Dinner is served. - Bon appetit. - Be so gentle. Look how gentle I was,
now you have to replicate. Is that good? Is it kinda good? - It's good. - Gimme that. - Wait, Pac-Man, go. - Slow down, I got too nervous! (coughing) Oh my god, that's actually really good. That was delicious. Oh, so she loves it. She's a meat fiend. I read that about you. If you liked this video, be

- Hi everyone! My name is Tyler Oakley and this is my video (laughs) for today. "Tyler where'd you get
that sweater it's so cute!" So I'm assuming you're
asking about the sweater I wore in my last video. It's from American Apparel. If you didn't know, American
Apparel is going out of business so... I went there and the sales are crazy so I went and I got every color (laughs) because that's what I do. I don't know what happens in my brain, but when I like something I'm like, oh I need 40 of those. I have a black T-shirt
from American Apparel. It's just called I
think like the boxer tee or something like that or the hammer tee. The hammer tee. And it's black and it's plain and it fits and I liked it so much
I went back and I bought like 40 more. I don't know, I can't help it, I just... Part of me is thinking, okay,
well Steve Jobs is all like oh you have to simply your
life like eliminate all these options in your life like every time you have to make a decision it's taking away from the
productivity of your life. So, I'm like, Oh He always wore the same
outfit everyday to like get rid of that. So does what's his head, that
one guy who made Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg. So I'm like, maybe I'll be
productive if I don't have to figure out what T-shirt
to wear so I bought just one T-shirt and I always
just wear the black T-shirt. Of course the one day I'm
not wearing the black T-shirt I talk about this black T-shirt, but it's a really good T-shirt
and I bought like 40 of them and I love my T-shirt. It's a good T-shirt. What can I say? Back to your question,
where did I get the sweater? American Apparel. Devon says, "Tyler, do you
have a mole on your wrist? "Apparently, all gays have
moles on their wrists." I don't have a mole on my wrist. You probably saw this is
what you're referring to. It's an acorn tattoo. But I love that you are like
jumping to that conclusion and you are all caps all about it. "Have you actually read
any YouTuber books?" Yes, I have like every
single YouTuber book. I haven't read all of them yet. I'm getting through them. I am just about Josh
Sundquist's new book called Love and First Sight. He is another YouTuber

about moving to a new place?" Having a dishwasher. I used to just like pile my dishes in the
kitchen for like a week, two weeks, and then it would get grotesque and then I would be like, I hate my life. It would get to the point
where I would get... This is gonna be so grody... Tinfoil and put it over a bowl
and have my cereal like that 'cause I saw it on like
Tumblr or something. And I would rather do that
than have to clean my bowl. (sighs and laughs) Times were tough. And like, I just wouldn't
use utensils anymore. I literally just be like, mmm delicious. I love all this like (stammering). But now, I'm like, yeah, give me a fork. Who cares, I'll wash it. There are things in my
new home that I just... There's no other way to put it, I love it. Jess wants to know what
is my one gay regret. What is my one gay regret. I think I was bad at being
inclusive to the rest of the gay community when I was younger. I think that's really shitty of me. And not just the other letters and LGBTQ+, but like also other people
within the gay community like people of color or
gays with disabilities things like that. I feel like I regret not
stepping up my bitch ass up when it came to being better
for my brothers and sisters and siblings within the LGBTQ+ community. YanLin says, "Would you
ever do an apartment tour?" I don't know. Would you guys like to see my new home? Maybe I will. Give this video a thumbs
up if you want that. Maybe I would do it. Alexis says, "Do you ever
want to go on tour again?" Absolutely. I have plans for things that I want to do in the near future. But in the meantime, I am
actually going to a couple events that I'm so excited
to meet you guys at. VidCon in America and VidCon in Europe. So, if you want to go to
those, the details on those are below. Faith says, "Can you reenact
a scene from La La Land?" (beeping) Jazmin says, "Will you ever
get a carer in politics "or run for president?" I don't know. I don't know. So, the last time I
was at the White House, I got to meet a guy called Kal Penn. This is him. He is somebody that went from
entertainment to politics and obviously could just do
acting and be good to go. But he decided to join the
Obama administration and work at the White House
and do public service and it showed me that, you know what, if I want to do that, I can. And maybe who knows, maybe someday I will. I don't know. And finally, "Tyler will
you come to Idaho because "we are just a bunch
of potatoes and we need "your happiness." Listen, I will go where I'm needed, okay? I will go where I will
have the most impact. But I gotta say, you are
really sweet talking me with that potato talk because
I love a sweet potato, a baked potato, a curly fry, a waffle fry, even smiley fries. You know, the frozen ones
that they give you in middle school that are like disgusting
even those types of potatoes I'll live with. Mashed potatoes, yum, delicious. I just love potatoes. So yes, I'm on my way. So, I think that is all I
have for you guys today. I hope you guys like this video. If you did, be sure to give it a thumbs up and if you want to see my latest video, click right there. If you want hear my latest

- Hey, everyone! My name is Tyler Oakley and I feel like I have been so busy with making the Chosen Family series and now that it's done I
can finally tell you all everything that I've been up to because I been, like,
traveling all around the world doin' some stuff that I
think is fun and interesting that I wanted to share with you guys. So, here's what I've been up to. Now, y'all know that
it is in my life goals to get an EGOT which is an Emmy, Grammy, an Oscar, and a Tony and while, so far, I
have not been successful with any of those I feel
like I'm one step closer in ways that EGOT holders are not and that is I got a Visibility
award from Out Web Fest and I got a Shorty award
for best web series for the Tyler Oakley
Show, so, Meryl Streep, eat your damn heart out. So, when I went to the OUT Web Fest, it was such a fun night
because Gigi Gorgeous was being honored who I absolutely love. Hannah Hart presented me with my award. I just was, like, filled
with so much love. The coolest thing was
talking about visibility and the importance of
representation within media for LGBTQ plus people. So being surrounded by so
many inspiring creators was just heartwarming and
I love this little world. Another fun thing that I did was I went to the YouTube Summit which is, like, a gathering of every YouTuber
from around the world to get together and discuss hot topics or what's going on in the industry. The coolest thing that happened was I took a selfie with Will Smith. This is it. Look at us. Beautiful. One of my favorite things that I did in the past couple months was I went to the University of
Kentucky for a speaking event which was so much fun and
I am always so nervous whenever I go to, like,
college speaking events 'cause I never know if
people are even gonna come, you know, it's just, like, nerve wracking 'cause I have no clue and especially 'cause I've
never been to Kentucky, but then so many of y'all came out and, like, got to hang out and
I got to meet so many of you. You were all so sweet and it
was one of the most fun crowds. I love doing speaking
events like this because A I never thought I would
be going to Kentucky any time soon so, like, when
they randomly invited me I'm like, "Yes, please. Come
meet my little Kentucky babes." And then, number two,
I feel like it's like intimate gossip session
where I get to tell you all the inside scoop that I
wouldn't normally put in a video 'cause maybe it's a little ris-kay. If you want me to come to your school, I'll put, like, information on how you can get your school to get
me to come and hang out with you guys in the description below. I went on a couple vacations
that I won on The Amazing Race. So, when you're on The Amazing Race, if you win an episode, you win a trip and because we were the team
that won the most episodes, we won a bunch of trips. So, I finally used them. I went to St. Thomas with my friend Brett and I was so excited to have
the vacation of a lifetime and then I showed up and
they had lost my luggage and I tried to keep cool
and I tried to keep calm and so I went to Kmart and
I bought all new things and the best little
silver lining of it all was once my luggage actually showed up, I had fallen in love with
all of my things from Kmart and they're not even
paying for this promo, so you're welcome, Kmart, but I bought this cute
black t-shirt with a pocket and I loved it so much that I went back and bought four more. And then after that I
went on an Alaskan cruise with my friend Korey who you
might know from the podcast, and I don't think I would've
ever planned an Alaskan cruise, but it was one of the trips that we'd won on The Amazing Race, but
I absolutely loved it. Like who knew a big, ol'
glacier could just be exciting? (laughs) I had never seen
a glacier in real life and after all of the
drama with the Titanic, I just felt like, how
important, how beautiful, especially before they all
melt, to see one in real life. I also went to VidCon in Anaheim which this was like my
seventh or eighth VidCon. I can't even keep track. The very first VidCon I went to, I rode my bike all the way to VidCon. I waited in lines to meet
all my favorite YouTubers and the fact that I get to go now and be, like, a guest,
I get to be on panels, I get to have my own meet
and greets to meet you guys, I got to make that video where you guys came and shared your
stories, and I even hosted the YouTube on stage
show which was bonkers and so much fun. But the fact that I'm, like,
introducing Jason Derulo, how weird, how random,
but totally appropriate. And I was on a panel for
Escape the Night season two, Joey Graceffa's YouTube
Red show that I was in. If you haven't watched that yet, the first, like, three or four
episodes are out right now, but it's, like, a weekly show. It was, like, incredible and intense and the most scary thing
that I've ever done because every single second I felt I was gonna get killed off, so, get ready, you might see me die in the most glorious way possible. Who knows what's gonna happen? Plus, we are on billboards
for it all over the country, so if you see them, send me pics. Here's one of them. Look at
me, mom, I'm on a billboard. Ooh, another thing that I did recently was I went to Toronto for the I Heart Radio Much Music Awards and I presented the Fan Fave
International Group or Artist with Alessia Cara and Shenae Grimes and Niall Horan won so
he came out on stage, we got to hug it out, it
was like we were reunited, it's been awhile. And I feel, like, how
beautiful to have gone from present Niall a flower crown to now presenting him with his own award for being a solo artist. Look at us. A glow up. The awards were so much fun. I got to catch up with, like,
Alessia Cara and Joe Jonas. They were both hosting the awards. I was on the hunt for Carly Rae Jepsen because I was in her
homeland and she was there, but I did not see her which
was devastating, obviously. You know who I did see though? I was at the hotel the
night before the awards and I was like, "Ooh, I
can, like, squeeze in, like, "an 11 p.m. workout session." And I went to the gym and there was none other than KJ Apa from Riverdale and he was lookin' fine and I was like, I was like, "Oh my god, wait, I know him." And I was doing my arms,
as one does, and I go, "Are you using that?" And he goes, "No." So I think we have, like, a connection. (laughs loudly) That's the
extent of our conversation. So that is all I've been up to. I feel like I've been
so busy running around, doing all those things,
plus Chosen Family, which thank you so much
for all the support on. I have had so much fun making that series, but I'm actually really
excited for what's next. I am back in Los Angeles for a little bit of time before the next adventure, but what have you guys been up to? Let me know in the comments below. I wanna know everything that
you have been up to this summer and if you like these little videos where I give you updates on my life, give this video a thumbs up. Maybe I will do more updates if you guys like them. And one last thing,
because I have received so many messages from y'all sayin', "Ugh, I missed my chance to
get my Chosen Family merch" I am bringing every single design back just for the weekend, so if you wanna get any of the designs still benefiting all of the charities that they are supporting, you can go to represent.com/tyler. All four designs are
available just this weekend. Once they are gone, they are gone. They come in a bunch of different designs on a bunch of different types of merch, so, go check 'em out. And if you get one of
them, I wanna see a pic. So send me a selfie of you in
your cute Chosen Family merch and I can't wait to see them. Okay, so that is all I
have for you guys today. I will see you guys next time. Later. 
- Hi, everyone! My name is Tyler Oakley and today is a very special day. It is the 10 year anniversary of the day I made my YouTube channel, Which just completely boggles my mind. I cannot believe it's been 10 years of hundreds and hundreds
and hundreds of videos and countless memories with ya'll and incredible accomplishments
that I can't believe that we've been able to do together. I'm very thankful, but we're not gonna get sappy. Instead I wanna make
a video of me reacting to the last 10 years. So I asked my manager, Lisa to make a little compilation video of all moments from the last 10 years. Whether that's videos that I
have made that have gone viral, moments of you know, my life and my career
in the last 10 years. I have no clue what I'm about to react to, but it's like things that have happened in the last 10 years. And I guess we're gonna start. Are you ready? Let's do this. (light music) So this is my first video. I was eighteen. Freshman in college at Michigan State. Like what is this? I don't even know. Like I can't watch. - Hi, I think you think you're
watching something else, but we have a little surprise for you. - What in the world? - It has been 10 amazing
years of you on the internet, and we are so happy to celebrate with you in this moment. So we got some of your
friends and family together to tell you what you mean to us and how you've inspired us and our favorite memories. And now we're gonna get started. - Hey Tyler, greetings
from the Venice airport. I just wanted to say congratulations on your 10 year YouTube anniversary. It has been so wonderful
- This is too much! - For Hank and me to watch you grow-up as a person and a creator
over the last 10 years. And the way that you talk to your audience and live your life is a real inspiration to us. So thank you for being awesome and here's to the next 10 years. - Hey, Tyler! It's Ingrid, just in case you didn't know. And I wanted to say happy
10th YouTube anniversary. We have definitely done some
interesting stuff together. (Tyler laughs) One moment together that
will forever be burned into my brain and also my stomach is the smoothie challenge
that we did together. - The worst. - I don't think I've ever been
- Hated that video. - So grossed out, but also laughing so
much in my entire life. You've done so much in
these last 10 years. I'm excited to see what's coming up next. - Tyler!
- My baby! - Welcome to the 10 years of being - Oh, bitch, shut up. - On this crazy platform club. I can't believe it's been that long. I remember the first time I ever saw you. You were just a teeny little twink. - We were babies. - And now you're still
a little twink (laughs). - I'll take it. - Thank you so much for everything and just being a voice on this platform. Here's to another 10 more years. - Tyler. You are the first YouTuber
I ever collaborated with. It's insane to watch how much you've grown and how much your channel has grown. I learn from your content, which I think is really
important these days. Happy 10 year anniversary. Here's to 10 more. I don't know if that's a good thing. (Tyler groans) Are we still gonna be
making videos in 10 years? Oh my god. - Hi, Tyler! My favorite memory of
us was when we collabed like so long ago and we shared secret special
stories that nobody's heard. I love all the work that
you do for our community. Love you! - I love Gigi. - Tyler, congratulations!
- Hank. (child laughs) - Yeah, segways are
funny aren't they Lauren? Thank you so much for
over the last 10 years making the Internet a
better, more interesting, more thoughtful place. Thanks for all the great conversations we've had over the years. All the great advice you've given me. And remember that time
we ran into each other at a park in San Francisco? - Babies! - Me too!
(Tyler laughs) That's weird. You're great, thank you. Success could never have
happened to a better person. - Hey, Tyler! I'm so proud of you. 10 years is a long time
to commit to something and I'm so happy for you. Because I remember when
I first started YouTube, you're one of the people that really inspired me to start doing it. - That's crazy. Because she inspires me. - You had such a great energy on camera. And I remember when I tweeted you, first moving to LA having no friends, you reached out and you were like, hey, let's go for lunch! I'll never forget that. It touched my heart a lot. And you're just so deserving of it and awesome and lovely. - This is too much. - I hope you do 10 more
years, then twenty years, then thirty years. - Nobody should have to do this. - I hope you, I was
gonna say die on YouTube, but that sounds deranged, but what I mean is grow old on YouTube. 10 years, congratulations. Give you all the kisses. - Hello! - Oh, my sweet boy! - Tyler, wow, this is insane. 10 years is amazing and congrats. Thank you for being my friend. Thank you for loving my dog, the way that you love her. Thank you for so much. Thank you for inspiring
me to be a better person. - He was just here, twelve hours ago cutting my hair in the
middle of the night. - To do better. - I was like I have a
video to shoot tomorrow. He was like oh, which video
and I'm like (laughs). - To do good work on the
platform that I have. And I think you inspire
thousands of people to do that. Congrats on 10 years and you're the best. (kisses) Bye, babe. - Happy decade on YouTube, Tyler Oakley! (Tyler gasps) You're like really old now. - I know I am old.
- I guess I should share with you like my favorite
memory or something, but we've been friends for a long time now and it's hard to think of one favorite. I do remember the time you
put slugs in my wife's hand (Tyler laughs) or something which was quite good. You're amazing. You're an absolute legend. I love you to pieces and I can't wait to see you soon. - Hey, Tyler. - Casper. - Happy 10 year anniversary.
- Naked. - I hope this is appropriate
that I'm not wearing a shirt. I know this is your
favorite way to look at me, so I thought I would do this
as a little bit of a surprise. - Thank you. - Is that weird? Yeah, that's probably a bit weird. I just wanna say congratulations again. And remember that time we were in Italy and we discovered that
(sniffs) I smell like carrots? Yeah, that was fun. Anyway, hope you have a great one! Bye. - Hi, Tyler, it's Paolo. - Hey, it's Patrick and we want to wish you a happy 10 year YouTube anniversary! - 10 years! - My babies, all of my friends! - Oh my gosh!
- That's crazy. - Okay, I just have to say, Tyler, you have, you know this, but I'm gonna say it again. You've inspired me since day one. These 10 years and watching your videos and seeing your authentic self has helped me wanna be my authentic self, so I thank you for that. 'Cause there is no one like you. You are the best. You are the cutest. You are the most talented. You are everything.
- This is just (laughs). - Keep it up. Congratulations! We wish you 10 more
years of amazing success. - Everybody's saying 10 more
years, I'm like girl, no. - We'll keep following your
journey and going to brunch. - Happy birthday, Ty. Oh wait, it's not your birthday. Is it? Again. Happy 10 year anniversary! I remember when I saw
you at Escape the Night, I was like you still
have a YouTube channel? Inspiring. But you are one of the most inspiring and dramatic individuals I have ever met. I loved how on Escape the
Night you were just like I hope there's not any drama. But what does this all mean? You are so extra. But it was seriously so
fun getting to know you. I've always been a fan. I was always snervous to meet you. You're so full of energy
and funny and quick-witted. Do I have to keep reading the prompter? (Tyler laughs) But happy anniversary, Tyler.
- I hate her. - I hope to be as old as you one day. What? - Oh, I'm so nervous (laughs). - This is Mia. This is my publicist. - Okay, I got it, keep rolling. Hi, Ty! It's me. Congratulations on being
on YouTube for 10 years! That's amazing. I'm so honored and grateful
to be a part of your life. One of my favorite memories of us together is when we went to Billboard for one of your first interviews and you were talking about Gaga - I love her. - And you were saying that
even if she were to punt a baby that she could do no wrong and she would forever be your queen. - And she was mortified! You are hilarious. I will never forget that moment. - That's so sweet. - I love you. And here's to 10 more! - You've been part of my life every day for the past five years. I am truly so grateful to
be on this journey with you. - This is my manager by the way. - To watch you make so much change and have such impact
- Stop it. - and really effect so many people. Just to hear stories from the people who you inspire has inspired me. It's a joy to work with you every day. I love you so much. And I'm so excited for the next 10, twenty, fifty, hundred years with you. And I think you're wonderful. - Congratulations, Tyler.
(Tyler grunts) - On 10 years of Tyler Oakley. - Joe Sugg.
- I can't believe it. What an incredible achievement. You inspire me. Every time I catch-up
with you you're inspiring and you're a big 'ole role model. That's what you are. And you should be proud of yourself, because 10 years of doing
this is a great achievement. I thought five years was good, 10 years is even better. I just think you're great. And I think you need to know
that you're great more often. So you're great, Tyler Oakley. Goodbye, have a good one. Hope you're getting drunk. - Hi, Tyler.
(Tyler squeals) Happy 10 years on YouTube. - From one sun to another. - That is crazy. You are my absolute idol. I can't believe you have been

lives, including mine. We love you, I love you, the
world loves you. (kisses) - Hey, Tyler. Just wanted to say
- Connie. - A huge congrats on 10 years on YouTube. That's an absolutely
amazing accomplishment that not many people can say they've done. Thank you for being one of my best friends and thank you for shaping me in ways that I'm sure you don't
even know you have shaped me over the past four years
that we have been friends. So congrats, thank you so much. - I'm like, gonna cry.
- I love you. Bye. - Happy 10 year anniversary
on YouTube, Tyler. I am so happy that you have
been going at it for 10 years, because it gave us the chance to meet and the chance to become friends. I truly could not imagine
this life without you. Thank you for being exactly who you are. Congratulations, it's really well earned. - This is all like (laughs).
- (kisses) I love you. - Hi, Tyler, congratulations! - Yes, it wouldn't be us if we weren't making this
video very last minute. - Yep.
- These idiots. (laughing) - While a motorcycle revs
(Tyler laughs) and we're hungover from
drinking with you last night. - Yeah, you have been
on YouTube for 10 years and in those 10 years you
have given us so much joy, so much laughter, so much
sass, and so much ass. - And so much embarrassing
gifs and Google images. - So congratulations,
we are happy to know you and happy that you exist
in the YouTube space. You're doing great.
- I love them. - Keep going! - Yeah, keeping something alive for 10 years is very difficult so. - Yeah, we both have dogs, so we know. - Yikes.
(Tyler laughs) - Bye! - Hi, honey.
- Awww. - Happy anniversary.
(Tyler laughs) 10 years on YouTube. That's awesome. You should be so very proud of yourself. I'm so proud of you. It seems like yesterday you just started your YouTube channel. I remember so clearly
that I was so excited because that was one way that
I was able to see my baby and hear his voice. And I couldn't wait to tell all my friends that they needed to watch
my son, Tyler Oakley. I love you and enjoy your celebration. - 10 years. That's amazing.
(Tyler laughs) I can't believe it went by that quickly. - My dad. - I love you very much. I'm proud of you. I look forward to seeing what your gonna do in the coming years and the impact that you're
going to have on people. Keep it up, bud. Love you. - Hey, Tyler. It's Korey. Just wanted to say congrats on your 10 year YouTube anniversary. - This is a lot for me right now. - That is insane to me. I cannot believe I've known you that long. I cannot believe everything
you've accomplished - We met the day I made
my YouTube channel. - Over the last 10 years. I have loved being right there
on the front lines with you. Keep inspiring people. You still inspire me every day. And yeah, I'm so lucky
to have you in my life. And I love you and I cannot wait to see what the next 10 years has in store. Proud of you. (kisses) - Tyler!
(Tyler laughs) - Happy 10th anniversary on YouTube. I cannot be prouder of you. What an incredible accomplishment. Tyler, it actually blows my mind when I take a step back
and think about the impact that you've had on YouTube
and on the LGBTQ+ community. You have really inspired countless people to be themselves and to
start YouTube channels and to live their truth
authentically online. And every time that an
LGBTQ+ person does that and shares their life on the Internet, they provide an example or a sense of hope for someone who's in the closet or someone who is struggling
with their identity. It just makes me emotional thinking about how many lives you've touched through your channel, through your advocacy, through all of your content creation, and through just being yourself. And being unapologetically you, which is such an amazing, fun, entertaining, compassionate, smart, talented human being. I want 10 more years and then 10 more years and then 10 more years.
- Bitch! - Because I just love
what you're doing, Tyler, and I am so proud to call
you a very close friend. I love you. Congrats on 10 years. - (groans) All my friends. That was not what I thought
I was about to do. (laughs) Well I feel like I could just turn into a puddle and cry. That was just too much. Honestly, that was like the best surprise I could
have ever asked for. Thank you, Lisa for organizing that. Thank you to everyone
that's like a YouTuber or my friend or my
family for being in that. I thought I was just gonna
be making fun of myself today and now I'm like about to cry (laughs). I love this and I love my job and I love you guys. And thank you for making
this all possible. And that was a lot of people telling me you've got 10
more years ahead of you and now I'm having an existential crisis. So (laughs) I'm like, I gotta go. Besides these people that I just watched, ya'll know me just as well as they do. You have been around for this long. I wanna know what is
maybe your favorite memory that we've had together, whether it's like maybe we
met at the Slumber Party tour. Maybe you were one of my first subscribers and you loved one of my videos from 2007. Whatever your memory is with me, I would love to read it. So put it in the comments. I will be reading every
single one of them, because I feel like if I was
about to cry just from that, I feel like just the comments
will make me just a mess. Like I said, I couldn't have
predicted today 10 years ago. So I have no clue what's gonna
happen in the next 10 years. But as long as I still love it, which I so much do, I can't wait to go on
that journey with you. So, that's all. Okay. I gotta go. Bye.

husband, or what's going on? - Yes, he has a wife. - Who's the wife? - Ms. Claus - Oh, how'd they meet? - Santa was being drunk, and
she was at the same bar too. They just happened to meet eyes, and they were so drunk that
they kissed each other. - Does that seem realistic? - No. - Yes. - How does he get all those
toys to everybody in one night? - He has a sleigh. - How does he get that sleigh around? Do not eat all that icing, absolutely not. You lost your mind. You better think again. Yeah, decorate that house. - By reindeer. - Do we know all the
names of the reindeer? - Rudolph the reindeer. - You know Dasher and Dance. - Yeah, keep going. Why are you hiding? - Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner, Blitzen, Rudolph. - You just knew em. Do we have a favorite reindeer? - [Aidan] Rudolph. - Yeah, yeah. - [Tyler] Yeah. - Whatever one brings me the presents. - Rudolph. - Good answer. Evelyn, that's looking beautiful.

Like, time to wake up. - And you don't get that much sleep. - Tickling their feet. - Tickling their feet. Can you sleep the night before Christmas? - No, not really. - Oh my gosh. I am just so excited. - I can't. - You can't sleep? Why? - Because Santa. - Because Santa. - Because I am too busy
opening my presents and seeing my family. - Now, do you guys put out
milk and cookies for Santa? - Yeah. - And sometimes carrots for the reindeer. - That is thoughtful, Aidan. Now, what is everyone gonna
give other people this year? - I can tell. - Tell us what you are
gonna give to your parents. You have any ideas? - A card. - A card? Is it gonna be so thoughtful? You gonna write something sweet and kinda? - I thought she said a car. - A car? - No. - I can't believe you're
gonna get your mom a car. - I'm not. - I'm gonna go tell her
she's getting a new car. Is that okay? - No. - No. Maddox what are you gonna get your mom? - The flu. - The flu. (laughter) - [Evelyn] How thoughtful. - She's gonna love that. Will you tell me? Do we open all? (laughter) Do you guys have a
favorite Christmas carol? On the count of three, everyone sing their
favorite Christmas song. One, two, six. Is that the correct number? - No - One, two, three, four, five, six. - Oh, thank you. One, two, three.

When is New Year's? Do we count down? - Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two, one. - And then what do you say? - Happy New Year's. - Then, we all hug. On New Year's, usually people
make New Year's resolutions. - What does that mean? - This year, I'm gonna be a nicer person, or this year, I'm gonna eat no sugar. - [Aidan] What? - I know. So if you were to do a
New Year's resolution, what would you do so you'd
be a better person next year? Yeah. - Be a friend. - Be a friend. I love that. That's a good New Year's resolution. - [Aidan] Eat more candy. - Eat more candy, okay. What would yours be? - I would help people tie their shoes and help people zip up their coats. - Help people tie their shoes and help people zip up their coats. That's a great thing to do this winter. - What if you don't know
how to tie shoes Delilah? - She doesn't, most likely. - Okay, you guys, so I
think we're all done. Now I would love if everyone
could show off their homes. - I made a gingerbread house. - [Tyler] It's beautiful. - It has candy on it. It has a wreath on it. - We made some lights, and

- How... big does it explode? - Depends on how ripe the melon is. - Shit. - Hi everyone! - Hi Tyler!
- Hi! - Hi! - (laughs) Hi everyone.
I'm here with my friends. Everyone, who are you? - Hi, I'm Grace Helbig. - I'm Mamrie Hart. - And I'm Hannah Hart. - And today we are hanging out. - Full of regrets. - Yep. Okay, it has to be known that
this is entirely your idea. - Yes. - We received a group text
message from Tyler a few weeks ago, wanting to shoot a collab video with a very specific idea. - I said y'all want to blow
up some balloon, or no ... (laughs) I said y'all want to
blow up some watermelons? - Yah.
- And everyone was in so. - The plastic bodysuit
was a new fun addition. - Yeah, you look like a
couture minion right now. - (laughs)
- Thank you. So, what we're doing today. Two teams. Hannah and I are - The Gays. - And Mamrie and Grace are - The Crays. - 'Cause we're gays like gazing. - And we're crazy. - Here's what's gonna happen. Me and Hannah are gonna face-off
against Mamrie and Grace. And the first team to
explode their melon wins. - What a euphemism. - How do we explode the melons? - Great question. Rubber bands. So watch. Go. Bam! - I'm nervous and hot. - Well, that's the perfect combo. - That's like your MO. - That's my perfume. - Are we ready? - Sure. - Go, go, go, go, go. Perfect. Perfect. Oh, yeah, do a bunch at a time. - Yeah, you don't have to
do one at a time, right? There's no rules. We've been told that up
to 600 rubber bands might make a watermelon explode. - I'm so friggin nervous.
I'm already scared. - You were better at what you
were doing. You were at ... - Why would we stop?
- Go back, go back, go back. - How many of us have health insurance? - I do.
- I do. - (laughs) - (grunts) - Ahh! - Don't let up. - I won't. - This is ... Oh, my God. - Oh, my God, I'm so scared. - This is like popping champagne. - We're kicking ass,
but I don't want to win. - You're gonna see it contour. - Really? - For the Gods. - Hannah, you need to get
your head in the game. Why is ours so like riveting? - Because I'm just grabbing and going. - Go, well then grab and then go. - It's really working our forearms - Ahh! - Oh, that's a good system. - Right? Do you see what I mean? Yes. - They're copying our system. - They're totally copying our system. - We figured out a system silently. - Grace and I are just so in
sync. We didn't have to say it. - I mean fear causes you
to be able to read minds much easier. - Guys, I think that
they're gonna blow soon. - I'm so scared. - (laughs) - (whispers) - That was a good distraction. - Thank you. Guys, watch out. Yours looks like it's really contouring. - Yours looks really like it's gonna pop. - Stop it! - Just so you know, we're three feet away and I can hear you. - (laughs) - Why are you giggling? - Ahh! - It feels more hollow. - Hollow. - Hollow. - What if this is a trick watermelon? - I know. What if this is a trap? - This is my least favorite pinata. - Oh, wait guys, we have to
practice not looking angry. - (laughs) - I'm just gonna smile
the whole ... Ahh Tyler! - I know, too much. - Tyler, too much. - (grunts)
- (groans) (playful music) - I feel like ours is getting taller. - I think so Tyler. - Look. It's ... Look.
- Tyler!! - Oh, sorry. - Is it getting lighter? I'm so scared. - Wait, what does the loser do? - Yeah, what's the prize? - We never established this.
- Eats all the melon. - Eats all the melon. - Eats the melon. - I need one sip guys. - Me too. - Oh, my God. - We're not stopping till we ... - Team Crays. - Okay, we can take a stop. - (laughs) Look at that. - Yeah, yours is actually contouring. - Like she's diveting. - Okay. - She's riveting.
- I hate it. (rubber band snapping)
- Ahh! - Oh, my God! Ours is arching. - Yeah, yours ... Holy
shit! Yours is going. - Here we go, here we go. - Ahhhhh! - This could be it. I think it's time y'all. Ladies. - Oh, my God! - This could be it. Any one could be it. - I'm so scared. I don't
want to win at this point. - (laughs)
- I don't want to go for it. I'm just gonna give myself
pigtails with the rubber bands. - (laughs) - Tyler's O-face. - Literally Jenga in
the worst possible way. - 0ohhhhh! - I'm just braiding my
hair and having a cocktail. (laughs) - How big is the explosion radius? - We don't know. None
of us did our research. - I'm so nervous. Hold
on, let me get my drink. Let me get my drink. - You guys can do it. We're proud of you. - Thank you. - Good job. We're quitters. - Look at the resilience of gay people. - I know. - (laughs) - Y'all come over here.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no. - Yes. - No, no, no, no, no I can't. - I don't know if I can do it on my own. - Yes you can. - No, I can't. I have to
hold it too hard. Ahh! - (laughs) Come on. - What is that? No,
it's not a flower crown. Ahh! - Oh, my God! - (screams)
- (screams) - Bitch. I know you're ready. - Ready? - Oh, my God, they're
going back for the big one. - Oh, we've been doing non-stop big ones. - Yeah, go big or go home. - I wanna go big and go home. - Fucking shit! - Oh, my God. It's really gonna go. - Yep. - Oh, my God. It's starting to hemorrhage. - It is muffin topping. - Body positivity. - Yeah, it's great. - Yeah.
- 100%. I love muffins. - I love muffins and tops. - Yeah, me too. - Alright. - Oh, my God. - They heard tsunami. - Yeah. - (screams)
- (screams) (laughs) No! - Oh, my God! - I hated it. - Holy shit! - I definitely didn't love it. - Look what I picked. - Whoa! How beautiful. - I mean this is a great
activity for your next backyard barbecue. - We did it. - Yeahhhh!
- (laughs) - I'm super proud of you. - Hannah. - Yes. - We did it. Mamrie and Grace, um, cool. You did that. - Are you just touching it in there? - Kind of. - (laughs) - I like that immediately
you guys were afraid and then both just
started eating the heart. - I'm starving. I want
this to be my class. - (laughs) - It's kind of like ...
- Put Charles in it. - Wait. Can we put Charles in? No Thank you everyone for watching. We did videos on everyone else's channel. I'll link them below. Best of luck with everything. That's all. - Bye.
- Bye. - Bye.
- Bye. 
- [Both] TD We wanna touchdown,
TD we wanna touchdown, - One more! - TD we wanna (laughter) - It's called crescendo,
my dear get used to it. - Hey everyone, welcome to my channel. (screams) Hi everyone, I'm Tyler Oakley,
and who am I here with today? - Oh this is just Mamrie Hart. - Mamrie Hart, you know we
have done so much together. - Honestly, I mean,
you could write a book. - You could. - Another one, bestseller. - Speaking of which, Mamrie, your book comes out next week, right? - It does. - Link in bio. - It does, I didn't even
plug it on my own channel. - Yeah I know, Jesus Christ. (laughter) - So before you watch
this, we already shot the first half of this video
over on Mamrie's channel. So the link is gonna be
right here, in the bio. - They're all like "yeah
we can tell you've already "shot half of the freaking video." - So watch the other half
on Mamrie's channel first, and subscribe to Mamrie,
give it some love, comment with a-- (laughter) Comment on Mamrie's video
who you think is gonna win, because you're gonna find out in this video, the real winner. - Ooh.
- Of the, what is it called? - We haven't named it yet. - Touchdown. - You can't just say a word and make it-- - I was reading, I was reading. (mumbles) The fumble and rumble,
I like fumble rumble. - One, two, three. - [Both] The fumble rumble. - The race was tight, but
we're back for the second half. - This isn't a race.
- Everything's on the line. - By the way, you should
totally cut to a little recap, so they can be caught up
on the game highlights. (beep) (gasp) Bitch, it's 3
o'clock somewhere, what! - No! (burp) (beep) Wow, some intense plays. - That half-time show, I don't think she's gonna be out of the
hospital anytime soon. - So here's what we're doing, Mamrie's quizzing me on all things football. - Yeah, we've been doing
this for 20 minutes and you're like "is this football?" I am asking Tyler questions
about football and then he is asking me questions about his expertise for this upcoming Superbowl. - Pop culture, which is Justin Timberlake for the Superbowl half-time, Mamrie seems to know a lot, as if she's cheating. - I'm not cheating! - Check her for steroids,
Lance Armstrong on the play. - The only time I use steroids
is when I get bad Poison Ivy. Have you ever gotten it real bad? - No, uh oh. - Ooh, it's the worst. - I'm always so afraid to
touch a leaf and then itch. - You know what, (wheezing laugh) I made up a rap when I was in summer camp to the tune of Can't Touch This on how to not touch poison ivy. - Of course you did. - Here it goes. - No, I didn't ask for it. - Oh. - Poor poison ivy hits me so
hard makes me say oh my lord, ‚ô™ thank you for blessing
me with a mind you know ‚ô™ ‚ô™ that leaves of three
are danger, stay back, ‚ô™ ‚ô™ don't get too close or it's
gonna attack it deadly, ‚ô™ ‚ô™ and such and this is a
plant ya'll can't touch. ‚ô™ Insert cheering sound effect. (laughter) - It's a wonder that you
are where you are today. - It is. Any-hoo, I've got three points. - So do I, I think. - You've got-- - If you round. - I think you've got two, I
have to ask Tyler a question. - Sock it to me. - So let's say, that a team
is down by one, it's the last second of the game,
and instead of going for a field goal, they should go for a? - Give me a hint. - Okay, one of the words is a very fucked up type of therapy. - Conversion of the points. (laughter) - You are so close. - A convert. - What do they need, I can't believe I'm coaching you through this. - A convert, a conversation, we just have a nice, gentle conversation
with the other team. - Meh, buzzer, it's a
two-point conversion. - Dag nabbit! - Dag nabbit, it's time
for him to kick it. (screams) - Wait we need to, let's hit it with a slow-mo replay just to make sure. (low pitched screaming) She did it! - You did it, congratulations. - A true relief, leaf, leaf. - We're still talking about poison ivy? - Cut to the leaf song. - (high pitched) Poor
poison ivy hits me so hard. This video makes no sense,
I love it, classic us. - Which Shrek movie was
Justin Timberlake a character. - Is it possible that
this is a trick question? - I can't say yes or no,
you just have to know Shrek. - Well I don't, personally. Well he did date Cameron
Diaz for a while and she was princess Fiona, and
so that would be awkward. - Again, you just. - It would be awkward if
he joined the Shrek movies once he wasn't in a relationship,
I'm gonna say Shrek 2. - Eh, Shrek the Third, you gotta play. - How many Shrek's are there? - A bunch.
- Wow. - I actually have no clue. - Shrek be cashing them
cheques, thank you. - Yes. - Ready? Oh that was good, let's go to the replay. - Let's check in. - It was good. - She got it, she got it,
it's all good, she got it. - Alright, Tyler, who is the quarterback for the New England Patriots wife. - Ooh. - The New England Patriot's
are going to the Superbowl, the quarterback who has
multiple (mumbles) wife is? I thought you'd get this. - I think that's Tom
Brady's wife, a woman. - Getting warmer.
- Muggle woman. - Muggle woman. - She's Gisele. - Yes! I cheered for you.
- Is it Gisele? - It's Gisele. - That really just, it must
have been, you know when you something, it's just in there. I really just took it out! - Okay, you don't have to shoot. - Well I would just
kinda like to celebrate. - Same right, cheers, to Gisele. - She's here. - Okay, lay it on me. - In 2004-- - I looked great. - Yes you did, I was a
freshman, here's a picture. She's cute, living her best self. - I was a senior, we aint showing that. - In 2004, how many people
saw Justin Timberlake rip off the thing covering
Janet Jackson's nipple? - I love that like my
odds of getting this right are literally like one in five million. - To the million. - To the million? - If you're within 25
million, I'll give it to you. - Really?
- Yep. - I will say, the amount of
people who saw the most infamous nip-slip in history is. (grunt) - What was that? - I'm gonna say 47 million. - Eh. - Wait, what is it? - It's 140 million. - That many people watch the Superbowl? - A lot of people. - Well, can I do something? - What? - Can I try to shoot it off of you? - Hell yeah, what the heck? Honey, you got, you better got game. - Ready? - It's gonna hit me! - It's good! - Are we sure? - Yes. (laughter) It's the final play. - Wow, it's all tied up? - Yeah. - Just like me in the bedroom, what? (whistle) I hate when you do that. - What, (mumbles) (laughter) - You know who I do love, tiny mouth. - (mumbles) so you better
just get in line, alright? - What is the question? - The first play in football, you're supposed to go how many yards? Like, what is the term for it? It's the first. - First down. - First, and? - First and-- - Firsten Dunst. (laughter) - First and thirty, is that it? - I cannot believe-- - That I got it wrong? - Yeah, you got it so
wrong, it's first and ten. First and ten, do it again,
let's go, let's move. - First and
- So we go - [Both] First and ten-- - No wait, hold on. - [Both] First and ten, do it
again, let's go, let's move. - Nailed it. - Do bap dee bop doodily doo. - Push back-- (laughter) - I was just thinking
about the last time we tried to do cheers and I could not-- - You were so bad at it. - [Both] Push 'em back five
yards, push 'em back ten-- - Pick 'em up-- - [Both] Push 'em back five

What is the most viewed Justin Timberlake music video on YouTube.com? - Question, JT only, or

and there was a controversy that they had a Britney look-a-like. There's also Bye Bye Bye,

do one more shot together. - Okay, if you don't then I think we also do a shot together. (screams) - If you wanna split one like Lady and the Tramp, just because we're-- - Do we both go like this?

- Hey everyone. My name is Tyler Oakley,
and happy holidays! It's the very video of December, which means it's time for Christmas. And, to celebrate Christmas, I have a very special guest today, but we'll get to her in a second. First, we've gotta give
some love to our sponsor for today's video, and that is Audible. Audible is the leading
provider of audiobooks with hundreds of thousands of
titles in every genre. You know them, we love them. And this month, I am recommending
for our little book club, a very special book, and that is How The Grinch Stole
Christmas, duh, by Dr. Seuss. You can listen to that
tile, or any other title if you use audible.com/tyleroakley. You get your first book
free with a 30-day trial if you use that link. Again, it is audible.com/tyleroakley. You're welcome in advance. Thank you so much Audible
for sponsoring this video, we love you here. So without further ado, please welcome my special guest. (screams) Look who it is. - Cindy Lou Who is she? - Who is she? - It's me. - It's Grace. - Yeah. (laughs) Just to preface this, I
got a text from Tyler, like, a couple of weeks
ago that just goes, "hey, would you wanna do like a Grinch and Cindy Lou Who thing? I have a cool collab idea". And I was like, "yeah, totally". And then I came-- and now we're here. - Yeah! (laughs) That's how this works. Today we are doing a
Christmas-themed humming challenge, and what you're gonna
do is pull a song out. - Okay. - You gotta hum the song. - Mhm. - And if I can guess
what it is, we both win. I don't know how we win at this. - I don't-- - Y'all are probably
the real winners here. - Yeah, I mean it's-- My humming skill sounds like, uh-- - Give me a B. (hums a note) - Nailed it. - Thank you. - Cindy Lou, - [Both] Who? (laughs) - My humming skills are,
like, all of my other skills; just really medium.
- Right there. - Solid medium. If humming is connected
to singing, can't do it, but we'll try. - Okay, work.
- Yeah. - So there's Christmas songs,
Hanukkah songs, holiday songs. Any way you celebrate,
you're gonna sing it. - Okay, let's see what we know and don't. Okay, ready? I'm going first? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Okay. What if I don't know the song? - Well, then you just hum
your little heart out. - Okay, ready? Here we go.
- Yeah, yeah. (hums) - Oh, Frosty the Snowman. - Yeah. (laughs) - I meant to do, ouch that's my heart. - Oh, yeah. (laughs) - Here. - Okay, I'll hold if for you, go ahead. Oh, my-- - Oh God. - You just became the Grinch. Was that the song? (grunts) (hums) O Christmas Tree. - Yes, bitch.
- Yes. (laughs) Maybe this is easier than I thought. - I know, I really was
anticipating this to be-- (groans) Oh, no, why did I speak so soon? Okay. I don't know how this song goes. - Sock it to me, Helbig.
- Ready? (hums) - Wait, O Christmas Tree? Didn't I just do O Christmas Tree? - I know, I know. (hums) - O Christmas Tree. - I know it sounds like
that, and I can't-- - O Hanukkah. - Yeah! - What? No! - That's it, it's Hanukkah, O Hanukkah. - Hanukkah, O Hanukkah,
come light the menorah. - Oh, that's how it goes.
- Let's have a party, and all dance the-- - Hora. - Hora? Tora? - Hora. - More like snore-a, am I wrong? - Wow. - Wow, I really got that. - You really did. God bless, 'cause I wasn't
gonna go anywhere else with it. (laughs) (mumbles) - I wish I had a camcorder,
where it's like (hums) - Oh, Jingle Bell Rock. - Yeah, I was being the mom in Mean Girls. - Oh, okay, because I was like,
why do you want a camcorder? - 'Cause that's what she had. - I was like what girl's
gone wild Christmas song? - And then they go (slap). - Oh, right, yeah. - Thank you. I think, culturally, we got that. - Yeah, I mean this is really festive. We're covering all the bases. Okay, ready? I mean, you're gonna get this. (hums) - Jingle Bells (mumbles) Jingle Bells. - Yeah. (laughs) That's the extended title. (laughs) - It's the remix. - Yeah. How you're not doing a cooking
video with these hands-- - What do you mean? - Everything is so-- - Don't you hate when you
get a hair in your food? This one's one of my dear friends. - Friends? - Yeah. - Okay. (laughs) I didn't know you could be-- have relationships with songs like that. - But-- you'll get it in a second. - Okay, okay. (laughs) (hums) - Rudolph The Red-Nose-- - Yeah. (laughs) I said one of my dear friends. - Alright, Hannah Hart, how dare you? - Ka-ching, ka-ching. - This one's a classic. - Okay. (hums) - Silent Night? - Yeah. Way easier--
- I wish there were one. (laughs) - Yikes. - Tough crowd. - Tough crowd, tough crowd. - It's me, I'm the crowd. (groans) - Uh, oh. - I don't even know if this is-- - I don't even know. - You know what? I'm gonna make it a little challenging for my little Cindy Lou. We're gonna start at the beginning. Tun-tun tun. Oh wait, no. I have to hum, not tun tun tun. - Wait, were you starting? (overlapping chatter) I thought you were doing, like a warmup. (laughs) (hums) What the fuck is this? (laughs loudly) (hums) This is some-- - It really is making sense in my head. (hums) - This is Christmas? (hums louder) (laughs) I'm enjoying the performance. (continues humming) - Oh, Frozen. (sighs) - No. - Let It Go. Let It Go. - Thank you, thank you. - But that's just winter songs now. - Yes, yes, Christmas, yes. - Okay. My mom loves this song. Okay. (hums) - Oh, Santa Clause Is Coming To Town. - Yeah. (laughs loudly) But, you get so excited, and
you try to say all the words in the title all at once. - Well, I wanna win. Oh, girl. (laughs) (hums) - Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas, but you're performing it as Mariah Carey, dressed as the Grinch. - I'm just Mariah, where
are you getting Grinch from? This is straight up, just pure Mariah. - True. (hums) That's the only part of that song I know. Give it to me again. (hums) - Oh, it's on the tip of this dang tongue. (laughs loudly) Go again, don't stop til' I get it. Oh, wait, what? Wait, I'm almost there, come on. I'm close. Give it to me. (laughs) (hums) - 'Cause All I Want For Christmas Is You? - Yeah. Baby, All I Want For Christmas Is You. - Oh, wait, that's not
what I thought it was, but then I thought, well, is it? - That's what it is, right? It's that Mariah Carey.
- We got there together. (gasps) Oh, I hope you know this one. - Okay. - It's a modern classic. - Okay, which means I won't know-- (hums) - I fucking nailed that. (laughs loudly) - You're getting a ticket to Hollywood. - Thank you. - I have no idea what that song is. - I don't-- - But it sounds delightful. - Mistletoe by Justin Bieber. - Oh, not-- Okay. - Shawty, with you, shawty, with you. - Oh, this one's very appropriate. - Okay, okay. (hums) (gasps) - Oh, girl. Something like I'm a Grinch,
I'm the Grinch, the Grinch, she's the Grinch, he's the
Grinch, he's a mean one, the Grinch. - Is that your new rap? - I'm the Grinch, he's the Grinch. - I'm the Grinch, he's the
Grinch, she's the Grinch. - She's a mean Grinch. What is it? You're A Mean Once, Mr. Grinch. True. - Why you haven't written
a Grinch rap holiday song, rap songs-- - What do you think is coming next week? We really got through that together. - Yeah, that was quite a journey. I didn't realize how many
holiday songs there are. - We get it, you were
over it halfway through. - Yep. (laughs) - Well, Grace, I mean-- What's your name? Cindy, my dear friend Cindy. - Uh-huh. - Thank you so much for joining me. - Thank you for having me,
this was an experience. - It was a joy for you, I think. I think it was a hoot an a holler. - It was. - In that order. - Both of those. - Yeah. If you guys wanna see the
video that we did on Grace's channel, wasn't it so good? - I can't believe it, scandalous. - Just kinda great. (laughs) You can click
it in the description, and then go subscribe to Grace, 'cause she's one of my faves. Also, we have done so many
videos together over the years. - I know, I didn't realize
that until you posted something that-- especially with Mamrie, too, when-- (laughs) Why you and Mamrie aren't both
in Grinch costumes right now? - She probably is somewhere in the world in a Grinch costume. (laughs) - I'm gonna link to all the
videos we've ever done together in the description. But, thank you for joining me. - Thank you for having me, it was so fun. - Good luck with your life.
- Vice versa. - Got it.
(laughs) Okay, bye friends.
- Bye.

videos every single week, and if you want to check out
some of my favorite videos from this year, click anywhere right now. And, I want to know what
was your favorite thing we did this year? Let me know in the comments below and I will see you guys very soon. Later y'all! 
hey everyone my name is Tyler Oakley and it has been a while since I did a little Q&amp;A so i asked you guys on Twitter to submit some questions with the hashtag ask tyler anything and ima answer some until I don't feel like answering anymore. Kelly says what's something that instantly makes someone less attractive? so if i see on somebody's profile or if somebody tells me in person that they don't date a certain race I just find that the worst. like if they say oh sorry I just don't date black people who are sorry I just not attracted to asian people are whatever it might be it just blows my mind how they can't see that that's racist yeah I if it's based on you know them thinking that all that race has the same characteristics or looks then obviously that's racist because not all certain people of a race look at the same or if they're saying that all like certain race acts the same then obviously that's racist because when generalizing millions and millions of people from all over the world so I just... it blows my mind that some people can't see that that's racist. and you know what? maybe we don't have to agree on it but i will say that makes someone less attractive to me they didn't have the best hair best smile best personality but if they say sorry no blacks are no asians just like: "girl... bye" Cait says what do you recommend on audible this month? As you guys know i recommend a new book on audible.com every single month they are the leading provider of audiobooks with over hundreds of thousands of different titles in every single type of genre if you want to try it you can use audible.com/tyleroakley for your first month free this month I am recommending "Buffering" it's Hannah Hart's new book it is stories about her life and I am so tempted to listen to it, Ima listen to it with you guys or you can get any other book again use audible.com / Tyler Oakley and you will get the hookup thank you to audible for sponsoring this video they know how to give you guys hook up and I appreciate that every single month WishfulSugg says what is your favorite award you've ever won? 
i have been given a lot of recognition that I so appreciate and I'm honored by a recent one was this one it was the Young Hero award at the Attitude Awards To me this is for being a hero which is weird and cool but a hero stands up for what is right even if it's not popular and they defend the people who need it this community is incredibly diverse and often lacks representation for the marginalized group within it it's one thing to say that you support the lgbtq+ community but we must actively choose to acknowledge and include and honor all the people that those letters represent. we have to support bisexual boys and transgender women and gender fluid teens in elderly lesbians and queer people of color and asexuals and everyone in between. the lgbtq+ community is not just white cisgender gays and if that's how you identify i urge you to recognize your privilege and amplify the voices of those around you. and accepting the young hero award i pledge to do that thank you. Nicole says what is the story behind you and Darren Criss both dressing up as Eleven for Halloween? literally there is no story i just showed up on Halloween night at a bar and there was Darren Criss in the exact same costume as me we were literally both screaming when we saw each other, I feel like we good though, right? Alyssa Avocado says I was an avocado for Halloween aren't you proud? Alyssa not only did you fulfill your twitter handle but you look good that's like a look for you. Katie says how much do you miss camp? Katie, i miss camp so much. if you don't know - I hosted a summer camp with another youtuber named Bethany Mota it was for our YouTube viewers and we got to hang out with all of you for a full week away from civilization it was the most fun thing I think I did all year. and everyone has been asking if we're going to camp again next year and... I'm sorry to say, don't kill me but you're gonna have to cancel all of your plans, because camp is coming back y'all that's right best camp ever is coming back for a second year and I am so excited. again the dates are August 20th to August 26 2017. Registration for camp opens November 14, 9 a.m. pacific time and if you register before December 2 you are going to get a huge discount but I feel like it's gonna sell out quick y'all. And knowing how much fun camp was this year i know so many ways that it's going to be even bigger and better next year so again go campseventeen.com 
Ronald says what is your favorite part about filming the Tyler Oakley show? honestly everything about it is a dream come true when I think about the fact that I get to have like a little talk show thanks to Ellen and all the producers over at EllenTube, all the people that make it happen like the camera people, the lighting people, the editors, the makeup people, the stylists, the writers who helped me come up with questions and games, the people that actually make the set. like there is a production that goes into it. i wanna do like a behind-the-scenes day-in-the-life video of what it's actually like to film the talkshow sort of you want me to do that let me know i'm gonna do a behind-the-scenes if this video gets 50,000 likes maybe I'll do that ok so that is all the questions I'm going to answer today. if you liked this video give it a thumbs up, if you want to see my latest video click right there it's my latest episode of the Tyler Oakley show with Carrie Underwood, if you want to hear my latest podcast click right there, if you wanna be my person of the week click right there, and that's all I have for you guys today i love you so much I will see you guys very soon. Bye friends! 
- Some girl went viral on Twitter for cleaning Donald Trump's star, and I am not having it. So I am here on Hollywood Boulevard with a rag and a bottle
of knock-off Windex and six Hollywood stars
that deserve to be cleaned more than Donald Trump's. Let's go. (upbeat music) Trump loves to ban people
that are different from him from entering the country. But you know who welcomes
foreign strangers into their land with song
and dance and open arms? The Munchkins. Trump doesn't even acknowledge
that climate change exists. Pitbull's latest album
is called Global Warming. King of spreading awareness. Speaking of fixing global warming, Trump wants the US to leave
the Paris Climate Agreement, which is ridiculous. Instead of supporting leaving
the Paris Climate Agreement, why not support the stars of the 1999 straight-to-VHS film, Passport to Paris, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen? Am I allowed to be cleaning this? I think. All Trump does is appoint
inexperienced people to his administration. Meanwhile, Lady Marmalade
had the best casting of all time. Christina
Aguilera is an icon, Betsy DeVos is a flop. Even though 97% of scientists
understand global warming, Trump believes that climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese. But we know, climate change
is gonna fuck shit up. For example, climate change
is gonna kill the bees, and scientists say that we need bees for humanity to survive. And you know who supports
the honey production economy, which in term helps
cultivate colonies of bees, which helps stabilize their population? Winnie the Pooh. Climate change hero. Al Gore could never. You know who didn't try to
defund Planned Parenthood? Shrek. There are tons of people
with Hollywood Stars that don't brag about sexual assault, don't undermine free press and democracy, and don't make America look like an embarrassing dumpster fire. So I'm probably gonna spend my day cleaning their stars. If you liked this video, be sure to give it a
thumbs up and subscribe. Plus, I have a brand new
video coming very soon about how to find your
voice and make a change. So I will see you guys very soon. Later. 
- Hi friends, it's Tyler. I just got done with a
shoot day at the studio, which is still so crazy for
me to think about even saying. I spent my day in the studio filming segments for my talk show. Anyway, sorry, I could
ramble and ramble and ramble about how happy I am about
what's going on in my life right now, but I would
rather answer your questions. What do you wanna know? Taylor says, "How can I register to vote?" Go to iwillvote.com to
see if you're registered, to register in the first place, just to make sure you know
where your polling place is, all of those things, iwillvote.com. Oli says, "Strip club or party bus?" Why not both? I would say the best party buses are also strip clubs,
though, I would not say the best strip clubs are also party buses. What if you were in a strip club and then you look out the
window and it started moving and you're like where am I going and then why is this traveling? Katie says, "What was your
favorite thing about the Emmy's?" I got to present a couple awards at the Emmy's with Bethany Mota. How crazy is that? YouTubers don't always get
opportunities like this. It felt like I was included on something that is the entertainment industry, and that's a really cool feeling. Henry says, "Will you be joining the cast of Waitress on Broadway?" Probably not, but I will say I did get to see Waitress on Broadway. I didn't know anything going into it, and then I saw it and
I absolutely loved it. I got to go backstage
and say congratulations to some of the people in the cast. It was so good. Jana says, "What is your recommendation on Audible this month?" As you guys know, I recommend a new book on audible.com every single month. If you use audible.com/tyleroakley, you get your first month free. They have hundreds of thousands of choices in every single genre you can think of. I love like autobiographies
because I like hearing the person that is
talking about their life telling the story in your
ears; I really like that. This month I am recommending Hard Choices by Hillary Clinton because
I think she's great. I'm gonna be listening
to it with you guys, so get it, listen along,
use audible.com/tyleroakley to get your first month free. Again, thank you audible.com
for sponsoring this video. We love you so much here on the Tyler Oakley YouTube channel. You are the best. Taylor says, "Can you still be gay and have like 8% feelings
for your opposite sex?" You can be attracted any
percentage that you feel to anybody and still identify how you identify. You are in charge of how
you identify, period. Opinions on feminism. I support the equality of all genders. I cannot fathom people that are like oh, I don't say I'm a feminist, but I do believe in the
equality of genders. I'm like girl, do you know
the definition of a feminist? Intuitive Oakley says,
"Have you been working on any passion projects recently?" I wouldn't do anything unless
it were a passion project. Linette says, "Would you get
matching tattoos with Korey?" So, last night, actually, I
went and got two new tattoos. I got this one, it's an
acorn and I really love it, and then I also got this one. I don't know if you can see it. It's a pinky promise, and Korey and I actually both got that
tattoo, so the answer to that question is yes, we just did. If you had to dye your hair a fun color, what would you dye it? I probably wouldn't do
it again any time soon. Maybe gray, I know that's
boring, but I really liked gray, but honestly, I don't feel
like dying my hair anymore. It's been years. I still get comments on Instagram that are like where's your fun hair, whatever happened to your fun hair. I'm like, girl, it's been
literally two years; move on. Christian says, "Why should we
vote for Hillary over Trump?" Besides the fact that he's Trump and she's actually
presidential and qualified and competent, et cetera, if
you are still on the fence about Hillary, I think a
great thing to think about is there are going to be
some Supreme Court Justice positions up for grabs possibly in the next four to eight years, and who do you want
appointing those positions? Do you want Trump, who's super
conservative and Republican and can really fuck up what
we got going on in the country where it's going in a good
direction for minorities, or do you want somebody who has your back? Something to think about. What is your opinion on chairs? Oh, I love a good chair,
something you can sit on, something you can lounge in. Very supportive of the chair community. Phoebe says, "Will you quit YouTube?" I have no plans to
leave YouTube right now. I'm loving it, especially with
having the Tyler Oakley show, I feel like I get to put out
fun collabs all the time, and then I can also do this, it's like I feel like
I'm having the most fun I've had on YouTube in a while, so no, I'm not quitting YouTube
any time soon, no. Okay, so I think that's all
I got for you guys today. I will see you guys soon. It's kind of been a crazy month, so thank you for bearing with me. I love you guys; I will see you guys soon. Yeah, okay, that's all. Bye friends! (upbeat music) That's it. 
- Hi everyone! My name is Tyler Oakley and I feel like when
somebody asks you who you are or to describe yourself, it's very difficult. Like if somebody's like,
"Tell me about you." I'm like, "Where do I even begin?" So I decided today to take a few tests to learn more about who I am, so that people can understand me. So I'm gonna take tests like, Which Pokemon am I? What house am I in in Hogwarts? What character in Sex in The City am I? What does my DNA tell me about me? I feel like there's a lot to learn. Let's go. Okay, so the first test
we're gonna do is 23andMe, that helps you figure out
your like, genetic makeup because there's 23 pairs
of chromosomes, 23 of me, you understand? It tells you about your health, and about your ancestry, and where
your ancestors are from, so I feel like out of all
the tests, this is actually probably gonna teach me the most about me. Okay, so first things first,
I have to take this tube, and I have to spit into it. This feels personal. (laughs) Don't look at me. Wonder if my spit's gross? Oh no, it's pretty. Great. (laughs) Stop. Now going into this
test, I don't really know much about myself. I know that my dad says that I'm Polish, my mom says that I'm Belgian,
but like, besides that I don't know much. I know that like, my great
grandma is from Belgium, and like, she lived in
a castle or something. You know, that's about it. That's all I know. So I feel like I'm about to
learn a lot about myself. Ugh! My spit. Did it. Done. So I'll mail this in. I'll let you know when I get the results. Thank you so much to 23andMe
for sponsoring this video. I can't wait to know more about myself. If y'all wanna learn more
about yourself from your DNA, you can go to 23andme.com/tyleroakley, plus I'mma put the link in the description so you can go check it out. Okay, so the next test I'm gonna take is the Sorting Hat for Harry Potter. I feel like that might reveal
something about myself. So first question: so
it says moon or stars? I'll go with stars. If you were attending Hogwart's, which pet would you choose to take with you? Oh my God, there's like 15 options. Cat, cat, cat, oh owl, common toad, (laughs) me. What do you think this is? Snowy Owl, Screech Owl... I'm a Screech owl. (laughs) Screech Owl. Four goblets are placed
before you, which would you choose to drink, the golden
liquid, so bright that it hurts the eye... Who is writing this? Jake at (mumbles). Next question, left or right? Left. Left. Wait, that's it? (gasp) That was the
quickest reveal of all time, and I also don't feel like
this is really who I am. See, maybe this is just
adding more pressure to my existential crisis,
cause I always thought that I was gonna be Slytherin,
and I'm a Ravenclaw, which I'm okay with. It's better than like,
the other two, truly. Okay, so let me learn a
little bit about this, because I feel like that
will give me insight as to who I am as a person. My traits include intelligence, yes, wit, yes, wisdom, sure. So maybe I am a Ravenclaw. Let's take another test. Okay, so this next test
is a Buzzfeed quiz. It says which Pokemon are you? First question, where do you live? I feel like this sorts
it for me; I understand what they're going at with
this Buzzfeed quiz because each of these towns has
a gym that is specific to a certain type of Pokemon. Choose a gym badge. See this is just, all
they're asking me is like, what element I am. Probably Rainbow Badge. Okay it worked. Choose your favorite game. I loved Red. That was the original. I'm gonna have to go with my original. Who's hottest? Isn't Ash Ketchum like ten? I'm going with Professor Oak. He seems like the only one
that's literally of age in this, and plus he's kinda hot. What's your go to attack? Water Sport, Astonish, Mega
Kick, Psybeam, Rock Tomb, Tackle, Seismic Toss,
Amnesia, Sludge Bomb. If I were to get attacked by anything, I wouldn't mind like a little Sludge Bomb. (laughs) If you know what I mean. (gasps) Wow! Guess what Pokemon I am. I'm a Mewtwo. I'm rare, that's for sure. At times you may let your
anger get the best of you. Yes. We all know that you're a
sensitive and thoughtful spirit at heart. The world needs you, but
just doesn't know it yet. That's true. Next test. Are you a Carrie, Samantha,
Charlotte, or Miranda? Now I feel like this is a
pivotal test for any gay man to know who you are in Sex in the City. I am going into this thinking that I am a Carrie, which
I know what that means. I am insufferable. I am self-centered. I think I am the main
character of everybody's story. But let's just take
the test to confirm it. It's 6:00 p.m., what are you doing? Wink. Still at work, getting a
pedicure, or working out. Probably working out. I like a 6:00 p.m. workout,
cause all the hot guys have just left work, and
my gym is full of all the hot guys. Priorities. Choose a drink. Cosmopolitan, Vodka Tonic,
Scotch on the rocks, water. Scotch on the rocks, easily. Your friend just got engaged. You give her a sincere
congratulations, sigh and say good luck, change the
subject to your new shoes, or pretend to be happy and
then make a snarky comment when she leaves. Honestly, sigh and say good luck. Cause I don't know if I believe in that. Sorry! Wow. This is really sorting me more than that Harry Potter thing. Your friend's wedding was called off. You, I can even say it before it happens. I would probably celebrate
with them, and go off and get them laid. Is that one of the options? What is something you
probably said in your life? I don't believe in the Republican
party or the Democratic party, I just believe in parties. Me. I'm so bloated and gassy,
I'm like a flotation device. Me! All these are me. Honestly, out of all of
them, I probably said, I'm so bloated and gassy,
I'm like a flotation device. That's great. No! Oh my God. Am I a Miranda? It says you wish you were
Carrie, but alas you're Miranda. That's rude. I'm not the Miranda of
my group of friends. I will have you know, I am no Miranda. I am the Carrie. But then it says you wish you were Carrie, so it's like, maybe that is the most real. Okay, well I feel like I
learned a lot about myself. I'm your average Mewtwo
Ravenclaw, who's got a little bit of Miranda
in her, who's just spit in a tube to learn about
where she comes from in the world. I'll let you know when
I get those results. But, I feel like I found
myself by now, a smidgen. Maybe. Plus if you guys wanna
check out 23andMe, it is a great way to learn
more about your ancestry, about your health, about
who you are, and where you come from in the world, and
where your ancestors come from. I feel like that's a really cool thing. The link to that is gonna be below. You can check it out and do your own test. I like this because I feel
like my mom, when I told her I was gonna do it, she was
like, I wanna do that too. It's actually a pretty good
gift for anybody in your life. I feel like your mom, your
dad, your grandma, grandpa. It lets them know a
little about who they are. Okay, so that is all I
have for you guys today. I will talk to y'all soon. Love ya. Later. Bye! 
On June 6th 2016, I got to visit Universal Orlando Resort. Home of two theme parks. Universal Studios Florida and Universal's Islands of Adventure. Hey everyone, my name is Tyler Oakley and I am here with my mother. - Hi guys! - Where are we today? - We're at Universal Studios. - We're at Universal Studios in Florida. We were just in Michigan yesterday and I was like "Mom, what
are you doing tomorrow?" - Nothing. - And so we were like well
let's just hop down to Florida and go to Universal. I feel like we deserve a
day off, don't you think? - It's gonna be fun today. - I think we do. We're about to ride the
Skull Island, Reign of Kong. It's brand new, look at
how intense that is. We're gonna be the
first people to ride it, isn't that insane? - That's crazy. - My mom's a little afraid. - I'm a little nervous. I'm a little snervous.
- You shouldn't be afraid. (laughs) (bouncy bell music) Mom, I didn't know you
got a part in the show. - Stop it. (laughter) Okay here we go. - [Voiceover] Okay we're on our way. (screams) (clanking) Oh god! (laughter) Holy crap. Oh my god! Oh my god! - [Voiceover] Get out! (growling) - Ah! (laughs) - Oh shit. We survived! - [Voiceover] Wait until
we come to a complete stop. - Okay so we just did Kong, mom what were your initial thoughts? - Oh my god it was so real. - It was so good, and usually
I'm not really into 3D stuff but it was actually really well done. Okay so we're about to ride
the Hollywood Rip Ride Rocket. They're about to take off I think. I'm a little bit afraid of heights, so we're about to go like all the way up. (laughter) I think it's the highest
part of the whole park. - Oh my god.
- [Tyler] Nervous? - Yes, I'm nervous. - It's gonna be good, it's gonna be good. Okay so we just did rocket,
mom what did you think? (laughs) - I feel like I'm still on it. - That was really fun, I loved it. So what did you listen to on rocket? - Some Motley Crue stuff. - Motley Crue like rock? - Like hard rock but I - I put on, cause you
get to pick whatever song you wanna listen to,
I put on Fergalicious, Glamorous, which is - Could you hear it? - Oh yeah it was like
blasting it was so good. Did you not hear yours? - I was screaming too much. - Oh yeah, well that makes sense. (laughter) Mom, what are you doing? (shouts) (laughs) Minion culture. So this might be the best thing that's happened to us all day. (laughter and screaming) Wait, you guys get in the picture. - Get in the picture guys. - Are you in?
- Am I in? - Come love me, mwah. Oh my god. (laughs) We were so bad at the shooting game. Well I tried to use two guns at once, which is thought was gonna be
successful, but it wasn't. That's us, riding the ride. That's literally what we looked like. (laughter) So we have been told that these chairs are the most comfortable
chairs at Universal. Mother, try it out. - Oh my god. (laughs) - Mom have you seen any
of the Harry Potters? - No. - Do you know anything about Harry Potter? - No. - Ey Jackie, good to see ya love. So Jackie have you had
some butter beer today? - No I haven't but I'm gonna try it. - Oh try the warm one. - [Tyler] Mom's going in. Nine and three quarters. (muffled talking) (laughter) Okay mom, show me your wand. - My wand is pretty. - Oh what is it? - It's got a curve. - Mine is cute. It's birch, I think. - Yours is pretty cool though. - It is cute, I think it's
got a lot of personality. - It's got character.
- It's got character. Makin' our way to Hogwarts. Okay so there's four houses in Hogwarts. Which one do you think you'd be in? - Tell me 'em. - You tell me. - I don't know their names. (laughter) - I think you'd be a Hufflepuff. - A Huffenpuff?
- Yeah. - Like H R Huffenpuff? - Yep, that's exactly what I think. (laughs) But you know what, so there's Slytherin, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, Griffindor. Each one has some good things about it. - I think probably a Huffenpuff that's - Okay Huffle.
- Oh. - Huffle
- Hufflepuff. - Okay so we just did the dragon challenge which is like a red dragon,
against like a blue dragon. And now we're getting a little refresher, we're at Hog's Head pub. And we're gonna try butter
beer for the first time. You can get it warm,
you can get it cold, you can get it frozen.
- We're gonna get cold because - I'm like, it is muggy
today, I need a frozen. - [Waitress] Beers and two frozen beers. - [Tyler] Oh my god. - [Waitress] And here
are some straws for you as well. - [Tyler] Thank you so much. There it is, that's good. Okay so I think we're gonna head home. It's raining if you couldn't tell. I think we're overdue for a nap. It was a lot of fun though right? - Yes it was great. - Nice little trip to Florida. Thanks for joining me. - Thanks for having me baby I love you. - I love you. If you guys have a suggestion
where we should go next, maybe this could be like
an adventure series. Me and queen Jackie. - Hi!
- Where should we go next? Let us know in the comments. And if you liked this
video give it a thumbs up. Thank you to Universal for sending us on a little vacation just for the day. - Yeah, that was so sweet. - So much fun, okay bye y'all. - Bye! - So I'm editing right now and
look how weird this part is of me and my mom, we're
like synced up like twins. Yeah! (laughs) Weird! Right? 
- When you were like (gibberish) (gibberish) What are you saying? (gibberish) - Still don't know to this day. (gibberish) - Oh, that's funny, I forgot about that. - Hello, everyone, my name's Tyler Oakley. Today, I'm joined with
Joe Sugg, say hello Joe. - Ding!
- There you go. And you may notice that it's
very 90s looking at the moment, and it is, look at my barnet. - What is that? Oh. - It's curtains.
- My-- what? - 90's curtains.
(sighing) - So, we got a box of shit
that is all 90's stuff. When were you born? Don't--
- I was born in 1991. - Oh. Did you have a favorite toy growing up? - Yes. I used to love-- yes.
- Cool. (laughing) - I used to love Mighty
Max. Remember Mighty Max? - Uh-uh, that seems straight. - Well, what sort of
toys did you play with when you were younger? - The Princess Diana beanie baby. Okay, so, we have a bunch of 90's toys, and we don't know what
we're about to open. I have no clue what's in this box. - So, we're gonna reach in,
- Yeah. - Pull out a toy,
- Yeah. - Play with it,
- Yeah. - Talk about it.
- Nothing matters. - I wanna say it's something okay. - Whatever.
- Am I going first? - Sure. You're making a right mess, mate. - I know, but it's huge. - Yeah, you're telling me.
- I've broken it. - Oh, bitch.
- Easy-- - I know what's up.
- Easy Bake Ultimate Oven?! - Do I get to keep these?
- I never had this growing up. - Really?
- No. - Did you-- are these the
thing that exists in the U.K.? - I feel like they were, but
we were never allowed them. She's probably like 50 years old now. That's the scary thing. - No, she's probably my age! How dare you?
- You think? - This is what you take the cakes out of that little Easy Bake oven with. - Or it's what you clamp to
your neck with like that. - Who needs a kitchen, I
wanna burn mine to the ground. This is all I need. - I never had this. Let
me get this straight. This is a-- a microwave for kids. - No, it's an oven. You put the stuff in, and
then it kinda transfers on a conveyor belt.
- Just the batter? - Then it comes out and it's a cake. You eat a cake, you can eat it. - As if. 100 percent-- - What's the calorie count? - And then you can educate
me on what it's worth. Oh, I think I know that guy.
- You-- wait. - Oh, I know it, I do remember those. - Why are they connected? Who are they, and what are they up to? - Well, you can see what they're up to. - I can. This is truly what I was up to. I would get the--
- Yeah, the TY. - No, no, no, the protectors.
- Really? - Because I thought these were
gonna be worth so much money. - I used to have this exact one, I think. - This one's named Peace.
- Bongo! - Jesus.
- Sorry. (laughing) - I genuinely used to have this exact one. "Bongo the Monkey who lives in a tree. The happiest monkey you'll
ever see." Oh, it rhymes. "In his spare time, he plays a guitar. One of these days, he'll be big star." - I feel like that's your story. Well, let me tell you about Peace. - I used to have--
- This one sucks. Reach into my box. - It's a foot pump! No, what the hell is this?
- What is it? - We have a Skip-A-Long. Place the round ball and--
- You know what you do? And you go (imitation sounds)
- You just jump over it. Let's give it a go.
- Ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-yeah. - Let's do it.
- I want it right now. - I thought all these sort of things are sort of things you find in Tyler Oakley's bedside drawer. - How dare you.
(laughing) Just a night in with me.
(laughing) Oh my gosh. (wheezes) You might have it on the wrong foot. (laughing) Yes, bitch! Yes, bitch!
- Ooh! That's nice! - Oh my God.
(laughing) What we got? What we got? (gasping) - Oh!
- Did you have one? - Yeah!
- Furby. - Shit on me, that is-- - I know that one.
- Excuse me? These are worth a lot.
- Are they? - How much did you pay for that? - This bitch wishes she were a beanie baby with this type of tag.
- Yeah, yeah. - And like, girl, it's, like, get real. Have you ever kissed a Furby?
- No. - Do you wanna kiss a Furby?
- No, I really don't. - [Both] Ooh, yes. - We had these at home called Bop-Its, but it didn't look like this.
- What do you mean? - Once again, this is coming
from your bloody bedside drawer aren't it?
- No! (laughing) Sometimes you bop it,
sometimes you twist it, sometimes--
- But where's spin it? - That's like Bop-It Extreme. - [Toy] Bop it!
(smacking) Pull it!
- Pull it! Ohh.
- Don't yell at me! - [Toy] Pull it. Pull it. Bop it. Bop it.
(wheezes) Pull it. Bop it. Pull it.
- Fuck! - [Toy] Twist it. Pull it.
- This is so stressful. That was the most stressful
thing that I've ever (inaudible) - That's like Bop-It now-- (laughing) - Okay. What do we got? What is this? (gasping) Oh my God, do you remember this? - Tomogachi?
- No. This was before--
- What the fuck is that? NSYNC?!
- This was, like, the original, like, iPod,
and you would buy this and it was like a keychain
for your, like, bag. And then you'd be like, "Hey, can I borrow your NSYNC clip chip?" Oh my God, imagine
carrying this on your keys and you're like, "Girl, anybody wanna listen to the new NSYNC?" - But that'd be cool,
that'd be cool nowadays. - I do think this would be retro. People would be like "What is that?" I'm like "You don't remember Bit Clip?" And I'll clip it in, honey.
- Oh. Hippity boppity. (laughing) - Dirty Pop! Dirty Pop! What's the deal with this pot life? Me at the gym.
(laughing) - Here we go. - Aww.
- Holy-- aww, this is nostalgia right here. - That's tender. This feels like vintage. But did you ever rewind it like this? - Nah, I try-- what I used
to do, I used to cheat-- you know you can't open this, look-- - You're not supposed to. - Press this little button here. There. - All you do is shenanigans.
- Yeah. So what do you do when you open it? - Just nothing.
- Do you ever pull it out? - Just look at the tape, and go "Yeah." - Once, my little sister's favorite movie, I'd, like, pulled all
of it out, and I said, "You're never watching this again." Are you excited for the new Lion King? - No.
- Beyonce. - What?
(sharp intake of breath) (laughing) (screaming) - What? Did you have this?
- No! - What is it?
- Socker-Boppers! - No. - Person to blow it up, and
then hit each other wins. - What? No, I don't like to-- - I feel like a Mario character. - Will you just blow that up? Thanks, Joe. So, now what? Don't.
This ain't the thumbnail. Tell me if this hurts. I'm just gonna hit you as
hard as I can on your head. - No, don't, 'cause I'll-- you'll whack-- no--
- What? I'm afraid to hurt you.
- Go. - Did that hurt?
- No, a little bit harder. Yep. Bloody hell!
(laughing) Oh my God. Look.
- Ooh, oh! - That hurt? - No, this actually is kinda nice. - This a massage?
- I just kinda like it a lot. What do we got? No, bitch.
- Oh! - I've never seen one of these. - He also likes eating them, look. - No, no, no, no.
- It's Tickle-Me Elmo. - C'mere ya bastard--
- Does it work? No. Another thing for my bedroom.
- Yeah, it is. (thumps) - [Elmo] Oh, boy!
(wheezes) - Are you ticklish?
- No. - Wait, what?
- No, no. - You're not?
- I'm not actually-- aww, hey hey! - I would buy a Tickle-Me Joe.
- A Swedish chef. That could be a good merch. - What is this?
(screaming) Oh, this is actually exciting for me. - This is blimming brilliant.
- Y'all. You don't know-- this is actually-- if you play Pokemon Go, it's
kinda like the same thing. The graphics are impeccable. This game actually sucks in hindsight because you just feed the
critter, and then it poops and you have to clean
up the poop. That's it. - Yeah, that's it.
- It's not a good game. - When it dies, you get
a little upset about it. - Well, that's not required. - It's about to hatch. It's hatched!
- What is it? What is it? - It's hatched!
- What is it? What is it? It's smiling.
- It's hap-- ooh, it's a--
- blob. - It's a blob.
- I love our blob. - What'd you call it?
- Bob. - Bob the Blob?
(laughing) - Tyler and Joe, proud
parents of Bob the Blob. - Look at our baby.
- (laughing) Bob the Blob. - He's so cute.
- I love that. - Great, well, I'll cherish him forever. - Make sure you do, though, raise him like a confident parent. - Are we gonna have a,
like, joint-custody? How's this gonna work? - No.
(both gasping) - Oh my God! Wait!
- Holy shit! - That-- (disbelieving laughing) Does it work? Does it
work? What's going on? Oh my God. A GameBoy Color. - Got full of goosebumps! Look! - Oh my God, you really do. (gasping) - Putty.
- Putty. Play-Doh!
- Oh, Play-Doh. - What were we supposed to do with it? Like build things?
- Eat, eat, eat it. - You don't eat it.
- No, but you canned it-- you can do it.
- No, you can't. - They wouldn't make it if you couldn't-- if kids could eat it. Eat a
little bit, it's so salty. - Not intended to be eaten! What is this? No. No, no-- (gasps) No!
You are not-- Joe Sugg! You did not eat the Play-Doh. I see it in the back of your-- no! Joe.
- Tyler. (wheezes) - I feel like I took a trip
down memory lane with you, thank God-- (Elmo laughs)
I don't like that one bit. We're gonna go play with our shit, but good luck with your lives. If you wanna find Joe,
where could we find you? - In the description box below. - If you're lucky.
(laughing) If you like this video,
give it a thumbs up, and I'm gonna link to
all of our past collabs in the description, so go watch those. Truly, that's the memory
lane trip you should go down. Okay, that's all, love you guys. Bye! 
- Hi, everyone! My name is Tyler. I just wanted to say thank you so much for all of the support so far on the Tyler Oakley show. The first episode with Kerry Washington, Celine Dion, Ellen
Degeneres, was so much fun and you guys gave it so much love. And now it's time for the second episode. This one is with Seth
Rogan and we were giggling the entire time. He is so much fun. I think you guys are gonna like it. If you do, give it a
thumbs up and let me know in the comments who you want to see in a future episode. And, yeah, enjoy! Hey, everyone! My name is Tyler Oakley and welcome to The Tyler Oakley Show. I am joined today by the always hilarious Seth Rogan, everybody. - Very kind of you. Thank you. (audience cheer) - Congratulations, first
and foremost, on life. - Thank you. - You're doing it. - I'm living life, man. - You've been a part of my life so much this week. I just watched Neighbors 2, - Nice. - And Sausage Party. - You've been inundated. - I have been feeling you within my soul. - That's a lot of me. - Sausage Party was hilarious. - Thank you so much. It's a crazy movie. - I was gasping, I was
shocked, I was appalled in the best way possible. - I've seen it like a
hundred times and I'm still shocked when I watch it that they let us make that. - Are you gonna do a Sausage Party 2, because if you do, - Yeah. - I wanna be something. - We're talking about it
now, so if it happens, you'll get the call. - I would love it. Okay, cool. Are you on social media in any sense? - I am. - I know you're on
Twitter, but do you like Snapchat, do you... - I'm not on Snapchat. I use Instagram. I'm pretty much on Twitter and Instagram. - Do you think you're good at it? Do you do it like all the time, or... - No. I get baited into stupid arguments with morons. - Do you argue with strangers? - Sometimes. - No! - And I'm always like,
"Never again" and then I'm just like, "What am
I doing? I am talking to an idiot" - Well, you know who is good at Twitter? - Yeah. - Your mother. - She is. - She is incredible. - She really is. - I have seen master
lists. The people, they live for her. She just reached 30,000 followers. - That's amazing. - Which is like incredible. - That's so crazy. - She is a celebrity within herself. - She really is. And she
is really funny on there. - She's great. - But, - Famous last words. - She says a lot of
sexual things I'd prefer her not to share. (upbeat music) - In Hollywood, there's
rumblings that you might enjoy partaking and
enjoying some munchies. - I do like munchies. - The internet has theories about certain ingredients that
go together that make the perfect 3 a.m. munchies. - Yeah. - So I felt like today
we would try to discover if they are good or not. - Okay. (Classical music) (Bell) - Ew. This is gross. - Do we dip that? - Yeah. Ugh. Chocolate and citrus? I guess there's like those chocolate blossom things, right? - Listen, there are
worse things you will be forced to eat in life. - It's like I'm having a
- I love it. I love it. Creamsicle. Wow. It tastes exactly like a Creamsicle. - I actually love this. - I thought as a pothead I knew so much. - No. - I don't. - Let me introduce you
to the world. (Bell) - There is always more to learn. - Oh, no. - This looks gross but
now I hate to prejudge any of these things.
I've had my eyes opened. - This might be a Creamsicle. - Exactly. In an 80's movie, this is
what the pregnant woman would be yelling for. - This is not bad. (Bell) (Bell) - It's good. Pepperoni and peanut butter, it works. - I guess. I'm done with that one. (Bell) - What do we have... - Have you eaten this stuff? - I have not. - Olives and chocolate? - I'm gonna like section it off. - Oh, so she's fancy. (Both laugh) (Classical music) You are so ritzy. - I know. I am. - Cheers. - That's not bad. (Bell) - Is it Okay? It's Okay. - It goes together better
than you would think. - Well, I'm done with it. (Buzzer) (Bell) I'm ready for the next one. Oh, my God. - Cheese and grapefruit? This looks gross. - You know what, you're gonna love it. - Have you had this? - No. My food is limited to like Chipotle. - (Laughter) - Straight up. - That's it, just Chipotle. - Nothing crazy in it. - It's kinda like benign. (Buzzer) - It's just nothing. - It kinda cancels each other out. - It's nothing. (Bell) - It's peanut butter, jelly and sriracha? - Now, do you like spicy? - I do like spicy food. - Ketchup is too spicy
for me, so this might be, I am that person. - You are the whitest human being... - Thank you. - On the entire planet. - You know what, I'll take it. - Maybe make a little
pile and we'll dip it. - Oh, so she wants to dip. - Yes. - I'm afraid I'm gonna just... - Oh, that's weird. It's not bad. (Bell) All I'm learning is I have no barometer for what tastes good. - Once it mixes (Bell) - Our taste levels are so low. - I just don't care. (Bell) This doesn't look bad to me at all. - This just looks like
something you can buy. This is a whole marshmallow. This has been the best meal... - I know. - That I've had in the studio all week. - Killer. (Bell) - Yeah. That works. (Bell) We just had a full meal. You are welcome. - I've had my eyes
opened in a lot of ways. - You will get the bill in the mail. - We must've eaten 85 cents worth of food here today. - Yeah. If there's one thing that
I know that you enjoy more than the munchies,
it would be doing good in the world. - It is. - I hear that you have a
charity with your wife. Can you tell us about it? - Yeah. It's called Hilarity for Charity, which rhymes. - Already off to a good start. - Exactly. My wife's mother got
diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's when she was
in her early 50's and we found that there was
really no one our age that was talking about it. We created a charity mostly designed to raise
awareness among young people about Alzheimer's,
but we also provide in-home care for people
who can't afford it. - Awesome. - That's where half of our money goes. And we have a college program... - Hey! - That should be starting soon for college children, that's what I
call them. I don't know if that's the term. - I think that it is. - But I say college children. - The kids. If you guys
want to get involved again, go to the website.
It's gonna be below. All of the information will be there. Thank you for chowing
down on munchies with me. - Thanks, man. That was good stuff. - Yeah, okay, cool. Bye, y'all. (jazzy music) So, that was episode two.

but y'all deserve to know what's up. So, I will see you guys soon, hopefully. I love you, talk to you soon. Okay, good luck with your lives. (Blows kiss) 
- Hello, everybody, my
name is Tyler Oakley and it's been forever since I sat down and just like talked to you
about what's going on in my life so I feel like I just
wanna make a little update. I wanna make a little diary entry so that you guys know
what's going on in my life. So, without further ado, this
is what's been happening. Korey and I got to be on a
special Amazing Race edition episode of The Price Is Right,
and we got called on down. It was like, you know,
it's one of those things that I watched my entire
childhood and then it happened. I was like, "Oh my God, this is surreal." I got to host an entire episode
of The Ellen DeGeneres Show, which is like, bucket
list, like that's been on my bucket list, so it's very bizarre. I needed a little weekend
away with my sisters. Not my actual sisters, but like every time we get together, these four people, we always call ourselves
like sisters, the weekend, in case you're wondering
how gay I am (laughing). But we had a sisters'
weekend and we went to Vegas, and this is us with Celine Dion. We got to go to the Celine Dion concert. It was so good, like, she is a living icon and so much of my time in college was spent listening to Celine Dion while playing Settlers of Catan, so like it was great for
me, and she was so nice. I also made one of the most
important purchases of my life, the Oprah Winfrey 20th
Anniversary box set DVD thing. It's like 17 or 18 hours, I
don't know how many hours. A butt load of hours
of, like, best moments and behind the scenes commentary. If you ever need to just cry, which I feel like is a healthy thing, this is like the best
purchase I've ever made. I also made some brand new merch. If you wanna get it,
it's on District Lines. There's some posters and some t-shirts. An example of some
t-shirts, that I have one that says, "lol ur not tyler oakley." It's a shirt that's applicable anytime you encounter anybody
in your life except me, and it also comes in black for those of you who are just like me
and have a black on black on black on black on black
on black on black aesthetic. Even though today I'm
not even wearing black. I'm wearing this cute little alien shirt. How adorable is that? Also, oh my God, so I have
been going to so many Prides. I went to LA Pride, which was so much fun, and then I went to
Portland Pride, which was, I don't know, it just
felt very like, community, and I really liked it,
it was a lot of fun. It was my first time in Portland, and I got to meet a lot
of you randomly there. I didn't tell anybody I was going. I was just like, "Let's
just go up to Portland" and one of my favorite things about Pride is being able to go see
LGBTQ artists perform and see the diversity that
exists within our community, and I was thinking about
this and how much I like it, and I wanted to do something
for Pride this year, which leads me to a little announcement that I wanted to make. I have partnered with Heard Well to make a compilation album. It is called Pride
Jams, and it's all music made by LGBTQ artists, and I was really trying to be conscious of
diversity in all senses, so romantic attraction,
sexual attraction, race, gender, everything that
you might wanna find that is diverse within
the LGBTQ community, you will find it in this, and it's not just great
music for you to enjoy, but it also is benefiting the Trevor Project, which I love, so, so when you get this, know that you're supporting LGBTQ artists, some
of them not Top 40 artists that you will ever find
on the radio, but also, it's benefiting an organization
that helps save LGBTQ lives so it's like a win, win, win situation, and it's good music, so enjoy. The link to that is below. It is available for download
on iTunes right now, and if you wanna get a
signed physical copy, there are a limited amount on the website below,
heardwell.com/tyleroakley Go support Pride Jams. It's a win, win, win situation, and yeah. What else is new? I went home to Michigan for a little week. I got to see all my family. My nephew was in a lacrosse game. It was the cutest thing of all time. I saw Finding Dory twice,
I loved it that much. I, so I got to see like
an advanced screening because I interviewed Ellen all about it, if you wanna see an
exclusive little clip, bam. There has been some speculation about a certain couple in the film and I think it's kind of,
because they never mention if they're a lesbian couple or not, but I think it's a little
bit of an assumption based on like maybe their hair. Do you have any inside
scoop for us about that? - I don't have any inside scoop. I'm pretty good at spotting lesbians. I think I would've spotted a lesbian, going, "Isn't there a lesbian?" So, anyway, so then I was
looking for the lesbian-- (Tyler laughs) and then when I, when I saw the part they were talking about, it was just a woman with a really bad, short haircut. Then I was deeply offended. - I know, how dare them. - I was like, is that what
a lesbian is defined by, is a bad, short haircut? So, I don't know if she's a lesbian or not or you know, and now
that animated characters probably like going, "I'm not a lesbian". - [Tyler] (laughs) Too funny. So that was just like one
question from the interview, but how bizarre to be
going from admiring Ellen then being interviewed on her show and then me interviewing her and then me hosting an episode of her show. Just like, life is crazy, dude. Life's crazy. Life is good, life is crazy. Okay, so that's all I
have for you guys today, I hope you have a good life, if you like this video, be sure to give it a thumbs up and be sure to get Pride Jams, it's available on iTunes right now or if you want a physical copy, go click the link below. A portion of the proceeds everywhere go toward The Trevor Project, whether you get like a digital copy or a physical copy. So, go support it. It's a good way to support an organization that helps save lives. Okay, that's all, I love you, good luck with your lives, bye. Call Queen Jackie. (phone ringing) - [Voiceover] Hey, babe. - Hey, what's up? - [Voiceover] I'm hanging out with Evie, she's not feeling well
so I came over to babysit and I'm babysitting her and the dog. - Oh, exciting, you're
living the Michigan life. - [Voiceover] What are
you doing a film for? - A film, a video? I'm just making a video,
was talking to the people. You want to say anything to the people? - [Voiceover] Hi, everybody. 
- Hey everyone, my name is
Tyler Oakley, and back on May 25th, 2013, I
tweeted, to Warby Parker, Hi, I want to start wearing your glasses, can our love affair
start immediately please? So now let's fast forward
to August 9th, 2016, where I uploaded this
video, with my brand new pair of glasses, which
everyone had an opinion on, Kathy tweeted me, you look so
different with those glasses which I replied, they're my
new glasses, because they were and then Taylor said I like
them, to which I replied thanks, I made them
myself, because, spoiler, I made them myself, I feel
like I've been dropping hints left and right, I should
just tell you, you guys, I have worked with Warby
Parker to make my own line of glasses (shouts) I
know this is like the craziest thing I have ever done, so
I figured I would bring you all along for the day when
I did my official photoshoot for the glasses, enjoy Ashley and I have been
getting dressed together for about two years,
and today we get to do a fun little shoot and this
was a suit that they like, painted, they had to like
paint the polka dots on, so you may notice, all of
the pocket squares match the lense cloths that come
with each pair of glasses if you get one of the
pairs, it will come with one that matches something from
the photo shoot, I love that Ashley and Kyle, fixing every
little thing that I messed up - You've got wrinkles, no wrinkles (laughter) - For no wrinkles, it's a
couple of years too late (laughter) I can't not smile Okay so now I'm in this
box and it's a lot warmer than you think, I was like
kind of like a contortionist for the moment, I'm
going, serving everything that I possibly could,
hoping that one angle would not look my worst the weird thing about photo
shoots is they take a million pictures and you hope for just
like three, that you don't hate, cause when you're
looking at pictures of yourself over and over you're like I
don't look like a human anymore, but in this box, I feel like
I was like, giving it all, this was like I, it could be my new home (upbeat music) (camera flashing) So I think we're almost done,
you're catching me mid pamper I think we're almost
done, we're trying to get one last little portrait
with a particular frame, and then I think we're done, thanks babes (camera flashing) - [Photographer] Will you
show it to me a little bit Get that shoulder round, on
the left shoulder, there it is beautiful, give me a serious,
give me a rotation just go from there, bring it
round, one more, to the camera turn quick, real snap to
camera, and boom, okay we got it - Wait that was it, are
we all done, we did it! (applause) Guys, we did it that was it, that was my
photoshoot for Warby Parker I cannot believe this
is actually happening, you guys know I have been talking
about Warby Parker glasses and giving you guys the
hookup for years now, and finally, I have my
own line, that is insane if you are a glasses
wearer, if you like glasses for fashion or function or
sunglasses for the light, I don't know what you do with your life, they are super affordable
and high quality, I love them I wear them, I think
you guys will love them too I have a whole bunch of
options, as you saw in this little video so, let me know
if you get them, tweet them to me a little selfie I
would love it, or Instagram, I don't know, use the
hashtag, thank you so much for helping me make it to this
point I love you guys, see you soon, can't wait
to see you in your cute new frames, okay bye (upbeat music) - [Photographer] Stop walking into it (laughter) 
- Hey everyone! My name is Tyler Oakley and I don't even remember when I was growing up, hearing about gay people
in like my history class or even seeing like gay characters on TV. So I can't even really
fathom how frustrating it would be for queer people of color when it comes to having
even less representation. Which is especially inexcusable because LGBTQ people of color that are activists have always been on the front line of the fight for equality. And just because Black
History Month is ending doesn't mean this
conversation has to stop. There are endless black
LGBTQ-plus trail blazers who deserve attention
for their important work. But here are eight that
I look up to that I think should be just as famous as Harvey Milk. Bayard Rustin was a gay
civil rights activist and Martin Luther King Jr's
advisor and personal secretary. Rustin actually helped organize
the 1963 March on Washington where MLK Jr. gave his
famous I Have a Dream speech. Like, you hear about the
I Have a Dream speech in elementary school and
I just feel like how cool would it be for young, queer kids to know that a gay man helped give
that speech an audience. Audre Lorde was a theorist,
poet, advocate, and author and she broke major ground
when she talked about the intersections of class,
and gender, and race, and being LGBTQ-plus. And, I know that I never
learned about intersectionality when I was growing up, but if
you want to know what it is, intersectionality, in
a very basic sentence, is the idea that a person
as many identities that are interconnected and they
cannot be examined separately from one another. So when you think about
the LGBTQ-plus community, intersectionality acknowledges
that there are Muslim people, there's disabled people,
there's Asian people, there's every type of person within our community, and that is something to be celebrated. James Baldwin was a
gay writer who examined and articulated what it
meant to be marginalized in America. James is incredibly
influential and his books even inspired my favorite
movie of the year, if you haven't seen it yet, I
don't know where you've been, Moonlight, which won Best Picture. If you haven't seen
it, you need to see it. It is incredible. So like, he's like making a
difference still to this day. Marsha P. Johnson is one of my absolute favorites. She was an American drag
queen, a sex worker, and a gay liberation activist. But to know more about Marsha, you kind of need some context. So the Stonewall Riots were
a series of spontaneous, violent demonstrations by members of the LGBTQ-plus community against a police raid that
happened at the Stonewall Inn, which is a gay bar in New York City. These riots are widely
considered to be the most important event leading up to
the gay liberation movement, and the modern fight for
equality for LGBTQ-plus rights in America. And Marsha was there leading the charge. She was like right at the front. One of my favorite fun
facts about Marsha P Johnson is when people would ask her
what her middle name was, the P, what it stood for, she
would say "Pay It No Mind." I'm like what a badass. Born in 1899, Ruth Ellis
became widely known as the oldest surviving
lesbian and LGBTQ-plus activist at the age of 100. And, in a time when public
policy and cultural sentiment told people of color and LGBTQ-plus people to do otherwise, I feel
like living a long, unapologetic life is the ultimate fuck you to any bigot. Keith Boykin was the
highest ranking openly gay person in the Clinton White House and he helped organize
the nation's very first meeting between LGBTQ-plus
leaders and a U.S. president. Being a part of the
conversation is so important, and Keith is the one
that made that happen. In 2008, E. Denise Simmons
became the very first openly lesbian African American
mayor in the United States. Democracy only works if we get involved and I really love the
idea of Simmons inspiring an entire generation of LGBTQ-plus people to run for office and be in charge. Lorraine Hansberry wrote
A Raisin in the Sun, which I read in high school. We spent weeks studying it and it boggles my mind
that we were never told that she was actually the
very first black lesbian to have her play performed on Broadway, which is like a big deal. I'm like, I can't fathom
that they'd never told us the cultural significance of it. I love the internet because it provides so
many places where I can do my own research and learn
about amazing trail blazers like these, so. I'm gonna put a whole bunch of links. If you want to read more,
which I highly encourage, you can go do your own research and find out more about
these incredible people. Representation matters, so if you want to know
some black Youtubers or Twitter activists that I love, and I follow, and learn so much from, I'm gonna put a list in
the description below. Go give them a follow
because they are incredible. And I am always learning
and I am eager to grow, so if you have a favorite
LGBTQ-plus activist of color that you look up to, let me know in the comments below. I will be reading. Thank you so much. I hope you guys liked this video. I will see you guys soon. (kissing sound) Later! (light-hearted music) Oh my god. That just freaked me out. A cat just jumped over. Holy fuck! And it's looking me dead
in the eye right now. That's so creepy. 
- Hey, everyone, my name is Tyler Oakley, and today I am going to
give you five easy ways to take care of yourself. I feel like self care is often overlooked. It should be a priority to everyone, so here are like little
things that you can do that can really help alter
how you approach the world. Number one is gonna sound silly,
but I have been doing this. It's be thankful out loud. And you don't have to like talk out loud, but be conscious of what
you're thankful for. So here's a little challenge you can do, and it might sound stupid, but trust me. I was gonna go get coffee the other day and I have this walk from
my home to my coffee shop, and I was like, "Okay,
I'm gonna find five things "on my walk to be thankful for." And when you think like that, it really alters how you take in what's happening outside
of your own world. And by the end of it, I was like, "I am thankful for that
tree for being beautiful "and making my neighborhood look so nice." I saw a preschool that I
had never noticed before and I was like, "You
know what, I am thankful "that I live in an environment
where people can be "taken care of from such an early age." You start to see things
that you don't normally see, because you're going out of
your way to look for things to be thankful for, and by
the end of it, I was like, "Wow, so much is good happening around." Not everything is so annoying or dreadful or like, you know, all these things that you might get hung up on because it's easy to get annoyed,
if you approach the world with a different outlook, you see things and you're thankful for them. I know it's silly, but try. So my second piece of
advice is to tidy up, and I learned about
this from a book called The Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up. It is on audible.com if you
wanna get the audio book of it. It is perfect for if you
wanna listen to an audio book on the road or while you're
exercising or whatever. It is a great way to get the book, and I recommend it this month. If you use audible.com/tyleroakley, you get your first 30 days free. Audible.com is the leading
provider of audio books across all types of literature,
whether it's non-fiction or fiction or periodicals,
and if you use that link, you can get this book or any others with your free 30 day trial. There are tons of lessons in the book, but I would say it's great to
help you organize your life and realize like what you
need, what you don't need, and like helps you respect the things that you keep in your life. When you have a space
where you feel in control, it helps you, I guess, also
feel in control on the inside. Also, when you're
tidying up your own home, it gives you an opportunity to give back to your local community,
so whether that's, you know, to Goodwill
or to a local shelter, or I always donate to
the LGBT Resource Center. I'm gonna put some links to
places where you can donate or how you can find places to
donate in your own community. Again, it is audible.com/tyleroakley. If you use that link, you get the hookup. You're welcome in advance. Thank you so much to audible.com
for sponsoring this video. You are the best, as always. Okay, so my third little piece of advice for self care is to stretch. I know some of you guys have like long work days, long school days where you're just sitting there, hunkered down. If you take like five minutes to get up, walk around, stretch, I don't
know what you're able to do, but whatever way that you can stretch. I know it's silly, but
just, it re-energizes you. It helps you refresh, and
then you're able to approach whatever you were doing
before with fresh eyes. Okay, my fourth piece
of advice for self care is to talk to yourself like
you are your own best friend. When you look in the mirror and
you point out all the flaws, you're best friend would not do that. A best friend is like, "Yes,
those pants look great. "That top is the best." "That lipstick color." I don't know how people
compliment each other. "Your hair has never looked better." Blah, blah, blah, all these things. Your best friend would
not be like, "That zit." No, your best friend is gonna
point out your best things, and if you are taking care of yourself, you will be your own best friend. You should be your own best friend. And finally, my last piece
of advice for self care today is to ask for help. No one person has all the answers, and when you accept that, it
takes a burden off of yourself, firstly, and I feel like when
somebody asks me for advice for something that I know
that I might be an expert on and I can help them in some capacity, it makes me feel better,
plus it's helping them because then they're
getting what they need, the help that they need, so
it's like this never ending circle of positivity and
encouragement and, I don't know, I think it's a really courageous thing to ask somebody for help. Knowing when to ask for help
is a huge self care skill that you can learn and you
can practice in your own life. So yeah, that is all I
have for you guys today. If you liked these five little
tips, give me a thumbs up on this video and maybe I'll
do more videos like this in the future, and I wanna know what is one way that you take care of yourself, and let me know in the comments below. Thank you again for watching. I hope you have a good
day and a good life, and I'll see you guys soon, okay, bye. 
- Hi everyone, my name is Tyler Oakley and today I felt like just hanging out, chillin with you guys,
answering some questions. Let's see what you want to know. Emma says, why are the Kardashians famous? The Kardashians are famous
because they decided not to be defined by one
slut shaming incident that happened how many years ago? And instead take control
of their situation. And they are incredibly
smart business people so, I don't have any problem with it, and if the general public
is going to eat it up, why are we to blame the Kardashians? Shouldn't we be looking at ourselves if we have a problem with that? Just food for thought. Aoife says, react to
this picture of my rabbit fighting my dog. Oh my
god, this is literally Pokemon in real life, like
what is going on here? I am very intrigued by the
ferocity of your rabbit, and I am literally your dog, I would probably be
terrified of this huge hare. Somebody's gonna drag me in the comments and be like, ooh well, let me tell you the difference between
a hare and a rabbit. Merchoakley says, can you read this word? Oh, it's one of my favorite words, and almost was in my book. Akak-pag-bad-dad-gab, oh, god. Akak-pag-bad-abag-bag.
Oh my god it's so hard. Akak-pag-bad, hmm. Akak-pag-bad-abag-badab.
Oooh I think I got that. Akak-pag-bad-aga oh, that's a hard word. I want you guys to send me
your attempts to use this word, with the hastag akak-pag-bag-abag, this. Hailey says, is there
going to be any way to meet you at Vidcon? Yes, there will be plenty of
ways to meet me at Vidcon. I am going this year, but
there is one way that will get you a personal meet and greet. I am working on partnership with Benzac to take a stand against bullying. Now as y'all know, acne
can really affect your self image during a really
challenging part of your life. Benzac empowers teens to
take control of their lives, and their acne, and, they
are hosting a contest. All you have to do is
submit a video talking about a personal experience when
you've had to take control to solve a problem in your life. So, for example maybe you had bad grades so you took control by getting a tutor. Or maybe you were being bullied online, so you took control by
blocking the haters. If you are the winner, you
are going to win a trip for two to Vidcon, and
you're gonna get a personal meet and greet with me. Thank you Benzac for working
in partnership with me on this. I am so excited
to not only meet somebody at Vidcon, but also to
encourage taking control of your life and standing up
for yourself. I love that. Again, all of the details
are in the description below, and be sure to check back
to vote for your favorites. Tioli says, what's your
biggest milestone you've hit? I've just hit 150 subscribers on YouTube, and to me, that's amazing. Well, Tioli, to me that also is amazing. I would say my biggest
milestone is not necessarily subscriber count based. I
like to track my progress as a YouTuber based on
the videos that I make. Not the reach that I have,
or the amount of people that just happen to push subscribe, I would definitely say
the biggest milestone you can have as a YouTuber
is uploading you first video. And I know, I
say that all the time, but like, that is the
biggest hurdle any YouTuber can face. Would you rather
a bagel shaped armadillo or an armadillo shaped bagel? Oh my god, as somebody who loves carbs, as somebody who can't get enough of carbs, but, I do like an armadillo, I mean I've never hung out with an armadillo, I like dogs, are
armadillos kinda like dogs? I feel like armadillos
are just like hard-bodied dogs, I don't know. My
only interaction with any type of armadillo is san true. So I'm gonna have to go with the bagel, cuz I would eat that, but then again I would probably eat an armadillo, like lord knows I'm not a vegetarian. Listen, I don't know. Are you excited about working with camp17 and doing hashtag best
camp ever in August? I am so excited for this.
If you don't know already, I am running a summer camp with my buddy Bethany Mota. It is this August, and if you'd like to
come and you are between the ages of 10 and 17, you
are welcome to register. There are still some spots available, and I keep hearing from so many of you that have already registered
and are excited about it. I too am excited, I cannot
wait to just hang out with you, in an atmosphere
that's not based on waiting in line to get a
picture with a YouTuber, you know what I mean? Like it's gonna be an opportunity to for
us to actually hang out. All the details about that
are in the description, I hope to see you there. Rachel says, what was
the last text message you sent and received? I'm
a little nervous about this. Oh, I got a text, literally
one minute ago from my friend Dolan. He was
my best friend from middle school and high school and, he says, hey buddy, what's up? I'm gonna
say, just filming a video. Now I just talked about you in it, ha. Arcticoakley says, have
you hugged someone today? I didn't hug anybody yet today. I haven't left my
apartment, how sad is that. I should hug someone, I should hug me. I'm gonna hug me, this is nice. Kate says, what is your
favorite Snapchat filter? I am the most basic
bitch alive, which means that I love the dog Snapchat filter, I think it's the cutest
thing in the world. I'm only on Snapchat for the puppy filter. But yeah, that is all I
have for you guys today. I just wanted to do a
quick little Q and A, so I hope you liked it. If you do, be sure to give it a thumbs up, and I wanna know, what is
