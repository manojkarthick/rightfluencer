many serious game streamers use a second PC actually so they got one for gaming and then another one dedicated to encoding and interacting with their audience so we were brainstorming and talking about some cool projects that we've done in the past with unread and virtualization technology and well let's just say the old light bulb went off what if we could build using an Intel high core count core I nine processor a two-in-one solution splitting a single Tower with a single motherboard effectively in half to perform both of those duties virtually of course would we end up with a viable day-to-day streaming solution well thanks to Intel sponsorship of this investigation we are about to find out [Music] okay so let's start with this why would anyone want to run a virtualized two-in-one setup as opposed to just having two separate machines I mean bare metals more efficient right let's take a look at a few reasons why it might actually be a cool idea first and most importantly for many is cost unless you already have a second computer to dedicate to encoding you would still have to buy GPU RAM and storage for two but you could save the considerable expense of many other components in addition your total power consumption and heat output will be a touch lower than running separate PCs meaning your energy bill will be lower - the second reason to go virtual is space while it's not a concern for some if you're streaming from a college dorm or a small apartment this means one less tower taking up space in your gaming area not every virtualized - and one has to be this big reason number three versatility since the gaming and streaming setups are virtualized not only are any potential software issues confined to each VM but they can also be much more quickly and easily backed up or cloned once you're set up so in the future you can easily hit the reset button in case anything should go wrong also thanks to the magic of on raid your gaming / streaming machine can act as a file and media server for the rest of your household so the plan then is to use a portion of our CPU to encode our video stream using x264 with high quality settings that way we can avoid the potential for scheduler conflicts without manually assigning CPU affinities and task manager like we would if we were doing both tasks on one OS well okay Linus this all sounds great but there's got to be disadvantages right well there is the fact that when using virtualization some devices can't be easily allocated to a VM our onboard audio for example shares an eye a new group with the chipset and essentially cannot be used same story with USB ports each grouping of ports has to be on a dedicated controller in order to pass it through so that you can hot plug your devices something that we pretty much take for granted these days and finally while it's possible to run on raid without its own video card it's a royal pain so we grabbed a dedicated sound card for our gaming VM and extra USB controller we're using one of the onboard ones for the other VM and an el cheapo third graphics card for under 8 so we are ready to you oh wait so during our testing we found that gaming performance was actually best when we assigned four cores and eight threads to our gaming VM and in some configurations we actually found tests that performed better in a virtualized environment compared to an equivalent configuration running on bare metal Y so this is the kind of thing that we encounter sometimes when we're running on the bleeding edge we spoke with on raids developers about the issue and they're putting together some information to share with the Red Hat and KVM hypervisor folks so that hopefully we'll see a resolution by the time game's demand more cores for optimal performance but for the time being our classic four core eight thread setup manages a negligible performance hit compared to bare metal and our streaming VM can suck up those extra cores anyway so that it could be used for heavier video editing and faster encoding for those edited videos that can later be uploaded to YouTube or other video on-demand sites alright then so let's show off the rest of the setup we're using the utterly unique level one text DisplayPort 1.2 KVM from Wendell and his team this gives us support for high refresh rate monitors like a Seuss's 240 hertz rog swift PG 2 v 8 q and easy switching between our VMs saving us from using two keyboards and mice though it should be noted that having an extra one on hand is pretty useful in some cases we're using Corsairs massive obsidian 900 D tower thanks to its ample cooling capacity and we're powering all three of our GPUs the 1080 Ti for gaming the 1050 Ti for streaming and that basic one for unrated off of an ax 1200 eye power supply and we've thrown in a monstrous on raid array of 712 terabyte Seagate iron wolf pro drives for 60 terabytes of protected storage that's visible to both VMs not to mention as I said before anyone else on the network who needs it allowing us to record our streams basically indefinitely so we can make them epic frag vids after we're done streaming finally for our capture Carlo and other surprise no capture card so we actually originally had planned to use one that 4k one from El Gato but this ended up being way cooler so our gaming VM is actually transmitting its video and audio feed to the encoder VM using the low impact OBS NDI plugin which runs with very little quality loss over our virtualized 10 gigabit network connection between our VMs then from there we've set the streaming machines output settings to Twitch's ultimate 1080p 60fps quality setting and would you look at that after a few command-line tweaks we could not only encode on the fly but do so at x264 s-slow preset which is 6 notches up from the default potato quality ultra-fast and to validate our original hypothesis is there some benefit from separating them in VMs we pushed our 11 hyper threaded cores to their limit in the streaming vm to the point where we forced our encoded video to start dropping frames then we went back to the gaming vm to see if those resources were effectively being isolated and it was still running games like nobody's business so what have we learned then on this journey well for one a virtualized dual head system with all of its shortcomings has some advantages operating our two virtual machines was about as transparent as running two completely independent systems whether via KVM switch or with two full sets of peripherals this is a use case for many course systems that we've been excited about for years now and one that has many applications beyond game streaming that is just gonna get better in time and second is that with superior codecs such as x265 on the horizon that are better optimized not only for image quality but for better thread and memory utilization that happens to mesh great with core I nines new cache design you'll be able to push the quality even higher with a setup like this all we need to do then is wait for twitch and mainstream broadcasting software to support it in the meantime though we've still built one of the coolest x264 streaming setups out there so thanks to everyone for their help with this and especially Intel for sponsoring this sick experiment and also you guys for watching it so if you guys dislike this video you can hit that button but if you liked it hit like yet subscribe maybe consider checking out where to buy the stuff we featured at the link in the video

[Music] yeah collector's edition graphics card scrolling text inch or whatever you guys get it so anyway the Dan cases a for SFX was a great if imperfect step in the direction of ultimate compact gaming it allowed a full-size GPU which is great but it forced you to compromise on CPU cooling meaning that our xeon e5 2699 v4 and last time around wasn't able to reach quite its full potential well stay tuned because with the a4 s FX v2 we were able to one-up every small form-factor PC we've ever built again speaking of one-upping today's video is brought to you by Mac Weldon one up your style with their smart design premium fabrics and simple shopping use offer code Texan get 20% off your next order at the link below [Music] okay so step one was to outfit our build with the fastest and sweetest gaming card on the market the Jedi Order Star Wars collector's edition Titan XP step two then was to actually trade some course from our zeal and last time around for the much higher clocks on an Intel Core i 979 ATX II this thing runs at up to 800 megahertz higher so we already know from our review that the kora 970 900 X outperforms the $26.99 v4 in many workloads so the 79 80 XC we're expecting that to totally smoked it there's one small problem though the area for the CPU cooler on this case is right here it is literally small and that CPU is a 165 watt part putting it at roughly 12 to 13% higher thermal output compared to our last ultimate compact build and if you guys recall the all copper dinah tron vapor chamber cooler that we used previously hid around 80 degrees under load so we're gonna get to the real solution in a minute here but first let's walk through the process we started by breaking out the dare bauer x 299 d living tool popping the IHS and applying some thermal grisly conduct a not we're gonna need every advantage we can get here so yes my friends you've been begging us to do it and here it is a liquid metal infused 79 80 XE but what to put on it ahh how about an NHL 12 this this looks pretty good right just put that on there and o temps are good too but that's outside the case and it's also nowhere even close to fitting and it can't be cut to fit so back to the drawing board well we had some success with our Dyna Tron cooler last time so how about we just grab the square ilm version of what is essentially the same cooler so you can just see it has a different screw layout and success sort of see while we were able to get reasonable temperatures with this thing we also had to use a knock to a 120 millimeter industrial fan in order to get them which wouldn't be so much of a problem if we didn't also need this 92 millimeter adapter to ensure proper airflow over the CPU heatsink and around the socket and that whole arrangement just won't fit and our low-profile fans didn't cut it so by this point we had completely exhausted our stock of compatible coolers before finally coming to a realization the a4 s FX v2 has a mount for a 92 millimeter radiator so that's why this video ended up delayed there are very few a iOS out there this size none of which we had on hand so after a trip to ASA Tech's website and another week of waiting our 545 LC arrived this thing is not much to look at honestly and we weren't really expecting it to perform much better than our Dyna Tron cooler did but when we fired it up for a dry run not bad after two and a half hours at stock voltage under full synthetic load our 18 core 79 80 XE had a maximum of 68 degrees Celsius on any one core d living man water drug on a 92 millimeter cooler anyway next order of business then is to get it all together and this is no small task the ass rock x2 990 ITX a/c and other board with its 64 gigs of g.skill ripjaws memory and coarser nvme SSDs and raid zero are easy enough as is the GPU but the cooler required us to remove the front USB 3 port the lower drive tray and the side panel clips at the front of the case in order to get it mounted properly and to make matters worse even with the 14 millimeter variant of the knot to a 9fen getting an SFX power supply in there is an absolute nightmare with some determination though and a healthy serving of elbow grease we got it all in so we just need one final check to make sure that everything is bolted in correctly and nothing's obstructed and our fan spins moment of truth time oh damn it did we leave the power supply switch off oh crap yep Hey all right moment of truth time [Music] I wonder what that is no I don't have time for this so this is not bad like it is not elegant to get the cooler in there at all and like you could even potentially damage stuff trying to cram all of that in there but the results we can't really criticize running a CPU and GPU synthetic load it's topping out at just over ninety degrees Celsius on the hottest core like that's hot but it's also not thermal throttling now let's look at some GPU specific tests so we've had the Unigine super position stress test running for almost ten minutes now I'm wearing my microphone here so you can hear it's actually pretty quiet and check this out we're seeing turbo speeds up around 1580 16 2016 13 mega Hertz not freaking bad and as for the rest of the benchmarks both synthetic and real-world this thing has absolutely chewed through them we are really seeing the hardware not just work but actually flex its muscle so in the end then the success that we saw here goes to show you just how much power you can pack into a tiny space like the a4 s FX v2 without making any compromises on performance I mean halfway through this project we flat out didn't expect it to work but we're really glad that it did this video is brought to you by the arctic freezer eSports one it's part of their freezer series with other products including the freezer eSports Edition with two fans and freezer eSports tr4 thread ripper it comes in four different color variations red white yellow and green and it's at

Apple prides itself on its courage the courage to do what no one else does the courage of our convictions to solder everything down courage to remove features pushing your willingness to pay more for less but sometimes sometimes they falter sometimes innovation rears its ugly head and today we have the iMac Pro the upgradable iMac the workstation iMac the Mac for legitimate creative professionals who saw that one coming [Music] today's video is brought to you by us check out the ltte merch store at the link in the video description we've got shirts mugs hat stickers and more so the base 8 core configuration of the iMac Pro is four thousand nine hundred and ninety nine US dollars let's take you for a tour then and break down what you get for that money and how that would compare to buying components off the shelf the most obvious feature of any AIO is the LCD spec wise there's really not much out there like it with LG's ultra fine 5k being the closest analogue with P three wide gamut color support 500 nits maximum brightness Thunderbolt 3 input and a $1,700 price tag moving under the hood the next most expensive component is an 8 core Intel Xeon w21 40 be a slightly down clocked version of the Xeon w21 45 that can be swapped out for up to a Xeon w21 95 18 core for very heavy workloads now with the Xeon comes ECC or error correcting memory and even our base model has a healthy 32 gigs of it interestingly unlike previous 5k IMAX the pro is using full-sized dims rather than sodium's theoretically great news for upgraders but alas Apple giveth and Apple taketh away to take full advantage of the Zeon's quad channel memory controller all four of the iMac pro slots are populated and there is no access hatch on the back a little bit more on that later one of the most underwhelming aspects of the base iMac Pro is probably the GPU of Vega 56 I mean it's not terrible but considering that previous Mac Pros used fire pros rather than consumer cards and the price point you might reasonably expect better and the same could be said for the upgrade options your GPU is soldered directly to the motherboard so the only way to max it out with the marginally faster Vega 64 is to pay up front AMD's full MSRP for a standalone card on top of what you already paid theoretically for a Vega 56 thanks cryptocurrency miners so bottom line with a comparable motherboard equivalent 10 gigabit networking a terabyte of very fast PCI Express storage a power supply a case cooling and some decent peripherals the Apple tax on this particular model even ignoring that computers do not assemble themselves and that ongoing software support and warranty coverage both have a value is a whopping negative $200 so why is it that Apple has this reputation for having overpriced computers we're gonna get to that first let's talk about the experience of using the iMac Pro it is essentially identical to that of our regular iMac the display is gorgeously retina and very bright but with fat bezels and no HDR support for reasons that likely have everything to do with supply chain and nothing to do with courage it D clutters your life with only a single cable needed for power as long as you don't need to plug anything into one of the conveniently located USB 3 or Thunderbolt 3 ports at the back and the included wireless peripherals are more than usable ranging from pretty darn good for a low-profile chiclet style at least it has a numpad 2 the built-in touch pad is really cool for gestures but how have they not fixed this charging port yet really similar except for one big difference the iMac pro uses workstation class and modern hardware something you can't take for granted so you'd probably think then that tools like Logic Pro and Final Cut Pro that have been tuned for years for outdated mainstream or mobile CPUs would run like billy-o on this thing and you'd be right this is the fastest Mac ever built in every respect you kind of have to feel it to believe how quick and responsive it is across the board Safari launches instantly even at 5k desktop animations never drop a frame and even Adobe Premiere as much of a dog as it can be launches every bit as quickly as the fastest test benches we've ever built oh and also 10 Gigabit Ethernet means that the iMac Pro is a real Mac that is finally able to work with large files and networked resources right out of the box something that is essential to our production workflow where we keep all of our footage on a redundant protected high-speed storage device on the network as for how well it performs elsewhere well it should come as no surprise that it tears through most of our professional tests with relative ease Cinebench scores landed about where they should lux mark spat out some very respectable numbers and blender ran very well except when it didn't we're kind of hoping that the performance issues with blenders cycles render are just growing pains that will be dealt with in short order with all those rosy results in mind though it should be noted that the Zeon W didn't quite match the performance of our similar C on W or our similarly priced desktop grade core I 9 and that even our base model CPU throttled under sustained loads with the imac pro's cooling system staying in audibly quiet rather than holding the cpu temperatures at a more comfortable 70 to 80 degrees we'd like to see Apple ramped up the fan more aggressively though with that said given the placement of the exhaust with air basically being blown back into the intake anyway it's kind of hard to tell how much it would help and what we also don't know at this time is how a higher spec CPU would affect any of this let's get back to that discussion about upgradability now Apple may officially void your warranty and getting inside the iMac Pro is a real chore but it appears as though the CPU RAM and proprietary SSDs there are two of them running in raid zero could all be swapped out for compatible replacements so this is something that we plan to explore in a follow up video bottom line then it feels like Apple is finally listening to its professional users there are a few things missing maybe kind of like the Soviets after the 1969 moon landing they've decided to just let Microsoft have it as the only one with a sexy AIO with a digitizer by leaving out support for the Apple pencil but they gave us 10 gig Ethernet and truly professional-grade performance and they did it in a form factor with a level of polish that nobody does quite like Apple so thermals aside I guess it's pretty magical and our major gripes that are really just the usual stuff about the restrictive Niseko system in general one without any obvious reason the iMac Pro doesn't support target display mode which would allow you to get more mileage out of it as a monitor once the internals become outdated - other than Thunderbolt 3 there is no way to add an expansion card in spite of the CPUs massive 48 PCIe lanes and three while on paper the specs and pricing actually look really attractive compared to an apples to apples DIY solution a big part of the reason for that is Apple's manner of choosing expensive options that not everyone would necessarily spring for if given the choice better performance per dollar can be achieved with some compromises in a DIY box now it's possible that when the true standalone workstations arrive perhaps later in 2018 that will see some more flexibility here nvidia gpus anyone they've got drivers but i wouldn't hold my breath speaking

like oh all right ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Wynn show we're technically here get this out of my face yeah but no I want it in my face put it in my not letting me remove it once you put it in my face you got to leave it there oh please for a little while let me savor it all right so we've got a great show for you guys today I think I actually have no idea at me neither it's been off to a pretty rough start to be perfectly honest I can't even check if I wanted to yeah Luke's got an update that's sitting at 23% thank you dual-core laptops yeah I am so glad that as of 8th gen you're gone forever did someone who someone raised your chair again doing it but from people like when people come on when show they need to just not dink around with anything or did they not that's it well why is it framed like this did someone mess with mine you know what forget it who cares ah your chair is too low chatter yo creator suspended after being arrested for child exploitation um yeah I know well like mine too now let's just I'm calling max I'm so I'm somebody reacts beautiful show the best show um okay no further details yet other than the other details that we have that will tell you about later AMD suggests that mining may be profitable on thread Ripper I don't even I don't even laughing cuz I like know that it isn't or that it is it's just like please miners buy our stuff to buy more of our stuff miners yeah he has so much money please all right Elon Musk released a flamethrower you know what's called the boring company yeah alright so we'll talk about that later I guess yeah and Apple sells fewer iPhones but profits rise wow this is some boring boring stuff I'm so interested in Apple making lots of money we'll find out other things to talk about I guess [Music] so I had you lower it max but I think what ultimately happened with someone adjusted my chair height because Luke said my head is bit about the same height because we're me that I'm not so we can't see it no I do not want an Apple box to sit on what are you Brandon no no bad new Brandon why just slouch a bit terrible welcome to the wine shop oh man still at 28% it's gonna go like the whole show I'm not even gonna have a laptop for the show today oh man you know what I would I would even say it's been that kind of week but it actually hasn't it's been an okay week I actually had an okay week yeah well you know no wait hold on a second I forgot about all the drama at the beginning of the week what with the whole yeah you know about game right I was a late comer okay cuz I night I had no idea I had no idea was happening while it was happening yeah and I was like just cruising through flow plane to make sure everything was going good and I saw like you were like what I'm this way this come Flynn no I saw like that thread and I was like I'm confused and then I watched like two minutes of it and was like I don't have time for this and I don't care and then I scrolled down and was like most the comments don't seem to care oh oh on our side on our side yes yeah and then I heard about the tweet and then I was like wow and then I moved on yeah it totally blew up um a lot of people have sort of asked me for comments but I hope I've said pretty much everything no no it's that's the schedule shot to know I've said pretty much everything I have to say in an unlisted livestream that you should have gotten for notifications about I was so mad like it's so mad okay I have a 15 megabit up connection at home I am I've watched that part down the hall from $1,000 access point which said those of you who've been watching a long time know that I used to have a lot of issues with Wi-Fi so eventually finally just like about three years ago I was like I am so done with this like what gives me more satisfaction in my daily life another graphics card for SLI no or Wi-Fi that works all the time I think I'm gonna do by the way I think I might do another wTF is going on with this live video really because I think it almost needs an update more that much it's like neither of them want to support it AMD's like No completely in videos like sort of - other than that no Nvidia likes people putting two graphics cards in their system honestly I think for them it's less even about the money and more about just like that a GPU is a status symbol yeah but the game developer support is basically non-existent and before the I don't know why we're talking about this I guess there's no good topics we might as well before the mentality from the the hardware guys seemed to be that they just show up to your development studio before your game came out would be like no you now support SLI and crossfire yeah and then now they just don't and because they're not there isn't support for you I don't know it's it's been a terrible experience like Assassin's Creed origins if you ran with SLI enabled the game would run it would just run way worse than it would have ran otherwise it's like completely not the experience that you should have I don't know its benefits but it's been rough for the multiple graphics card guys and the future doesn't look any better at all yeah so I don't remember where we how we got onto this topic you were talking about this the you preferring having like a sweet AP versus this weekend yeah so I decided that Wi-Fi was actually more important to me than a few frames per second so I got a baller access point so I was streaming through the YouTube app on a pixel to excel so I was as Google as I could possibly be and I sent out and that interesting part I managed to send out three notifications to people each time I went live which three each time no no one each told you three one for each time I went live and then the streams would just stop I got a I got a screen grab of actually you know like an unhappy face I can probably grab it but yeah like it would just give me this error and be like yup your stream is down wah-wah it doesn't seem to have uploaded so that's my thumbnail I know yeah it's just the day I wrote I couldn't I roll enough I actually tried to I roll more that was the most that was the most that I could physically roll my eyes but I just got this your stream has failed message and and it would just stop and then what I've discovered now is that you can't you have no way of undoing those notifications that are sitting in people's feeds so I was getting messages from people for the next couple days oh babe screenshot these for notifications on the road they'd be like wTF is this I'm just kind of sitting here going I'm sorry I can't reply to every single one of you I don't like it either trust me it's dumb but I can't do anything about it so I finally streamed on the iPhone 10 instead and it works perfectly that's like something like if you're if you're twitch streaming and say OBS crashes are you yeah pewter blue screens or something and you need to go Twitter stream again yeah it sends the email version of the notification to everyone I disabled the auto tweet one because of that on like most like ours doesn't do it mine doesn't do it most people that I hope it doesn't do it anymore yeah but it will still email everyone and people still get the phone notification right so it's pretty yeah it's pretty frustrating like it would be nice to have it you know be resumable or something like it yeah especially because the app itself didn't crash it was just like your stream is stopped and I understand I do understand that whether it's down to you know codecs requiring files to be closed out or whether it's down to any number of reasons that it's actually not like trivially simple I do get that but there has to be a better system than what we have now especially if you stream for like one minute and then you stream again like I would I would I would like for it to be a little bit smarter than that um so anyway I said pretty much everything I had to say there you guys can check that out if you want you probably have a notification if you're subscribed but in a nutshell people were mad because I confused attempt and a pad because the title said tampon okay in the thumbnail is holding a pad yeah we probably shouldn't move probably should we get into it because all we stand to do all we stand to gain is more articles on Mashable Daily Mail really and some yeah oh yeah like there are there are like articles about about this controversy that I'm kind of sitting here going okay like I guess I guess that's a thing that we need to write about today okay I'm just gonna no comment let's move on yep so I don't even want to cover this first topic either what's the first topic today the counter-strike thing oh yeah there's not really a lot to say well no it specifically says was not charged yeah a crime so I don't really want to cover it because we're just like throwing the student to the bus when he wasn't charged with a crime maybe if anything concrete comes out of it yeah I don't like the idea of just throwing his name into the bus when he's not arrested suspended bivalve yeah suspension they're probably waiting til the okay statement from valve suspended from the developer while the company investigates does not have a criminal history so in a nutshell we're not gonna name any names it doesn't look like anything's really happened here but one of the co-creators of Counter Strike has been arrested and suspended from valve and there's what's weird is that he's been arrested but not charged with a crime and the police didn't say if an actual child was harmed he has no criminal history and of course the local news station is speculating as to you know what this might mean but no one has actually indicated that they know exactly what's going on here so let's move into oh man why would AMD even bring this up so this article from PC games and calm what does this mean for AMD's reputation that's an interesting thing for me because so many gamers right now are really upset about lack of stock of parts about prices of things going up and the person or the group that everyone loves to hate is theoretically fighting against that at least in statement I don't know outside of that yeah but NVIDIA has stated at least I don't again I don't know outside of that they might be doing something I don't know if they are or not that they that they are trying or they want game works to still be able to buy graphics cards and stuff AMD I don't think I stated anything about graphics cards as far as I know I could be ignorant on that topic it's not like my laptop's working right now like several minutes yeah you bet it will but but is actively encouraging people to buy CPUs remaining so they're trying to potentially crush the other side of the market and right now with everyone being mad at like what is it Micro Center or something I don't know because they're like bundling GPUs with whole platforms but if you buy the whole platform you get the GPU at MSRP okay sure but like if you don't you get it at a cranked up price right yeah so it makes it tough for upgraders but that's but then upgraders are a huge part of the market because ya don't have to upgrade your CPU that often yep so anyway the what leads up what leads you know we should probably strawpoll this but what led us to this conversation is that AMD's technical marketing manager Damian trill it believes that there's massive potential for home mining rigs with their thread Ripper CPUs and there's a few details here let's go through the like stuff that was said first and then we'll get into all the problems with this because there are some so kryptonite can be mined with CPUs that have about 2 Meg's of level 3 cache per mining thread 3 cache is important for CPU money yeah so this rules out almost all ASIC mining machines that are so far in production but favours CPUs with high level 3 cache per core which thread Ripper is designed for ok so he also said CPUs could be acceptable for mining if they could handle very few threads very fast and that's exactly what thread repair is able to do Fredrick fir comes with up to 32 Meg's of level 3 cache and it can keep the data set in cache which speeds up crypto mining a lot blah blah blah so with 2 Meg's per thread a thread refer 1950 ax could run around 15 active mining threads not bad that would allow it to get in about the same ballpark as our X Vega and it will be much faster for example this is all quoting them much faster than a 1080 TI for example in kryptonite h2 Intel's a DDT chips have far less level three cache per core so he believes that a thread Ripper could be capable of accumulating around $90 a month through the nice hash mining program though of course let me just check my handy dandy how much has the market fallen yeah you know calculator here and it's dropped honestly this is not reflective of what happened yesterday so somewhere in the neighborhood of like 30 plus percent in the last couple of days so your mileage may vary now of course and also go back up I could go down 80% more I heard something happened last January as well so there could be a seasonally sure it's every January yeah there could be a seasonal element to this but or there might not be who knows maybe every other January was just a coincidence and maybe this one is - or maybe this is the end of times who knows the end of mining anyway so using his estimated earnings a thread ripper 1920 x would see a return beyond its own MSRP of around seven hundred and sixty dollars in just under nine months so oh yeah I'm not reading games you have to do it you do it is ambi trying to cash in on that cryptocurrency CA CH e okay so penny problem number one is the perception problem yeah do I think that's huge because you look at how many people were mad about the piece that we did on cryptocurrency mining what was it a week ago two weeks ago something like that did you check out mining adventure part two part three yeah part two you don't want the GPS I've seen all okay you've seen all of them so mining adventure part two cool rough we covered building a more optimized to GPU mining machine and that got 40,000 likes which is pretty good Wow but also 10,000 dislikes yeah cuz the gamers so just over a fifth of you guys were mad enough that on a piece of content that I thought was pretty good whether you like mining or not I thought it was interesting Jake did a lot of research on this one he ended up with a pretty cool rig pretty optimized configuration anyway people were so mad that we got a fifth of you like pressing the dislike button to show your dissatisfaction with us even covering the stuff and there's 8,000 comments on it 1000 I don't know who they should be mad at well okay I know at least one group that they should be mad at outside of that I don't know if they should or should not be mad at other groups yeah but gamers I understand the GPU market is terrible right now that's crazy I would not want to be building computer I wouldn't build a computer I tweeted out like way before the whole internet made articles about it and then some people were like oh they copied you it's like no they didn't but whatever I stole sure they figured it out independently yeah yeah it's a pretty common thought but buying consoles right now yeah is like actually if you just want a game a pretty decent it's like not a bad bet yeah and the crazy thing is you look at how quickly this happened oh because if you go back to mining adventure part 1 which it was fine backed by many accounts or by our by a lot of accounts is a worse video yeah because we we did not try to build something optimized we actually went at it from a completely unauthorized way it's amazing by the way was the boy it's amazing how many comments there are on that video about how poorly optimized the build is even though we said it right in the video the top was what exactly what we were doing it's amazing how many people try really really hard to not understand a video anyway so that had 50,000 likes and just 1600 dislikes that's about 97% and then this one's closer to 80 so the whole public perception was like this is okay and then this is suddenly not okay so that's gonna make sense from mid-november to mid-january two months and the perception changed that much around GPU mining well it went from like where I think is a good spot for it to be which is like Oh gamers you can like make some more money doing this yeah and like if you if you have a couple GPUs around or you want an excuse to play with hardware and buy some more graphics cards you can do this it went from that to like dawn good in a warehouse to remember and then people got really upset about that right okay the solution Linus coin did you see Jake's tweet no he's saying instead of float coin we should call it sync coin st. Croix sync sync is the market syncing and because of its same coin because you should sync your investment into it all of it we really really all of it yeah so so I think we've pretty much decided we have kind of talked about it a little bit to be clear when Luke initially brought it up total joke in Paul's video not even talked about at all pure troll you still don't want to call it pure troll let's know we don't have to okay okay um but we've talked about it we're gonna do a coin and we're gonna do it as part of mining adventure and the point that we're going to be trying to make is them and I really want you guys to listen really carefully just turn off the radio do kids don't listen to the radio anymore turn off the whatever else it whatever audio noise pollution you have around you off the twitch memes listen really carefully we are creating this video to demonstrate how a coin can be created for purely exploitative purposes because a lot of them are because a lot of them are we will be going through the procedure and showing you guys how it is done and we'll be listing like a lot of the different ways that it could be done and then we'll be picking a few yeah and we'll be going that route yeah well do you guys want so if you guys decide to mine it by all means - if you guys decide to buy some by all means do it but let me tell you guys right now our coin aside from if we can find some purpose for it where you can like use it for voting on weighing Shores voting on land show or like some kind of access to a special sub forum on the forum or whatever like we might come up with like a couple a couple LMG or floatplane related things you can do and those would largely be a part of the experiment of getting people to use it actually but expect it to crash because in the long term we do not have either the technical know-how or the inclination to follow this through and make it a technologically superior coin which is yeah it won't be we're just work someone else's thing dude do no special advancements to it yes and run forward yes so expect it to be that which is coming now I realize I talked for a really long time so if anyone tuned out here's the bottom line if you didn't listen till there everything I just said don't mind any and don't buy everybody got that yes okay that's good all right now it's time for our sponsors hold on one quick thing if I want to know CPU mining I believe I believe you FD Tech has done a video on like is it worth it I don't know if we're gonna go down that road actually haven't I wanted to talk about a few things to do with this okay after after these messages from our sponsors we're gonna talk about a few things from them no way what up oh these are cool it comes with swappable the kids ones oh ok nevermind I thought it was like just purple and for at all yeah so those those can come off easily and though they Bend easily and they won't break and all that alright so spectrum glasses my friends spectrum glasses are all about keeping that blue light out of your eyes staring at a monitor all day can be hard on your eyes over time and make it tougher to fall asleep so compared to a software solution chum gives you better filtering of blue light features include that they are stylish and you guys can check out their site they've actually got tons of different styles to choose from they're high quality they come with a one-year warranty and they have low color distortions so the idea is to block high-energy blue light while keeping colors as similar as possible to be very clear you're still gonna have to flip up your glasses if you wanted to do some like color accurate work but if you're reading text or working on spreadsheets or PowerPoint presentations or whatever the case may be you won't be sitting there working on it with your spectrum glasses and then like you know save it and walk away and then go to present it to someone you're like oh that's supposed to be red it's orange not gonna be a thing they're primarily focused on the Canadian and US markets but they are expanding to Europe oh that's cool and they offer international shipping check out at Spectrum glasses comm slash collections slash pro spec or click this link and use offer code Lynas to save 10% I'm going to copy that link into the twitch chat so you guys can go check them out and you can look almost as cool as me almost I'm wearing big headphones around my neck which makes me look super cool that was a thing drew I know why was that a thing why I know why because it beats by dre why were those a thing why are they still a thing actually I've heard the latest ones are pretty good I haven't actually tried them I suspect Apple might improve them oops there's this bit you know I don't know I think apples bar for audio is like good enough and clearly when they Bobby a brand it was already good enough was it well the solo twos are apparently pretty good oh I don't know tell Harrison's likes them the only ones I've tried were garbage but I've only tried like one or two pairs I only tried the OG ones yeah and they were awful yeah I did like the really old-school black and Red's right I remember I remember trying to talk one of my old colleagues at NCIX out of buying them like I I did my video on them and he was like yeah so like I want to buy them but it's a lot of money they're like $400 it's a lot of money are they any good and I'm like no and he's like well I mean they look really cool and I just like I thought maybe they'd be pretty good and I was like they're not and he's like well I was just like I mean maybe they're like good enough and I'm like they're not good and you need to change the batteries like every other day so they're not good there's a change that they weren't charged didn't work at all they didn't work at all without the batteries to triple A's okay yeah and he was like yeah you know I'm just gonna get them and I'm like why do I even that was the point where I realized that no matter what I say in these videos people are just gonna do whatever it is that they're gonna do like it's actually amazing how little influence that I have as an influencer yeah and on that subject Squarespace yeah if you're gonna build a website please listen use Squarespace okay it's really easy even I can do it you just pick one of the templates they've got

trial today enter when and how did you hear about us section Oh all right let's go back to why CPU mining doesn't make any sense so first of all um okay part of mining adventure should you do a like the other ways video and do like hard drive and CPU well hard drives coming okay yeah that's mining adventure side quest did you get GPU working it's not good I haven't yet I figured it out though you just need to use a different plotter yes yeah so yeah like I just told ya it's slightly more complicated than that yeah but yes I don't care anymore because I'm using a dual 22 core system and I am getting up to about 70 to 80 thousand nonces per minute on CPU so I have so I have my four instances running at a time because there seems to be some kind of limitation that's wrapping me at 60 percent of CPU usage so I've got four running at a time so while one of them is committing to the draw or while two of them are committing to drives the other two are running and then these ones will kick back in and then those ones will kind of run through creating nonces and then they'll be committing them to drives and these two will be running so overnight I was actually able to do over 10 terabytes on a single rig with CPU plotting so anyway to be clear I'm not running out and buying all the hard drives put away the pitchforks I'm just experimenting with birth coiling because it's this coin that you mind by just allocating empty hard drive space to it and it doesn't seem to so in further research and actually doing it a little bit myself yeah once it's plotted yeah it doesn't seem to hurt the drive okay at all plotting though yeah you're hitting the drivers rough yeah like really rough so from talking to guys in the burst community they're saying that it doesn't hurt it any more than normal use would yeah so I'm still not doing it on petabyte project yeah no because I just don't even want them spinning if they don't have to be yeah but on all these like janky drives that I had sitting in literally sitting in boxes around the warehouse why not might as well so before I go for the weekend I'm gonna load up as many drives as I can on that system run them through all weekend and then buy sort of next week I should actually have it all going so far I've made $5 nice yeah there you go do you how much more than that I've spent on electricity a lot I don't know exactly how much but a lot you can do dynamic plotting - are you gonna do that uh no I'm actually not familiar with dynamic dynamic plotting is you are able to use the drive Oh add more data to it the plot will make itself smaller no I probably gonna do that and you set an offset so that you have room to put stuff yeah you put the stuff there and then it will shrink itself we can discuss it in the video but that's like not really the approach I'm taking you saw the machine I'm using no I know I'm just saying for for people that have like it's already getting to the point where it's probably not that practical to try to mind with just like the drive in your computer depending on the pool you join so the the difficulty so okay I'll get into this in the video but the more capacity you have the easier it is to respond to a job in time in sort of very very simple terms and so different fools you know fill our machine basis or a per address ah that's a great question wonderful questions no idea okay anyway so different pools will have different thresholds for how quickly you need to be able to respond to a job in order to benefit from the pool yeah because if you're just someone with like 300 Meg's and you're like never never going to actually discover a coin because it's like each amount of capacity is kind of like buying more and more lottery tickets so if you just have like a tiny tiny amount you're basically just piggybacking off of the success of the big people in the pool so some pools have very strict requirements for how much capacity you have to have in order to be considered a contributing member and in order to allow you to join so what you can do is you could join one of those pools even if you have a hundred Meg's of data but you would just never qualify and your entries would reject it every time you would never benefit don't hit your drive from plotting and then never again and then never get anything and then there's much much looser pools that have really really long times but those ones are full of a bunch of losers that you know no one like are individually gonna find almost nothing so anyway right now it's that kind of like a weird stage where to get the most out of it you really do need a lot of drives like it's kind of transitioning that way interesting not surprised so back to CPUs so AMD has made a couple fundamental errors here number one is calculating ROI time ROI time is a flawed calculation because it is very easy to underestimate it or overestimate it you can't just look at how much it's bringing in today and go yes that is going to pay for itself in amount of time X because because saying it will pay for itself in amount of time X if nothing changes is just a sentence that doesn't matter yeah it will change it depends when and if you cash out it depends what currencies you're mining etc etc etc etc etc it depends on whether you will even still be able to mine that particular algorithm nine months down the CPU so yeah it depends on a lot of stuff problem number the second is that there's more to the cost of a thread Ripper CPU than the cost of the CPU itself so thread Ripper motherboards are like three hundred plus dollars normal mining motherboards are in the neighborhood of a hundred plus two around two hundred for something like a Seuss's B - fifty - and you're going pretty hard if you go to that yeah the other issue here is that you could kind of go oh okay well thread Ripper is only like you know fifty percent so double to fifty percent more than a regular motherboard but you can effectively make use of the CPU socket as another mining you know node or whatever you want to call it as another miner except the problem with that is that thread Ripper is limited to what is it seven PCIe devices or eight something like that yeah so you could never have a thread Ripper mining optimized board because you could never plug in enough GPUs to account for this difference in cost so while yes theoretically you could mine on thread Ripper you would not do that if you were actually trying to build an optimized dedicated mining machine you might not be though if you're picking a CPU for your home rig and you want to like mine overnight it would double your ROI time for one because you're not 24/7 mining but if you wanted like a beast machine CPU there's another problem yeah yeah I'm just not sold and I also wonder if that's power yeah power that's probably not any worse than like remember they're comparing it to a Vegas but but you're taking away from your ROI time yep because power is a cost so that will delay your ROI time which is a screwed up thing to measure anyways I think it's a little it's borderline nefarious in my opinion for a hardware company that isn't like selling a six because then who cares anyways to be like it'll pay for itself in nine months that's a little I'm not super stoked on that personally all right putting it's like hash rates up and stuff is fine maybe even if they do an article I'm like this is why you need l3 cache yeah CPU mic that makes it makes a lot of sense it's like a blog post cuz a lot of people don't understand l3 cache anyways yeah so if you're like look this is a practical application that needs a bunch of it that would be an interesting blog post alright some random YouTube channel or website or podcast or whatever picked that up and was like oh my goodness you can man with CPUs that's fine cuz that's someone else do we met so you bought this yeah is this even legal here okay technically 100% yes uh-huh it actually making it here imma give it like a 50% chance uh-huh my hope is that if they reject it I can just tell them to ship it somewhere else uh-huh then I'll just send it to my grandpa's or something and he can get rid of scorpions with 20,000 flamethrowers far 500 US dollars they sold them within a couple of days yeah thanks twitch subscribers cuz they took PayPal here's the caption here don't do this also I wanted to be clear that a flamethrower is a super terrible idea definitely don't buy one unless you like fun that's kind of lame I hadn't actually seen it fire yet that's really that's a really short yeah it's short burst okay which a lot of people were like oh that's because of laws and apparently basically nowhere has regulations on so one of the reasons why flamethrowers are not illegal in places yeah is because people use them as like weed destruction torches basically uh-huh and that's apparently really common in like a lot of farmland and stuff what you think oh that's gonna start a forest fire apparently no because they just like do it properly and stuff I don't know but yeah there's there's no regulations around it in Canada there is not a single beep about it in the Firearms Act it's it's apparently completely allowed I even looked up import and custom stuff and there's import and custom stuff about knives because I'm talking about which blades yes which blades and stuff and I was talking about how I like like pocket knives on my stream once - someone sent me one and it got grabbed by customs and customs was like we're keeping this forever screw you and I was like oh ok well nothing I can do about that so I looked it up and yeah there's all the stuff boat knives there's tons of stuff about guns there's ways to do it properly with both of them because stores can do it you just can't do it personally and you can let you have to set up as an entity to be able to import it and blah blah nothing for flamethrowers so my ready it's coming ATF says any flamethrower with a flame shorter than 10 feet 10 feet is a-okay our design is max fun for least danger I'd be more scared of a steak knife this guy is such a troll yeah like he's such a troll so I want to cook with it if I don't know what type of fuel it takes so I don't know if that's possible if it takes the right kind of fuel I want to like propane or something like a know I think propane we can't no you can with propane come from you can't with whatever tiki torches no no no but tiki torches are like an oil what fuels it ok I mean I'm not an expert but it but it looks like it could be a propane flame to me it's very blue I don't see any reason why that would not be a propane flame especially because that would make it really really cheap and really easy to to refuel sail drew criticism from a California politician who said he would introduce legislation aimed at banning the flamethrowers we don't allow people to walk in off the street and purchase military-grade tanks or armor-piercing ammunition I cannot even begin to imagine the problems a flamethrower would cause firefighters and officers with that said this is hardly a military grade tank or you need this to start a fire this is basically a blowtorch shaped like a guy yeah like okay it's a little longer but like if you can't go to the if you can't go to the hardware store I couldn't find something that'll make a fire easier than this then I don't know man like honestly that flame is gotta be that's only up maybe 18 inches maybe like you can get you can get blow torches that'll do not much shy of that and probably hotter if you can jog around an office with your thing fully firing and everything's fine yeah like you could like you saying military-grade whatever military if you can run around an office shooting with a gun it's not gonna be fine yeah okay I think it's hilarious so honestly now that I've seen it fire like I was disappointed I didn't order one now I don't even care it looks kind of lame oh you oh you figure maybe you can mod it maybe but it depends on the fuel like something like your propane I doubt it yeah I don't know if it is so maybe maybe people are spending the chat telling us what it is Canadian firearms laws so weird 22 snub nose pistol nope you might hurt yourself well technically a cannon you can get in the same classification as a rifle such a joke it's so bad most stuff is classified by name instead of by specification so there's a lot of things that like look scary that are banned and there's things that are way scarier that don't look super scary so they're not matched so weird apparently tiki torches use butane someone's backs me up that it looks like looks like perfect kind of tiki torches are we thinking then cuz I'm talking about those ones with like the wick and the like kind of wicker there I have no idea I thought they just used like like a wick soaked in a thing and they have like that lemon smell am i thinking of something else what is was a tiki torch yeah no that's not that's not like I thought this is like like a wax or like an oil look at the way it burns I could be wrong though tiki torch fuels like the things that we end up I don't think it's something something doesn't say where it is number one torch fuel pre fueled paradise in your backyard oh wow please just tell me what is in it thank you I wish you would just tell me what's in it oh man tiki torch fuel American sale calm with lemongrass oil oh my goodness okay well either way there's a lot of like it's scented with this or it has whatever else eucalyptus formula ah I'm dying the kerosene kerosene kerosene now did you know that we all keeps the bugs away yeah yeah but that's not there you go no there's different kinds this is why it's hard to find paraffin tiki green whatever this is but like that's like paraffins a wax type okay but yeah just something with a wick in it like it's totally different from from this yeah I don't know if anyone actually knows let's see I think you burned citronella I think that's the yeah that's the scent crap yeah why switched out his family in sintra nella I think that's what like makes it smell good or keeps the bugs away or something really the slow mo guys did a cool video using tiki torch what haven't they done a cool video about Oh finally Windows 10 defender is finally gonna block those shady free PC optimizer applications about time this is supposed to by tech dreamer on the forum and the original article is from cloud blogs Microsoft com protecting customers from being intimidated into making an unnecessary purchase how did this take so long I mean I'm not mad like it's just like a main thing that they should have been blocking oh there was something else that I was like really mad about yeah how does you know what his windows not have a built-in screen recorder at this point outside of games how is it that iOS has this and Windows doesn't like there's just some baffling stuff that they haven't built in theirs so okay have you heard I don't think it's in the dock but have you heard the rumors of the companies Microsoft is interested in buying no oh yeah it's propane I just go to their website 20 ounce propane there you go so yeah there's no way you're gonna get a propane propane flame much longer than that sorry let's change what fuel it is yeah I don't know and we're talking like okay to be clear I think there are going to be people putting new rags in them and they're gonna be people changing out the gas I don't care sure I'm not gonna do it but I think it's gonna I'm gonna go help my friend who lives on a farm clear blackberry bushes with it cuz that sounds fun right alright anyway that's what I'm what were you saying about the so this is like super rumor mill stuff and to be clear I'm pretty sure if anything I think it's like insider information I'm super rumor mill no no no I didn't hear this directly this is posted on some website sure okay and it was very much like they're interested in doing this not those other companies are also okay with it sure so and one of them I'm very sure is not okay with it but pub G Corp what yay what and valve which they technically have the war chest money to deal with but like I'm sure the last one is not okay exactly they're yeah they're not okay with it pub G Corp it sounds like they're micro their minecraft acquisition yeah hey this is already popular and everyone already bought it let's now buy it too we're not really sure but okay Kurt fans actually yeah part of the idea behind that sorry I just remembered was not letting it go to PlayStation because it's a timed Microsoft Xbox exclusive and I guess they're they might be trying to buy it before it can go to PlayStation and I heard that the idea of them acquiring EA is to get a whole bunch of expensive can I let me cut you off right there if Microsoft wanted a game studio why did they get rid of Microsoft Game Studios wears a mic need a mic well they're still making Microsoft is games because like whatever that new pirates game to see if thieves is like a Microsoft game yeah like not much they used to be an actual major developer yeah well I'm assuming maybe they want to get back into that I don't know okay so the EA acquisition idea is interesting because there's a lot of ways to hate that because more exclusives for Xbox and stuff but I mean everyone already hates EA pretty much at a maximum capacity already so yeah maybe they can't hate them even more I don't know maybe it's not that big of a deal I don't know um yeah I don't think any of that's gonna happen I just wanted to bring up Microsoft stuff um all right what else we got here is all boring Apple delays iOS features to focus on stability that seems like a good idea couldn't use speaking of built-in screen recording couldn't use it today without rebooting it would list it would just go and then you can stop it and then the clip would just be gone yeah we tried a few times it was broken for iOS 12 they've been working on a redesigned home screen app grid hopefully by redesign they mean exactly the same except I can move stuff where I'm on it multiplayer mode for augmented reality games ah augmented reality is so bad like it is so bad we're just we're not even close for so many years away he's okay it's bad max it's bad what can I help you with know we're streaming um uh a merger the third go somewhere I phones max do i nevah antonio you didn't have time after work okay improvements to face longest-standing video game record was thrown out after 35 years this was by Todd Rogers it was for his dragster record yeah obviously it was impossible because it's like physically impossible to happen in the game so are a lot of his like 1400 other video game records a lot of them are physically impossible including records that are like not actually able to be gotten in the game because like your score goes up in increments that his score isn't at like a lot of the games they'll be in increments of like 10 and his score will end in like a 5 it's like that's not how that works or he'll play Donkey Kong and like the next highest person is like 10 million points below him ya know it's super BS and Twin Galaxies records he has so many records and Twin Galaxies that make no sense at all and like and they're the official source for Guinness World Records and a lot of a lot a lot or all of his records were posted through one person who's now like in jail and like the tapes were seized by the police so he's like oh yeah all the tapes of my records are just gone because of that but then people have contacted the police they're like no we returned them all and there's like basically none so yeah Todd Rock Todd Rogers records super BS moving on now his personal website offered a simple explanation of how he achieved his unbeatable time while maintaining that Activision's certification of his time highlighted in one of the company's newsletters was enough to cement his place on the gaming leaderboards great that's makes sense there's even like if someone took apart a game I'd found that like one of the games that he played its electronically impossible for him to get the score that he got there's another game where a camera what it's called barnstorming or something like that you fly a plane and you have to fly through barns and you have to dodge other things they removed all the ops and so if when you go up and down to dodge obstacles you lose a little bit of horizontal speed so you're supposed to skim things right it's also move up and down as little as possible and go straight as you can but you have to move a little bit so they removed all the obstacles from the game and just flew in a straight line and didn't even make his time so they're like dude you're BS I don't know dudes a joke it's finally being recognized that's good because there's too many cheaters in the speedrunning community and the speedrunning community is great so stop there's also a lot of really legit awesome people in the speedrunning community so there you go that aren't Rogers so this is pretty great TiVo will let users auto skip the football to watch just the Super Bowl commercials original article from TechCrunch um in other news there's a new app that you can only use when you have five percent battery or less it's called die buck me an anonymous chat app that you can use on iOS or Android it cost 99 cents and there's usually about 30 people active in the chat at any given time that's hilarious um and YouTube will now be labeling state-funded news broadcasts now here's a question do they label CNN and Fox News all right I don't think there's but there are people who would argue on either side that they might as well be funded by the left of the right oh geez run away you're tuning into the wind show we've got a lot of great stuff up on floatplane I can't show it to you because I'm logged in as an administrator on the forums so I can't share my screen with you but there's some good stuff there you can share it here and just highlight the things cuz you don't open the threads anymore okay so LG wallpaper TV completes that's a good thumbnail Hey yeah it is I think we're finally getting a little bit better at them yeah designing our new gaming set oh I think this went up simultaneously but that's a good thumbnail - it is actually this big that was cool is that on dude yeah it's on you - no okay that was cool um can you build your own mechanical keyboard another good thumbnail yes what we're finally getting it I think you know it took a long time um is eight gigs of RAM enough in 2018 that's more than eight gigs minor details minor details police is not a tampon so isn't that like more than a hundred gig I don't know okay the fastest laptop we've ever seen eight cores in a laptop well this was cool Wow old desktop CPU okay it's actually an AM four processor in there with an AM socket yes that's cool yes hashtag on gate I can watch it there oh we did another episode of ultimate compact PC nice ooh with the Jedi one yeah that's cool Star Wars card some picture of some guy with like seven of each mining and I was like really same bat-time same bat-channel [Music] Viji 776 says this show sucked and that may be true but at least it wasn't reported it had slowed down uh no one listens to the stuff we talked about during the am surely ah someone will basic main stop streaming confirm stop dot title conferred stop dot dad hopefully that hopefully the top comment on YouTube is confirmed confirmed stop comment or something 
Every year we do one of these holiday PC buyers guides, and oh my god, have I ever aged a lot. That's okay That's not the point. The point today is whether you're buying a new gaming PC for yourself or for somebody on your nice list we've got suggested parts at three key price points under five hundred bucks around a thousand dollars and approximately two thousand dollars, so let's get to it. Zotac's ZBOX PCs are great for applications like productivity streaming and gaming They feature seventh gen Intel Core processors, and they're super small check them out at the link below So let's just dig right in with our budget-friendly Just game build where if it doesn't improve your frames per second, It doesn't make the cut. When we first saw current pricing we actually thought we were gonna be stuck with an Athlon X4 950 but using a six-year-old CPU architecture today felt wrong, so we crunched some numbers and miraculously managed to squeeze in a Ryzen 3 1200 with its stock cooler This did necessitate dropping down to an ASRock A320M-DG5 socket AM4 motherboard which doesn't support overclocking, But this is still a major performance improvement over any of the Athlon options. On the subject of performance improvements, We've got the same amount of RAM as last year, and for that matter, the same amount of RAM as our 2013 holiday buyer's guide due to the worldwide shortage of DRAM that's driving up pricing so eight gigs of whatever ddr4 2400 or higher from a reputable vendor is What you're gonna get and, while upgradability isn't a major consideration for this build, (that rear I/O on the motherboard is a prime example) We're going to use one stick instead of two to give us most of our performance today With the ability to throw another one in down the line for dual-channel For storage we've taken a page out of our 2015 guide and gone with a one terabyte Seagate FireCuda hybrid drive For a balance of capacity, price, and performance and for our case We've gone with a Thermaltake V2+ Which for the money gives us both a solid enough chassis and a power supply that while, super cheap and only capable of about 300 watts continuous, Probably won't instantly vaporize, thanks to its two-year warranty. Though you will absolutely want to replace it if you upgrade your CPU or your graphics card later on. Speaking of the graphics card, this year we're going with the MSI GeForce GTX 1050 ti 4 gig Truthfully, it's a step down from what we'd like to use if we had a bit more to spend but a budget's a budget. So overall then this year, we've got a much faster CPU for overall system performance and Less framerate variance in gaming, but we're actually taking a significant hit on our GPU performance Thanks to the renewed cryptocurrency mining craze That's driving up pricing, and we couldn't really fit in an SSD as a result of the worldwide NAND flash shortage Which sucks. But we did end up with a pretty well-balanced machine here that can handle eSports titles and console quality 1080p gaming. Our mid-range game now build creeps a little higher budget wise but picks up some significant upgrades including a Ryzen 5 1400 again paired with its stock Wraith stealth cooler. Not to be dissuaded by the hilariously cheesy stock photo on MSI's website, we then paired it with an MSI B350 PC mate motherboard It's technically branded as a business board see look he's wearing a suit but the quad Ram slots and VRM heatsinks for better upgradeability and Cooling should give us solid real-world benefits for gaming as well For RAM, We've got 16 gigs of dual-channel ddr4 2400 megahertz Ram making this build more of a platform upgrade than a Performance upgrade compared to last year's though It should be noted that these sticks run at just 1.2 volts Meaning that like the CPU itself you could overclock them a little if you choose Giving you a bit of a bump over last year's model. For storage, We contemplated going with a four terabyte 7200 rpm hard drive rather than take a 30 percent capacity hit due to SSD prices but ended up opting for a 525 gig Crucial MX300 for better overall system performance So hopefully if you're spending $1,000 on a system You can then Wait a month or two to save up for a hard drive or you've got an old one lying around that you can use for bulk storage. Our case this year is a Thermaltake versa H21 which, like last year's versa H25, offers toolless access and installation, top ventilation holes, and --unofficial-- Radiator support if you've got a dremel and a couple of hours on your hands For power we chose a fully modular EVGA 550 watt B3 which should be plenty for everything. We've listed so far and the GTX 1070 that we managed to stuff into this about $1000 budget. Now the 1070 isn't a step forward from last year, But it's not a step backwards either with its excellent 1080p or even 1440p performance. Once Vega 56 availability improves a little bit, that would also be a viable option at this price point for team red members. So then compared to last year we spent a few bucks more, But we get into a fresh platform that promises solid upgradeability down the road. Now you could choose instead a core i5 7500 with a B250 board which might even give you better overall performance But you'd be even further over budget And it is less likely that you'd be able to slot in a new CPU for a performance increase a year or two from now Let's get then to our high-end game on build. This sucker clocks in at roughly $2,000 and is designed with gaming performance in mind, but also as a capable workstation so it sports a core i7 7800x 6 core CPU running on an Asus TUF X299 Mark 2 motherboard. This means that unlike Last year's core i7 6800K build, we get to take advantage of both the updated cache setup and AVX-512 support that was introduced with Skylake X for a nice little productivity boost and the higher clock speeds are just gravy We've given it a 32 gig quad Channel kit of g.skill ddr4 3200 memory for optimal performance and as for cooling We really like the Noctua NH-U14S. It's a quiet solution that will allow some light overclocking while being easier on the wallet than a high performance AIO liquid cooler storage brings us to this year's first dual drive setup, a 525 gig crucial MX300 M.2 paired with a Seagate Barracuda 4 terabyte for bulk storage, and then all of this bolts into the corsair carbide clear 400C, a Cleanly laid out case with an acrylic windowed side panel that can optionally handle liquid cooling later on now although we were disappointed by its pricing compared to last year the GTX 1080 still ends up being the obvious choice at this price point and it will comfortably handle high refresh rate 1080p or 60fps 1440p gaming and we will power this beast with a SeaSonic 80 plus gold 750 watt semi modular power supply Easily more than enough for our needs though at $2,000 should be about more than just needs and overall this build was a bit of a disappointment for us we get a generational CPU performance boost over last year sure but we're not getting nearly the capacity of SSD that we did then and Frankly we were really hoping that by this time there would be a bonafide competitor to the GTX 1080 driving down not just its pricing, but also the flagship 1080 Ti I mean as it is, you could squeeze Nvidia's top-of-the-line into a high quality build for $2000, but you would need to make a few compromises and either wait for better Coffee Lake availability or settle for a quad-core So maybe next year, we'll get a $2,000 system that's worth upgrading to from our 2016 model like, can we, AMD and NVIDIA? If we're really good? I guess we'll see.

Let's begin with the good news I found my composite to four pole three and a half millimeter adapter that I need to plug my Super Nintendo Into my fancy OLED TV, Wish I had a framemeister But this will do. The bad news is five minutes before we started filming this, I tripped on this cable, knocked my SNES off the coffee table, and cracked it here and here and now it makes this noise (rattling) The good news is that whether you have working hardware or not, analogue is launching their super NT very very shortly, so it is a great time to be a retro gaming enthusiast if you're into this SNES, and We have the perfect tool to make your experience complete, this is Exactly what it sounds like, the SD to SNES, it takes this and adapts it to this [Very Loud Intro] Song: Lazlo Supernova [Very Loud Intro] Song: Lazlo Supernova ZOTAC's mech one PC is an ultra slim desktop Built for gaming featuring a sleek, robotic style design. Check it out now at the link below. So on first glance There's really not a lot to this guy, but as we dig beneath the surface, a lot of thought was given to the tech That's gone into it and Compatibility, so it should be a complete Well, near-complete One size fits all so on the subject of size and fit you can see it is shaped like a Super Famicom cartridge But it has the tabs for the North American region version so what that means is that it will fit universally in any SNES or Super Famicom without any modification whatsoever this SD card slot has near universal compatibility So they don't have support for exFAT yet But it supports up to SDXC and they've tested up to 200 gig cards in here So it should be pretty much format fat32 and go it can't take full advantage of the speed of those high-end SD cards mind you but roms loading at nine megabytes a second is pretty good and They claim that menu navigation is snappy on the high resolution 512 by 224 menu. Oh yeah, baby. It's got real time clock support it supports ROM sizes up to a hundred and twenty eight megabit though only 96 is implemented right now Uh, because nothing bigger than that has ever been produced and They claim it will operate totally seamlessly regardless of region so 60 Hertz and 50 Hertz and It's got a super CIC, or as I like to call it super sick I don't know if anyone actually calls it that but it's got a reverse engineered super CIC chip inside of it So you don't have to worry about any Anti-piracy you can run it on a non modded console from anywhere building out your SD card is pretty straightforward You just need to format it fat32 it supports up to sixteen thousand files per directory And you have to select compatible roms. It is enhancement chip compatible though. It should be noted that starfox I know you were gonna ask that Starfox is not supported not that enhancement chip. It's fired up Oh, does it work? I don't see the light on. Oh, that sucks. Hey lights on okay hold on Wow that looks terrible, thank you, thank you built-in scaler see if there's anything we can do about that All right well controller me So whether you're using an 8Bitdo wireless controller or an original one, you just navigate the menu like this and then what do I what should I go? What should I do? [Unintelligible Mumbling] Sure dad and I own Super Mario World I Don't know if I could legitimately say the same about everything we are scrolling through right now. Oh Wow that loaded really fast Okay You wanna play? -Sure You know what I'm gonna be a dick, and I'm gonna do level 2 first so that I can get the switch Palace That's right. Well. Okay? Oh Input lag [Anthony Snorts] Oh, there is yeah? That's fine, that's fine if I'm just gonna show off my skills that would be on this level anyway No, this is not good. Not good. Oh come on Enough of your bull crap Anthony Oh Gotcha, ah and I'm standing right on oh You like that timing oh no no hate that oh That's fine plenty of time for a comeback here. Yeah, get back get back get back over here get back over here. Oh oh S**t Oh Nooooo Okay, so that's pretty much the experience with original roms But we're heading into the MSU one enhanced folder where there are Actually a few games that we've gotten here like Legend of Zelda a link to the past see that that's a 15 Meg ROM that means CD audio Cool huh you know we treat unskippable cutscenes like their new, but they are actually not. so something that people should know before they buy something like this is that it comes with none of the feeling of actual ownership of owning original cartridges And none of the benefits of emulation because it's not Emulation you're just running the original ones and zeros that were on the original cartridges on the original hardware for basically the original experience Unless you are using modified roms like this Chrono Trigger one for example, but has this slick animated intro So that's pretty much it at $200 it's not cheap plus you provide your own SD card, but if you're an enthusiast let's say for example You've got a really large cartridge collection, and you hey you don't want to wear them out or B Don't want a hassle around with finding them and plugging them in and unplugging them This is the way to archive your entire library in one place and get the actual genuine original experience of the original software on the original hardware and don't let the, uh Early 2000s inkjet printed label fool you This is the real experience let us know actually in the comments, too If you guys would like to see more of this kind of like retro emulation-type content We haven't really touched on it much in the past speaking of the real experience Squarespace is the way to have the real experience building a website Easily quickly and beautifully you pick one of their gorgeous templates add your own text images or whatever navigation you want the whole thing is managed through the cloud and boom You've got a reliable website for just a few bucks a month Squarespace has tons of great features like their logo designer the ability to publish on your blog through Apple news format and the inclusion of an online store with every one of their websites So why wait go to squarespace.com/LTT (You Can't Click it here) We're gonna have that linked below and start building your website today So thanks for watching guys if you dislike this video you can hit that button But if you liked it hit like get subscribed or maybe consider checking out where to buy the stuff we featured at the link in The video description also linked down there is our merch store, which has cool shirts like this one and our community forum Which you should totally join. 
so this video from CES 2018 is brought to you by group Renault check out our video there symbiote Zelo car at the link in the video description Haji bow are you ready I'm ready for anything well I'm ready for anything that I've been programmed to be ready for it so as you can probably imagine team G bow was well let's just say they recognized our crew when we were walking by on the show floor here at CES and they actually had some pretty specific responses to some of the criticisms we had of their geebo home robot first of all Haji bow who's the President of the United States Donald Trump is the president of the United States so there you go Jibo knows what's up now and they've made a lot of improvements since then rolling out OTA updates about every two weeks now there's actually been one small hardware tweak as well the screen has been swapped out for a higher resolution one with rounded corners unfortunately it's not OLED this supply is just not there yet but hey it's a small improvement and we'll take it now let's talk about the software updates because there have been a ton tweaks to camera processing for better pictures what they're calling fresh and lively features to make Gebo a little more topical like a snow globe during the holidays geebo can now play music through iHeartRadio so at this time there's not a ton you can do in terms of voice controls and he still doesn't support services like Spotify but they are expecting to add more services and the ability to do things like TiVo play the next song in the near future the team has added a new commander mode that actually allows you to see through G Bo's eyes which lights up a purple LED revealing that G bow has full RGB lighting in his LED strip and in fact there is probably other hardware lying dormant under the hood and the GEVO team has in fact confirmed that for us another feature of commander mode is the ability to type a message and have G Bo say it - Texas is the best so you can be looking around you can go hey this room's pretty messy hey there's my son yo kid clean your room and giba will say it well in a in a nicer way geebo now uses information from Google in addition to the previous sources and can also do live sports tours even adding a little bit of color commentary to the mix like the Celtics are crushing the Knicks integration with Philips hue nest and Allrecipes is coming as is a find my phone function something that I'm sure that we can all relate to a big priority for the development team is personalized report so debo will see you and say something like hey Linus you got to get going oh by the way it's raining so you might want to grab an umbrella on your way out the door or if I were to give debo an instruction like when you see my wife can you ask her to pick up some groceries next time she's at the grocery store debo can pass along that instruction using his facial recognition now to be clear I still have a lot of doubts about Jibo and for that matter smart assistants in general for as long as they are stationary but it's clear that the geebo team is a taking feedback seriously and be continuing their software development work so I do look forward to seeing how it continues to change in the future and we will be able to do that because the winning bid for our sign G bow was an epic troll so we still have it thanks for checking out this video from CES 2018 this video was brought to you by group Rando you guys got to check out their symbioses demo car we've got a video linked in the description but they did a full demo allowing me to take it out on real French roads with real drivers around at a level for autonomous operating level so that means that I was sitting in that thing going okay I'm leaned way back there's a big screen here I cannot even see over the dashboard and this car is straight up driving itself telegraphing its moves around other vehicles as we change lanes and even being able to operate autonomously with the driver wearing a VR headset I was a driver I was wearing a VR headset and they had the sensors of the car actually dialed into the VR headset and the programming for it so that you could be driving in this like fantastical environment like I had like a flock of birds go by and I kind of went like this and it was an actual car totally crazy go check it out to see what group renault is doing in the space of autonomous car innovation so thanks for watching guys if you dislike this video you can hit that button but if you liked it hit like get subscribed and maybe consider checking out where to buy the stuff we featured because this is one of the few things we've covered at the show that you can actually buy today but whether or not you should is still up to you Haji Bo how'd I do sorry ouch 
okay so I'm wandering around the warehouse looking for something right yeah it was mounting brackets for these didn't find them not the point point is I found this a Rubbermaid bin in gray that's not what's important what's important is what's inside this is the original motherboard and graphics card from the mineral oil cooled PC out of there oil and oh my gosh absolutely this casting let's find out if they still work after I tell you about eks phoenix lineup of modular water cooling systems it's their next-generation modular AIO and you can check them out now at the link in the video description [Music] so the dealio here is that we actually refurbished this machine around the time of LTX last year with the intention of showing it off there so we pulled off some of the stickers that were kind of peeling off replace the motherboard replace the graphics card with something more modern so it's got a 1070 in there now and then never actually successfully repaired the tank we think it might be working now but the previous attempts we've made have just resulted in it cracking again almost immediately and to replace this they thought this attempt Flyknit that's disgusting to replace this thing would have cost like a thousand dollars from a customer critic shop so that stuff's all gonna stay there because ideally I really would like to fix it at some point but in the meantime I totally forgot about the motherboard and graphics card I want to know if they still work so let's grab some test bench hardware here hmm our options are 59 60 XR 59 30 K I guess that's the least valuable thing that we might wreck so let's grab that okay so my options are use my crap here test bench but then I have to put a power supply in it or use my better one but then I'm gonna get mineral oil on it I'm just lazy so I guess we're using this one stuff is just nasty and it like spreads everywhere it's basically like glitter except it doesn't even look sparkly and fun so there are a couple of things to contend with when it comes to mineral oil now the main thing is the like mineral oil all over the place but the big problem is that mineral oil has a nasty habit of degrading plastics and rubbers and really a lot of things that it comes in contact with so one of the things that's going to be a challenge here as you can see this memory slot just snapped off when we went to open it up and at least one of the pins is actually bent inside the slot there so what we're gonna try and do is lift that back up and see if we can get a stick working in there you know it's actually not in terrible shape all things considered I mean it's like furry because it's been sitting out in the warehouse during the renovation and it's been covered in mineral oil the theory the theory if you talk to the mineral oil enthusiasts they'll be like oh yeah you just leave it out drip dry for a few weeks no problem you want to touch it so let's just let's isolate our variables here let's try just the motherboard first then we'll try it with the graphics card that was soaked in oil oh I am excited right about now I mean if this thing works I don't like Max's PC is that what you were gonna say no you don't want the mineral oil cooled okay so the reason we want to try just the motherboard without this card first is because we've got to potentially like Jane cast components here so if it doesn't work we want to know that it's down to one of them so we want to make sure the motherboard works first so we can troubleshoot anything there then we'll try the graphics card because if we just put the graphics card and the motherboard on and it didn't boot up we wouldn't know what the actual issue was look I even went and got paper towel and why am I still waking this in my pants you know what screw it let's get this show on the road people paid good money to be here ow watch this video damn that hurt okay hey we got postcodes like that's a good sign check this out thirty-two four F seven nine look at this it's got like a big long hair a hundred groans hey look at that no problem let's see how much ram we've got detected here twelve cakes shoot that doesn't seem like an insurmountable problem okay oh wow this memory is like it's wet contrary to what people might think I don't actually want to go out of my way to destroy a hardware just kind of happens you know so one of them is just not making contact at all right now then there's another four here that are all just exposed they're no longer supported okay I'm not gonna put in that last stick this time but if we see 12 gigs this time odd sleeping all over the card not an esd-safe cleaning method but it's better than having mineral oil all over it throw the last stick in I want to see 16 gigs because it could still actually be something in the CPU socket that was damaged and then that would be another reason why we would have one of the dims not showing up in fact it might have been not that stick all this time I actually don't know got it mangled RAM slot repaired no idea how stable it'll be but that's the problem for another day damn I'm good sometimes some people get excited by know like know naked people this gets me excited look at this here we are on the desktop let's just run a quick stress test I guess Hoopa do okay so we didn't run the full 15 minutes or anything like that what are we sitting at eight minutes but at this point it did not immediately crack let's go ahead and shut this down then and find out if the graphics card works so looking at this you can see actually there's not a lot of external damage to it so these stickers all faded you can see the text will just wipe off so not bad so whether they intended to or not EVGA made a pretty much mineral oil proof graphics card so if I'm turned on by Hardware seeing it suffer like this is that like a weird thing if you're not comfortable having the door closed right now we can open it just this is Alex's drive not mine okay so the driver install was a little bit weird see if we can run us some 4k rise of the Tomb Raider BAM I don't even know if this card is capable at 780 this is even pre 780ti we did this build a long time ago wow I'm getting old I mean one thing I was concerned about was whether it would still stay adequately cool I mean it has the benefit of having one of the best graphics card coolers available I mean how many heat pipes does this thing have I don't think anyone has a lot invested whether I've got this right or not what you guys hear that you guys hear that short so that's not posting something I had forgotten about is this motherboard actually got three caps soldered back on to it once it came out of the oil they were just like loose so it's possible that there's been damage to the graphics card well oh it's dead damn you know I thought I thought we had a miraculous success story for you guys today well goodnight sweet prince end hello the sponsor of this video LG

thank you the group Renault for sponsoring this video at CES 2018 check out their symbiotes concept car in the description down below we're here at table pong they have these Atari pong tables for $2,800 they've got these chairs for 250 bucks it can display the time or the scoreboard on the table it has RGB lighting but who cares let's let's just play that's kind of all doing okay two-player mode then you have to tap an orange button so that you lock in your number here okay so I serve that's what I mean have you tried this already I have okay give me okay okay so three three three two one play against the AI press press one player does this work hold on what's in it so let's go man that's how it used to be let's see if you can beat me I'm gonna pretend I'm playing your control level is pretty you got to spin a lot it's realistic though who's gonna be some real if you're on the wrong side and you need to get over you have to go really fast [Music] oh I'm good computer play yeah yeah how you like that how you like that no wow that's right that's right baby no no so you kids today you want to play your your digital game maybe you have an advantage like analog games [Music] [Applause] [Music] what you know I'm taking it twice oh okay okay now let's not even against the thing tell you what why don't you play the game [Music] that's pretty close that was pretty close good job good job all right thanks for grouper known for sponsoring this video check of the symbiotes car in the concept in the description down below lioness rode in it in France with a laptop in the front seat yeah it's like seriously cool I was wearing a VR headset at one point in the sensors of the car we tied into the headset so that I would see like virtual representations of cars and objects around me as like flocks of birds going past while he's driving down the road because it's level 4 autonomous so it completely drives itself yeah it was one of the weirdest experiences of my life just like taking my hands off the wheel so guys if you want to see group rhinos vision of the future of autonomous driving you can check out that video on the link below rematch sure this is freaky this is very feisty $2,800 I think and then 250 bucks if you want the two chairs yes which you should probably give the two chairs because it's a little low and these are the perfect height for it anyways thanks for watching like it if you liked it dislike if you disliked it get subscribed to see no more CES content because this is it I'll see you later [Music] but [Music] [Music] whoa 
So spec wise they're not really saying a whole lot here because I don't really know how much they've changed about the cooler I've only seen this in footage from Nvidia's teaser So is it all cosmetic or are there actual changes to the design of the card? I love the case, this is the kind of thing where you feel like an idiot for for pulling it out, but the thing about collector's edition computer hardware is that unless it ends up being a very very iconic piece of hardware, like an original Mac. Um, I would say in terms of bang for the buck you're better off taking it out of the package and enjoying it, because it's not gonna go up in value for not breaking the seal. I'm actually kind of liking this I thought the the aged finish that they put on it looked kind of tacky in the video, but in person, that actually looks not half bad like they've got a pretty convincing effect on here. I'm not quite sure how they did this like it must be a... It must be a paint application, but it looks really good. What's this? Is this the thing that you're supposed to? Instructions not included, got penis stuck in the little port on the top. No, it doesn't, it doesn't, look like that's the thing you take off so the backplate. This is a funny thing they actually Printed the Star Wars logo as though it's going to stay in the case forever What a weird thing because the text is gonna be upside down when you install this in a case that is some That is some classic You know video card mistake stuff right there, so the cooler doesn't look fundamentally redesigned. They've got Oh, this is interesting. They've got this cover over the fan that looks like it would make it hard to install two of them side-by-side Not that I think too many people would order like a bunch of these and put them in a system but that heatsink looks pretty similar oh There's no DVI port on the back How interesting alright so let's go ahead and? Throw this on to our Zenith extreme testbench here oh Come on, I unpluggled the cord dang it Then we can have a look at the lighting effects Okay time to fire it up Yeah, did not think that one through with respect to the positioning of our power cable here Is looking not too shabby, so they've got LED lighting all around the fan They've got LED lighting under the grill here. Oh Look at the way, you can actually see the way they've wired it in so they've just got a little a little tiny like hard PCB LED strip going on there and then they've just got it wired up inside the heatsink So there it is Unigine super position running on the Titan XP collector's edition but wait There's more Ah yes so I don't have to speculate that the Galactic Empire one looks better I get to actually find out in person oh This I'm excited about I Mean as excited as I can be about Nvidia totally getting it wrong Jedi Order and Galactic Empire Are not I mean yeah, they're like good guys and bad guys, but they're like from different eras of the Star Wars universe What is the deal with that I Don't know what it is, and maybe it's just the fact that it like doesn't look so banged up gives it more sex appeal Maybe it's just that I actually like in most cases I hate the glossy black But man does that ever work here with the glossy black on the Titan X Glossy black around the fan you've got that I've always liked the dark nickel coating on the fins on the vapor chamber cooler like this card just looks so good it I had actually thought from the video that the heatsink designs were more different But this one this one just is better check this out This is a metal piece on the Galactic Empire one check this out check this out, so This is metal on here, and it's just like a plastic plug on the Jedi Order one alright, let's shut it down and Let's do the unthinkable Nvidia sli on a high-end AMD platform running Galactic Empire and Jedi Order graphics cards could anything be more wrong than this moment right now The answer is no oh It's beautiful It's like Christmas, it's like my Christmas Because cuz it's because it's black and green like Christmas Also, because it's exciting also. It's like mid-november so it's clearly Christmas if you go to a store updating LED firmware So this one does an LED have firmware? I mean I guess you need firmware if your LED looks like that alright fine fair enough ASUS, boop! Now let's get some SLI going here, I got a snap a picture of this for the Instagram I shoulda known this was gonna happen this. This is what you can expect When you put the light side in the dark side together. Okay, look at this It's like it's like a half the horizontal resolutions is broken Okay, let's Let's try this again. Why don't we try plugging the HDMI cable into? What is clearly the dominant card which apparently? Is the dark side? *linus hissing* All right, I don't have to stall for time anymore, it's done Maximize 3d performance all right, let's try again and *more hissing* Now that's the TV that's not the computer working That's a it's a TV screen saver what you gotta be kidding me Why. why is my life hard Okay, be clear I love my life But this is the kind of crap that I deal with this is supposed to be the simplest thing ever plug in two graphics cards And be like ah the Jedi Order and the Galactic Empire. They're working together I mean, I guess this is kind of funnier anyway This is not the last time you've seen these cards what I want actually is your guys's suggestions for what you want to see us do with them, so leave those in the comments and Maybe you will see your idea executed By being flung out of a window Mace Windu style 
whoa we're resurrecting tech showdown we were thinking we should call it something else but then we were talking about other names and one of them was in use by a law firm or something so tech showdown it is except for changing the format now it's two teams competing to build a themed PC okay that's exactly the same as before but now we've got four days so we're gonna build something totally kick-ass this season is brought to you by synergy and the theme is candy now in a stunning turn of events it was brought to my attention this morning that rather than each Luke and I being paired with a professional mater Luke and I will be squaring off against two professional modders so I wish us the best of luck building a candy-themed PC and a candy-themed full desk set up to look fricking awesome or at least be tasty failing that yeah and there's no real clear rule so go Tech showdown is brought to you by synergy 2 in partnership with g.skill be quiet and cable mod synergy 2 makes sharing your mouse and keyboard between multiple computers so simple that anyone can use it learn more at the link below so in fairness to you guys you should understand who you're building the system for we've got three celebrity judges our minor celebrity judges are gonna be Riley from NCIX tech tips and Steve from gamers Nexus and then our sort of headliner celebrity judge is actually iJustine so she's coming all the way up here and the three of them are going to contribute to who actually wins so keep that in mind you've got okay we take this board markers we got markers baby we got three markers we got all the markers oh yeah that's one big difference there's no barrier hey we don't need markers everyone everyone can see what everyone else is doing this is like tripping me out like I want to hide stuff but okay I think the first thing we have to deal with though is your your sponsor logo shirt hear that okay so you got to do one of two things yeah you got to start eating these to fill in or we could find some taste you look ridiculous I think these belong over there don't they oh yeah called dumb-dumb yeah these go over here you guys these are dum-dums there you go here you go smart guy you don't have those in America do you I think no thought they call these Rockets down there oh no our Smarties no wait our Rockets are your Smarties and you guys don't have our Smarties you have the lame like powdered candy Smarties so okay my grand idea that has si you are everything that is wrong with us staying organized you just put a not working marker back in the pile of working markers yeah it has to be okay so where this can go though is another level there's one where it like comes out of the top of the computer and it flows down and then there's like a little river but then how do you recycle that that's gonna be pretty pretty bonkers but one thing that I observed about these tables that were using already is that they could actually be configured that way but how do you get it back up okay um so here's the thing there's no fixed budget for Tech's showdown it's all within reason so I don't really see any reason you know that's not within reason why we couldn't obtain something to help us do that now here's how we take it to like a crazy level though this is I believe what a 180 watt CPU okay that would be awesome I mean what could unlock the power more than this I feel like that might be hard to communicate to judges we could have like an info like this is how it works card that's worked in the past yeah we could man oh okay having like four days to work on this in some ways is actually like okay okay yeah okay okay this is not attached so these are just like sawhorses so let's open our case first and then we'll worry about how to plan it's a big Tower basically blank canvas yeah it's a big Tower okay okay so here here we got add like I don't want them to know too much we need yeah okay buy a thing that would come with that but it would have to be continually which makes a little bit difficult yeah and how do we keep it from like dunking up we need to run for a little while okay so these like our designs that it won't matter but our extra stuff we will have to be pretty careful about sure but like the the river part I wouldn't actually worry about it too much but we just have to get it back that's the part that I'm really worried about cuz yeah you can like slant the table and stuff oh no we can't do that because that would make a terrible user experience I imagine that they're going to get really creative and do all kinds of crazy stuff and that might hurt them okay so khon kaen yeah it would be it'd be difficult right okay cotton candy that you can apply and it starts good like you know to keep it that clean fluffy yeah stick it yeah so the desk see the desk has but we have to do some paint work with the desk okay the Jess kind of remind me of like you know when they pulls halfy at the fair they're always on a big workbench and stuff and I was like and sometimes they've got those big machines that like stretch the taffy like automatically it's like how cool is it to build that if we have this big table what if we created a game like a Candyland again Candyland or candy land game works right board game where you have to move spaces and then we incorporate L like Lyle incentives or something or whatever on the table we could paint this white and then do you like some sort of a like um like a big game board or something maybe no problem okay can you help me okay priorities priorities let's get you not looking like a smack tool what's this it's does it sound down mission accomplished whoever word of the t-shirts may have ordered the wrong one for Luke Colton I mean it's alright yeah it looks not as bad but it's definitely still kind of bad because like look at this look at this and look just start eating candy then I tried but you think Colton try which is why we're here so this pretty much goes on this side what about like regardless of what else we think is that not sure yet where is this gonna sit like if this is a complete battle station you're too big objects are gonna be your case and your monitor so if your case sits on this side you know it blocks off so much then your monitor say sits on the front like do we do base amount like on the monitors the monitors on arms how do we keep it like super clean do we mount the chassis like yeah does it fit inside the sawhorse things or something like that I mean you want to be a showpiece you don't want to hide it but it's huge I mean it blocks up yeah do we really want to have it and then Ulsan you got the back here I mean you're gonna be looking at from this side put on the same I mean so then you monitor your battle stations here it doesn't have to be just like we could we could incorporate like ice cream I mean ice creams technically yeah right like what's our like for things we're doing right so like are we putting a gumball machine in this like that's a major you know cut grind there seems too easy though it's here yeah okay like how does a gumball machine and a reservoir work together like what if one dispenses gumballs and one dispenses Aurora fluid like it's a two loop system but it's not ones Andy and one's coolant so should we stay away from stay away from doing crazy paint because there's no paint booth here there's no yeah the only thing I'm thinking you got this white canvas on these sawhorses I think that is something that we should do so we could paint we could paint this whole tabletop white starting point - I like the I mean I like the maple but if it doesn't work in the theme then you know so these are standard regular key caps so we might even be able to buy a key cap set but get them in time if we can get them at like maybe NCIX or something or yeah or just Amazon Prime so it's just the caps of the keys that we can replace the black ones with some color synergy - is designed to be easier and more seamless to use than synergy one features include sharing from anywhere with automatic control of any other computer without reconfiguring SSL encryption to protect your keystrokes from attackers dynamic networking so it detects the best route based on your setup and being able to always run in the background on all your operating systems so you can set and forget and it even works across VPNs and tricky home networks if you get the pro version you can get access to other cool features too like clipboard sharing dragging and dropping files copy pasting lock screen synchronization and lots more okay so Bob and rod are starting to get a few good ideas but just because they don't have a solid ton yet doesn't mean they've been sitting on their hands they've already assembled their monitor and are well on their way to painting their case and now time for a little cable management this thing can go out you know all the way through holes route route everything down through it's like perfectly clean I'm really hungry wait this is their plan yeah distract dude this is their whole plan they know I like candy so they put all his candy here to keep me from working on the computer the whole plan no you guys are mean you don't think I can sit here with all this candy anything between anything water cooling it's probably coming from the supply here okay so we we have to go see what they have okay yeah which we could go we could go look at that yeah I know okay so the mouse I'm taking off the question mark there we can decide on colors later we may go together or you know what we may have to stay split up on all of this there's some pictures well yeah we'll just go we'll pick something really fun we definitely need to spend some time doing what they're already almost done doing which is taking this baby apart and figuring out but we need the overarching theme first I'm gonna be stressing for the next four days I don't think our mods gonna be on par because neither of us has the fabrication or the painting experience that those guys do like they do this all day what I was mostly counting on going into today was Luke having some kind of a kick-ass idea like Mad Max or whatever I mean he's behind me so this is a little awkward to say but like his idea was okay it wasn't like game breaker you know I'm having doubts about both well I think we should go back to the original time it's gonna Rev I hope at this point I hope that we at least turned in a computer I mean we'll have some yeah we'll have something oh my god what time is it it's - yeah should we build it no cuz we have to take this all apart - like we have to paint this they're obviously painting we can't not paint it maybe this is the gold foil and chocolate thing so gold all on the outside and then try to chocolate as much as you can on the inside so that it's a candy bar computer interesting okay and then we go with other candy for all the rest so we get those multicolored key caps and we go with other candy for the rest and we go with chocolate bar for the computer and then do we still do the brown desk no I don't think it's I think we could because there would be enough contrast of the outside of this being gold how gold can we go though without ruining like airflow and how good of a job can we do of that this is a super modular case this won't look at where they're at cuz I come worried about stuff like this yeah but how are we gonna put it back in tidally because what ever kind of oil we're using is not gonna be that strong we could do that we can do foil for some parts but I think a lot of its gonna be like this is definitely gonna be painted this would be okay okay okay okay so we go golden wrapper outside and then inside all Brown we could do cream and so we could do cream accents with a brown base we can mask off these fans and we can go like brown frames so we are we are we are brown and brown and cream I don't think this is an incredible idea but I think it's a doable idea and then we might be able to spend more time doing crazy things with the rest of the film it took us until 2 o'clock to even sort of have an idea it wasn't finalized by any stretch frankly our whole value add on this one is the idea because our execution isn't going to be better so yeah I'm really worried right now will Linus and Luke continue sucking next week don't wait to find out you can watch part 2 right now on floatplane follow the link in the description below 
So the folks at origin wanted to sponsor a video featuring their brand-new Genesis system. You can learn more about it at the link below But in a nutshell,  this latest version was just unveiled at CES and our config rocks an 18 core Extreme Edition Dual tempered glass side panels. Dual water-cooled GTX 1080 TIs and four radiators for cooling. Not bad for...$8881 Lordy! So a machine like this deserves nay! DEMANDS! A proportionally dank battle station to complement it. So with our middle school level woodworking skills We set out to build a custom desk for the Genesis. Let there be RGB light ♪ Intro music ♪ Now with this kind of power 4k gaming is well within our reach, but *inhale* plopping a 4k monitor on a table and calling it a battle station is not the LTT way So we decided to use one of the Dell S718 QL 4k laser projectors that we reviewed recently instead But opting for an ultra short throw projector as your display Will introduce some key constraints to a project like this First we realized we would need a really deep tabletop since not only with the projector itself be taking up a lot of key real estate but if we ended up too close to our screen we were concerned we'd feel less like A badass power user and more like a tennis spectator But finding a sufficiently deep and wide desk at a reasonable price, Isn't easy, or is it? This sliding door from our bedroom set is 34 inches (86cm) deep 7 feet (2.1m) wide and doesn't have any pesky door like features like a knob hole so we picked up another one of them for 20 bucks and Spent then another $20 on some semi-gloss black paint to complement our tower The second thing about using a projector like this is that the image ends up being quite a bit higher than you would typically want And we didn't want to have to lean Waaaay back in our chair Pewdiepie: BUT CAN YOU DO THIS? I DON'T THINK SO Linus: Just to see the browser search bar. The solution? a phone book on the chair! I mean realistically it's 2018. What else are you gonna use it for? Actually, I'm just kidding. By cutting a recess in the desk and then hanging a dropped shelf we were actually able to get the top of the projector flush with the desktop, which looks sick and gets the screen down as low as it can be. To create our mounting system We simply used some long bolts and a shelf from Ikea Which could actually easily be replaced by a regular piece of wood to save a buck since you'll never see it Constraint number three. Where are we gonna put the tower? Normally, we'd want to show off a box like this on top of the desk But even with a short throw projector and a super wide table we'd be risking cutting off the view of either the system tray or the start button and Letting the Genesis sit on the floor is totally out of the question so since our giant desk didn't have any legs at this point and Since any potential legs would have to be pretty beefy to be proportional We decided to build a custom cabinet for the tower That would double as a table leg so we went to Ikea and bought two alex cabinets for $80 a piece one that we fully assembled and endowed with upside-down feet to rest the tabletop on and another that we Completely butchered so that our towers good looks and hot air could shine and blow through Finally we added some black anodized aluminum trim to visually unify our ragtag Assortment of pieces not to mention to cover up the janky lines that came with freehand in the jigsaw Which I guess brings us perfectly to the bloopers. Let's just say that building this desk was a learning experience for James The first lesson was that you can tell if a door is hollow or not by how much it weighs and how cheap it is and if you find yourself accidentally in possession of a hollow door that you're expecting to hang a 33 pound projector from You can beef it up by ripping out the cardboard ballasts and inserting slabs of wood to basically act as like big reinforcing washers Lesson number two, use molding that says wide is the material you're trying to cover up. The walls of our Alex cabinets are three quarters of an inch thick But the trim we ended up with is only half an inch leaving a lot of exposed wood And nothing is more awkward than exposed wood Lesson number three, don't use too much glue unless you want to find your finished desk ruined by hardened gorilla glue bubbles that take the paint off when you cut them off Finally lesson number four, a projector really looks a lot better on a purpose-built projector screen so to do this over we'd Probably recommend that upgrade Especially if you were trying to recreate this setup with a less bright projector However, with all of that said, as a Proof-of-concept this turned out more than okay We put together a simple plan for how pretty much anyone can set up a giant, comfortable, custom desk for just a few hundred bucks and we have a Bad-ass new addition to our new set. Not to mention our selection of off-hours leisure activities Here at the office. So big thanks to Origin for sponsoring this video. Their Genesis system absolutely chews through anything we can throw at it at 4k and Looks great doing it the front i/o including ten gigabit USB 3.1 is discreetly hidden behind a sliding cover and the tempered glass side panels are easily swappable with tooless hinges and swanky magnetic clasp. Of course if you're into the all aluminum look Origin will paint or laser etch any logo or custom design your heart desires and Before we go we should probably also throw an honorable mention to Dell for providing the projector Ergo Direct for providing this awesome chair that works really well with a Nice tall screen and Nano Leaf for hooking us up with some brilliant decor So thanks for watching guys if you dislike this video you can hit that button But if you liked it hit like get subscribed or maybe consider checking out where to buy the stuff we featured at the links in the video description.

let's begin with the important stuff the V in Titan V isn't a Roman numeral there have actually been six Titans now making this one number seven instead it directly signifies the Volta architecture that this card is based on and to further drive home the point that it is not a gaming oriented card NVIDIA has decided to forego the GeForce GTX in the product name not that we won't game on it of course after I tell you guys about iFixit there protec toolkit gives you the tools you need to tackle any electronics repair challenge visit ifixit.com forward slash linus at the link below to learn more [Music] so to help manage overhead our test setup is a little different this time around we're gonna be testing our productivity and our gaming loads on our z 270 bench for its fast per thread performance while we'll be doing our scientific testing on our X 299 bench where those workloads are more likely to benefit from the extra CPU cores let's kick things off then with the boring sciency stuff I'm just kidding so Titan V manages a higher 97th percentile framerate in Deus Ex mankind divided then the second place Titan X pees in DirectX 11 mode then it continues the curb stomping in DirectX 12 Middle Earth shadow of war also sees a huge spike in performance over the Titan XP and while Assassin's Creed origins dials things back a little the Titan VIII still ends up on top so I don't even really need to say it but given these scores and our synthetic results Titan VIII is right now hands down the fastest card on the market for gaming and it isn't even supposed to be what sets this Titan apart is its FP 16 and FP 64 performance along with the inclusion of invidious new tensor cores which are special compute units that are optimized for deep learning and AI oh and while we're at it Nvidia is also showing off HBM to memory for the first time in a Titan so V does end up with a smaller frame buffer than the Vega workstation cards or the HBM 2 equipped Quadro GP 100 but it may end up making up for that through sheer brute force its whopping 5120 cuda cores should make it the fastest part available for compute should but when we first took the shrink-wrap off and loaded up some compute benchmarks we actually found that many cuda focused tasks simply wouldn't run well it turns out that while previous gen raishin cards were built around CUDA compatibility version 6.1 and earlier Volta and by extension the Titan V bumps this up to 7.0 and new compute kernels need to be compiled to support it so blender most coin mining algorithms and other tests were affected with users reporting even more incompatibilities that we didn't see oh I'm getting flashbacks to the Vega frontier edition thankfully the open CL layer still works though so we can get rough numbers for benchmarks that support Nvidia cards in open CL mode with the caveat that open CL does have some overhead compared to CUDA starting off with Lux mark we've got Wow are these numbers even right Lux mark is super parallelized so those extra CUDA cores pulled double the performance of the Titan XP and far higher than even the Quadro GP 100 Chaos groups render sweet v-ray brings us another win for the Titan v shaving a cool three seconds off the GP 100 in second place moving on to compu bench we see the gap close for the level set segmentation benchmarks but then the Titan V pulls way out ahead in the computer vision optical flow benchmark leaving everything else well in the dust and it continues to assert its dominance in most of spec view Perth where 3ds max CATIA maya energy and showcase all have it at the top but it should be noted that the quad rose do fire back in some of the other tests thanks to their enhanced driver code paths as for coin mining well the rumors are true it is a beast especially an eighth hash but with that said the $3,000 price tag is going to kill your ROI time and it doesn't even win in every scenario Vega frontier handily outperforms it in Kryptonite whoa that's a lot of testing and it looks like Volta is mostly living up to its promises so far but we've got one more test up our sleeves for its compute performance deep learning using imagenet 12 on caf2 Titan V managed a significant lead at both tested batch size thanks to its tensor course but maybe even more interestingly it even wins without them enabled against the GP 100 a truly monstrous feat because for context you guys that card is still almost triple the price well ok then line is fine Volta is great for compute big whoop what does that mean for me okay I'll get to that first we need to talk about thermals and power because this bit is really important while Titan V manages to throttle a bit harder than the GP 100 and the GTX 10 atti in our testing and while it has the second highest idle power draw in our entire test lineup thanks at least partially to Nvidia using TSM C's 12 nanometer manufacturing process it's also got the lowest full load power draw which is bonkers considering everything we know about its overall performance so then back to your question what this means for you is that the slightly cut down and maybe higher clocked enthusiasts consumer variants without any tensor course are going to be mind-bogglingly fast but that's a conversation for another day here and now what we have is a quadrille killer at a third of the price for most workloads and one that can game faster than anything that's ever come before it though I'm not saying you should go out and buy one if raw horsepower for compute is your jam and you won't benefit from a bigger frame buffer or multi GPU with envy link these connectors they're dead you're looking at your next card right here though you'll need to roll your own CUDA kernels or wait until compatibility level seven is mainstream by which time there will probably be a Quadro variant as for the gamers well the lack of g-force and the branding says it all is just not worth it even for you mr. worm is meghamala over there I mean do you really want something that's not even SLI compatible anyway so you have to run a single card in your system like some kind of a peasant so think of the V not as something to buy but as more of a teaser for what may come in 2018 I know that I'm feeling sufficiently teased right about now speaking of teasing fresh books they don't tease they

all right so you've watched mining adventures part 1 2 &amp; 3 you've got your dank mining rig and an ASIC or 2 and you are well on your way to becoming crypto rich but how do you keep those sweet bitcoins and alt coins safe and for that matter if you're not necessarily into buying a bunch of hardware how do you just speculate on the coins buying and selling them let's find out but first let's tell you guys about ek water blocks ek SMLC Phoenix lineup is designed around quick disconnect couplings and brings a modular approach to connecting and expanding your loop learn more at the link below [Music] so if you've already been mining you're likely withdrawing your rewards to an exchange be it G Dax crackin finance or any of the other few hundred exchanges out there or you might be using a wallet on your PC now most casuals will probably stick with the former because being able to sell without moving your funds from your local wallet to an exchange can actually save both time and money in transfer fees however there are some serious drawbacks to this approach first and most importantly you are not in control of your private keys what's the private key ah I thought you'd never ask ok so I'm gonna use Bitcoin as an example in layman's terms a Bitcoin address that string of numbers and letters is kind of like a see-through donation container at the local McDonald's there's a slot in the top so anyone can see how much is in it and anyone who knows the address can put money in but if somebody wanted to get money out like to transfer funds to a friend or to buy something they would need the private key to open up the box signing the transaction now there are a couple of exceptions to this for example Manero makes use of ring signatures to hide balances and transaction amounts but most crypto currencies are fundamentally similar in this way so then when your funds are in a wallet on your PC the private keys are owned and can be encrypted by you so if there is a fork a duplication of the existing blockchain with whatever new and different features that the duplicator may desire you can export your private keys and then import them into the Forks wallet to get access to the duplicated funds if your funds are on an exchange however support for Forks is completely up to them because they're in control of the private keys so let's look at Bitcoin gold as an example of why this matters many exchanges chose to not support this fork outright so many people missed out on what was essentially free Bitcoin gold because they were not holding their own private keys at the time of the fork huh now either of those approaches though even with those drawbacks is probably fine for casual miners who aren't holding more than a couple hundred dollars worth that is as long as they can afford to lose what they have more on this later for larger scale miners and investors though something called a cold wallet is basically an essential tool now to be cold a wallet cannot have an active network connection this makes it nearly impossible to hack now some people will just use a network gapped computer so it's unplugged with no Wi-Fi with normal software wallets and then a system of either webcams and QR codes or thumb drives to complete their transactions but this method can be kind of a hassle so many people with large crypto holdings are using what's called a hardware wallet these come in the form of little devices with physical security prompts like the ledger NAT OS or treasurer once this device is plugged into a PC you enter a PIN code open up a companion app and then you go about your business now it should be noted that even the methods that we just outlined do carry some risk but if you think about it so does putting money in a bank so you know your your PC's Drive could die you could lose your hardware wallet or in both cases you could forget your password but as long as you backup your wallet and you keep your backup codes somewhere safe a safety deposit box in a bank is a pretty good bet you should be ok alright then so now that your Kryptos are safe let's talk about buying and selling though I really need to preface this with a quick warning we are not endorsing any of the exchanges that I'm about to mention and I personally would know I recommend buying cryptocurrency unless you know what you're doing and you are comfortable losing literally all of the money you spent like literally like this gone all right there is a very public history of exchanges disappearing overnight or being hacked and losing anywhere from a lot to all of their users money so be safe with that out of the way there are a ton of exchanges out there let's look at one of the most mainstream ones coinbase it's fairly limited in features but should work pretty well for casual buyers the process is pretty simple just hook up your bank account debit card or PayPal account and you are free to buy and sell cryptocurrency up to your limit and you can raise your limits by doing additional verification with the exchange but this simplicity comes at the cost of pretty high fees nearly 4% for debit and credit transactions and I should also point out that coin base has a history of freezing trading during high traffic times so take that as you will some of the more Pro oriented exchanges will charge a small fixed fee of a few dollars for bank transfers in and out and then cryptocurrency transfer fees are typically dependent on that currencies specific network fees so Bitcoin will likely have a fee of a few dollars while something like Zee cash will have almost no fee at all these exchanges like finance G Dax bit recs Polonia X crypto Pia and BitFenix also have crypto - crypto trading pairs so you can actually take your Bitcoin and then turn that into litecoin without having to first go to a fiat currency this helps you save some fees and is pretty snazzy now if you're not super concerned with getting the best possible rate a market trade can be a pretty easy way to go you just pick how much you want to buy or sell and then the trade will transact at the current market rate just remember that especially for a very large amounts that rate can actually change literally as your transactions are going through so you might end up paying more or getting less than you initially expected now limit trades these allow you to set the price point that you want your trade to execute at meaning that you may actually be able to get a slightly better rate or if things go the other way you might end up with nothing going through at all some exchanges allow what's called margin trading in this situation you can auto magically borrow money from the exchange to leverage your bet based on a multiplier so let's say you wanted to margin trade a thousand dollars with a leverage of two to one you would essentially be trading a thousand dollars plus another thousand dollars borrowed from the exchange and then you would be charged interest on it in most cases and the benefit is that you could double your profit or the drawback is that you could still lose all that money and still need to pay the stuff that you borrowed back so unless you're a seasoned gather excuse me trader we would recommend staying away from margin trading in conclusion trading can be a fun way to play around with some disposable income but again I think I've said this before but I would caution against using any money that could seriously negatively impact your life if you were to lose it so be safe and probably don't buy any [Music] [Applause] so yeah I fix it then you know those guys really like to take stuff apart and teach people how to fix things they are leading the charge in the electronics repair tools industry with their iconic black and blue Pro tech toolkit and it's only 60 bucks it's got tons of great features the tool roll that makes it compact and easy to store there's 64 bit driver kit their wide variety of plastic opening tools sputters and picks not to mention suction cups with the new fancy handle to help remove display assemblies they've got all kinds of stuff the Jimmy pry tool the ESD safe tweezers and all iFixit tools are backed by I fix its lifetime warranty so why pay someone often more than $60 to fix something for you when you can make a one-time investment in a fully loaded Pro Tech tool kit over at I fix it comm slash Linus and fix your stuff forever so thanks for watching guys if this video sucked you know what to do but if it's awesome get subscribe hit that like button or check out the link to where to buy the stuff we featured in the video description except don't buy the stuff we featured unless you can afford to lose that money yeah also linked in the description is our merch store which has cool shirts like this one and our community forum which you should totally join I think and iFixit kits probably a better investment than cryptocurrency all you have to do is like a few device repairs for people and you'll get that investment right back several times over where'd that money go 
this may be the most expensive keyboard we've ever tested individually addressable RGB keys no Cherry MX switches with custom key caps no Thunderbolt 3 pass-through with triple OLED displays no it no it's got none of those things it's the completely wooden handcrafted in Japan keyboard from Tekoa priced at nearly 1400 US dollars but is it at all worth it or does it get chopped by this $40.00 Chinese keyboard that we bought on Amazon speaking of things that are worth it by the way Tunnel Bear tunnel bear thinks the Internet is better when everyone can openly access the same content so try total bear for free over at tunnel bear comm /l TT [Music] available in either maple or walnut from responsibly managed forests we're gonna start with a look at the illustrious Kokua keyboard key meaning both wood and tree in Japanese see what they did there simply put it's a work of art the 89 gently concave key caps are cut from a single panel of wood with their relative position preserved such that the natural wood grain pattern is visible on the finished board the keys contrast subtly with the chassis which is one solid piece even on the back where they cared enough to carve a recessed bevel so that the board is easy to pick up off the desk turning now to the poop end of the stick we've got the $40.00 cooler tron other than the fact that this board is indeed made of wood its appearance is not that similar to the a koa key ok hand-carved sustainable bamboo sure I guess but there's no cohesive color scheme and the keys chassis pieces and the media keys have no consistency in the direction of the wood grain then making matters worse at the top of the board the wood motif is disrupted by an obnoxious cooler Tron sticker and a nearly useless power indicator LED that I would gladly trade in for caps and/or num lock lights something her koa managed to include and in a way that actually enhances the look of the board let's go back to the Hikawa and look a little closer the laser etched letters on the tree board have amazingly sharp corners like they're they're perfect to the eye the tactile guides are both elegant and functional and the key caps are aligned in perfectly straight rows one of the weakest points of the cheaper boards looks on top of that poor key stabilization makes the spacing between letters uneven assaulting your eyes and that impression has only made worse upon closer inspection excusing even the corrugated look of the bamboo wood grain the keycaps legend is etched with a degree of precision that I could charitably described as serviceable except for this Internet Explorer looking key that won't servicing me at all when it comes to general build quality from a more keyboard e standpoint honestly neither of them is the best we've seen I mean look at that flex akoha though at least to their credit all the key caps are aligned and sit at the same height by comparison check out cooler Tron's ragged afro and low rider style question mark while we're at it the edges are pretty rough the f9 key is randomly darker and the key guides subjectively mind you are a little too subtle to be really useful now some have complained that the legend on this one can be difficult to see particularly in the dark but cooler Tron claims that the symbols become easier to read after 2 weeks of use presumably thanks to finger crud filling up the grooves mmm yummy so for build quality and style points I'm giving it to her color it even feels and smells way more woody than the cooler Tron which might sound inconsequential but it's actually kind of the whole point here boy alright then what about the practical aspects of this showdown the bamboo board believe it or not is actually surprisingly decent to type on since it's one of those men Kanaka boards meaning that the switches are membrane but a small lip on the key cap gives the stroke a more tactile feel it's not as loud as a set of Cherry MX blues but it is louder than your typical membrane board it's got a bit of a weird layout since it's a full 104 keyboard with a numpad but then with compact navigation keys but I might even go as far as to say that I like typing on it at least I would if it weren't for that astonishingly heavy spacebar but this stupid thing takes the force of Thor's hammer to press down it's shorter than normal and it's its left-of-center leading some typists to accidentally hit the Alt key instead alright then but what about typing on a keyboard that is 35 times the price well to put it plainly this membrane is mush city people who aren't accustomed to mechanical boards might not notice but those who are and who might be considering the Jaco Ikki are barking up the wrong tree so to speak and this one's got a weird layout too it's like Japanese but with an English legend which is great if you're Japanese and you want to type in English but if you're used to a North American keyboard like I am you will be annoyed by the shortened ENTER and backspace keys you will have no use at all for the keys that Japanese speakers use to switch between their various alphabets and you probably won't be a fan of the even stumpy ur spacebar though it should be noted that this one was actually easier to use because at least it's centered so which one's better well truthfully in spite of the awful spacebar the bamboo Letran is probably the better type er so while you can get a real mechanical keyboard at this price point the novelty makes it may be a decent buy especially since unlike the Jaco icky it's wireless then again we couldn't even slide the little door shut and without it breaking as for the keyboard I believe them when they say that each individual unit is made by a Japanese master craftsman in a labor-intensive process at a rate of just one per day unfortunately that craftsman didn't spend any of that time on things that keyboard enthusiasts actually care about to be clear no one here hated it I'm just a little disappointed that someone could spend so much time making such a beautiful object then charge a sizable chunk of cash for it without even doing the requisite market research to realize that for 1386 dollars we expect a braided cable so then which one would I rather have in my home office honestly neither of them they're both kind of novelty items though at least one of them is priced accordingly I can't believe that we paid for this thing I feel like a total SAP often but what's not awful is ting the mobile carrier that's focused on customer service and customer satisfaction first when you call ting you do not speak to a robot you get put through directly to a person and you don't have to pay extra for that kind of service you pay only for the airtime that you use with the average ting bill only 23 bucks a month per device and if you're stuck in a contract and switch to ting they'll even cover 25% of your cancellation fee up to 75 bucks they've got new lower mobile data rates data is now just $10 a gig beyond the first gig and every single ting customer will be able to reap the benefits of this new change so head over to Linus ENCOM

In a world of plain black boxes with no RGB, one man Risks it all to show five of the most insane cases that money can buy and It's brought to you by Ifixit. Ifixit protec toolkit gives you the tools you need to tackle any Electronics repair challenge visit ifixit.com/linus at the link below to get yours today Okay, don't get me wrong. I'm a huge fan of the understated Monochrome aesthetic with maybe a sprinkle of color here or there, but today today is about the outliers the biggest the boldest and Arguably, subjectively, the beautifulest monstrosities that you can actually Buy for your next PC build so no one offs Let's kick things off with the deep cool. Oh Tristellar to make something truly unique you basically need to step out of the Standard form factor. I mean all boxes look somewhat alike do they not? So deep cool Amongst others here today took that challenge very seriously as the name implies the TriStellar has three isolated chambers arranged in sort of an Arrowhead style with a metal hub in the middle that serves to route cables between the compartments The exterior panels have a rough kind of like Gunmetal finish that gives them a very industrial look and feel and they just slide off whenever you need to perform maintenance So each chamber holds something different.. So starting at the top. You've got mounting for your GPU via a PCI Express Extension and up to three SSDs with some sexy tempered glass to show them all off Then the left chamber holds your power supply An optional two hard drives and a five and a quarter inch bay if you still live in 2005 Finally the last compartment contains an ITX motherboard with either a low-profile CPU cooler or a single 120 millimeter liquid cooler Thanks to this fan mount Now each of the wings comes with a 90 millimeter fan in the front and is designed to act like a mini wind tunnel so I would probably stick with a blower style GPU cooler in this case that is if you can afford one.. It is 350 bucks.. Now for our next trick the ThermalTake tower 900 may actually not feature an overly unique form factor, but it's still more than earns it's insane designation Thanks to the sheer magnitude of both its capacity and size which are sort of the same thing this thing is so big That my wife can literally fit inside of it with the motherboard tray removed I couldn't make this stuff up Anyway, the white version that we have here in the office has a powder-coated steel exterior and more tempered glass then you have probably ever seen on a single case at least for now and This robust construction lends to its over 50 pound Dry weight, I mean you seriously need two people to move this thing around once. It's full of hardware lots and lots of hardware the Tower 900 can hold 2 quad 140 millimeter extra thick radiators like what We've got here and even has adequate room for fans on both sides of it if you're a total airflow nut. The motherboard tray fits up to an e ATX board and quad GPUs although that last ones not really a thing anymore at least for gamers and surprisingly the 900 actually costs barely more than it weighs at 220 dollars Following in the "size matters footsteps" of our last case is the also by Thermaltake core P7 now in its default form here, you can see, it just looks like one of those fancy   showcase cases that's just kind of like a Slab of metal that you put a bunch of stuff on and then a tempered glass cover in front for effect but No my friends this case has much more to offer it can be upright like a test bench it can be on the wall or in its final form which we're calling panoramic mode you just install these extra included panels and The case turns into this crazy open Concept setup thing that you can You can choose for different angles for depending on what you like to change the look of your case and your build I mean customization is king right? The p7 also has a ton of radiator mounting with space for 3 quad 120 millimeter radiators in Panoramic mode here, and you can even vertically mount your GPUs. Yes, that is GPUs Plural, but if water cooling or our fancy GPU mounting isn't really your thing the case also has plenty to offer for normal people with space for up to eight hard drives or SSDs and Of course like the tower 900 full ATX board compatibility. This one will cost you 300 bucks Alright, so you've likely seen part one of our course err slate build and don't worry We will be finishing that up soon TM, but the slate fit our Insanity descriptor so well that we needed to include it here And I know it's fundamentally just a big black box, but what makes this case crazy is the? Ridiculous amount of tempered glass. This glass it's gonna be huge It's curved, and you won't even believe it And it's no slouch when it comes to hardware capacity either in fact, It has the most capacity out of A N Y case we've looked at so far. The most. You can mount 8 SSDs, 5 hard drives, 5 graphics cards, 2 motherboards, 2 power supplies 2 quadruple 120 millimeter radiators , a triple 140 millimeter radiator and 24 fans to cool it all off Oh, and did I mention that it has RGB front i/o because yeah, it has RGB front i/o Now sadly this 40 pound behemoth is not on the market yet, but we are hoping to see it sometime soon and Hopefully for under 500 bucks because damn it Corsair, the world needs this bringing us to our final case But okay the most insane case The most insane thing I Think I have ever seen, Meet the Zadak 511 Helicarrier we aren't sure how many of them exist or how many will be made, but it is technically a production model and therefore qualifies for this video so all right Where do we start with this thing? Not by opening it. That's for sure. So it did include toy jets you know yeah but it didn't include instructions, so we're gonna have to take their word for it that it contains a 6950X and an Asus Strix GTX 1080 that actually that story doesn't really check out at all because this is an MSI motherboard and You know what whatever..I'm sure if you order one you can get it with whatever you want inside Let's focus on what we can see from the outside The entire case is plumbed up for the integrated liquid cooling system With coolant lines visible on the sides here and over here, and it's got four single 120 millimeter radiators here here here and here the whole thing is made out of machined aluminum and Plexi and weighs so much that it requires two people to move it Io is fairly standard and positioned at the back.. But don't be fooled into thinking that you can just put it on your desk and fire it up The power cord can only be inserted into the bottom once It's mounted on the included display stand but once you get it in there you can power this thing up by Sliding your finger down a capacitive strip at the front whoa Is that a thing of beauty or what? so it lights up these LED lights down both runways and And also add some blue accent lighting to the bottom now I wouldn't blame you guys for having decided by this point in the video that you need one of these Two which all I can say is Too frickin bad cuz unless you've got a cool $20,000 burning a hole in your pocket, You're just going to have to live without it But what you don't have to live without is TunnelBear, the simple VPN app that makes it easy to browse Privately and enjoy a more open Internet.

so if you've ever owned a laptop you've probably got experience with your CPU getting hot enough to boil water causing your fans to spin up to blow dryer levels and your performance to fall as a result but what can you actually do about that well in the fringe PC performance tuning scene swapping out generic manufacturer provided thermal paste for high performance alternatives has been found to improve CPU and graphics card temperatures significantly so we took one of the best products on the market a liquid metal based material to find out if we could improve the cooling and performance of a gaming laptop and spoiler alert it worked really well and we're gonna show you guys how to do it after we show you eks muddler liquid cooling phoenix lineup this is their next generation of modular and all-in-one liquid cooling solutions check them out at the link below and thanks to ek for sponsoring this video [Music] liquid metal has a thermal conductivity of 73 watts per meter Kelvin this is a staggering sixteen point two times higher than even a good aftermarket thermal paste like icy diamond so then with performance like that why is everybody not using it well there's one big problem liquid metal is well metal and that makes it not just thermally conductive but also electrically conductive so if you have a slip up during application and it gets on to the capacitors resistors or traces on your CPU GPU or motherboard the only thing your device will be good for is making black smoke and even that only for a short time so with all that in mind we decided that the best laptop for this job was the $3,000 Acer predator Triton 700 this 18 point nine millimeter thin laptop packs an Intel Core i7 7700 HQ and a GTX 1080 max-q but while it's out of the box thermals are genuinely impressive given its size under a combined load it does experience thermal throttling giving us an opportunity to not only improve temperatures but also potentially performance so before we began we needed to establish a baseline so we ran a fairly comprehensive battery of tests then it was time to head down to the workshop and get started this is everything you'll need a set of screwdrivers we recommend the iFixit Pro Tech tool kit some conformal coating electrical tape cotton swabs and of course liquid metal we chose thermal grizzly conductor not a tin gallium and indium eutectic alloy for it's insanely high thermal conductivity and its endorsement from overclocker extraordinaire Deir Bauer now disassembly of your laptop if you're following along will be different please consult a guide online but the Triton 700 requires the removal of the bottom screws actually the keyboard area up top one pro tip is to always be careful when lifting pieces away from a laptop because there may be fragile ribbon connections that need to be removed first with the heat shield and the fans from either side of the heat sinks removed finally we can get to what you've all been waiting for removal of the heat pipes and fins always undo the socket mounting screws in reverse order of the numbers by the screws and then very carefully lift up from both sides slowly working it until it all comes off at once from here then it's goop removal time for us this took an especially long time because we were trying to get it out from all the resistors and capacitors surrounding the GPU die but patience here is important these are not only extremely fragile but they're also the most likely thing to get shorted out if our liquid metal application goes poorly some isopropyl alcohol on a cotton swab will help you get in between them next step is to apply some conformal coating to the areas around the CPU and the GPU dies this stuff forms an insulating layer that should help prevent short-circuiting if our liquid metal seeps out if you feel like masking all day you can spray this stuff on but to save time we applied two coats 15 minutes apart with a cotton swab bringing us then to the do-or-die moment application of our liquid metal it is crucial that you only put a super small drop on top of the die so that it doesn't seep out very carefully put um okay you know what we meant to do that because without some liquid metal to clean up for you how would we show you what to do in the event of a spill sure that's it so anyway since it's metal you can't just soak it up with a cloth but as it turns out wiping it with alcohol can be successful so after about half an hour of cleaning we were ready to give it a second go we cleaned out this part strayed to allow us to get the right amount just on the tip of the applicator and then moved over to the dye and actually that looks about right now we're back on track so then the next step is to spread it around using the included cotton swab until it makes a very thin film you want it to be fully covered but it shouldn't look like pooled up water then what you do is rub any excess on the bottom of the heatsink where it contacts the dye the process was similar for the GPU liquid metal on spread it around and we're good to go we also added some last-minute electrical tape just because we were a bit sketched out and a physical barrier is always a great second line of defense so then with the machine slapped back together [Music] ah that super stupid boot sound I never thought I'd be so glad to hear it the laptop works although that's not much of a surprise if you guys have been paying close attention to the video now anyway let's talk results now we were expecting our temps to be a little better but to be honest at least for me anyway like I kind of thought the main limiting factor was the dissipation capacity of the tiny heat sinks that you find in laptops not the thermal resistance between the processors and the heat pipes I was so wrong in i-264 we got a 20 degree improvement to CPU temperatures under full synthetic load and under a combined CPU and GPU load it still gets hot sure it's a lot of heat but nowhere near the overheating that we saw before 3d mark saw modest performance gains and then the team did you guys really think we were gonna stop there we fired up the intel extreme tuning utility upped the turbo boost time to as long as it will allow then we hopped into MSI Afterburner to see how much we could get out of the GPU and with everything said and done we had our GPU

the new GoPro Hero 6 black is the best action can FR but if we're being honest we could kind of expect that at this point right it's kind of like this iPhone 8 plus right here if it isn't the best iPhone that they've made yet wouldn't they just throw it in a bin where it belongs and keep selling seven pluses so the question is just how much better is the hero six black compared to last year's hero five black and that this price for something that is just a camera how much better is it than this and is it also better than our sponsors Oh tax product the Magnus en 1070 a compact high performance gaming machine well if you're looking for a camera maybe but if you're looking for a high performance gaming machine probably not check it out at the link below [Music] so the hero six black has nearly the exact same body as the hero five meaning that it is waterproof without an external enclosure it works with the same accessories including the Karma grip and drone and it has the same 12 20 milliamp hour batteries and USB type-c charging port GoPros companion app remains an option for remote control and monitoring but like with the euro 5 you don't have to use it anymore because the integrated 51 millimeter touchscreen makes it super easy to adjust settings like shutter speed white balance ISO and beep volume and to review your footage in the field as long as you aren't underwater at the time with that said once you've dialed in your favorite settings I think you'll probably give most of your commands to the hero 6 black by voice and I know I know it's everybody's favorite gimmick right now along with AI but think about it it actually makes way more sense here than it does on most devices if your camera is mounted to your head and your hands are full of you know sports balls and athletic peripherals you have no easy way of knowing whether the camera is recording or even what mode it's in but that doesn't matter with voice commands because it will actually change from photo mode to video when I say gopro start recording so yeah I know voice operation was introduced on the hero 5 black but it's also been expanded here in a couple of meaningful ways including the ability to turn the camera off and up to eight hours later back on which is theoretically awesome for saving battery gopro turn on gopro turn on as long as you can get it to work reliably ok then - that's great how about something that the five didn't have sure while it might not look new on the outside instead of using a commercially available processor from Amborella like just about every other action cam on the market under the hood of the hero 6 black we find something really special a brand new custom process sir called the GP one cool name by the way you guys I wonder what that stands for so this new chip has double the processing power boosting nearly all of the camera's capabilities allowing it to record at higher bit rates capture higher dynamic range videos and even HDR stills and perform electronic image stabilization along more axes but most of that stuff doesn't actually even make it to the bold print on the front of the box there the focus is on the framerate 4k video at 60 frames per second up from 30 last gen and 1080p video at 240 frames per second for some wicked slo-mo up from 120 on the last gen videos recorded at these high frame rates use the new h.265 a TVC codec while the rest used garden-variety h.264 it also has a new recording format called 4k 4 by 3 or about 4000 by 3000 pixels and it can do this at up to 30 frames per second this mostly adds vertical space to the recording and the purpose is to help the editor ensure that the action isn't getting cut off at the top or bottom of the frame if the camera gets accidentally misaligned while you're running around out there on the subject of framing you can also zoom now sort of hero 6 black has a linear slider now for digital zoom though you cannot adjust it while you're recording so I would think of this as more like an infinite number of field of view options and indeed the old narrow and medium field of view modes are no longer with us finally the new photo burst mode called auto takes up to 30 photos per second but can actually take fewer if it thinks that each shot requires more exposure time which all sounds nice but bearing in mind that the hero 5 black was only $400 when it launched just a year ago is this refresh really worth the $500 price tag I mean we are getting close to flagship smartphone territory and come to think of it on top of everything else the iPhone 8 can take 4k video at 60fps to them is there any point buying this thing at all side by side you can see that video quality between the two is actually pretty comparable though keep in mind that it is not exactly an apples to apples comparison given that the hero is wide-angle and the iPhone 8 plus has a more conventional lens and a telephoto lens on its two discreet sensors the hero 6 also lacks image stabilization at 4k 60 while the iPhone 8 has optical image stabilization all the time with that said when shooting at 4k 30 where the hero 6 blacks electronic image stabilization actually works it does work really well now obviously though these cameras are very different gopro products are rugged have an ecosystem of accessories that have given them their reputation as the fremo action camera brand and even if you go out and get a gimbal for your iPhone or you put tape it to your forehead like I did last week you're still not going to get the immersive first-person experience that GoPros wide-angle lens delivers so does the fact then that the hero 6 black is arguably the best action cam ever made mean that you should run out and buy it well if it were two hundred and forty-nine dollars that I would say hell yeah man but and this actually seems intentional GoPro has priced it out of the range of you know your casual music festival attendee and closer to the prosumer threshold where the target buyer for this probably makes some money maybe even to attract sponsors for their downhill racing err motocross or whatever with epic action cam footage this strategy shift will probably result in fewer units sold but let's face it that was happening anyway and at least this way GoPro can make up for it with higher margins from the people who can more easily justify the higher price tag speaking of higher price tags don't you hate it when you go to the grocery store to save money by making your own food and you end up buying stuff that you

A third of the Razer Blades that we bought last year have been returned to Razer for diagnosis or repair, and still more are suffering from ongoing issues So today's video is about two things: The 4k Blade update that dropped this summer [crowd shouting] And whether any of the issues that we've encountered with past Blades are present on it Speaking of issues, Sennheiser can solve them.  That is assuming your issues are specifically to do with needing a new pair of IMS.  Their Hd-1 Wireless In-Ears feature a sleek design, great sound performance and a ton of awesome features check them out at the link below [Theme song] The main attraction of the new Blade is of course the upgrade from a 3200 by 1800 to a 4k display.  And it's a significant improvement, but maybe not for the reasons you'd think.  More on that later There are some other things I want to get to first.  The last generation Core i7 6700HQ CPU has been replaced by the faster core i7 7700HQ and The Blade V5's dual channel... [record scratch] No...no wait! What? Sorry about that Anyway, like I was saying, Blade V5's dual channel ddr4 2133 [mhz] gets bumped up to 2400 megahertz for Blade B6 But other than that, not much has changed as far as I can tell The reviewers guide contains some, in my opinion, fairly misleading fluff about a lighter chassis, brighter keyboard and improved thermal design But, when I questioned Razer about this, they admitted the chassis itself was unchanged, the thermal solution change was just an updated software fan curve and, this one's the kicker, the brighter keyboard bit was meant to be compared to a notebook without chroma backlighting Excuse me? Now, they've assured me since then that this messaging was never used on the actual product page, and that they're going to send Updated reviewers guides to me and everyone who received one, But frankly, that still really sucks Unless everyone goes back and updates their articles, videos and streams, that misinformation is still going to be out there this review from tech spot for example quotes the weight of the 1080p and 4k models from the reviewers guide But, while the new 4k model is lighter than the old qhd+ model, this small difference seems to be because the display assembly was changed Possibly without adjusting the hinge, because I can't open the notebook with one finger anymore Not because the chassis is lighter To be clear, I'm not knocking Techspot here for basic non-debatable product characteristics like color, weight and dimensions I generally take the manufacturer's word for it too - and I only double-checked this time because of the other peculiarities. Maybe marketing and PR isn't entirely to blame here though Maybe they wouldn't have to scrape the bottom of the barrel to find stuff to say about their 'latest and greatest' if it was a bit more 'greatest' and a little less 'latest' so, [sigh] and this is an honest question What has the Blade team been doing for the last couple of years? What we did was that we got the best thermals engineers The same ones that worked on the Razer Blade, and had them look at the...the new razor phone But, I do have some good news. It's only been a few weeks, and it's a sample size of one, but I haven't experienced any of the issues from our previous blades on this unit Even the weird color rendering issue that John found in Google Chrome appears to have been resolved And, as much of this video as I've spent criticizing it so far, the small iterative improvements to the blade have added up to a genuinely better product Especially for the user like me, who wants a portable machine that can game, but that generally uses it as more of a mobile workstation.  Battery life is much better thanks to definitely Intel and probably Nvidia fine-tuning their manufacturing processes Max system surface temperatures are basically unchanged, but the cool spot for WASD is bigger which is nice performance in games actually improves a little bit B6's GPU clocks higher and runs a few degrees cooler than v5, and the new touchscreen display really is a lot better.  Now at this size 4k resolution is irrelevant.  In fact, I actually wish that it was 1440p at the max, because both of these panels are impossible to drive with the GTX 1060 in modern AAA games But, for general use, it's brighter, the air gap is smaller improving off-axis clarity, and both color and contrast are so much better that last gen looks straight-up washed out when placed side by side with the B6 this is...equal parts criticism and praise though.  The difference here wouldn't be so striking if V5 wasn't using such an outdated panel.  So then, it's better than ever before I still love a lot about it. The keyboard is among my favorite Thank God that horrendous one from the blade Pro didn't make another appearance Thunderbolt 3 for external adding card support is great, and it looks and feels so deliciously premium But it's 2017, and for gamers out there who want power and portability, the blade isn't the only game in town anymore So, in no particular order, here's what I want the blade team to work on for the next 6 to 24 months to make b7 and b8 go from aging to awesome. 
 One: the webcam It's still decent, but it's no longer ahead of the pack, and streaming is at the heart of Razer's other product development Two: oh wow...that bezel A 15 inch screen would be perfect here Number three: while I'm wishing for a custom display, it really should be 1440p and it should refresh at 120 Hertz Four: a two-year standard warranty This unit is great so far, but Razer, you guys really need to start standing behind your products better to rebuild my trust And five: I don't know...Dolby Atmos certification? I...that last ones not a huge deal actually, and I mean that's all I could think of to change so... obviously, I still Love the Razer Blade, which is why it hurts so much when it cut me last year and why I hate to see it getting rusty and neglected like this speaking of neglected... can I...

what is a phone for gamers exactly is it a no compromises mobile experience for the most discerning of consumers or is it a mediocre expensive product that hides its flaws behind flashy marketing and an eye-catching industrial design maybe just maybe it can be a little bit of both today's video is brought to you by Sennheiser their PXE 550 wireless headphones feature up to 30 hours of battery life noise guard hybrid adaptive noise cancellation and more learn more at the link below [Music] the razor phone both on paper and in practice is one of the fastest mobile devices on the market with highlight specifications including a totally insane snapdragon 835 processor through the insane performance and insane eight gigabytes of RAM and an adrenal 540 GPU that I think could only be described as insane all right okay razor so back on earth none of those things would actually get you strapped into a straitjacket and in fact all of them can be found on the cheaper one plus 5 T so I guess it's my job then to help the average consumer differentiate between your phones totally normal features and it standout ones that's fine the first thing they did well was cooling razor is a long way away from being able to design and/or fabricate its own mobile processors like giants Apple and Samsung do so to differentiate from competitors all they can really do is get the most out of the generally available parts on the market and they did just that the performance difference between the razor phone and another phone is totally sane insane performance but it's also measurable I wouldn't personally notice this kind of a bump in day-to-day usage but I would never say no to free performance the second thing they did well is the battery in spite of razors choice of an impressive but neither insane nor unprecedented four thousand milliamp hour battery they've actually taken some flak over benchmarks like screen on time but as someone who relies on a more anecdotal approach to phone battery longevity I had no problems with it at all and even with the screen configured to 120 Hertz the razor phone lasted me through even the most demanding days with lots of GPS navigation and video watching leading us to the third thing that razor did well and not as well the screen the good is that the 2560 by 1440 120 Hertz from sharp is a total GameChanger I already experienced this kind of fluidity with the iPad pro but a high refresh rate display when used with variable refresh rate technology to keep unnecessary screen updates from sucking back battery while you're just staring at a static screen not doing anything is a pure no compromises solution it's insane for real this time other than some stutters now and then that I hope Razer can continue to tune in future firmware updates animations and scrolling are so much smoother that because of the additional responsiveness you would swear that the device is more than just marginally faster thanks to a beefy cooling solution the bad though is that other than the refresh rate nothing about the screen stands out compared to an OLED you do lose the burnin concerns but it can't display a clock or notifications all the time by illuminating only the necessary pixels compared to a more color focused LCD it's not especially bright and this is actually a big one for me compared to some of the ultra wide aspect ratio displays that are out there now the razor phone wastes far more of its face on bezels and on screen buttons though maybe waste is an unfair word call quality on the handset in particular was pretty unexceptional but when it came to playing games or watching movies that wasted speaker space was an absolute godsend now I went out of my way to praise the pixel 2 and pixel 2 XL for their spectacular front-facing speakers even though it did cost us a headphone jack and Razer is going to get the exact same treatment here great speakers guys wish it had a headphone jack yes in there and the skin is actually another highlight they're using a nearly stock Android skin that seems to kind of borrow from the oneplus PlayBook noting razor added feels like bloat and their game booster which lets you tune performance versus battery life on a per game basis is pretty cool so no complaints here other than the usual warning that comes from buying a low volume Android phone the Expediency of razor's software updates and how long you can expect to get them on their first generation product are both unknown quantities at this time and that isn't the only buyer beware statement that I've got about this phone here are a few more in no particular order one it's not waterproof for careful people this might not be a huge deal but ip67 ingress protection is quickly becoming industry standard and this omission is made worse by number two the razor phone's ergonomics are not great I understand why they went with this blocky shape it's cheaper and it gives them much more internal space for heat pipes and batteries compared to a phone that's similar in size on paper like the pixel to excel but curvier but the hold ability drawbacks compared to devices with a more natural hand like shape are something that stood out to me three razor says the camera is going to improve a lot and it might but right now the best thing I can say about it is that it actually is capable of capturing decent or even pretty good pictures the worst thing I can say about it is that the camera app is best replaced with a third-party one off the Play Store the low-light performance is not very good and that I haven't experienced shutter lag like this in years it's just not very competitive right now and if all I had to go on was my knowledge of razors long-term support of their first gen products and how difficult the software tuning required to get even identical hardware up to par with Apple and Samsung or even oneplus would be I'd have to say I sincerely doubt that it will get there before work on a new snapdragon 845 based new razor phone start sucking up all of razors dev time which brings us to the last buyer beware price when a new razor product comes out to its credit the razor phone is significantly less expensive than other top-tier flagships like the iPhone 10 and Galaxy Note 8 but compared to the next level down kind of second-tier flagships like the Galaxy s8 iPhone 8 1 + 5 t its flaws become much harder to overlook it's a bottom line then I'm not switching to the razor phone but razor has still done something been seen remarkable here that is especially remarkable given that this is their first attempt they've managed to create an identity for this product line that gets me pretty excited for where they're gonna take it in the future it might not be great at everything but it's the best at something butter smooth gaming and that is a lot more than most me - phone manufacturers can say speaking of me - if you guys notice the sexy D brand skin on our razor phone you thought I gotta get me one of them too then head over to the link in the video description dbrand creates awesome vinyl skins for laptops phones tablets consoles controllers and more they use high-quality authentic 3m vinyl on every product and their cut is so precisely measure many times to ensure that they have a factory fit for your product and not only do the skins look great deep brown skins protect against incidental scuffs and scratches and they have recently announced their D brand grip case the grippy estate ever so head over to the link in the

there is our merch which has cool shirts like this one and our community forum which you should totally join we spent an insane amount of money and insane up and insane but it's insane insane insane

huge thanks to huawei for sponsoring our trip here to their booth at CES 2018 where we are checking out the mate 10 Pro Wow they've got long tethers on these things look at that you can like basically walk off with it I was expecting it to get caught but I mean yeah I really was not intending to hold up that one because I've actually already got my own that I've been playing around with for the last about 48 hours in a nutshell their claim to fame with this one is this is their first phone with an AI processor or an NP u so it's got a Chiron 970 this is an 8 core chip built on the 10 nanometer process it's got 6 gigs I've ran 128 gigs of storage it's got ip67 water and dust resistance an 18 by 9 OLED screen at 2160 by 1080 resolution a 4000 milliamp hour battery and it's a 6-inch display phone which is actually really impressive given the form factor it does have a little bit of heft to it but that is a lot of hardware in really not a lot of space it does not have microSD expansion but it does support dual Sims so you can travel with it very easily and one of the big things they're talking about here is the camera it's got a dual sensor rear camera with glass from Leica a 20 megapixel sensor under one of them that's a monochrome sensor and a 12 megapixel color sensor under the other they've got optical image stabilization and back to that AI processor a lot of the features of the camera are actually powered by it so one of the coolest things that it can do is subject recognition and scene recognition and it's really fast so it recognizes all kinds of things from flowers to skies to night scapes to Sun rises to plants to food to text that text 1 is more important than you might think I don't know about you guys but I scan stuff with my phone all the time and it can do more things with AI as well from Huawei's research they found that the biggest things that people complain about with their phones are performance and battery so the plan is to use AI to dynamically optimize the performance and battery life of the phone for each individual user and they are claiming that after 500 days of using it you won't experience a slowdown so this baby comes pre-loaded with Android 8 Oreo and it is going to be priced at $7.99 for this version or there's actually a porsche design more premium version that's going to be 1225 though they did mention in the keynote that if you move fast some participating retailers will have a hundred and fifty dollar gift card incentives so thanks for checking out this video thanks to huawei for sponsoring our trip down here to their booth you guys can like this video if you liked it you can just like it if you didn't like it quite so much and you can check out where to buy the products we featured at the link in the video description we will see you at the next amazing technology discovery yeah make it out of the frame oh damn 
yeah it's that time of year CES you guys have had videos up the wazoo in your sub box for the last few days but you just didn't have time to watch them all fortunately people do round ups so here are the five best intel desktops that you couldn't see in their dedicated videos brought to you by intel first up is the asus strix GL 12 it's a pre built that's geared for pro gamers and tournaments it features up to an Intel Core i7 8700 K and a GTX 1080 an acrylic side panel that looks pretty darn close to tempered glass are a sync RGB of course and the coolest feature a swappable SSD compartment in the front you might be thinking who needs that well it's actually for gaming tournaments so that organizers can easily load up the systems with all the games and settings that they need but if you're looking for something more professional and maybe in a smaller form factor MSI has got you covered with their new W 25 a workstation in their incredibly small two and a half liter case basically everything about it is undisclosed but we can make some educated guesses so we know it's got a Xeon processor so we could say it'll probably be something with a similar TDP to the 8700 series chip in the gaming version and we know it's got an undisclosed NVIDIA Quadro perhaps volta based whichever way it ends up it is awesome to see this much power in such a small form factor if you're looking for something small but you want water cooling well the digital storm spark might be what you're after this case is only 4.7 liters in volume but it has hardline liquid cooling to keep its internals up to an Intel Core i7 8700 K and a GTX 1080 cool and boy is this thing ever sexy other features include triple m dot to drive mounts optional custom paint jobs and a 92 millimeter radiator in the top to dissipate all that heat if you have space to spare though the Acer predator Orion 9000 we'll be sure to take up well a lot of it this thing though can hold up to a hundred and eight gigs of DDR four quad-channel RAM and Intel Core I 918 core processor dual GTX 10 ADT eyes and then up top a dual 120 millimeter red to keep your CPU cool the outside complements the bonk doodles components with full RGB lighting a headphone holder a DVD drive because why not and wheels so you can roll up to your next land party in style but getting back to smaller things coming in at just one point two liters you could actually fit a hundred and twelve of Intel's haiti's Canyon nooks inside the orion 9000 this thing features up to an Intel Core i7 80 809 G with a TDP of a hundred watts graphics for this thing are taken care of by a Radeon rx Vega mgh with 24 compute units and four gigs of HBM to memory making this little guy capable of driving a full-fledged VR experience additionally whether you're into blowing skulls or not you'll be taken care of because it's RGB lit and you can turn it off so thanks once again to Intel for sponsoring this roundup be sure to check out our other videos from CES 2018 
Okay so today's video yeah it's a product that really makes no sense to me at least on the surface this right here is i've actually got the product page up behind me this is come on come on get in here check this out check this up this is the i don't know highland star microelectronic anyway we ordered it from usb dot brando dot-com and this doodad right here adapts as as regular sata interface with some controller from sage that i've never heard of to 10 micro sd slots That's quality right there so yes my friends today we're gonna make our own ssd [LTT Theme] {click click} [Intro] Song: Lazlo Supernova Today's videos brought to you by tunnel bear the simple VPN try Tunnel bear for free at tunnelbear.com/LTT we're gonna have that linked below So step one is gonna be some RATFAM because while it does seem fairly straightforward in principle you take the 10 micro sd cards that Kingston graciously sent you because you're a famous youtuber and then you Install them in all the things i do want to make sure that we are doing it correctly so instructional note number the first you can use 1 2 4 8 or 10 micro sd cards at one time it does not support 3 5 7 or 9 Instructional step number ii insert the micro sd cards into the micro sd slots one by one as The order shown on adapter where's the CHP0L I just see COM tf 1 tf 6 tf 2 i think that's for trans flash why does this pcb say demo on it okay well We're just gonna we're just gonna go according, to the numbers so where's here's tf 1 let's do this thing wait doing this write Down and then you slide it there we go So the idea here is that it runs all of your micro SD cards which aside from being a much lower grade typically than the nand flash that you would find in an ssd are fundamentally the same thing it runs them all in RAID 0 To make up for the fact that a typical micro SD card will be capable of anywhere from you know 20 to maybe 80 to 90 megabytes a second reads and writes whereas a typical SSD especially a SATA 3 one can saturate a SATA 3 interface at around you know 500 Mm 50 or so megabytes per second One problem that i do foresee though is that there's more To life than sequential performance when it comes to SSD and the controller dictates what the random performance will be like and oh That too ignores the other problem which is that the flash on a typical microsd card is not only slower But also less resilient than the higher quality stuff on a normal SSD a problem that is compounded this is all about the problems with this thing hey Compounded by the fact that you're running this whole thing in RAID 0 so one dead micro SD card means there goes your data it's gone, so there it is for better or for worse this is now a 1.2 terabyte RAID 0 micro SD SATA SSD I don't know what it is let's plug it in this is so dumb it's like cool but it's like why there it is no way 1.16 terabytes of useable space let's call this drive letter k has it special So i'm actually a bit of a loss now because i'm gonna let you guys behind the curtain for a second here while i was prepping this video i actually realized that this probably wasn't going to work because i hadn't gone through the instructions ahead of time and i just noticed that it says right here do not support uhs-1 and these are quite clearly uhs-1, cards so i Was expecting to like go on a field trip to best buy and come back? But it's working so let's let's test it i guess ok, so if i told you we have the world's stupidest ssd special k drive here how would you benchmark it it's 10 micro sd cards on a pcb we could use crystaldiskmark, ATTO disk benchmark i'm coming into this with literally no expectations whatsoever actually at 512-byte that's right even that bad is it this is that a queue depth of eight though so to be clear this is very unrealistic for a desktop workload okay So there's a couple of takeaways here number one is that our drive is indeed sata to and number two is that The performance is actually better than i expected but this is just sequential this doesn't really tell us anything about how it would perform in a real-world workload let's head it with crystal disk mark just for lulz oh wow um we're still gonna run the pass mark test i guess but this is not looking good for random performance this is performing about like you'd expect from a bad SSD four or five years ago because there's a lot more To SSD performance than just taking a bunch of nand flash and writing to and reading from it in a Parallelized manner to get more speed out of it the controller intelligence has to be high in order to get better oh, wow these random numbers these are awful okay So for our last trick pass mark just thread test so The average latency here doesn't really tell us the whole story because where you really feel the slowness of a drive is when it when it spikes That's what most modern SSDs are really trying To overcome this those spikes and latency that's when you like click on something and you feel like your computer's like? So we are seeing spikes up to almost half a second on this drive with a lot of them actually sitting here around a fifth of a second so while you could run an os on this thing i really wouldn't recommend it and to drive that point home i've actually spent the last half an hour waiting for windows to install off a usb drive and it's still at 81% of getting files ready for installation this thing is kind of painfully slow like to the point where i'm having a really hard time figuring out what its purpose could possibly be because you might go oh well you know maybe Disposable data that you need to be faster than a hard drive? But not as fast as an SSD like a steam game library but even then the cost is so high to fill this thing with 64 gig or 128 gig microsd cards like we did would cost more than just buying a proper ssd like a crucial mx 500 or a wd blue so I'm not sure why it exists but it does And it's cool So there it is and you know what else is cool Dollar Shave Club if you have it for whatever reason signed up for Dollar Shave Club then now is a better time than ever for just five bucks they are offering their shave shower starter set it includes their executive razor as well as three trial size versions of some of their most popular products their body wash their shave butter and their one wipe charlies butt wipes After the starter set replacement cartridges are just a few bucks a month's so head over to dollarshaveclub.com slash lightest we're gonna have that link below and join the club so thanks for watching guys if you dislike this video you can hit that button but if you liked it hit like get subscribed maybe consider checking out where to buy the maybe not that this thing but maybe the SD cards and and that site actually where we got this has lots of other cool random gadgets as well so you can check that out at the link in the video description also linked down there is our merch store which has cool shirts like this one and our community forum which you should totally join 
freshbooks is the number one cloud accounting software custom-built for the way that you want to work for your unrestricted free 30-day trial go to FreshBooks comm slash line of CES and speaking of custom-built for the way you want to work we're back at Silverstone checking out the top five crazy things that we found at their booth that are actually really useful and we're gonna start off with the MSO nine and the MSO nine mini these are MDOT 2 SATA enclosures but not just that they also have a USB 3.1 type-a connector on the edge so to make it yourself you just remove the four screws on the back that's on the side with the switch on it for your USB type a connector open it up flip it over and then inside the standard MSO nine you can fit at 22:40 to a twenty two sixty or a 20 to 80 sized MDOT to SATA drive and in the smaller MSO nine mini you can fit a twenty to forty two then just close it back up and you have your own awesome super fast ten gigabit per second flash drive that you can then convert later on to be a system drive or whatever else you want moving on we've got probably my favorite thing here and it's the third time that's been released and it's still probably my favorite thing here just because it's so kind of hilariously awesome and that's their remote starter kit for your PC this time it has a speaker mounted to it so when you press the power button or reset button from across the room you have to hear that your computer turned on it doesn't seem like immediately you might need that functionality but when you can't see the computer necessarily it's actually pretty freaking cool when you plug it into your motherboard for the power switch and reset switch headers it also has break offs I don't know an Escalade what to call them pass throughs that you can plug your standard power button and reset button on your case into so don't lose any of that functionality either I think this is actually pretty damn cool and it plugs in through the PCIe 1x slot on your motherboard next up we've just got an expansion card that you can mount an nvme m2 SSD into which is really cool because it's so small if you notice there's no even mounting bracket to go on the outside of the case it's also really short if you have a tiny little builds that you need to make and you do have an available 16x slot you can drop this in here get another drive don't have to worry about clearance on top of it and don't have to worry about mounting it on the back pretty cool then we have there tpo 2 m2 link it for MDOT two SSDs I know a lot of this stuff as MDOT to based this I'm mainly calling out just because it's kind of funny they added an actual physical heat sink into the box because people were too sketched out with their previous version that actually worked better but don't worry that's all previous stuff is still included in here if you've been following the news on MDOT - cooling stuff these heat sinks that go on the top of them don't accomplish a ton but people love them because they look like they'll accomplish a ton it still has the thermal pad which can thermally conduct from the MDOT 2 drives controller mainly down into a mainboard or whatever it's actually mounted on which is actually far more effective so you've got the peace of mind over the piece of metal that goes on top and you've got the effectiveness of a thermal pad that goes on the bottom and then just in case your love for em to just absolutely cannot be satiated we have another way to mount them all the way from 20 to 40 to 220 to 110 those really long m2 drives this will convert them to SATA so you can have 4 SATA plugs only takes one SATA power which is actually pretty cool as well and you can have way more m2 in your system just in case you've populated all the m2 on your board and you've populated all the PCIe lanes you can possibly plug m2 into you've done everything else and you still want more drives you can have four of them mounted into a three and a half inch drive bay and speaking of MDOT - and other things that we just can't get enough of sponsor spots thank you - fresh books for sponsoring this video you can use they're easy tools to create invoices in less than 30 seconds you can even view if people have seen your invoices or not so you can check in with them and make sure that they're actually going to pay you which is a pretty important process of running a business you can focus on things like doing your job and pushing forward in your company instead of just doing paperwork which can be frustrating and annoying and speaking of less paperwork you can also accept credit cards through their online platform which is helpful as well if you want to check it out for your free unrestricted 30-day trial code FreshBooks comm slash line of CES if you liked the video like it if you dislike the video dislike it other than that stay subscribed we'll see all the rest of our CES 2018 content and everything beyond that as well see you next time 
So you bought yourself an ergonomic keyboard spending not only hundreds of dollars, But also countless hours trying to master typing on the darn thing. But like that's fine. I guess right you can't put a price on health. But hold on a minute! What happens when you're not at your regular desk? Most of the ergonomic keyboards that we've tested have been large and cumbersome enough that you wouldn't want to travel with them. So what you're just doomed to aggravate your repetitive strain injury? Haha, no my friends for there is a light at the end of your carpal tunnel. Introducing... Yogitype! The foldable ergonomic keyboard. But is this thing a direct path to keyboard nirvana, or is it more like downward dogs*it. Speaking of nirvana today's video is brought to you by TunnelBear. TunnelBear makes really, really simple privacy apps so people can enjoy a more open Internet. Try TunnelBear for free at tunnelbear.com/ltt [Intro] - Song : Lazlo Supernova The Yogitype comes in a bougie carrying case that will absolutely make people want to be your friend, and Inside you'll find the base, wrist pads and the keypad set up is a snap. At first it might seem like you're typing upside-down or something. Since you're looking at the underside of the keyboard as you type. But actually the Yogitype is kind of like the safe type keyboard that we *clicks* checked out before. except on steroids The main idea of having a vertically standing keyboard like this is to prevent what's called pronation. That's when the two bones in your forearm crisscross, pinching tissue and blood vessels Of course though having the keys on the side makes them harder to see. And let's be honest even the touchiest of touch typists will look at the keyboard, sometimes. But instead of janky rearview mirrors the inward angle of the key modules allowed Yogitype's creators to implement a much more elegant visual aid colored LEDs And you can even switch them off if you prefer. And this angle has some economic benefits as well helping with extension and finger relaxation. Speaking of relaxation the included wrist pads are... Super cushy. Easy to adjust and the best part is they slide so they don't inhibit your natural movements. This is so much better than having to hold your arms up the whole time like on the safe type. My only gripe is that you can't adjust their height, and I think that they're a little bit, too Tall to fully alleviate the last economic pitfall. Ulnar Deviation Okay, so this is all quite positive so far, but what's it like to actually type on this thing? Well at first it wasn't too bad since they've got tactile guides for both your index and pinky fingers. As well as this sort of inexplicable one on the 8-key. And most of the keys are in the same relative position as they are on a regular keyboard Most of them. I mean, hey I get it this is ten keyless board and there's no room for keys on the foldable base so you're just gonna have to get used to the more obscure keys like home and end, Having new homes on the end. But what about non-obscure keys? They moved the apostrophe key to no man's land and Backspace. a key that I use a lot more than I'd like to admit, though Probably still less than I should has been moved to right beside the P key which means that when you make a mistake Typing on this strange new keyboard you have to rectify it by using your pinky in unfamiliar territory Which often leads to making even more mistakes making you so unproductive that you just end up putting the Yogitype in a bin under your desk for two weeks while you review other stuff But Linus, backspace has to go somewhere doesn't it? Well, of course it does and My vote is to take over some of that spacebar real estate this would not only flatten the learning curve but also make it more ergonomic since you have way more power up here than you do with your little finger, but I'm actually not going to stop there as is the space keys are positioned to be pressed with the base of your finger Which works, and it's actually kind of innovative But it does disrupt your index fingers ability to continue typing so our Preference would be to strike the space and backspace keys with the thumb like you do on the Kinesis advantage - or the erga docks Except that these bloody joysticks are in the way not that thumb sticks are a bad idea Inherently, so these are for controlling the mouse cursor page scrolling and right and left clicks You can even switch between left and right-handed mouse configurations right on the board And I'm positive that there are some users out there who need to be able to do that from a neutral position The problem is that the mouse is effectively unusable it has crazy Acceleration unruly steering, and I'm not sure if our right stick is broken But we had trouble moving it at all without highlighting everything if they insist on keeping the onboard mouse I would suggest replacing the joysticks with Marble-sized trackball or something like how cool would that be. One last complaint. Did anybody else notice that the keys on this side are staggered and the keys on this side are all aligned WTF? (Oh, Linus) Anyway Should you buy this keyboard then at about a three hundred and fifty dollars? It's $60 more than the Awful SafeType, but is better in just about every way including the switches. This one is way less mushy Though with that said the Advantage 2 is the same price is mechanical and though it doesn't fold up It is portable in the sense that all the macros and the layouts that you program onto it are saved on board so I wouldn't say that it sucks but the Yogitype has enough small things wrong with it at this point that giving it our full endorsement would be a bit of a stretch Which can't be said about Squarespace!

handy tech under a hundred it's time for handy tech the show where we find handy stuff that's tech and show it to you it's also one of the only series that we have managed to stick with over the years anyway we've got a lot of great stuff in our hands today to fuel your childhood gaming nostalgia that is unless you're currently a child in which case you probably won't really get most of this stuff speaking of getting it get tunnel bear tunnel bear is the really simple privacy app so you can enjoy a more open Internet to try total bear for free go to tell bear comm /l TT will have that linked below [Music] first up is the SN 30 from 8bit doe a remarkably accurate replica of one of Nintendo's most beloved controllers only made like six controllers so it's not that hard but anyway it even has the right mix of convex and concave buttons it's available in nests or Famicom color schemes and it was designed for use with the recent Ness classic and super Ness classic consoles since for some reason Nintendo decided that in spite of the much greater size of modern TVs they would endow those systems with cables that are much shorter than the originals so now then you can sit comfortably on the couch because not only is the SM 30 a 2.4 gigahertz wireless controller it also lets you reset the console remotely by holding down and select the controllers can last for up to 25 hours off of just an hour of charging over USB micro-b and they are reasonably priced at 25 bucks now unfortunately the dongle complete with nest style grill marks uses Nintendo's proprietary connector so while you can use the SN 30 as a wired controller for your PC Mac or Android device by plugging in a USB cable it doesn't have the broad functionality of the SN 30 pro turning everything good about the SN 30 up to 11 it's got modern Nintendo features like Rumble feedback and motion control plus this nifty button for taking screenshots on the switch it also has thumb sticks a home button and two sets of L and our shoulder buttons making it a fully functional Xbox one controller that can connect to anything with a Bluetooth signal the feel is a little less authentic it's heavier they had to shift the buttons up to make room for the joysticks and like the regular one it is thicker than an original controller not to mention that it's twice the price at 49 it could be much more useful especially with the $8 smart phone clip accessory which has a surprisingly good job of hanging on to even large phones though the way is slightly imbalanced all right then so you like the idea of tactile gaming on the go but you want something smaller how about the our do boy a credit card sized 8-bit game platform that lets you not only play games but also make and share them our D boy comes with only a single classic 8-bit game but it can be reprogrammed from a huge library of free open source and editable games online the unit itself is super light but still feels durable with a metal back polycarbonate front and subjectively pretty fantastic buttons and it's got a toggle switch to turn it on a 1.3 inch black and white passive matrix OLED screen and 2 piezo speakers to blare your favorite chip tunes for up to 8 hours on a single charge and because it's based on Arduino Leonardo it can actually be recognized as an input device like a synth keyboard or even a remote for your quadcopter not bad for 49 bucks but if you're not interested in the user programming crowdsource EE thing you can also get an alternate version of the our D boy the tetris micro card this one has an additional toggle for sound a vertically oriented screen and only one game an officially licensed version of tetris complete with peace preview wall kick and soft landings there are 15 difficulty levels that should be enough for most people especially since you cannot pause the game and it's a little bit dear at $54 but it's fun little retro toys go it is pretty awesome great gift idea now to mash all of the themes we've touched on so far into one the nest PI case is a tiny Nintendo themed enclosure for your Raspberry Pi B+ two or three it has slots for microSD expansion USB power in HDMI out and audio out then it's got its own handy daughterboard to handle pass-through Ethernet and four USB to ports as well as power and reset buttons and a cute little red LED and this is cool they include a small fan mount so you can utilize the original slot and grill for cooling and there's even a mysterious little compartment that you may or may not remember on the original mess that the net spy uses to hold extra SD cards this thing is actually a great value even if you're not into the pie scene at 28 bucks you could easily pay more for just a Nintendo themed desk ornament and I'm not even mad that it's not as white as the one on the website because the yellowing here makes it look really realistic leading us to finally hmm now we're gonna tie this into the female god you could use it to lock up all this gaming stuff so that your roommates don't touch it with their greasy Dorito hands trick method anyway the tap lock is a smart padlock that you unlock with your fingerprint just press your finger against the capacitive sensor and the lock opens in just 0.8 seconds which is key for a lock that you open and close all the time like your gym locker or your new year's resolution forbidden snack cupboard priced at 85 bucks the tap lock can hold up to five hundred fingerprints making it easy to share with your whole family and the battery can last for up to a year or 3500 unlocks before it needs to be topped up with the magnetic cable you can grant and revoke access to other people using the companion app and you can also use it to check on the locks battery life and open it without your finger by connecting over bluetooth as for how strong it is as a plain old lock I mean like anything with the right tools you could obviously break it but it's pretty beefy so at 300 grams the electroplated body is made of Zanic 3 while the anti shim and the anti pry shackle is 7 millimeters of reinforced stainless steel as for whether it can withstand the weather though that's a bit of a mixed bag so tap lock is ip66 rated so any amount of rain should be fine as long as it doesn't get submerged but when it comes to temperature it's only rated for between negative 10 and 60 degrees Celsius so not ideal if your shed is in northern Canada alright then so as with any handy tack we've got our disclosure bit and this time it's pretty easy all of these items were sent to us by the

at long last the final update to the wallpaper TV window saga is here I've come up with a couple of really fun ways to take advantage of the features we saw in our previous videos including its 4k resolution spectacular image quality integrated Dolby sound bar and HDR support and I'm rolling the whole thing into something people have been asking about for quite some time so step into my office we are going for a little tour sponsored by LG almost everything in here has a story behind it the textured wall on the left as you come in is not wallpaper which is what most people assume it's actually made up entirely of painted motherboards and it's not just for looks see you can hang stuff off the little i/o ports as for my desk that hasn't changed much the custom PC that was built into it was designed to my spec with a 10 Core Extreme Edition processor a 1.2 terabyte Intel PCI Express SSD and Asus workstation board with 10 gigabit networking 64 gigs of corsair dominator special edition memory 24 terabytes of local storage a totally overkill water cooling system from UK and an LG 38 you c99 38 inch 75 Hertz ultrawide monitor with a c910 webcam and a razer siren pro for video calls and some pretty boring peripherals they're actually so old they're not even they're not even Argentine I'm using a Corsair Raptor m45 because it's one of the only mice that doesn't agitate my wrists and as for my g7 10-plus honestly nothing else would feel quite right this baby has seen me through literally hundreds of thousands of words of LTT script material including the ones you're listening to right now and I have no intention of replacing it until it fails this wall here is where I keep all the sentimental stuff that I have acquired over the years I've got the world's creepiest renditions of Han Solo and Leia Organa with mine and my wife's head swapped onto them a broken thread ripper 1950 xcp you framed badminton jersey an entire silicon wafer of quantum processors that was really cool that was from when we checked out d-wave and finally one of those Chinese money cats that my wife got me as sort of a joke when we moved into this building and then he's wearing this super weird thing that this JaVale Oh company sent they were like whoa check it out you could do engraved pendants with your face on it and I was like wow who would want to do that bringing us finally to the big change now the original plan here for the wallpaper TV window was to just basically leave the room the way that it was and put the TV on the wall but as you can see we actually ended up Rikka jiggering this entire side of the room to make it significantly more functional so we added some shelving up on the top left I can use that to store ongoing projects or things like the extra modular cables for my test bench power supply we added some shelves over on the right which ended up being mostly decorative they're not really big enough to put anything that useful on and we added this built in desk so it's the right height for me as it is which means I no longer need to have one of our more expensive up desks in here we've got a pass-through power that's backed up by a UPS as well as pass-through USB power for whatever I might be running on the bench surface right here and use case number one for the wallpaper TV is that better not that does so right now I'm testing this external GPU box and there you go I'm just using it as a secondary display for the laptop right here so I've got two HDMI cables that are coming up through the bottom of the desk one of them comes up through here for a test bench and the other one comes up over here for a laptop so I can just sit here and use these throw a video up there if I want to have it playing in the background while I'm working or whatever the case may be use case number two is probably the most obvious one so using an additional PC just a little low power consumption one plugged into yet another HDMI input in the speaker bar that's below the desk here we can use a combination of stock video footage from online and our own clips like the one that's running behind me to change the environment in the room more than you would probably think so whether it's the Serengeti or whether it's a view out over the water in downtown Vancouver or from in a bad mood whatever goes better with that this use case is probably the most wow factor one for when people come into the room because the image quality on this thing is just breathtaking which isn't to say that it's necessarily the one that's most fun for me okay so let's pull this off and check this out wait this was just working this right here is the new tech studio monitor app and with this I can replace the functionality of the fifty dollar piece of glass that I could have put here with exactly the same experience for the value price of only eight thousand dollars for the TV plus a whole bunch of other gear yes my friends I can see exactly what I would have seen if we had just put a window here or thanks to the wonders of modern battery banks with AC outputs networking and I don't know tripods I can see anything I want anywhere with a network connection this thing actually does go wireless but I found that the wired connection is a little more reliable go figure right I just got the battery out of the camera is that good oh that's not good don't mind me employees I am just putting this camera here pay no attention to the camera it will not be used for surveillance don't think of it as a camera think of it as a window of opportunity check it out they don't suspect a thing my totally discreet tripod setup gives me a window into the goings-on of the lmg headquarters neat huh well whatever I like it so thanks to LG for sponsoring

frickin lasers whether they're coming out of a stormtroopers blaster or they're mounted on the head of a shark they're undeniably badass and the go-to weapon for evil villains everywhere and now us in our quest to dominate YouTube's tech vertical we will be harnessing the power of the laser so that we can wow guys really that's what we're using it for just like you'll be using Corsairs new HS 50 if you need a wired three-and-a-half millimeter headset it features metal structural components and 50 millimeter neodymium drivers check it out at the link below [Music] you know you know what I am I'm gonna wear them for over a year now alex has been trying to figure out how to make a laser cutter that's both powerful and cheap and that's where the good people at smart DIY come in they had the smart idea to make a DIY laser cutter kit giving you the capabilities of a prefab at a lower price by having you assemble it yourself so it's like IKEA I guess and that's what we'll be doing today but first why do we want a laser cutter and what exactly is a laser cutter okay no I'm not gonna wear them the main things that people use them for are to accurately cut plastic or wood in two dimensions or to engrave basically any material and while we already have a 3d printer that can fabricate plastic parts in three dimensions because these parts get printed in layers they can only be their strongest in one direction at this time easily pulling apart in the other further contributing to their weakness is the time and cost associated with printing solid objects using fused deposition modeling so it's much cheaper and faster to make hollow stuff with a laser cutter though you can cut pieces of acrylic without giving up any of the strength of the original material this means you can build load-bearing things like drone components or computer cases using them so enough foreplay then let's meet the smart DIY fabulous co 2 a 40 watt laser cutter kit hailing from Japan we were initially worried this video wouldn't be that interesting then we opened up the packaging and holy Frank look at that laser oh it also computer water cooling parts damn okay this should be fun the frame is made of aluminum extrusion that gets held in place using right angle brackets the instructions aren't perfect and you do have to pay really close attention to the text in pictures but if you follow them very carefully there's no reason to screw anything up now it's time for power there's actually one power supply already in here so that gives us one AC to DC power supply for the electronics then a switching power supply for the laser the next piece is the rail with the stepper motors once the tension is adjusted these tracks should allow our cutter to robot its way around the bed and then these big cable holder tank track chummy's that I'm sure have a real name will keep it from snapping its wires cables go in the motor side then out on the bottom and over to the controller this can communicate to the outside once we have the i/o panel attached which has USB AC power and also this weird fitting thing that I'm not totally sure what it does yet now it's time for water cooling the initial plan was to RGB it up and use our only chance but unfortunately the fan controller uses proprietary wiring and we would need to do a fair bit of careful soldering to get power to our RGB controller so we decided to leave it stock although a hard line tubing upgrade is definitely still on the table down the line when it came time to mount the laser we realized that we didn't have a large enough allen key for these bolts so thank goodness for vice grips Ben we carefully put the laser on making sure not to tighten it down too hard or we could risk breaking it with the laser in wiring it up was pretty much a matter of following the diagram until everything but the pump is connected we'll plug that in once the reservoir is filled the only part of this build that didn't feel all that premium was the dampers for the top cover these long bolts are kind of jank but they do the trick and then with the acrylic installed on top it looks pretty good anyway okay but hold on a minute here if the laser is locked in place in the back how does it cut things ah well it actually gets bounced around to the desired location using front surface mirrors the first one goes back here on this piece of aluminum extrusion and then this is where this project started taking a bit longer than expected it would appear that a big part of the reason that laser cutters cost so much is because of how freakin long it takes to get them properly calibrated so the process is basically like this after putting on the protective not to mention very cool glasses that you need whenever the laser back is open you take the mirror and put a piece of masking tape over it then briefly radiate the laser which creates a burn mark on the tape to show where it's hitting you adjust until it hits in the center and then you're good to go no actually it's not quite that simple either since the laser beam needs to hit the center of all of the mirrors in all of their possible locations around the work area it actually was about a day of fine-tuning before it was finally ready to go the last steps then were filling the loop putting on the final panels installing the software the process for which is conveniently entirely in Japanese and booting it up and it works and it's in English actually so for our first test will engrave a dead meme on a dead pcs side panel with okay so some small issues at first but we'll just turn vsync on here and hey the second half of the etching went without a hitch so guys as of filming this right now we just got this bad boy running and we definitely want to do a follow-up video so let us know what you want to see us do and we'll add it to the list of super cool projects that we have planned for the fabula co2 and on the subject of things that are super cool Tunnel bear if you've been looking for an easy-to-use VPN app then tunnel bear is the first and last place to look it's super easy to use and they've got apps available for iOS Android they've got a Chrome extension they've got it for PC they've got it for Mac and it's got lots of great features as well one of them is what's called switch so before you connect to a network your device actually starts to send information about itself and what it wants to do and a kill switch stops this from happening because during that time before you connect to a normal VPN all that traffic is unencrypted so in the few seconds it takes to connect you've probably already broadcast your IP maybe a few DNS requests or a search query vigilant Bear stops all this from happening by blocking all outbound and inbound traffic so nothing leaks out before you connect and if your connection goes down for some reason vigilant bear will kick back in and stop until the connection comes back so for a free trial of tunnel bear go to tunnel bear comm /l tt will have that linked below thanks for watching guys if this video suck do you know what to do but if it's awesome

the Xiaomi me notebook Pro has been billed as some kind of much cheaper macbook killer but it doesn't run mac OS and it's like $1000 so buy that line of thinking what Windows notebook with an aluminium shell isn't a cheaper MacBook so then does it actually stand out from the crowd as a true competitor or is it just a look-alike knockoff well I'll get to that after I tell you what's not a knockoff today's sponsor tunnel bear telomere makes it easy to privately and securely browse a more open Internet Tritonal bear for free go to Tunnel bear comm /l tt [Music] opening up the mean oppa Pro feels really good the aluminum backing is solid and so tastefully free of branding that even Apple's light-up logo feels a little tacky by comparison the hinge has a satisfying weight to it without requiring two hands to open it and this theme of clean style and quality construction is present throughout the entire device even extending to the i/o I mean I'd have loved to see Thunderbolt 3 but this is still a solid mix of ports at this price point plus USB type-c charging is nice to have the only part of it that even sort of breaks the illusion is the cheaper feeling bottom panel but in regular use this is not an issue at all what was an issue for me at least is that we imported this thing through gearbest.com and it was pre-configured to Chinese so yeah no problem Dennis can fix ah no he can't it actually comes with a single language Chinese version of Windows like we tried to just deal with it like Chrome and parts of some programs are still in English so it's not impossible to get by but to call the experience inconvenient would be a gross understatement so for me and my fellow Grillo's the only real option is to reinsert it san insult to me for me and my fellow pylos out there the only real option is to reinstall windows which in this case also meant obtaining a fresh license key with that sorted out though it was time to actually get to using the me notebook pro and good news here it is a powerful little machine quad-core hyper threaded core i5 8250 u 8 gigs of ram and get this and NVIDIA MX 150 which is basically a mobile version of the GT 1030 I mean to be clear you don't expect to be playing modern triple-a titles at full resolution but this is still heaps better than integrated graphics even for things like premiere or Photoshop or older games and unlike some devices that we've tested dedicated graphics doesn't seem to have any negative impact at all on the system cooling was more than satisfactory with our CPU quietly reaching a mere 53 degrees Celsius under load with a small 2.1 gigahertz turbo and the battery life blew our minds the efficiency of this hardware including intel's 8th gen u series cpu gave the me notebook pro a staggering 10-hour 4 minute result in our battery life work test that is a full 40 minutes longer than our previous champion the LG gran and it absolutely smashes other laptops that are well-regarded for their battery life like the dell XPS series Microsoft Surface lap book and the MacBook Pro running Windows but the most important aspect of any productivity oriented device is arguably the interface if the keyboard and trackpad are constantly annoying you nothing is going to save it fortunately however the me notebook pro actually gets these mostly right as well the keyboard has a good layout that commits no major sins and a reasonable switch travel distance but if key caps are quite poorly stabilized so if you hit the keys off-center they do feel really mushy which can affect accuracy so I'll give that a b-minus as for the trackpad despite its large size we experienced no issues with palm rejection the tactile feel when clicking is nice and satisfying and although out of the box it has quite a bit of sloppy feeling acceleration it's actually large enough that you can disable acceleration entirely for a great experience this one gets an a for a Windows device the MacBook is still way ahead of the pack and that's true when it comes to screens as well but I really don't mean that as an insult to the me notebooks display it runs at a mere 1080p 60 Hertz but it's bright with wide viewing angles thanks to its IPS panel so as long as you don't mind the reflections that are an inherent part of the glass-fronted screen experience you will like it one thing I might have changed is to add a touch screen option though this is something that I feel Apple has really been missing out on and would give the Mino but pro a leg-up the webcam is perfectly acceptable for Skype calls and as for the Harman speakers that boast Dolby Atmos certification well I've yet to have an overhead or surround at most experience on a notebook but front positional audio was outstanding especially considering their downward firing positioning and while for stereo content they do distort a bit at full volume they get loud before they get there and they're surprisingly full sounding making the me notebook pro a fantastic portable Netflix machine let's get back to that GPU now okay yeah it's not amazing in games but it is still a big upgrade from intel's integrated solution rise of the Tomb Raider not a good time but it handled titles like rocket League Skyrim and csgo handily so if you want a casually game after studying then it's got you covered there too opening up the mean OPA Pro we can see where the impressive battery life comes from from an impressive battery this thing is rated at 60 watt hours and since we're in here we'll take a look at upgrade ability too so adding another m dot to SSD would be easy-peasy but unfortunately the RAM is soldered so if you're looking at one of these I would recommend buying as much RAM as you're gonna need probably the 16 gig model unless you are a very light user bottom line then starting at 9 79 us on promo the me notebook Pro is an impressive piece of hardware at a great price that's made even greater if you don't mind the Chinese Windows that's included the inclusion of a dedicated graphics processor will give it a longer lifespan as GPU compute becomes more important for productivity and the solid construction should help it hold up physically as long as you'd want to use it the remarkable battery life though is what really makes it stand out against other MacBook alternatives like the Dell XPS so well done Xiaomi and well done Dollar Shave Club for sponsoring our video that was a good decision you guys if you guys haven't already now is the time to try out Dollar Shave Club

thanks to synergy for sponsoring this video from CES 2018 synergy 2 is the easier way to connect one keyboard and mouse to multiple computers check it out at the link below so we're here in the Nvidia suite where they are showing off the world's first big big format sorry excuse me big format display they're bringing big screen gaming to the PC now gaming monitors that are big have already existed for quite some time and there are even PC monitors that are as large as 42 inches though it should be noted that there are only a few outliers that you could really consider to be gaming monitors that are 30 inches or above well that all changes today the 65 inch monstrosity behind me checks off a ton of the boxes from our video earlier this year where we designed our ideal gaming TV so it's got really low latency like super low like a monitor it's got DisplayPort and HDMI input just like a monitor it's got a hundred and twenty Hertz max refresh rate just like a monitor and like a high-end gaming monitor it supports variable refresh rate with Nvidia g-sync technology so they're announcing three different models but all of them are using a VA panel from a you Optronics with quantum dot film four DCI p3 color support and nice deep black levels they're also using a full array back light solution with local dimming in order to achieve 1000 nits peak brightness with the ability to support HDR now they haven't announced plans for Dolby vision at this time but it should be noted that most games maybe there's an exception or two you guys can leave a comment if you can think of anything but most games are supporting HDR through HDR 10 anyway let's talk results now they haven't announced how many local dimming zones these TVs have but if I had to guess I'd say it's probably similar to the 4k high refresh rate monitors that they talked about at CES last year so more than tens but probably not you know over a thousand something along those lines and in terms of results well local dimming is still not oled so that's a thing you can see blooms around bright objects in very dark scenes from time to time and it was especially noticeable in menus or if you have a bright moving light moving around your character like let's say like a navvy type assistant but if that's the case you've probably got more annoying things in your life and in general and fast paced situations we didn't really notice it while gaming now let's take a look at the back of a sirs prototype here these are absolutely prototypes so I guess the other thing to consider is that you've got to give them some time to improve it so they're announcing three partners Acer Asus and HP who are gonna launch displays hopefully sometime in the summer and it's up to those guys how they want to finish the screen matte or glossy how they want to do the stand the sound the bezel and the OSD options but in terms of the actual performance of the panel they're all using the same panel so it should be pretty similar okay then so I mean it's a TV realistically the expectation would be that you can use it for more than just gaming so Nvidia solution to that is to integrate a shield TV so they're full standalone device experience into the display and this is another thing that was in our video why don't you just have a high end thing built into the thing why are they why are they laggy it's ridiculous so Amazon and Netflix both have 4k HDR support and now you've got full integration with Google smart home and Google Voice which is pretty big and this is another announcement today that just like someone mentioned in passing I was like what really g-sync is now supported with game stream and in android games on shield TV though it should be noted you can't just plug your existing shield TV into your TV or your monitor because it only has HDMI out and gsync on the desktop anyway at this time is only supported over DisplayPort another cool thing for the TV guys not the gaming guys out there is video playback thanks to variable refresh rate is done at the native frame rate so if you're watching cinematic content it'll be running at 24 fps or if you're running something like the Grand Tour on Amazon then you will actually see it at the 25 fps that it was shot at No stupid interpolation no pulldown no nothing like that so let us know what you guys think in the comments is couch gaming finally here we've got low latency wireless mice we've got wireless keyboards we've got actual gaming TVs is it time well it's gonna depend on your budget like I said it's coming this summer and Nvidia is not commenting on pricing at all so I'm just gonna have to wildly speculate based on what I know about a typical g-sync up charge over a decent monitor and say I wouldn't expect these to be less than probably around 5 grand so let me know what you guys think you're gonna see and what you would pay at the comment section at the comment section damn it I was so close no let's just roll with that thanks to synergy for sponsoring this video synergy 2 makes the configuration of synergy their keyboard and mouse sharing software that works across Windows Linux and Mac easier than ever even with more complicated networking setups also improved with synergy 2 is the ability to have it running seamlessly in the background so you can set it and forget it so check it out at the link in the video description it's seamless comm slash synergy slash CES 2 you get 50% off down there by the way so thanks for watching guys if you dislike this video do that if

so I am on my fourth international trip in the last like three and a half weeks I've been all over the place New York two or three times LA and now finally I am in beautiful Paris so it's night time I was thinking to myself I could go out and I could see the sights enjoy the nightlife or I could show you guys something that I whipped up that I call the ultimate travel gaming setup okay so I know what you guys are thinking that's just a razor blade stealth with a mousepad a mouse and international adapter and power brick there's nothing ultimate gaming and there's nothing special about it but I do have a piece that is special and this was actually kind of inspired by my upcoming review of the razor blade stealth because as you guys probably know if you've seen any coverage of a previous played stealth one of the big selling points for razor for this device is its compatibility with their razor core external graphics card enclosure but I don't think most people are gonna buy that kind of thing so I wanted to review the device stand alone but that doesn't mean that I wanted to ignore the capabilities however as you guys have probably noticed this is not a razor blade core this is the secret sauce that actually makes this travel gaming setup more possible because the core or core v2 now I guess is really designed to be left at home so you take your notebook around with you you get home you plug in your Thunderbolt cable and boom you've got a full desktop grade graphics experience this guy this is the a horas GT X 1080 gaming box and it's actually available with a variety of different GPUs pre-installed in it so small and compact that you could be reasonably expected to travel around with it so it enables a completely different use case than the razor core which is actually pretty bulky not to mention it does not come with a handy-dandy little travel case so razor doesn't really advertise this but their blade stealth and actually their blade for that matter I've tested them with a variety of different external thunderbolt and external GPU enclosures and I've actually found that while they don't guarantee interoperability between their notebooks and their GPU enclosures and third-party accessories it's actually been pretty good so your mileage may vary in terms of which external box you use but I wouldn't necessarily feel like you have to buy the razor one and that's a good thing because razor I mean I love you guys and all that but you guys charge a freaking lot for your external GPU box but pricing on this one puts it closer to if you account for that it comes with a gtx 1080 inside and that those obviously have a cost this guy comes to about two hundred dollars only compared to the razor core v2 at about five hundred dollars so it doesn't come with this fancy orange cable mod cable that was that was actually something that i added so on the one side you've got a really large fan that is completely dedicated like all the way from here to here to here to here to this mini gt x 1080 graphics card on the front you've just got a ARS logo on this side you've got a built-in power supply a couple of cooling fans that are bringing fresh air in over here and then around back you find the business end so there's a standard PCIe 16x graphics card so feasibly you could actually swap this out in the future if you could find something that would fit then you've got some included i/o so you've got a fast charging USB three three more USB 3s and then the Thunderbolt that you need in order to power the GPU so it doesn't have the same IO as the core and honest I'll tell you guys it's been a little bit more finicky at this stage been the razor core has requiring a reboot sometimes in order to be detected but overall the experience has been pretty decent so we just take our Thunderbolt 3 cable plug that bad boy in and what's cool about this is that we actually don't even need the blade stealth included power adapter anymore so this takes the place of your laptop power adapter ok so let's fire it up the gaming box actually turns on automatically once you plug in Thunderbolt and power up your machine I just need to give my setup a second to detect my mouse and all that good stuff getting a couple issues with USB connectivity this is something that I've seen with this particular box before it doesn't affect my use case right now but it is something to maybe keep an eye out for before you go ahead and jump on this exact setup but but overall this is about the direction we're heading in terms of mobile gaming like look how compact and easy to travel with this whole setup is ok now before I fire up the game there's one quick thing I want to check just I want to make sure that this hand shook properly so yes GT X 1080 shows up here and the Nvidia control panel shows up so we should be good to go now I just want to configure my options here now normally playing on a laptop even a gaming laptop you'd be setting up like bitch tier options but not today we're gonna crank it to 3200 by 1800 FXAA and we're turning the graphics to very high with motion blur off now to be clear the best gaming experience on these external boxes is had with an external monitor because there's only so much bandwidth in this Thunderbolt connection there's a PCIe 4x connection and then some protocol overhead so when you have to communicate from the system to the graphics card in order to actually render the game then that's a lot of bandwidth and then when you have to send the graphics cards display output data in of actually hooking up an HDMI or DisplayPort connection here when you have to send it and I think it's called loopback mode back to the laptops display then you end up hurting yourself because you're using some of your bandwidth up for that so you can expect to take anywhere from a 10 to a 20 percent performance hit is this not incredible like yeah we're only running it 38 to 42 fps so it's not the smoothest gaming experience of all time but like I'm being pretty unfair to it like we're running at 3800 by 1600 I don't have to do that on a 13.3 inch display so let's say we drop it to 1920 by 1080 let's have a look at what performance looks like there there it is my friends ultra details 65 to 70 FPS gaming in a reasonably demanding game on a laptop okay so I know that external GPU boxes aren't new and the razor blade stealth isn't particularly new obviously carrying a mouse around with you when you travel isn't new but the reason that I'm bringing this up now as opposed to before is just because a few things have all come together and made this sort of this what's been a pipe dream of mine for the future start to look like it's a lot closer maybe even a reality today so number one is that these external GPU boxes are getting both smaller and cheaper that's awesome number two is that notebooks these actually legitimately thin and light notebooks with great battery life I use this on a plane for over six hours with a couple of battery tweaks on my way here finally have quad-core processors because that was the issue a lot of modern games are finally getting to the point where they can actually use more than just a couple of CPU cores so even though razors been talking about this use case for well since the blade stealth launched it never made any sense to me before but check this out so you can see here the CPU is turbo hang up as high as like three points gigahertz and change to keep the CPU from being a bottleneck and this is pretty cool here back up a little bit I'm gonna lean in with my microphone which I'm wearing this whole setup is quiet so in some ways this is actually better for my purposes than a gaming laptop with everything integrated because now I can upgrade my super portable notebook or my GPU separately as my needs change and the pricing is not that far off especially when you consider that like this graphics card is non-proprietary so it could just be moved to like a friend's desktop or resold when you need a new GPU like ah this is totally game-changing so thanks guys for checking out my video on the ultimate travel gaming setup if you dislike that you can hit that button if you liked it hit like if you want to get subscribe do that if you want to check out where to buy the stuff we featured I'll try and throw links in the video description for that this is actually available with a number of different GPUs I'm not sure if I mentioned that before also down there's our merch store and our community forums so you should totally

I can see the product development meeting now No one's buying AMD laptops because they're slow... But everyone likes AMD Ryzen desktops with lots of processing cores... Today's video is brought to you by Corsair Their Void Pro gaming headsets feature microfiber mesh fabric And memory foam ear cups As well as custom tuned 50 millimeter neodymium drivers Check them out through the links below [Intro] With its black back panel and red accent lighting, the Asus GL702ZC looks mean But not in an, over-the-top gamer-ey way And opening it up, immediately reveals the stars of the show A Ryzen 7 CPU and Radeon Graphics processor that make this, the first all AMD gaming notebook that we've seen in... Many years, or... Now that I think of it, ever? And it's no slouch! The Ryzen 7 1700 8-core 16 thread processor boosts up to 3.7Ghz, The RX 580 is a very competent GPU for 1080p gaming, The 16 gigs of RAM out of the box, And, the ample I/O that comes with the territory of a large and in charge 17-inch machine like this one, make the GL702ZC, on paper, One of the most compelling, gaming/workstation PC's that we've ever seen But I'm sure what everyone is wondering right now, is... Can they keep all of that cool? And the answer is... Hell yeah! For a while.. At 3.2Ghz under synthetic load The temps, well... *BAD PUN ALERT* They just kept on Ryzen At 5 minutes, we hit 80 degrees Celsius After 10 we were above 90C, and then after 20 minutes, it seemed to leveled off But at 95 degrees And, while still remaining super quiet for some reason maybe ASUS needs to do some fan curve tuning here Once my CPU is over 90 degrees, I don't care if it sounds like a typhoon, It needs some TLC Tender Loving Cooling And remember our testing was done in a climate-controlled room All of that being said, we were impressed to see any laptop maintain 3.2Ghz on eight cores So, to find out how this kind of grunt compares to a more traditional Intel 4 core laptop We put it up against the ASUS G503VM. A similarly priced 15-incher, That packs an Intel Core i7-7700HQ, and an Nvidia GTX 1060 Firing up Cinebench we... Wow. Oh wow Wow! Oh wow, just... Wow, that's some savage destruction of... I mean, not just our comparison laptop... All laptops! By a lot! Even beasts like ASUS $6,000 water-cooled GX800, And the Acer Predator 21X are no match! For the multi-threaded prowess of the GL702ZC And the theme continues in other CPU focused tests like 7-Zip and Blender It's not all amazing though In rendering tasks that can take advantage of the GPU The gap narrows somewhat with the GL702ZC still taking a convincing lead though And then, when we move from compute, to graphics The RX 580 just can't quite keep up with the GTX 1060 No matter how hard it tries *loud fan noise* Which, judging by the sound of the fans while gaming... Was pretty hard In 3D Mark it loses out by a bit to the 1060, And then in actual games the GL702ZC consistently loses, although not by much To it's smaller, Green and Blue brother Not that those couple of frames will probably be noticeable in actual gameplay But there's more to life than FPS anyway. If you run out and buy a GL702ZC today That's our AMD version here, It's both heavier and thicker than the Intel Nvidia version And honestly, the 702 didn't light any exciting fires for us at this price in general The keyboard is not amazing, it does have a numpad if you're into that and after typing for a bit Getting up to speed accurately won't be a big challenge, but it's a bit mushy feeling And pretty much the same can be said for the trackpad It's serviceable, but un-interesting And the same goes for the screen. It is IPS, so viewing angles, brightness, and colors were all suitably adequate And FreeSync is a boon for improved gaming smoothness at low frame rates But 60Hz screens are better suited for laptops that don't have to go up against 120Hz models, at a similar price In eSports titles, this amounts to a big difference in the gaming experience Moving on to the webcam. It's not bad by laptop standards, but it's.. Unexceptional. Especially in low light And, you might want the light low since you'll be doing everything you can, to conserve the battery Like... There's bad, and then there's... One hour and 22 minutes until all the electrons have escaped... bad To be clear, the performance while it's doing it is good But this still puts the 702ZC on the, worst battery life We've ever seen in PC Mark's test podium Okay, so that last bit was a bit of a downer There's more good stuff though, Opening up the GL702ZC you are greeted with surprising upgradability There's an empty RAM slot, Non soldered solid state storage, and a 2.5 inch bay And, AND! A mother-freaking full sized, desktop AM4 socket! Now, we can't guarantee that ASUS will provide BIOS updates, but AMD has confirmed AM4 support Until 2020! So it's possible Pretty unlikely, but possible That you could have top-tier AMD CPU performance for years to come with all that being said We're not that into buying this thing as a gaming laptop. It's competent at gaming But if that's what you plan on doing, there are better options right now With that said, we see the GL702ZC with its unprecedented multi-threaded performance as more of a, Powerhouse on a budget mobile workstation That can also game on the side. And in time, we're really excited to see what other Ryzen 7 designs, make their way to the market. I mean, maybe with a more powerful NVIDIA GPU, or mobile Vega.. Next note, AMD We could see the ultimate streaming laptop Only time will tell Speaking of time, if you find yourself running your small business or your freelance operation and just not having enough of it Freshbooks can be the solution you're looking for.

is it just me or does it feel like dreaming has been slapped on pretty much everything at this point I mean we're talking from stuff that makes sense like mice and video cards all the way to glasses or chairs but does using gaming components actually make your pc better for gaming well we built these two PC's and tested them head-to-head to find out and we're going to tell you after these messages from total bear total bear thinks the Internet is better when everyone can openly access the same content try total bear for free at total bear comm /l TT [Music] so our methodology was pretty simple we started with a well balanced machine core i5 8400 16 gigs of RAM GTX 10 70 m2 SSD etc then we replicated the exact same config as closely as possible except that to the best of our ability we replaced every single component with a gaming version of the same thing so if it didn't have something about calling up your squad or just gaming right in the product name it was out it actually ended up being a lot easier than we thought so we have not only easy ones like gaming graphics card and gaming motherboard but also a gaming SSD gaming power supplying gaming a i/o cooler even our case fans are all gaming doubt we look at this look at this packaging according to these blurbs from the manufacturers their hardware will deliver upon us a new era of gaming it will bring a real body blow to your opponent's weak point for massive damage and even enable one to master the decisive moments and succeed in all attacks wow that sounds great let's fire up some synthetic tests - oh no well this can't be right what what all these numbers are within 3% of one another whatever in the world could be happening I was promised a new era of body blows and decisive moment mastery success maybe to have the amazing gaming experience advertised on the box I have to play real games no no again this is consistent with what we got earlier on just what in the hell is going on here okay in all seriousness though let's talk about what happened here many of you probably saw this coming but it turns out that slapping a gaming moniker on a product and adding some RGB and fancy styling does not make it magically perform noticeably better the only things that affects the performance of a PC are its actual specs the clock speeds of the given products inside it and potentially cooling for example when we clocked our reference non-gaming gtx 1070 graphics card to match the speeds of the gaming version the results equalized so why is everyone putting gaming in their product names well our first guess was that they wanted to charge suckers more for it but while your mileage may vary depending on the particular models you choose and how much you're willing to drop on additional enhancement elements like RGB lighting and custom power supply cables our gaming machine ended up costing about the same as our vanilla one and actually included some tangible benefits first up our GPU came with a higher boost clock out of the box which it was easily able to maintain thanks to its enhanced cooling gaming class cards also tend to come with extras like multiple temperature sensors or OC switches that make kicking them into a higher gear a one-click affair second yeah we have to bring it up style our gaming machines looks immediately tell us what she was built for some manufacturers like isus even enable you to sync your system and graphics card lighting via their software with that said more and more these days even vanilla parts like the Asus I'm Z 378 in our non-gaming machine come with RGB capabilities so some people like a nondescript box tucked under their desk churning out dem frames while others prefer the other this one is clearly subjective but we had to mention it bringing us to number 3 gaming parts often come bundled with game codes or paraphernalia like do not enter I'm gaming door hangers and gaming related stickers and that's it that's about all we came up with our 2 systems cost about the same perform about the same and their quality is about the same soul then why dump so much money into the development and marketing of these products if they perform the same why does ROG even exist well because even though the base level of these gaming branded products do actually cost about the same what these brands do are a couple of things number one is they allow companies to create halo models that do sell for a lot more for the people out there who value bragging rights above performance per dollar and then number two is that even for that regular stuff that doesn't make more money as marketing strategies go it seems to be working really well when we did our last audit of orders through our Amazon affiliate code we actually found that even for a category like video cards which never used to have gaming in the name since I think the manufacturers figured it was implied gaming models were out selling their non gaming counterparts significantly so there you have it Gaming doesn't make it faster but it also doesn't necessarily make it slower so I think the real takeaway here is um come to think of it what did we learn today that this video was brought to you by Dollar Shave Club if you haven't already now's the time to try out Dollar Shave Club it is more than just razors Dollar Shave Club makes it easy for you to upgrade your shave and your bathroom and you don't even have to step foot in a store to get high-quality shaving and grooming products they deliver them right to your door for a limited time Dollar Shave Club is basically giving away their shower shave starter set to new members for five bucks it includes their executive razor and three trial size versions of their most popular products to help you stay fresh and clean so you get the shave butter the body wash the one wipe Charlies Bott wipes and the executive razor which includes the premium way to handle and a full cassette of cartridges after the first box replacement cartridges are just a few bucks a month so check it out at dollarshaveclub.com we're gonna have that linked below so thanks for watching guys did this video suck you know what to do which was awesome get subscribed hit the like button or check out the link to where to buy the stuff we featured in the video description we'll have both versions down there for the more gaming aesthetic inclined and the less so also linked in the description is our merch store which has cool shirts like this one and our community forum which you should totally join 
for the number of super Nintendos that i own that's also technically the number of super Nintendos that i own that are also broken but we won't talk about that for the number of SNES hardware revisions recommended by purists for optimal RGB output for the number of available colors for the Super NT a hardware reverse engineering of the original Super Nintendo and for the number of seconds before I tell you this video is brought to you by us check out the LTTE merch store at the link in the video description we've got shirts mugs stickers hats the super NT is the latest retro console from analog built by enthusiasts for enthusiasts right off the bat it appears to be quite a bit less premium than their original reverse engineered NES the NT it ditches the USB charging port for its included wireless controller and it's made entirely of plastic instead of 6061 aluminium but that's actually ok because in return we get a selection of classic and modern designs for both the console and it's controllers we get a price tag that's dramatically lower than anything analog has produced to date a mere 189 dollars including two built-in games putting the super ante within the reach at least of mere mortals unlike first party SNES classics which have gone for as high as $400 on eBay thanks for limiting your production Nintendo anyway what else do we get here it still got an SD card slot for firmware updates with the possibility of a jailbreak firmware that would enable you to run games off of it and we have a single universally compatible SNES cartridge slot thanks mainly to 1990s Nintendo and they're curious implementation of cartridge region locking move around back there's micro B USB for power a single HDMI port and that's actually it no fancy outputs this time but we do still have real SNES controller ports compatible with every single SNES accessory outside of the super scope and again with the downgrades where the NT and NT mini had four here we only get two thankfully multi taps works just fine though and that's it aside from power and reset buttons they really simplified the outside this time around so have the internals been cost down too absolutely not we've got the same altera cyclone 5 and all its companion circuitry on the top side of its beautiful PCB programmed again by Kevin Horton aka keV trous the same legend who did the reverse engineering for the analogue NT minis FPGA though he didn't go it alone this whole thing has actually been something of a community effort with input from people like Beauty author of the super-accurate higen emulator intro sound effects by electronic musician square pusher and a shiny new user interface designed by indie developer phil fish yes that phil fish complete with a super slick optional animated intro that randomizes each and every time you power on the console within the menu you'll find a ton of options to customize the experience from adding and controlling the depth of scan lines to enabling more sprites on-screen than the real SNES could handle to adjusting hotkeys audio volume and even the skin of the user interface it allows you to add filters like the previous consoles or remove filtering entirely if you just want those beautiful chunky pixels in all their unaltered glory as for what it's like to actually game on to answer that question I brought in my framemeister to test out an OG Nintendo adapted to HDMI alongside our super NT with an SD to SNES so we could test as many games as possible let's start with compatibility testing analog claims its 100% because they're actually simulating the chips in a real Super Nintendo and from what we've been able to tell they've hit the market dead on believe it or not not only does the Super NT handle edge cases that were only recently discovered and patched in emulators the way they've done it allows them to improve upon the original without sacrificing that compatibility in particular with the sound so after spending some time with it to say that it's a great experience would be a huge understatement it handled literally everything we could throw at it including enhanced msu 1 games with CD audio tracks and FMV the picture is sharper the audio is clearer the input lag is non-existent every box is so thoroughly checked for this little thing that people around the office are already competing for their pick of the sample units with others saying they're just gonna buy one themselves if they miss out which is probably the boat I will be in if you spent any significant amount of your childhood playing Super Nintendo games you want the real experience on modern where this is it I mentioned this already but the sound is one of the best things about the super MT although I would personally like a toggle to put it back to 100% original they won't tell us how they improved things exactly but knowing a little about the super Nintendos audio processor helped us kind of piece it together the SNES mixed together individual sounds like a drum or a guitar to make music or sound effects and these small sounds were usually somewhere between eight and twenty two killers the og Super Nintendo just mixed them together at 32 kilohertz with a Gaussian Gaussian bhooshan Gaussian filter that basically muffled it to hide the resulting noise meanwhile the super NT mixes them at forty four point one kilohertz along with modern cubic or sync filtering so everything sounds much sharper and truer to the artists intent pretty cool stuff there are some dilemmas with the console like this if you're a new collector and want to support the original developers of the games you're playing the only real way to do this is ironically via Virtual Console and the classic series which are our emulators that don't give you the original experience and the only way to get the classic series anyway is on eBay making your purchase less meaningful to developers and more meaningful to opportunistic scalpers and what if you already have some games is it worse to buy unofficial hardware or is it worse to pay scalpers who buy up all the official stuff is it just as bad to download all your games and throw them on to a SD to SNES or a Raspberry Pi for that matter well nope I can't answer that I'm gonna bail hard so anyways then if what you're after is a no-frills easy-to-use experience with full compatibility with all your favorite SNES games and as close to real hardware as possible all while having full compatibility with modern displays there's really no contest this is your go to it's super inexpensive compared to getting a framemeister and potentially modding your SNES it's well-built its feature-rich and it's clearly a labor of love just like your Squarespace

So we've actually been criticized in the past for putting job posting videos up on our YouTube channel Apparently we "won't find the right people there", and it's unprofessional Who cares? "We're hiring" videos have brought us, over the years, Luke, John, Anthony, Alex and James and You know, now that I think about it.. That's a good point! Those guys all totally suck You know what? I'm gonna go post this in the local newspaper instead! No, I'm just kidding (Mind Blown) So, anyway, we're looking for a couple of things this time around. A graphic designer with clothing design aspirations and A part-time Video Editor with some camera experience or, in a perfect world, a single magical unicorn who is able to do both. So the graphic designers responsibility on his or her first day would be hit Ed with the waifu pillow for leaving me to wear this aging WAN hoodie design for the last TWO years. Then, from there we're looking to create like pitch decks for sponsors, Twitter profile banners, and stuff like that so like boring things but also dramatically increase both the quality and variety of our merch offerings And not just like more random stuff with like an LTT logo on it, I mean, we'll do some of that But we want to focus on fully custom stuff that normal people would want to wear so Some familiarity with clothing and merchandise sourcing would actually be a huge plus The position is full-time in Surrey British, Columbia, so you will need a Canadian work permit Please don't waste my time and yours if you don't have one Position number two, Video Editor. So you need to be able to edit videos in the style of LTT, tech quickie, and then potentially a new channel That's right. You heard it here first folks. We might be working on a new channel. Actually we're definitely working on a new channel, otherwise Why would we put up a job posting for a new channel? So you'll find the full details for
submitting  your cover letter resume and portfolio in the video description this position is part-time in Surrey, BC and Again, please don't waste my time and yours if you don't have a Canadian work permit we cannot hire you if you cannot legally work In Canada and in response to your question about working remotely. No. We've tried it. It sucks. We're not doing it. So good luck everyone This video is brought to you by no. I'm just kidding. There's no sponsor. I'm done 
There are literally thousands of imperfect choices for mechanical keyboards out there and You can customize them a little, add some o-rings here, change some key caps there, Luke actually did a guide. Luke: "Welcome to the ultimate Mechanical keyboard guide" but unless you have the know-how to actually build one yourself You're at the mercy of those that do, or are you? What if I told you it didn't have to be like that? What if I told you that there are more options out there than you might have realized what if I told you that? Today's video is brought to you by ifixit. ifixit's pro tech tool kit gives you the tools you need to tackle any electronics repair challenge. visit ifixit.com/linus at the link below and get yours today Linus Singing: "Do you want to build a keyboard use any switches that you like It could be. ahh. ah." Alright, so let's go over what we set out to accomplish here because when Anthony first came to me with this idea he had like these grand visions of programming microcontrollers and soldering diodes using 3d printed or laser-cut chassis and a bunch of other things that are really cool, but This is our first rodeo so we decided to focus on getting one working first So with that in mind then we narrowed our search to parts that can bolt together relatively easily Meaning though that we can expect to pay a premium looking at what's available there's a lot of ten keyless components out there But then even more options for the smaller and simpler 60% layout so we settled on that starting at mechanicalkeyboards.com for some essential supplies Cherry MX brown RGB key switches three choices of beautiful Anodized aluminum cases to put everything into and then a selection of Springs that we can use to actually customize the feel of our switches So this way we could make the caps lock key or the function key more difficult to press Accidentally, and then we could even reduce the actuation force of keys like w,a,s,d Or even the whole alphanumeric set to improve our speed while maintaining that satisfying tactile bump of the Cherry MX brown Like the beauty here whoop is that the sky's the limit for Customizability, but while it's really fun to play around with a bag full of cherry MXs a chassis and a bag of key switches a keyboard Does not make so we are going to need to wire them up now some folks do this manually but a PCB Preferably one that is well documented is much easier not to mention a lot tinier now There are lots of options out there but for our project we turned to banggood where we found not only this nice wooden case actually this thing's really nice and Wrist rest but also Satan no seriously We found the satan GH 60 a fully programmable keyboard PCB that seems to check all the essential boxes It's got macro support and RGB variant And it is widely used in the DIY community as a budget option so with the power of satan and a plate to go over it we started to write I said no soldering for this video So we just really wanted to make that Satan joke so maybe we'll do a follow up later with the Dark Prince GH60 anyway after some more digging for a plug-and-play option we found this on a store called Kbd fans the geek customized GK 64 from semi tech This PCB is pre-built with hot swap terminals, so not only will we not need to solder anything ourselves, we can much more easily pull our key switches if you want to adjust the springs or Replace them altogether and it gets bonus points for using a detachable USB type-c connection and having multiple RGB modes including Check this out you guys this lit AF sound activated mode courtesy of a little microphone built into the keyboard Before you ask that microphone can't be used for sound input and for good reason I mean imagine your clanmates if you put your headset microphone right next to your cherry MX blues, right Anyway, so while we were talking to way over at KBDfans,we also requested his stylish Tina chassis a full set of key caps and stabilizers and another plate to fit our GK 64 which finally completes then our component checklist oh And we also got these which I caught Anthony working on And he assured me was productive, but I will let you guys be the judge All this left now is to put it together and see how well it works um, okay, so let's assemble this thing So we start with what ?screwing down the PCB? Yes, that was relatively straightforward So spacebar Where's the hole I can't do this so that seems to go on that way mm-hmm What'd they do that on the doodad cool? This is fun? All good in hood But it doesn't even sit like evenly like it's bowed up in the middle So you're sure it wouldn't be faster to clip these into here, and then put the whole thing down hmm Yeah, it's probably better to do that. Okay, wait, but there's to know there's some wiggle room. Yeah exactly oh... Yeah, yeah here, let's grab. Let's grab the stiffer one for the spacebar yeah Like a much stiffer one. Okay? Where's 100-meter grams cool? Oh? Okay, cool. Yeah, let's try it I dont think I'd recommend it Oh Wow, it's like. It's like yeah. It feels like it's pushing you away from the table. Okay progress. Let's do a quick light up test Hey Not bad huh all right so now we can put all the key caps on! oh,these aren't labeled or Are they? Well backspace isn't working. O isn't it working How concerned out of ten should be beyond that about that? Here we go and that is one bent ass pin right there bent right over Yeah, I would recommend buying some extras if you're gonna undertake a project like this so everything is tested all in all I'd say that 60% It's gonna take some getting used to you got a super short shift over here your delete key is way down here You don't have function keys obviously, but overall Pretty pleased with the with the end product here. It's compact its programmable It's super portable. We don't have the ability to RGB sync it with you know Asus AURA or Razer synapse or anything but We could change out its case anytime we wanted we can make adjustments to the force of the individual keys I mean, it's fantastic So you might be sitting there thinking gee that sounds great linus does that mean I should do it, too? well that Really depends on how much you value your time And how much you value your money? Not only did this involve about an hour's worth of work not accounting all the research of finding all the parts and ordering them our bulk together approach means that our total cost topped 350 US dollars before shipping or taxes I mean many people already bulk at the idea of a hundred dollar keyboard So this is clearly a deep rabbit hole for the amateur the more adventurous among us could Salvage from old keyboards or even build or 3d print their own cases But there will always be caveats no matter who you are You won't get a warranty by going totally custom, so if you care about that So in the end then while this may not be Hands-down the best mechanical keyboard ever certainly not for the price Nor was it quite as down and dirty DIY as it could have been its uniquely ours and for some people That's gonna be worth it So let us know would you build your own keyboard in the comments below and let us know if you'd like to see more DIY keyboard stuff in the future Maybe next time I'll even let Anthony at the soldering iron blue apron is perfect for those of you out there trying to keep to your New Year's resolutions especially if they were eating healthier and Cooking at home blue apron allows you to create delicious chef inspired recipes at home By delivering all the farm-fresh ingredients you need right to your doorstep in exactly the right proportions No waste and no trips to the grocery Store they offer two types of plans the two-person plan and the family plan and there are eight Recipes to choose from each week now instead of six so you can pick any combination you'd like and they're always adding new dishes to the menu blue apron recipes are delivered in a Refrigerated box so the ingredients will stay fresh even if you're not at home, and they ship to most of the USA There's no commitment you can skip or cancel the service at any time and prices starting as low as $8.99 per serving check it out at the link in the video description And the first 100 people to sign up will get 30 bucks off their first blue apron order So thanks for watching guys if this video sucked Do you know what to do?

so recently we created a two-in-one machine for twitch streamers using on raid and virtualization to capitalize on the hike or count of Intel's Core i9 processors and the results got us wondering well just what other practical applications could such a set up have also you guys were wondering just how we got the whole thing working so thanks to Intel sponsoring this follow-up project we are about to boldly go where very few men have gone before and create a triple headed vr gaming set up with the whole thing running off of one tower and actually one CPU [Music] as you probably know vr gaming is a demanding workload for both your CPU and your GPU so when we set out to put together a system that could not only run triple AVR titles like Star Trek bridge crew but actually handle three instances concurrently we knew we were gonna need the best of the best so we'll start with the CPU if we were running a single instance of bridge crew a modern processor like an intel core i7 8700 k would be a great choice but since we're running free and we need a couple of course left over for our hypervisor we chose the Intel Core I 979 60 X so you can actually see with all three of our gaming rigs running at about 70 to 90 percent utilization this CPU is still capable of running at nearly 4 gigahertz which means no dropped frames in our game due to CPU bottlenecks afraid to touch this thing too hard it's a little fragile anyway 4 ran we went with 64 gigs of 32 hundred megahertz g.skill Trident ddr4 in a quad channel configuration and that last bit is important because it allows us to give 16 gigs of memory to each of our gaming rigs with some left over and while very few desktop workloads benefit from quad channel memory when three demanding workloads are hitting it at once well it's a lot more important than usual to have all the bandwidth you can get now for our graphics cards we actually ended up with a mixture of different Nvidia V are capable cards ranging from the gtx 1070 all the way up to the titan XP now the point we were trying to make here using different cards is that as long as we have enough CPU and memory resources and they're above a certain threshold it actually doesn't matter what mixture of video cards we use now the motherboard on the other hand was a really important piece of the puzzle you can't always count on virtualization features to be implemented correctly in the UEFI BIOS so we turned to the same asus prime x2 99 deluxe from our gaming and streaming combo machine now let's look at some special pieces that we needed for this config one of the limitations of KVM the underlying virtualization tech the done raid uses is that if you pass a USB device through to a virtual machine like say for example a mouse it won't be hot pluggable by default and if you have more than one of the same peripheral like all of our vibes they would all have to be passed through to the same VM which obviously wouldn't have worked very well for our demo of three people running their own discrete copies of the game in multiplayer mode fortunately this guy right here this thing exists it's a single USB PCIe expansion card that has four discrete controller chips on it so that means each of them can be passed through to a separate VM without any performance bottlenecking then this is cool when you pass the whole controller through to a VM you also get hot-plug support so we just used a few cheap hubs and now each of our VMs can have multiple USB devices all of which are hot pluggable next up is another sort of KVM but this one has nothing to do with virtualization this right here is the level one tax for port KVM switch it is super expensive at over 300 US dollars but it's DisplayPort 1.2 meaning that it is 4k 60 Hertz compatible and apparently it even works with free sync and gsync if both your connected monitor and graphics part support them now it wasn't strictly speaking necessary but it allowed us to use a single monitor keyboard and mouse to quickly switch between all of our virtual machines for configuration using this console right here finally we've got our handy dandy blinders here see if one vive headset can see both its own lighthouses and another one you are gonna have a bad time and then we had some weird timeout issues with our rifts even on a certified USB controller so we just put up these cloths now we can walk you guys through the steps required to set up a configuration like this first we need to land in the unread webui where we'll assign an SSD cache to run our VMs off of and hey did I mention before we've got four cores and 16 gigs of ram left 4 unread well we can use 60 terabytes worth of Seagate's 12 terabyte iron wolf pros and throw those in an on Radar a where they can safely store personal data off the public cloud or even serve up transcoded media files via plex then what we're gonna do is jump into the VMS tab where we need to configure our basic VMs set up pass-through for our graphics cards this is kind of the special unrated sauce that allows high performance gaming in VMs and setup pass-through for our USB controllers from there we need some KVM specific drivers for Windows and then it is mostly business as usual keep in mind though that without three discreet sound cards you'll be relying on the HDMI audio built into your graphics card or in our case the USB audio device built into your VR headset oh and here's a special headache we got to experience you see we had to fit three dual slot video cards and the USB card into a six slot motherboard now normally on raid needs an additional video card for itself bringing the total card count to more than the board physically has so we solved that issue by grabbing the primary cards BIOS modifying it and then presenting that BIOS to unweight as if it was an actual card yay virtual graphics card for a mainstream board with onboard graphics this step would probably be unnecessary but with a CPU that fits to a mainstream board this kind of performance wouldn't be possible so this was the most elegant workaround that we could find and quite honestly it's pretty darn elegant every one of our VMs is capable of delivering a smooth steady vr gaming experience concurrently and this is all thanks to the recent drop in price not to mention increase in clock speeds of high core count desktop CPUs and virtualization technology so a huge thanks to Intel for sponsoring this demo and the folks are done RAID for helping us out whenever we got stuck John you rock and Tom and Eric you guys are cool too

everyone's been waiting even very famous celebrities for the results of the one-year airflow test yes my friends we are still running them and we are doing the video but there's only one small problem Luke doesn't work here anymore to do the stunning conclusion so we're gonna have to walk all the way over to floatplane media's office and get Luke to help me check out which one worked or if they'll didn't work brought to you by tunnel bear tunnel valve leaves the Internet should be more open and private try it out for free at tunnel bear comm /l tt will have that linked below [Music] I actually had very little involvement in this project what is going on here well there's any OD and in between II like there was before OD has more fans blowing out I think all the fans blowing out any has all the fans blowing in and in between E is fairly balanced they have all been running for over a year behind the old set yeah but then we built this mezzanine that we're standing in and then we tore down that set so once the mezzanine was done and before the set got torn down they got moved up here to the office but they were out in the warehouse under the worst possible conditions literally construction zone let's not entirely dismiss the possibility that we will learn something today even if what we learn is that were idiots and we don't know how to perform a controlled experiment so which one is supposed to be the worst by the conventional wisdom I think most people think that all in is the worst okay so let's get the other ones no wait we bleep no no all out is supposed to be the worst but all in these are these are the top and Packers this is supposed to be the bad one all out and then it sucks air into the crevices yes okay okay so this is the one we start with so the outside isn't really something to judge because they would have all had a bunch of dust settle on the top and it's not that terrible I mean like I'm gonna do one streak on the power supply I mean it's not great not great having a look at our fan though really makes me wonder how it is that people get their computers disgusting enough to be like gummed up well how there's it there's cobwebs that bottom filter was definitely doing something and this is OD this is OD so that means this one it wasn't pulling through a filter he should have been sucking all the air in from elsewhere so this is another thing we have to be careful with this this is another thing where it's fairly case-specific because a lot of cases don't have that huge filtered mesh on the bottom so you can also see here that with the audi case we've actually got a lot of dust build up here and you can assume that for every bit of dust on this yeah more got pulled in yeah actually this is a good thing they're both sort of a good thing but it's a good thing to see so our graphics card does have a dust bunny inside it yeah so that's some buildup so our CPU is good yeah so on the top was good so it actually didn't suck that much in because they're just blasting everything else yes so the CPU is like sheltered almost because everything around it was like no get out yeah so you can actually you can see some dust streaks on these cable management holes and then but not much I bet you the graphics card was breathing through here and through here how explains clean because it's through a filter actually that area of the filter is pretty concentrated any dust that's caught in this filter was already in the computer okay interesting so that's all pulled from inside and these fans have a fair amount of buildup in the matcha tea I think the main takeaway with this one is that even in a construction zone where clearly there was a lot of dusty buildup on top most of your dust is coming into your case from the bottom so if you put your computer on the ground because we didn't have fans blowing out of the bottom that's right yeah you might have a bad time when do the other extreme let's do the test is still bad we're already learning something hold on this is the one that is sucking everything in this is everything in so theoretically yeah this isn't gonna be good either well no okay let's start with the bottom okay interesting that's weird the power supply area doesn't have much dust no it doesn't because the air is blowing out of here getting filtered and then being sucked into here there's two fans like hold on there's one two three four five fans worth of pressure going out of here this effectively has a skirt around oh yeah okay so there's dust on this but it's not on the inside it's on the top yeah it's definitely on the top that's so weird okay power supply is completely clean yeah how interesting that is interesting see we are learning things I did not see this one coming that is okay that's cooler than I expected I will definitely give it that well I want to see the Franco good it's filtering stuff this is telling us that this case is intake system is like not that great because these are about as dust this is the other one this stuff is on the outside cuz that's pulling through that makes sense oh just like wow way when you did that like and it's loose which is interesting so our graphics card has no doubt that's a little more than earlier than last time definitely more dust just lying CPU okay there's also definitely more dust on the back Ben C female office so GPU is a little bit better but our supply is better this case does not have filters on the top of the back so you don't get to experience so the main takeaway from this one is that more airflow right around an area is gonna give you a much much higher concentration of dust and that again poor planning is ultimately what's gonna kill you yeah is the graphics card better or worse on this one oh it's waivers way worse so the GPU over there had to breathe in through this which was very apparent yeah and it breathed in junkie dusty yeah that's right this one is actually breathing good air but that's the only piece and the tars busting I wouldn't have thought that having a filtered fan like blowing towards the graphics card would affect the movement of the air inside like the currents inside enough to be the difference okay so this is sort of the like the recommended way so it's neither one extreme nor the other most people would go with a setup similar to this so it's important to note that even though we've actually got four fans pulling in and two going out the ones coming in are filtered so these filtered ones coming in should have much less airflow than the non-filtered ones going out so right off the bat our CPU is pretty good I would say almost us Wow almost as good but not quite there is still no not quite at all there's definitely still noticeable dust and that one was like actually clean so this one what's interesting is that even though it's using a poor method of keeping dust out of your system what it does do is it focuses all the dusts that it does pull in on the bottom and then sucked it all through that filter for this particular case and here a bit yeah and it's gonna change with every case okay should we have a look at the filters yeah okay so as expected this one doesn't have an air curtain around it so the power supply does draw air through the filter filter didn't even stop everything don't filter didn't stop everything at all and there's a lot of customers this is easily the most concentrated wow there's like hairs there's like strands oh okay there's a little bit of that on any yeah that makes sense because these are pulling in right yeah yeah and like it plumed okay so that's as expected so no dust bunny in the GPU CPU fan mostly cleared this one had more fans and got slightly more total dust which kind of makes sense and the filters are slightly more clogged which makes sense but overall I'd say it's probably more balanced the CPU got hit but not as hard as it did on the really bad CPU case yeah but not as good as it did the other time as well that much is this one yeah the in turn so it ended up being in between which it's kind of what we were aiming for we just didn't know is actually gonna work that way here you go then the main takeaways are on your intake fans you want to have filtered air to the greatest degree possible and the more air flow you have the more dusty buildup you are ultimately going to have yeah I think a balanced approach is good but you're gonna have to think about your particular case your particular like if you're on the floor then one of the big things we learned is you want a bunch of exhaust on the floor yeah to keep dust away from your system it actually works yeah yeah and then the other big takeaway is that fresh books is the small business accounting solution for well small business owners and freelancers so whether you're running a plumbing business or you're running a house-painting business or dust management doing cleaning

welcome to our og reboot episode 1 our first winner here is Josh he had a very simple request I mean especially in retrospect it seems like this is the kind of thing that should be pretty doable he wanted a white and blue gaming computer and we got the gaming computer we've got the ROG gtx 980ti we got the core i7 7700 k we got water cooling up the bananas but the case is black this is my peace offering can you live with a balls-to-the-wall gaming computer that's not white and that I dropped pieces of I think so good let's get started then [Music] [Applause] [Music] the asus rog Strix 1080 TI features RS ink RGB lighting with a plethora of colors and the ability to synchronize effects across the ecosystem of our sync enabled products learn more at the link below your video pretty short pretty sweet had one of my friends help me write a script and then grab my sister and said hey will you help me with this that's a little awkward not like that [Music] have you ever gamed on a machine of the caliber of what we're building today never ha see I get so disconnected from this stuff sometimes I just like kind of take it for granted so then have you ever built a computer before no I should know that because the last desktop you had was what 10 years ago you know you don't even have a desktop we did at one point but I might have broken it oh that's a little awkward are you gonna break the one I build today no not at all so even just a little bit broken nope let's try okay so you got you had a desktop but we're talking it was like a Pentium 4 or something is ancient yeah okay got it yeah oh I feel old we're off to a good start okay so how much of the building do you want to do versus how much of the building do you want to be like like when I would help my dad with carpentry I'd like to do at least a good part of it okay a good part of it alright I'll pick the best part okay so the best part here hold this screwdriver and hand it to me when I'm ready for it so we're gonna open up our power supply silver box right there yes I know it's not it's not light or blue that's okay like it's 80-plus titanium efficiency which is like bananas bananas bananas are good it's 30 they have lots of potassium yeah [Music] we have these also not white and blue cables from cable mud but that don't look really good mori it's okay I don't really care at all that there's no white case I just think it's funny that Linus takes it so personally that there's no white case I don't know if I can work under these conditions ten points if you can find the motherboard in the massive pile of awesome hardware that you're getting today nice ten points perfect you leveled up it's like the beginning of a game where like you actually don't do anything you just like look in the right direction and it's like 25 XP your level 2 now yeah yeah it's it's like that no see if you installed you can pull that off okay there you go hold on to that if you ever had to it was like let's say you legitimately had something devastating happen to your board like critical functionality like the RGB wasn't working quite right if you send it back to them without that cover and the pins get damaged now that's physical damage its bricked okay do you want me to do that right now sure okay I mean you don't have to I can't force you to do anything you could just leave I could but I won't there you go at first you didn't got it but then you got it yes now you don't got it that is true okay so that looks pretty good so far next stage is we actually move on to the not white but still very good case look I'm showing you how to build the computer I can see it in your eyes you're super disappointed it's not white I'm just getting really tired of how much pressure you're putting on me about the parts not being waiting sorry here I'll stop no pressure but this is the part where you either kill your motherboard or it's fine oh that's stressful no no it's not stressful at all don't worry you know the one funny thing about this though to me is that we didn't choose an rog board for the build Oh white and blue you got this yeah it always does that it's kind of annoying it's like they were determined to have the logo upside down on their water cooler in this case all right well I'd recommend tubes up because then it doesn't run across the graphics card so I usually recommend a pull orientation on a radiator you familiar with push-pull yes the reason for that is that when you have the fans pulling air this way this is really easy to clean you just kind of go like this and you take some cat hair or whatever and you tuck it in the garbage when you turn these around the air goes through this way well now you have to take your fans off let's face it last time you had a desktop with ten years ago this thing could be running for ten years we got to be ready for this stuff okay what matters more to you your precious blue color scheme or cable management I just need to go get something really quick here this completely definitely new h100 IV - that definitely we didn't pull off the shelf because our shipment didn't get here in time which definitely has nothing to do with why your color scheme isn't right definitely isn't missing some of the hardware so I'm definitely not going to go over there and get it fantastic cooling done and without any mishaps whatsoever all right let's do a hard drive oh sorry it's in that box I was just getting this one out of your way he's like wait that was the motherboard I knew that I showed him I knew that yeah it's not going and just force it a little you know just give it the old force it so we've put it right there [Music] nope nope nope I think the white goes better with what's currently inside wow you can't just pick a color without taking a shot at me for us not getting it right you can't even do that and it's time for the graphics card so naturally I'm gonna let myself do the honors come on be a man open it with your teeth yes you ready oh and and a CD that's it that's what the highest performance graphics card on the market looks like if you'd be gentle GeForce GTX 10 atti Strix overclocked so I'm gonna get you to unbox your nice cherry IMAX mechanical gaming keyboard your mouse pad your mouse your monitor there you go are you wearing your mousepad yes excellent here we go go ahead press the button oh that's a bad sign no I'm just kidding I didn't turn the thing on your RGB is lighting up so the most important thing about the system is already working which is great so we are going straight for static color blue what you have gotta be kidding me it's ROG everything's red the tablecloths red you just be happy with Reds there we go see I told you this was a white and blue themed build would I ever lie to you Josh never what do you plan to do with your new rig I want to run some games probably will buy rocket League because I love that game I just played at my friend's house is all the time right I also might want to do some video editing and get into that more because I'll have something that can run something other than write a potato okay so color scheme 5 out of 10 performance 11 out of 10 11 out of 10 very good good answer building my first gaming PC was pretty difficult nah it really wasn't it was pretty simple all right well I'm glad and thanks for tuning into our og rig reboot all of you guys out there and a huge thanks to Josh for entering and why am i thanking you a huge you're welcome to Josh for getting this fricking awesome computer courtesy of a soos who else contributed to it Corsair helped us out with it Intel Nvidia helped Seagate all good stuff so uh congrats man enjoy thank you 
let's say for a moment that you're the kind of person who takes cybersecurity super-cereal you use a password manager with multi-factor everything you keep all your programs and operating systems up to date and you're constantly keeping a vigilant eye out phishing attacks that is all really good stuff that we should actually all do but none of it will do you a bit of good if an attacker actually gets your hardware in their hands like physically that is unless you're using a tamper-proof Orwell computer from design shift a PC that needs a password and a fob just to boot up and that apparently will disable itself permanently if we mess with it challenge accepted by the way speaking of challenges this was a challenging Segway to eke a water blocks Phoenix lineup is their next generation high performance all-in-one cooler check it out now at the link in the video description [Music] named for George Orwell every one of these tiny yet shockingly heavy little machines has its own unique encryption key one that is totally unknown even to the manufacturer design shift it's a time rotating RSA 4096 key so that is over 4,000 bits long and what it means is that it is practically impossible to brute force so for reference the largest RSA number that's ever been factored was only 768 bits long and that took hundreds of computers over 2 years to figure out now this encryption key is not stored in main memory or on the self encrypting SSD but rather in a security microcontroller that only exposes it briefly when a user is authenticated like as you're booting up as for how to authenticate well two-factor of course or ball comes with two special key fobs that must be scanned on the machine before you'll even be prompted to enter your numeric password using Orwell's OLED display and only then does the Machine boot up and then you will still need to enter credentials for Windows Ubuntu cubes OS or whatever your fobs use NFC for the initial setup then once they're paired the Java card applet on the fob that's responsible for pairing is actually deleted and from then on the fobs communicate their distance from or well over encrypted low-energy Bluetooth and the machine will actually lock down if you get more than 10 meters away in lockdown mode Orwell's ports that's two five gigabit USB type C's for power and peripherals and a mini HDMI for the display are shut off so no one can plug in their Stuxnet flash drive or boot the computer using an external device and the CPU is put to sleep that is unless the mainboard secure MC use three axis accelerometer and gyroscopes detect movement at which time it will actually be powered completely off forcing a potential hacker to build their lab a around the Machine rather than carrying it away to be prodded at in privacy okay then Linus what if I go around the MCU by freezing it with a spray refrigerant ha well since the MCU also monitors for drastic temperature changes freezing it will actually result in Orwell destroying the encryption key and even if you could freeze the RAM for example which typically retains information for a few seconds after being powered down you'd have a hard time reading anything from it because it is soldered on to the board and going at it the other way isn't an option either the boot sequence is designed to wipe the RAM before post to prevent attackers from somehow inserting code into the memory during boot I mean most of that stuff though is kind of hypothetical anyway because you probably would never get that far the entire system is physically tamper proof and I'm not talking about a handful of pressure sensors that you can just drill holes around and disable no no the entire system in addition to the mainboard MCU and the MCU and the FOB the system is wrapped in a conductive dye shield with multiple pressure switches and a wire mesh barrier this protects against physical ingress and certain side-channel attacks like over-the-air power analysis since no meaningful power leakage will make it through the die shield and if you disturb any of that stuff the encryption key gets Newt and all of this works even without Orwell being plugged in since the main board MCU is onboard battery can actually last for several months now to be clear security features like this have been around for years in some industries but design shifts pitch is that they're delivering Bank level information security for everyone without changing the overall user experience and they're actually mostly there the fobs are a little too bulky right now in my opinion and while they are rechargeable over microUSB they lack a battery indicator light so when they die in your Orwell locks down you're gonna have a bad but once you're logged into Orwell it behaves just like a regular computer as advertised so that's really cool but I still think their audience will end up being somewhat limited the Orwell breezed through our thermal tests staying relatively quiet without throttling but even the top tier model sticks you with a mobile processor eight gigs of RAM and integrated graphics and that's at three times the cost of a similarly Specht tablet computer to be clear that could be considered cheap compared to some of the other options that are out there and there are definitely going to be customers for this tech but I just have to wonder if the next step for design shift has to be a notebook to give extra flexibility to anyone who wants to take his or her secure computing on the road alright then with all that out of the way let's see if we can lose

freshbooks is the number one cloud accounting software custom-built for the way that you want to work for your unrestricted free 30-day trial go to FreshBooks comm slash line of CES and speaking of custom-built for the way you want to work we're back at Silverstone checking out the top five crazy things that we found at their booth that are actually really useful and we're gonna start off with the MSO nine and the MSO nine mini these are MDOT 2 SATA enclosures but not just that they also have a USB 3.1 type-a connector on the edge so to make it yourself you just remove the four screws on the back that's on the side with the switch on it for your USB type a connector open it up flip it over and then inside the standard MSO nine you can fit at 22:40 to a twenty two sixty or a 20 to 80 sized MDOT to SATA drive and in the smaller MSO nine mini you can fit a twenty to forty two then just close it back up and you have your own awesome super fast ten gigabit per second flash drive that you can then convert later on to be a system drive or whatever else you want moving on we've got probably my favorite thing here and it's the third time that's been released and it's still probably my favorite thing here just because it's so kind of hilariously awesome and that's their remote starter kit for your PC this time it has a speaker mounted to it so when you press the power button or reset button from across the room you have to hear that your computer turned on it doesn't seem like immediately you might need that functionality but when you can't see the computer necessarily it's actually pretty freaking cool when you plug it into your motherboard for the power switch and reset switch headers it also has break offs I don't know an Escalade what to call them pass throughs that you can plug your standard power button and reset button on your case into so don't lose any of that functionality either I think this is actually pretty damn cool and it plugs in through the PCIe 1x slot on your motherboard next up we've just got an expansion card that you can mount an nvme m2 SSD into which is really cool because it's so small if you notice there's no even mounting bracket to go on the outside of the case it's also really short if you have a tiny little builds that you need to make and you do have an available 16x slot you can drop this in here get another drive don't have to worry about clearance on top of it and don't have to worry about mounting it on the back pretty cool then we have there tpo 2 m2 link it for MDOT two SSDs I know a lot of this stuff as MDOT to based this I'm mainly calling out just because it's kind of funny they added an actual physical heat sink into the box because people were too sketched out with their previous version that actually worked better but don't worry that's all previous stuff is still included in here if you've been following the news on MDOT - cooling stuff these heat sinks that go on the top of them don't accomplish a ton but people love them because they look like they'll accomplish a ton it still has the thermal pad which can thermally conduct from the MDOT 2 drives controller mainly down into a mainboard or whatever it's actually mounted on which is actually far more effective so you've got the peace of mind over the piece of metal that goes on top and you've got the effectiveness of a thermal pad that goes on the bottom and then just in case your love for em to just absolutely cannot be satiated we have another way to mount them all the way from 20 to 40 to 220 to 110 those really long m2 drives this will convert them to SATA so you can have 4 SATA plugs only takes one SATA power which is actually pretty cool as well and you can have way more m2 in your system just in case you've populated all the m2 on your board and you've populated all the PCIe lanes you can possibly plug m2 into you've done everything else and you still want more drives you can have four of them mounted into a three and a half inch drive bay and speaking of MDOT - and other things that we just can't get enough of sponsor spots thank you - fresh books for sponsoring this video you can use they're easy tools to create invoices in less than 30 seconds you can even view if people have seen your invoices or not so you can check in with them and make sure that they're actually going to pay you which is a pretty important process of running a business you can focus on things like doing your job and pushing forward in your company instead of just doing paperwork which can be frustrating and annoying and speaking of less paperwork you can also accept credit cards through their online platform which is helpful as well if you want to check it out for your free unrestricted 30-day trial code FreshBooks comm slash line of CES if you liked the video like it if you dislike the video dislike it other than that stay subscribed we'll see all the rest of our CES 2018 content and everything beyond that as well see you next time 
[Music] excited we have great topics this week HDMI 2.1 is here that's actually really cool every single time a display cable gets updated I'm just excited it's a good thing it's like it's gonna be like more resolutions yeah and master colors and faster oh yeah right refresh rates good everything just gets better also China is using DJI drones to spy on the US rumor alleged lamer alleged well allegedly yep yeah EA Sports UFC threes egregious implementation of micro transactions so bad we'll be talking about that and finally our former employer NCIX dot-com bankrupt okay do you think I can roll the intro and adjust the tilt of the camera at the same time you got three okay two one go he's off he's gone around the table he's grabbed a lever twisting the knob oh the knobs broken off he's having some issues you might have to go get a wrench the intro is still going oh he's trying to turn the camera anyways and use route oh I have to sit up I have to do an ad thing though dragging the ad in this place thank you savage jerky Thank You spectrum Thank You Marcille my side my side Oh French yeah someone with a French name and I would know oh speaking French in really well though hdmi 2.1 yeah sure are supposed to buy sylvester silver do you mind if I have the right I was ten this is supposed to buy silver dracky on the forum and the original article here is from engadget.com let's go ahead and pull that baby up boom hdmi two point one is here with support for 10k and dynamic HDR support and it is backwards compatible with previous hdmi specifications that 10k by the way pretty weird 10k so-so 10k it looks like is gonna be more like wide 8k yeah except that that still makes it 10k yes because the way that we define resolutions because average you know Joe can say okay nothing against people named Joe kills just average Jeff consumer yeah can't handle two numbers yes okay so that's why resolutions are just something K now has to be a maximum of three characters or else you've lost them that's right before it's probably pushing it that's why swear words usually cap it for you can't go beyond there okay it's kind of a thing how interesting um so be okay here hold on back to this back to this chart that we're looking at over on Engadget here so this is this is interesting because back in the day we had Full HD and that was everyone we didn't really know that as full HD outside of like you know like yeah I mean 1920 by 1080 I think we called it 1080p back then and then Full HD was no no we didn't know what is Full HD but that was kind of like used some people inside enemy P Full HD yeah because we called it Full HD because of all the BS marketing that went on around 7:00 720 which was called HD HD okay is complete and then 4k was like okay it's I get the four so it's like four times this and it's also about 4000 pixels wide but then okay so this 5k this is interesting we've got about 5,000 pixels wide which makes sense that's consistent with the 4k naming oh it's something a lot of people don't know is that there was actually a 2k standard yeah so it's 2048 by 1080 if I recall correctly but that was only a dcpip cinema standard that wasn't actually a consumer standard and then everything got really confused with 4k because this resolution 3840 by 2160 is technically UHD Ultra HD it is not 4k 4k should be 4096 by 2160 because it would be 4 times 2k but then we weren't sure if we were using consumer nomenclature or if we were using a professional nomenclature and then the 5k thing I don't know I don't know what the hell that is because that's like widescreen 4k that's not 5 K because 5 K the only 5 K devices that exist are the Apple display on the iMac and LG's 5k display that's also for Macs and then 8 K is 4 times 4k but actually this is 4 times UHD which is 4 times Full HD so the decays never meant anything in the first place and also so 7680 is like dangerously not that close to 8,000 at this point and then 10k is now apparently four times five K at a different aspect ratio than eight K for K full-hd you know what know that was probably horrible sorry I'm sorry sorry but I I have to express my frustration to numbers is not that hard we've been doing it since you know 640 by 480 it was good enough for me it's good enough for the next generation I hate this I hate everything about it except that with new HDMI we can run high resolution and I actually am excited to see ultra wide TVs the fact that these standards are making it into the HDMI specification means you're gonna see choices like this anytime you go down a clip there's one that's really high on reddit right now anytime you see a clip of horizon zero dawn that's an ultra wide it's like oh that's probably how that game supposed to be played TV's apparently 480p was first gen HD what was that yeah HD CRTs I think they could be like 480 progressive or something or something something I can't remember the HD term has been it's been bastardized yeah there's a swear word that's not four letters yes someone in the twitch chat informed me of that yeah I said usual I mean we could have thought of a couple I'm sure I think I said you because there are some compound swear words that are definitely me and four letters so anyways there's a bunch of other cool stuff forty-eight gigabit per second that's pretty sick 4k at 120 Hertz that's actually a lot more important to me than 10k yes 8k at 60 Hertz that's pretty sweet I guess personally I'm really not that sold on above 4k at this point for yeah but that 4k at 120 is like that's pretty sweet I mean 8k 60 Hertz would be great for like a gigantic projector I guess dynamic HDR variable refresh rate yes finally oh man when I'm surprised Sony and Microsoft haven't been pushing harder for variable refresh rate because it would mask so many of the FPS dips that you know in a good way in a good way yeah like actually like Mask puts a potentially negative term yes that's true yeah but it is masking yeah but like it would it would it would look a lot better Auto low latency mode so that's cool contextual anti-aliasing removing jaggies without noticeable blur that sounds like if they get it right it'll be great and if they don't then it won't and sub 1 millisecond leg although that'll be up to the TV makers in terms of how they want to implement that and how little lag there actually is because they are constantly dinking around with the signal trying to do whatever it is that they're trying to wish they wouldn't do yeah every time that I even think about maybe looking into a TV which I don't I haven't I've never technically bought a TV so I mean like if someone asks me or whatever else I end up just being like I wish I could just buy a ginormous monitor because I don't even exist now yeah like can you get like 60-inch 65 inch monitors no I think the biggest that's what I'm talking about she has a 42 because like not only do I not want this stuff that's on the TV right TV but like I'm in the tuner it makes it worse it's not like oh that's not a benefit it's like no I really really wish that wasn't there I would pay the same price just please take it off right it's so annoying I've got people asking me what's up with the I just een thing so I went down there hooked her up with a sick 150 terabyte storage server in pink and white yeah it's sweet it looks really clean it's super cool and then while I was down there I actually impromptu shot a studio tour of her place because I actually didn't take a camera print this is kind of a funny story so the original plan was for me to take a camera person down and I was gonna stay down for like two or three days and I was gonna hang out with Jason and do cuz he's actually working I don't want to say what he's working on cuz his might still be top secret but it's a really cool build it's like sort of a collab except I don't need to be there so I don't need to be there for that anymore so we shortened my trip and then the other reason that I was going to take a shooter was that I was probably gonna do some kind of video for our channel with Justine and then I was like you know what forget it I just need to do a short trip because I've been traveling so much lately and you know what I don't know if we're gonna have time in one day to do the video for her channel and one for mine don't worry about it she already came up and she did a a guest appearance for us another thing that's never coming in I think that it'll come out um forget it I'm not gonna shoot a video and then what's funny is Yvonne booked a room with two beds just in case I like changed my mind at the last second and took a shoot here but I didn't but then I got to Justine's place and I was like this place is amazing this place is unbelievable and so what I did was I actually borrowed her shooter and then just got the clips off the SD card back here and it's actually being edited right now nice you are gonna be blown away and this is from the same person who just did a deadmau5 studio tour her place is unbelievable it's incredible really cool yeah I'm stoked I want one spoiling yes she probably has literally 50 Xbox one controllers literally what literally okay one more spoiler yeah literally every amiibo literally like properly using that term every single one literally what the Hat literally actually literally oh my god that's so many amiibos she is a way bigger nerd than I gave her credit for there's a few I haven't been able to get not collecting that many to be very clear I have like four I've wanted that I can't get yeah so her place was super cool and I was really excited too that's pretty cool yeah the entire chai is just like literally literally I found something that I thought okay you know what forget it that we'll get to it in the video okay what were we talking about we were technically on HDMI but I think we passed on oh yeah in between things and we're maybe doing DJs should we do flip lay oh let's do DJ I first yeah DJ I wow so this is supposed to by WM groom a K on the forum and actually we're going with our forum for the source of this article here because apparently this was a really epic post oh no no Engadget is the original source you always pull that up if it ever goes it'll go it'll go it'll go I got posted in the twitch oh there we go alright Homeland Security claims that DJI drones are spying for China and it released a memo detailing what it believes to be DJ eyes main targets wow that is like some pretty serious business accusation going on so this is a memo from the Los Angeles office of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Bureau alleging that the data captured from DJI drone customers in the u.s. is being provided to the Chinese government and the memo originally in August says that and there's a quote with moderate confidence the Chinese based company DJI science and technology is providing us critical infrastructure and law enforcement data to the Chinese government the information is based on open source reporting and a reliable source within the unmanned aerial systems industry with first and second hand access so they conclude and this is more quotes that it assesses with high confidence the critical infrastructure and law enforcement entities using DJI systems are collecting sensitive intelligence that the Chinese government would use to conduct physical or cyber attacks against the United States and its population yeah so DJI appears to be targeting users with the ability to disrupt critical infrastructure railroads utilities companies that provide drinking water weapons storage facilities DJ eyes statement though to be clear this is all alleged DJI statement says that the memo was based on clearly false and misleading claims shortly after however DJI released a local data mode which allows users to cut off drones from all internet activity which they probably what is my drone you do and they have had no clue like actually in terms of reporting like camera and telemetry data yeah especially when I'm recording like other than when I'm performing a firmware update yeah or I couldn't actually only be down I could see it reporting something like if I'm flying in a no-fly zone like that kind of stuffs coming but again that shouldn't be going to a foreign government that's for sure that should be going to one that has jurisdiction over the area that I am flying you have to would you have to register your drone or something now right so that should be like when you register your drone they like get a key or something yep Wow pretty brutal so now the ice memo did focus on the drones used by companies and institutions not the drones flown by hobbyists so I don't know if you necessarily have to stop you know hovering your drone in the bedroom to film yourself making a sex tape or whatever I wouldn't recommend that either either way you have blades yeah you know blades and penises not a good combination unless you don't want to have kids anymore like me but there's better ways to do that yeah yeah oh speaking of which I know you wanted to talk about stuff that's on floatplane it's hilarious okay it's actually so funny I can't even one of teryn scenes in this is so golden go like you know that yeah oh my okay so oh my good stuff that's on floatplane right now you guys join the club it's cool all the cool kids are there we've got case made of radiators literally human owned it's out literally a case made of radiators literally it look at it literally case made of radiators okay achieving the ultimate 4k experience the first-ever nvidia sponsored linus techniques video of all time literally I hope I hope talk comment on this threat I haven't looked yet isn't video shows will see that I hope so too yeah there's no way it won't be a Terran hosted a video recently on the elgato stream deck I have so many problems with that thing I'm watching this video yet but we'll see um let's see what else we got here we've got some exclusive stuff we toured the server room that was pretty cool well where's the Chum super fun one uh-oh it's coming it's coming oh that's already up on YouTube treyton 700 super powerful super thin gaming laptop very cool and there it is cruel pregnancy prank gone wrong it's amazing how many people are giving us crap about that gone wrong in the title I would hope it's fairly obvious that that like naming scheme is is played out at this point and that anyone doing it now when people are still really doing almost 2018 exactly anyone doing it now is clearly just being ironic its tongue-in-cheek it's just it's silly we all know it's dumb gone sexual gone wrong I don't think we've done a prank in a while yeah so it's kind of a show back to like when YouTube used to be prank - prank - basically yeah like I just I there were a couple people who seemed legit upset about it no no it's just it's it's a joke it's just a it's just a joke bro it's just a joke joke bro it's just a joke um that was the worst in all seriousness this wasn't a very funny joke it was hilarious as an external person so there it is a it is a - prank video yeah so should I should I say you know else know what the first one is that one's right at the beginning okay okay so the first prank is when Yvonne got pregnant with our third she and I got together and we were talking about how guys are not that observant like women can tell that each other are pregnant like basically immediately I don't know how they do it it's like they can smell it on each other or something yeah okay well I'll keep doing this so women can tell right away and I was like no there's no way guys would notice like that's why we never asked like we never bring it up because we can't tell the difference between like eight months pregnant and fat and you don't want to run that risk because you're like there's no way to win right and she was like no they'll be able to tell I was like they will not be able to tell and they certainly won't say anything and so she and I kind of made a little bet I was like they won't be able to tell even if and they'll think that it's me being mean if I'm like constantly going after you about how you're getting fat there's they won't be able to tell they'll just be like Linus is an ass they will not figure out that you're actually pregnant and yesterday that while he's being an ass to his wife who is also an employee of the company that we all work at he's also everyone's boss yep yep if we can dynamic and this is great I would ask people like do you think do you think he founds getting fat meanwhile she has actually gained 15 pounds because she is pregnant they'd be like oh no anyway there's actually a part two to the prank that is not funny at all but no it's Ashley Lillian it's a good video though sign up for floatplane having having the second parts not funny though having nothing to do with it it is hilarious but like there's certain points of time where I was like oh this is so this is getting bad there you go there you go guys go sign up for Flo plain one week early access ish it's not always a week but it's like definitely early access also beautiful videos with top-tier audio quality top-tier audience one of the rock that out there all right speaking of top-tier quality why don't we talk about sc2 mitches post on the forum the original article here is from astute gaming a site that I've never heard of by neither but sure one there you go and the headline here whoa whoa oh the headline oh EA Sports UFC three the single most egregious implementation of microtransactions to date so bad whoa have you read any but this at all you know my above all this is this is not my deal I'm not a UFC guy I'm not an EA Sports guy and I rarely even have time for gaming and I definitely don't pay for micro transactions so I tend to pretty much ignore them wherever they exist so it offends me probably less than other people because this is a game I was never gonna play from a company whose game I was never going to I still offend you okay hit me reasons why I should still friend you know run run through what it is okay country what it is right on top every single technique ability fighter stat roll all of it is in kwatak yeah is entirely acquired and upgraded through a loop box system okay where's things you can't actually like buy a fighter pressing the square button apparently we're going for PlayStation here pressing a square button to throw a punch at an opponent the simplest and most obvious mechanic in an MMA game will do more damage if players have paid money in an online PvP game it will do more damage if players have paid money sogood microtransactions are also the only means of acquiring perks and booths perks are powerful abilities that can be equipped for a small number of fights before expiring and boosts are temporary enhancements that offer endurance boosts and durability bonuses meaning you can fight longer you can take less damage and you can hit harder which is literally the entire game boom so good so basically EA is saying that UFC gamer fans are just endless like like money teats that they can suck on pretty much does that sounded like about what ei apparently thinks so yeah they're their audience here and you know what the interesting thing is when when we when we rolled out the keep on digging shirt that was because of Ubisoft I know but they've like taking turns well yeah cuz EA was like always crap like the keep on digging was only relevant because Ubisoft scrapped and this was like kind of a new thing like EA I mean when was the last time oh no cuz I remember like at that time we did actually have some positive EA liens yeah so they've switched and like like Ubisoft is not doing everything right right now yeah there's some extremely valid complaints to be made about certain games of there's like for honor but they also launched as a south park game South Park game was very fun it's quite a long game lots of content in it I haven't heard many people complaining about that all the negative reviews that I've seen on Steam because there's quite a few of them are people going why the heck do I need you play that's not a new problem that's a consistent that's been a problem it is a dumb problem but is existed for a long time I should play it did that just come out fairly recently there's nothing like stick of truth right it's extremely similar to country I'll take basically the same game yeah it's just a different story yeah like like the overworld is essentially identical well yeah I mean so yeah but like even town in Colorado what do you want yeah I don't know new town in Colorado and you can't redo the art style because it's South Park so like it's it's like the same thing and you do the same thing where you go from like house to house which you know me so many house yeah yeah but like it is a very good game it's funny yeah okay they said it as a completely different combat system I don't even remember the previous one but yeah it's not it's not like super next level or anything sure I would recommend playing it on as heart of the difficulties is yeah I will yeah stick of truth is pretty easy yeah okay cool like it's it's what do we even say about this there's like nothing to say you can't defend it you know like you can't even play devil's advocate and be like oh well you know maybe if nope not at all and like this is this this ties in with there's battlefront issues going on right now while that's going on they somehow thought it was okay to throw it beta keys for this game with this already implemented and this being the style they take the microtransactions out of battlefront 2 and then what just assume that everyone's gonna be super ok with UFC like a different target audience they're not even gonna bring it up I don't think this can be what is you haven't told me any other time ok where were you going mom you just got Loki owned I did what you gotta preface that a little bit you sent them 16 minutes ago ok this is not fair yes I did I did okay okay sorry one moment okay well in the meantime um I'm gonna I'm gonna go I'm gonna they look pretty good mom we actually they do it they look pretty good hi I hope you have a good trip okay bye me too yeah no problem oh dear okay so let's jump into our sponsors sponsor number one spectrum which glasses do you want today oh I'll just go straight up with these so spectrum staring at a monitor all day can be hard on your eyes overtime and spectrum is an affordable solution to help you keep from your eyes getting fatigued there are software solutions to reducing the amount of blue light that goes from your monitor into your eyes like flex and Twilight but they don't give you the same kind of filtering that an actual piece of glass or two pieces if you have two eyes would they have many features including that they are stylish they you would well yeah that's what they do yeah no you wait you know what they do right yeah yeah okay so basically they're like a yellow tinted let oh actually you know what I never noticed this before there was a there was a pair that I was wearing years ago like these yellow glasses are not an entirely new concept there was a pair of was wearing years ago and the reason I stopped using it was because even though I did find that it was more comfortable over the course of the day was it had a slight magnification on it spectrum has absolutely nailed this no magnification whatsoever at least on this particular pair well I don't notice any on this one either so that's pretty nice anyway it's high-quality product one-year warranty and extremely durable and they have very low color distortions so they're trying to block the high-energy blue light while keeping other colors as similar as possible so you check them out at spectrum loops you can check them out in spectrum glasses comm slash collection slash prospects and you can get 10% off using offer code Linus not bad I'm gonna keep playing these yeah next up we've got Oh was this this has happened a handful of times and people always like people always go tinfoil hat on this kind of stuff when it happens but have you said did you watch our video about this the answer ones but no I didn't interesting okay so this has happened a handful of times where we with no no intention of actually ever working together we've done a review of a product in this case it was the M cable from marsai a product that claims to improve the image quality of a device that it's attached to I didn't see this video okay so many sewing off please explain it's over a hundred dollars okay so one hundred and fifty bucks okay for an EM cable yeah and what they claim well you can see what they play I'm reserving judgment because big sponsors excellent graphics rejuvenation advanced contextual anti-aliasing contrast and detail enhancement leg free real-time processing and an automatic movie mode they claim and it works so inside the cable see how there's a USB connection yes it it's it it is actually a powered signal processor and I saw on the teeth on the TV end of the cable is like huge yep so so it actually works particularly well for certain applications one of which is anime so I think you're holding the cinema edition yeah does a great job of like low resolution anime collections you got a bunch of like 480p anime it cleans up a lot of the lines a lot of bandana about 2006 Warcraft video I got no that so there's a limit to the tech so we went oh oh we hooked it up with like original unreal it looked really good ah the m cable cinema is actually apparently also great for streaming content that isn't something that we tested extensively in ours but we did take a look at a lot of downsampled content and it managed up to do a really good job you guys can't see it because it's way too small but in this corner and I'm sure if you go to their website which is probably on green yes I my Sai ink.com it shows that there's like a processor and stuff going on with yeah the cable sub 1 millisecond leg we did not notice any discernible lag even in like uh you know CRT optimize the games like Super Mario World it's pretty awesome and it's even supports frame rates up to 1080p 120 so you can legitimately game on the gaming Edition here and yeah you guys you guys should probably check it out though the best use cases we found for it we're older consoles but not too old so you don't want something like an S but something like an n64 PlayStation PlayStation amazing sense actually yeah you can clean up the quality of an affair bit cuz to be fair an S is already pretty clean old anime yeah um streamed video I'm sorry oh that's where I got confused by strange video I don't necessarily mean live streaming although it would help with that but any kind of Internet video where it's like pretty good but a little bit of tidy up would probably not be a bad idea it's great for that guess what VR lots of people are using it for VR because the displays are low resolution and it cleans up the image a little bit yeah and apparently the results are fantastic though I actually haven't tried that personally yet let me say it's interesting how like a type of content is specifically better that actually makes sense so check them out at MRSA inc.com this is one of those situations where we intended to do a useless tech over a hundred ended up spending anthony spent an entire week because we knew we couldn't come out and say this thing is really great unless we absolutely proved it like if we were going to come out and say it's it's junk that would be easy because we've done that before it's a video on the $1000 like silver HDMI cable based on that their claims were BS which they obviously were yeah and that's easy that's like cheap easy content so we were intending to do more cheap easy and instead and you got I screwed paid someone for an entire week video but then they turned around another sponsoring the land show so I guess that worked out okay so uh alright last Vaughn sir they're back I'm gonna do something hot this week by the way someone said their background looks fake it's not I'm a can see I can like pick things up from yeah I'm gonna type I'm gonna type on this Underwood the keys don't come back up like the world's most convincing that's that's my can go to the the frame convincing I think this is an Nvidia ammo box why don't we have it showing the top-secret it's the wrong way around because it's a secret good dog I don't I don't know how to no it's so much cooler all right there's the Nvidia crowbar too yeah that's hidden that was the that was the container that anyone who reviewed the GTX 590 got the card in and it was such a terrible shipping container my first one was broken because if they just put like packing peanuts in like an anti-static bag in there oh this is a metal container there's no like there's no shock absorption so my card was totally broken so we're the chat Wow CGI has come a long way oh you dicks alright what do you want today we're doing we're going hot you can do whatever you want but I'm going with the ghost peppers let's ghost pepper buffalo sauce did you do it last week no I went I went I ate an entire pack of the maple maybe we both said we were like going to do it or I said I was gonna do it and I don't think either of us did it so yeah oh I'm preparing myself these guys really do make frickin hot jerky and not just jerky they also make barbecue sauce hot sauce and a spice rub so they're Carolina Reaper hot sauce uses one of the hottest peppers in the world the jalapeno I'm just kidding Carolina Reaper their drug is made with great ingredients without nitrates or preservatives I'm the globalists accretive snack that is full of flavor and spice that's not bad for you it's definitely full of flavor yeah it's definitely flow spice I'm starting with a small piece I'm working my way up to it today we've got 13 different flavors of jerky I'm gonna regret that when some of the favorites did you eat the whole thing yep well beating the sriracha bacon maple buffalo bacon and traditional flavors I'm partial to the Moho me too and the much once alone with the white and black packaging the sucker classic is that classic no classic event traditionals red no there's one little white and black package that's really good whatever the one with the white and black package anyway Hughes offer code LTT to save 10% on their products at the link below sea salt I've what it was itsomething pepper cracked pepper and sea salt that was really good okay I'm gonna keep working on this I'm gonna slow and steady wins the race mode Windows 10 is bringing tabs to every whoa Microsoft is bringing tabs to every Windows 10 app the spice flip that around on me note a hex app was this posted this on the forum Microsoft is planning to add tabs like the ones in your web browser to apps in Windows 10 allowing you to group apps together they're calling this feature sets so say you're working on a word document you need to research data on the web or grab notes from PowerPoint you can create sets or tabs of these tasks in a single window honestly I think this is actually pretty sick yeah that sounds great I really like this because oftentimes I'll have a few different things that are for one thing honestly my preferred method is to just have more monitor space so I can have it all open at the same time you're gonna have Windows 7 anyway that's so 8.1 or you running 8.1 okay yeah okay I'm excited I wish this wasn't news because I wish this was a thing ages ago but I'm not gonna be down on them for like doing something good so it would also be really cool if like on the taskbar at the bottom you can have your set icon down there so you could like click on it and then it would bring up the multiple things instead of having it all in one because often times I want a copy between them and read one thing while I'm typing one thing and having it all in a set actually isn't very conducive to that but it'll still be really nice and oh except not for me so oh well although a point was getting painful because I think it's like less than 10% of people are using it so a compatibility for my platform it's like really not great so file explorer even notepad they'll eventually be extending to app so that I have custom title bars like Photoshop and they're aiming to let iPhone and Android users start sets and then resume them on a PC or vice versa all I'm getting my spicy hiccups dang at all right this is pretty bad this is posted by heyyo on the forum websites use your CPU to mine cryptocurrency even when you close your browser that's new well yeah like we've heard of we talked about the Pirate Bay yeah and another one I don't remember who was but another one but this is new it's always it's always been kind of a short-term thing because it's only lasted while you were on that page yeah luckily for these websites a lot of people just leave things open in tabs Wow look at this so they've got a pop under that's opening up another tab that is running this in the background so you see once they close it the CPU usage goes away Wow close it so one researcher recently documented 2500 sites actively running crypto mining code in visitors browsers that's a lot of sites actually yeah that's pretty brutal I wonder what these sites are though so basically in a nutshell do to do so the one that they're focused on is mining Manero so this is like I don't know I think everyone should be offended by this like some people might not think it's that big of a deal but this is using your electricity and your CPU resources so like your investment to just make money from a site ranking your CPU and it's potentially making your CPU run really hot which you can potentially reduce its lifespan especially if you're on a mobile device and speaking of a mobile device if you're on something that's battery-powered this is going to destroy your battery life if it's a technique that's being used on any sites that you visit regularly right now the technique works on the latest version of Chrome running on the latest versions of Windows 7 and Windows 10 at the moment no indication that it's being used on other browsers or operating systems so you're in compatibility that's freaking brilliant it's the Apple approach you know we are secure because no one's making viruses for us you know what's interesting root it ways that sound in the dock have you heard about that uh yeah I did see that hilarious you know what's interesting is our render server like the one that does our final export before we upload yeah almost never errors out on a render in fact I'm not aware of it ever having done it windows 8.1 it's the embedded version the window yes all right dude message me today it's it's like the third a few days ago it's like the third year anniversary of like Windows 9 thing oh really cool yeah so this is sort of a big deal if you're into like that sort of thing but our formal and our former employer oh yeah here we go where is it it's kind of crazy yeah so here hold on I'm gonna bring this up search civil by party name so net link Computer Inc oh wait hold on so here's some here so here you can see I actually didn't even know you can do this of course that makes sense so you can search for lawsuits or like you can search for court cases by party name it's a net linked Computer Inc small claim small claim small claim small claims four times over the over the last you know since 2011 and boom net link Computer Inc Bora Group Inc the net link Computer Inc supreme bankruptcy December 1st 2017 so this just went down my formal my former employer is I mean is this up oh no I think it's still loading no no I'm pretty sure it's still loading oh oh yeah there we go the site still up I really don't know that I would necessarily recommend apparently shopping there though getting your stuff after you buy it has been a little bit of an issue recently for a while yep so I yeah I haven't done any I haven't done any pre like sort of research here but I'm heading over to the I'm heading over to the forum ok restructuring ok important service announcement we figured it's time to write a formal post about the restructuring Wow I'm pretty sure this thread has been pruned because I know that there were other things in here before huh alright NCIX supreme bankruptcy confirmed okay what is supreme is there sub supreme bankruptcy I have no idea it sounds crazy like what Wow yeah I've had a lot of people know fire to box I did not cause this um no I mean that okay I don't know I don't know well how much should I talk about right now scale of 1 to 10 like a 6 or 6 okay like not not that I so I left partly because I saw a great opportunity in content creation online and partly because I had some significant or even closer to 3 fundamental disagreements with senior management okay particularly the owner over what exactly we needed to do in terms of our direction as a company I also left this was a significant part of the reason for my departure I also left because the people that I had been mentored by they're the people that I had really felt like I learned a lot from were departing and they sometimes for very good reasons I'm not going to defend the conduct and job performance of at least one of them but some of them were forced out by extraordinarily in my opinion extraordinarily poor management decisions and that ultimately led me to believe that I could do it better so I had an opportunity and I thought I could do it better and I thought that my company made my way would be something that would make me happier too up in the morning and go to it's made me happier well I'm glad to hear that uh I know you're having a moment I just want to add some comedy yeah thank you and that was ultimately why I left I didn't agree with the strategy I thought and this was something that I pitched about six and a half years ago I thought the direction for us to go and meet by us I mean I was at NCIX I was one of the top product management people there I might have been a category manager at that point can't remember anyway I was basically at or near the highest rank that you could really have in the company there before and I don't wanna you know the odds of anyone that this might apply to ever watching this stream are pretty low but my opinion of some of the people that were hired in senior positions couldn't possibly be any lower so you know that was that was though there were some bad decisions there as well anyway where was I where was I going with this right so the direction that I had wanted to go was to try to get acquired and the way to try and get acquired is to have some kind of a value that somebody else would want and it wasn't gonna be the website let's be honest it wasn't going to be the logistics system and you know I can't say too much about what NCIX had because you know I don't want to I don't want to be disrespectful of their privacy as a company but I will tell you that it wasn't you know robot arms and you know robot eyes and automated conveyor belts like what state-of-the-art warehouses were doing even back then it was not that so it wasn't gonna be the warehousing system it wasn't going to be the inventory management system I can tell you that much it wasn't going to be the the super-talented team and there were talented people on it obviously like I was part of it I think I was pretty talented there were definitely talented people on it but I don't know that that was visible enough externally and I think that you would end up with a lot of in order to acquire a team you'd have ended up with a lot of deadweight and I don't even necessarily mean in terms of people like the locations that we had least I think at one point there were three locations in Richmond which is a small city just to give you guys some idea of why that wouldn't be a good idea so so my concept for what we could build having seen the partnership between Nvidia with the shield and EB Games in the States where I think the shield was initially only available to preview it at EB Games in the States and I was like why would they make it exclusive to them and I could be remembering some little detail of this wrong maybe it was a Nintendo system I don't know whatever the point is the reason that they partnered with them was that they still had at that time anyway 4,500 locations which has a value another thing that I thought could have a value would be a distribution system slash business model that combatted one of the biggest difficulties of doing business in Canada which is extremely high shipping cost it deters customers from shopping online and it enables brick and mortar to continue to be competitive here because shipping a case across the country from new AG is like $7 shipping a case across this country from NCIX could be as much as 30 40 60 dollars depending on how remote you are so you know it was a constant refrain from customers shipping kills the deal you'd hear it all the time so the concept that I pitched was like an NCI x-lite these would be extremely small stores like maybe 600 to 800 square feet really small stores with really small storefronts that were effectively kind of ordering kiosks and the idea was that you'd have technical services so you could walk into small communities like Kamloops and displace the mom-and-pop shops with a trusted brand believe it or not at the time we were a trusted brand you could displace those mom-and-pop shops as a trusted brand you could probably cover your lease and your employee overhead with the services business that you're doing then you would stock like two SKUs tops of every category so that if someone walked in they could build like something basically the computer at any given time which is pretty easy to define it's really easy to do so right now you would stock assuming that you there is inventory you would stock the 8,400 for Intel and you would stalk the Verizon five sixteen hundred or something along those lines and then you'd have like a motherboard for each of them you'd have an eight gig stick and a 16 gig stick and like obviously multiples of each of these but the idea is that if someone just like wanted like the computer right now like the bang for the buck sweet one that everyone wants you could just walk in and buy it or we would build a system and it wouldn't be a complicated system but we would have a network of trucks that would crisscross the country constantly between the two locations that we had in the West and in the east so that the model would be you can shop online and you can ship to your house or we'd have these little tiny low overhead locations scattered across the country and you could get free pickup at any location and this was well before Amazon started doing pickup so whoa insects actually sounds really cool this was an ICU never happened he was pitching I pitched this this is what I wanted to do instead of these monolithic high overhead extraordinarily expensive retail stores in order to you know I the writing was on the wall like seven years ago Amazon was going to kill us all like the people who were paying attention knew this already so the idea was to build this infrastructure so that when Amazon decided to hit the switch and you can see now they're running around acquiring people that have infrastructure that they like like Whole Foods the idea was that when they came in they could buy us and that never happened if I'd had the resources I think that could have been the way for me to never have to work again like if I could have built might like I even to go back like if I was the one who had the resources that I have today even that might have been a model that I would have pursued I really believed in it I thought that it was a great opportunity it's not worth it now oh no you'd never make it now no but I should PI NCIX and do that I couldn't afford NCIX not because I couldn't afford like what NCIX is net value is right now but I couldn't afford an STI X's overhead the monthly expenses even with all the layoffs that they've done there's still a lot of things there's still a lot of buildings there's still a lot of inventory so when we didn't do that and when we continued marching down the obviously no longer viable big-box retail path I figured out that I had to get out so ultimately the reason that I ended up leaving NCIX and taking this guy with me and me thanks for coming along well um yeah that I was thinking that five-year thing it's actually like seven or something or eight or something yeah it's kind of ridiculous so anyway sorry I forget where I was going with that right so so what happened when I left was I had decided to leave and the reason that I was able to take the line is tech tips channel and so to be clear I take no pleasure whatsoever in NCI x's demise you know and I've seen a lot of horror stories online but however they've treated other people everyone they're all the way up to Steve the owner and Mary his wife they have always treated me with the utmost kindness and respect I have not had personal bad experiences with anyone there from from HR to my colleagues to I shouldn't say everyone there were some there were some some port aspiring decisions made but at the very highest level that at least the people that I consider to be at the highest level you know I take no pleasure from this I learned a lot there like I am everything I underst and about business at what to do right what to do wrong it was ultimately from them I I didn't go to school for business management I don't have an MBA I don't I don't actually have any formal education everything I learned was school of hard knocks and NCIX was a stupendous proving ground for me so you know I take no pleasure in this but where was I going with this but how'd you go the channel right how I got the channel so so ultimately I was able right right right so I'm very grateful to them for giving me the opportunity to build up this channel and then ultimately take it with me because the deal was look I'm leaving because I disagree with some of the stuff we're doing and you my boss is gone who I loved and that sucks and so I'm out so you can either let me walk away to another retailer and I mean you know I didn't have four million subscribers and a team of you know 19 people that's like a world class video production team like I hadn't built any of this yet yeah we were pretty far from it yeah we were a long way away from this but for me personally anyway my stock was high enough that I could have walked into literally any electronics entity and gone like this and I would have had a job so I wasn't concerned about getting a job what I was concerned about was building a team and building something and making sure that Luke and Edie who were both out of work if I walked out of there and didn't manage to take them with me making sure that they stayed employed so the deal was look I'm leaving but if we can work out a deal where I take the Linus tech tips YouTube channel the trademark and any associated assets which now that this is going on I'm really happy we did buy the book with a lawyer get to that more later but if I take all that stuff with me I'll sign a non-compete for I believe it was two years but it ended up getting extended two three and four pennies on the dollar I'll come back and I'll continue to support the end cix tech tips channel so that you don't have to replace me immediately also I'll give you as much notice for my departure as you need so I had originally planned on giving somewhere between a month and six weeks notice I ended up giving about five months notice although in fairness I phoned in about the last three weeks of it by then I had trained my replacements for pretty much everything I didn't really know what to do with five months like um like I tried okay I tried so the fact that we the fact that we acquired those assets legally is really important because if some if the like the bankruptcy lawyers if whoever NCIX as creditors are were to find that it had an asset that was worth a significant amount of money and let me tell you Linus tech tips is worth a significant amount of money both as a brand and as a YouTube channel at this point although you know no I'm not gonna say no thanks to NSA X but most of that development has been done in the five years similar but if it was found that that asset wasn't transferred Title II then it could also be found that NCIX still had some claim to make against it and then their creditors would as well so Steve I trusted to never do anything untoward with me by predators creditors all bets are off I really didn't you know I didn't think it would come to this I take no pleasure in it but that's what happened and yeah that was some context there we broke off at what two hundred fourteen thousand subscribers or something like that yeah we're now at four point eight million yeah there's kind of been a lot of work done yeah we've been we've been going pretty hard on it so yeah yeah so aligned is tech tips documentary no no that probably won't happen we actually tried to do a behind this like a behind the blow type thing here and it was a total disaster we brought in a third-party film crew they like shot a bunch of stuff then they submitted a rough cut that was awful totally unusable and then we tried to edit it together ourselves but by then our team was like 60% bigger so like different yeah like a third of our staff wasn't in the video and you know it doesn't make sense yeah alright so what else let me out for topics yeah that wasn't wow that was kind of a fricking downer of a topic man also take a long time I'm surprised people are still watching sheesh let's find something exciting it's pretty interesting yeah I guess so it's like learning that before coke came out it was green I'm like I'm like damn let's just find like something like one cool topic to do and then these are all terrible Oh tinder tinder tests using AI to suggest who to super like they're testing a new feature called super likable that intermittently presents a card on your screen and offers you a bonus super like that can be sent to one of four people present it's presented on the card the original Super Lake was designed as a way to signal your interest in a potential match was stronger than others but users have a limited number per day Wow how many of those could you possibly need per day wow I'm not I mean like I'm sort of pre online dating so I don't really get like a social hub sheesh like somewhere light like deep like LA or San Fran if you just like go through a few hundred people and you're just like yeah there's many more you know what I mean I don't know I don't feel like it's like that up here huh I don't know okay well I'm bored of that already cuz this is way better yep there's officially Mario series yeah so I like super need some okay this also isn't the first time that Nintendo has tried to do serial I thought it was kind of interesting because right now they're huge cuz the switch is like wildly mildly successful but at a previous time of them being huge they also tried to roll out a cereal and this one is not just cereal the box itself is essentially an amiibo so you tap the box on your switch and you get stuff in game wow it unlocks gold coins and hearts in Super Mario Odyssey hits shelves mid-month okay I'm down for that alright well that's pretty much it o.o LOL max root access issue if you have if you have a Mac and you're watching the show you should maybe look it up on your own it's not in here but I'm pretty sure if someone literally just attempts to sign in as username root with no password they just have all the stuff alright yeah I I'm not entirely sure in all the details it's not in the doc but if you have a Mac look into it because it's a big deal so thanks for watching guys we'll see you again next week same bat-time same bat-channel no don't be down [Music] apparently it's patched so just update yeah there you go yeah [Music] what an issue easy 
yeah I know my videos late because I didn't get an iPhone 10 until dbrand actually bought one skinned it and shipped it to me but unlike some people I'm not gonna make a big salty song and dance out of it because frankly if I was Apple I probably wouldn't feel like spending the thousand dollars or even three hundred and seventy dollars to hear what I'm about to say about their latest and greatest either especially in front of their store which is under innovation I wanted to do this in front of the cube today's videos brought to you by Mac Weldon I was gonna wear the shirt but it's so cold Mac Wilden believes in smart design premium fabrics and simple shopping use aqua co tech tips at the link below to get 20% off on your next order [Music] now if the iPhone 8 and the 8 plus are fraternal twins then the 10 is kind of like the lovechild from that brief but intense affair that everyone knows mom had but that no one talks about unless Uncle Gordon's had too much to drink Apple reused almost every major internal component making the 10 with it's beefy battery 3 gigs of ram and dual rear camera system something familiar kind of like a plus in a regular-sized body and yet something totally different because as I fix it revealed in their fantastic teardown to achieve this spectacular density they actually went back to a technique so old we haven't seen it since the original iPhone a dual PCB internal layout that in another creative move uses dual lithium-ion batteries for maximum density but while in some ways physically the 10 is what I've been asking out before 4 years less concerned with reducing thickness and weight and more with increasing battery life and features like wireless charging this comes at the cost of it feeling well kind of heavy and thick to be clear I still vastly prefer the form factor of the 10 compared to the 8 plus it's size makes it much easier to hold on to even if it's slim bezels mean an accidental drop is more likely to be fatal it's just that the slight increase in unwieldly 'no scared to the 8 is compounded by the tens unfamiliar new gesture-based controls before I get to those though let's talk about the screen I am sorely disappointed that my 120 Hertz prediction didn't come true but otherwise it's everything that you could hope for from a top-of-the-line phone in 2017 Apple took the best mobile OLED screen technology on the market from Samsung and tuned it to damn near perfection it's the brightest OLED I've ever seen making for the best direct sunlight viewing experience that I've seen yet and the best rendering of HDR content that I've seen yet and the ultra tall or ultra wide depending on how you look at it aspect ratio combined with the stereo bottom firing and earpiece speaker combo makes it great for watching cinema aspect ratio content like movie is what I would say if it weren't for the knotch whoa now for the vast majority of the content that you'll find on YouTube or Netflix it's and the rounded bottom corners will end up cut off by pillar boxes but in movies it is a literal black mark on what is otherwise the standard by which mobile displays can be measured and while it's far less obnoxious I did also notice it in day to day use a lot of people might not care about something like this but there's no room at the top anymore for your battery percent or your VPN connectivity status requiring a swipe down from the top right to bring up the control center that so what do we get in return men in tech enthusiasts terms we get a marvelously densely packed not to mention incredibly sophisticated array of sensors emitters and cameras that had me hardcore nerding out but everyone else just calls it face ID without getting into the theoretically reduced security I mean no one that I know was able to unlock my phone here's what it does really well downloading apps buying stuff or logging into websites is in a word amazing it worked nearly flawlessly across all manner of challenging conditions from cold days where you don't feel like taking off your gloves to touch to bright sunlight to pitch blackness and even with a kid in my arms or a toothbrush hanging out of my mouth and the feature that hides the details of your notifications until it recognizes you is a biometric authentication game-changer okay cool now here's what's less awesome because the 10 only Auto wakes when it's right side up and has no obvious land Marx when the screen is off like an always-on clock for example and because it requires a swipe after it identifies you I often found that it took me longer to unlock the 10 when I wanted to use my phone face ID to be clear is much better than Samsung's iris scanner across-the-board but it still requires a special dance move to do something on your phone while it's sitting on the desk or table next to you and back to that notification hiding thing I really wish that it was a little bit faster like I've been using my old iPhone 6 as an mp3 player lately and then I forgot how much worse first gen touch ID was and how much better fast biometrics are compared to just having them at all all right fine then Apple a notch in the display for unlocking with wet hands ok I can wait a little longer for you to put all this stuff behind the panel and besides the notch actually bothered me far less than the interface and navigation changes that were necessitated by the tens lack of a home button all the new gestures are easy to remember and felt natural within minutes to the point where I actually found myself swiping up on other devices but multiple aspects of the new control scheme are marginally slower reinforcing my belief that Apple is either run by or caters to people who just don't have a lot to do these people I assume have all the time in the world to type names into their address book like a cave person instead of using t9 dialing interact with their touch screen however little it might be to quick launch their camera instead of double tapping a hardware button they have time to pause mid gesture to wait for multitasking to show up instead of pressing one button though the slide to the right is quite a bit better they have time to hold then swipe or reach to the top of the screen to force close a frozen app and finally and yes I'm repeating this one they don't mind swiping their screen every time they unlock their phone now I'm not saying that Apple did nothing right here control center from the top right is much more reliable now that it no longer gets confused by the on-screen keyboard and on that subject the dictation button under the on-screen keyboard is super convenient which wait a second under the keyboard ah leave it to Apple to figure out the most obvious stuff that everyone else missed I've been complaining for years that on devices with small chin bars it's harder to touch type and they just went and put a space in there brilliant anyway in fairness to Apple the navigation isn't terrible it's just also not as advertised it's not like a quantum leap forward in the way that I interact my phone and if anything it makes me miss the Android back button even more than I normally do on iOS not less now I'm not gonna spend a ton of time on the camera or an emojis other than to say that if you liked the excellent 8 plus camera and if you're a portrait mode bokeh fiend you'll like the TENS camera I will be even less inclined to create awkward moments in public than I already am so that brings me then to my conclusion the original iPhone was first in execution of a brilliant idea and the device that was created to celebrate its 10-year anniversary his brilliant execution of what feels like a first gen idea it really seems to me like Apple was trying really hard to make an innovative device then make you like whatever they ended up with rather than looking forward to what people wanted to do in their lives and building a solution around that an approach that probably would have involved some more investment in Siri so bottom line then the iPhone 10 is what it took to make me more excited about the 8 and the 8 plus and ultimately go back to the S 8 so that I can stop carrying around this stupid bag of headphone doggles so this video was brought to you by the D brand grit present never drop your phone again its key features include their revolutionary grip their world-class d3o shock absorbing technology an industry-first carbon composite frame full D brand skin compatibility so you can customize it till however you want using the D brand site and

so back when I was in like high school creative labs soundblaster was basically synonymous with high performance high quality gaming PC audio and they're making a comeback but hold on - everyone knows an external amp and DAC is the best solution today this new flagship sound card is dead on arrival no you hold on smartypants this time it's different this sound card has built-in RGB lighting this sound card is ready to compete in 2017 [Music] the protrek smart from Casio features Android 2.0 energy-efficient GPS functionality water resistant up to 50 meters and more check it out now at the link below so in a nutshell the Sound Blaster X 85 is creative labs latest attempt to marry a great DAC chip the ESS Sabre 3290 18 and a great amplifier circuit to a form factor that's convenient for PC users if a little unfamiliar to the younger generation so taking a peek under the emi shield we are greeted by the saber DAC right there in the middle as well as this is interesting all the main capacitors are high-quality we move films and interestingly while the rear Jack's are all grounded to the bracket the headphone jack is the one exception it's grounded internally to reduce crosstalk with the rest of the outputs cool of course it's not quite as impressive looking as the inside of a Modi 2 and Magni to a popular standalone stereo DAC and damp combo that enjoys the usual advantages of these solutions particularly very low interference thanks to widely spaced PCB components not to mention being outside the computer case we did notice though that shyt audios products used fewer film capacitors and more giant electrolytic s-- and we also noticed that they have boring white LEDs on the front versus creatives homegrown Aurora reactive lighting system which is basically individually addressable RGB lighting on yet another damn separate piece of software to install alongside are a sync corsair link and razor Creelman that and what a missed opportunity this is it doesn't even have a music reaction mode so we'd recommend just ham fisting the proprietary connector on the included strip onto an Asus header and otherwise ignoring it I mean this is supposed to be a sound card not an RGB controller card like I'm I'm having flashbacks to when they started putting firewire ports and like joystick ports onto sound cards I'm thinking that that was also creative so then the main attractions in creative software package are the Blaster X acoustic engine and Scout 2.0 most of the acoustic engine is creatives usual fare surround crystallizer bass smart volume and dialogue plus crystallizer can help with compressed streaming audio and while dialog + sounds weird for music it can help with other types of content I will leave the rest of them off but those two can be kind of useful Scout 2.0 on the other hand completely worthless it didn't give us better spatial awareness than the conventional surround setting and even worse than that scout radar this phone app that if it did work would be cheating anyway was both distracting because you have to look off screen to see it and horribly inaccurate picking up our own footsteps and ambient sound in csgo as a blip straight ahead and usually failing to register another player until they were within a few digital feet relying on this thing would be a great way to boost your being knifed to kills ratio so how about sound quality then well Anthony grabbed a selection of headphones off of our headphone wall along with the aforementioned magnet 2 and moti 2 and got to work using a Maximus 9 code as a third comparison source to represent good motherboard audio so early on in the testing it became clear that both the 85 and a su supreme effects can drive even notoriously difficult to drive planar dynamic headphones like The Odyssey LCD 2's and the 250 ohm bear dynamic DT 990 probes and both of them at uncomfortable listening volumes even unsurprisingly though so does our Magni and modi combo which is good because that's the entire reason it exists so everybody's a winner so far audio quality was a different story even without the surprisingly easy to use brought the way you wanted EQ highs are crisper and lows are smoother than our onboard audio which is especially apparent in electronic music where high pitched cymbals and snare drums sounds notably coarse by comparison rock and metal sound significantly less noisy which is to say that everything doesn't devolve into a mess of riffs and cymbals as happens with lower quality outputs and meanwhile symphonic music sounds quite a bit smoother and fuller with that said comparing the 85 to our only slightly more expensive it comes pretty close on both of them are a significant improvement over onboard and I'd say the edge especially in quieter passages goes to now obviously the 85 has the advantage of not taking up any additional desk space that is to say as long as your mo isn't to take it and put it on a desk in front of you and talk about it to a camera it also though has a one less obvious drawback that is unless you want to use your cases often very poorly shielded front panel audio jacks you'll need a long headphone cable to plug into the dedicated headphone jack on the rear i/o so bottom line then once upon a time filling up all your expansion slots was like the mark of a baller system and that's not lost on me here what is though is the fact that something like this has one very specific purpose to be plugged into a compatible computer meanwhile external sound solutions are more versatile DAX are usually driverless and cross-platform and amps can be plugged into virtually anything with an output so I guess the answer then boils down to how much you value three things creative software including yes the RGB controls they're 7.1 surround support and whether you're like into filled up PCIe slots anchors power delivery charging enables faster and safer charging as well as more power for your larger devices and USB see connect are super handy because they allow you to use the same cable to charge your smartphone tablet and even a supported laptop with no separate power brick required so today we're looking at two products with these features the power core plus 26800 as well as the power port speed PD 30 both of them have a USB C port that can deliver up to 30 watts as well as up to two regular USB ports they've got hard-wearing matte exteriors this one's made of aluminum which is pretty nice with high-gloss detailing and these kind of cool blue USB ports to provide a sleek look the foldable plug and compact size means that you can take them with you wherever you want to go and you can check them out through the links in the video description so thanks for watching guys if you

so it's ROG rig reboot time again and yeah you're coming over here right guys like okay you should have heard him before before the camera started rolling I was like hey do you like our review of a copy Lake process you're like no I'm like okay well then fine so here's how it's gonna work your system getting dropped that's right so this is James and we're gonna be upgrading his craptastic rig today [Music] the asus rog Strix 1080 TI is 5k gaming and VR ready featuring to hdmi 2.0 to DisplayPort 1.4 and one DVI port allowing you to connect a VR headset and up to four monitors check it out at the link below alright James so tell me about your system here what was your theme other than Asus because ROG sponsored this ohm I was hoping to have it like white and blue because those are pretty fun colors okay well we got the white right black black black black black and gray white Hey all right black hey hey waiting blue kala mod got it right fantastic have you ever built a system before I've not you've never built a system before no wow it's not really a surprise none of the other ones yet so first things first have you ever watched like a system build guide before I have maybe not all the way through but a little bit not all the way through no you know can you imagine imagine for a moment okay if you took this approach to everything in your life okay like let's say you know you go for your you know Marine training and you go all the way through and then you get to the point where like you know you have to reload the gun and you didn't make it to that part now what I said wouldn't go so well do you know what the first step is you unpack stuff yes start with this one step one open the box like that yeah yeah it's like that's fine yeah actually no it isn't like that oh oh my man yeah okay so CPU installation easy lift out and then up this arm right here now look at it closely okay okay now the most important thing here is that it goes down with no force whatsoever okay so if you've been doing any Jedi training don't use it alright ah oh my goodness this thing just broke off what are you gonna do now I believe that's supposed to come off okay so you have watched it'll go - okay ran is the hardest part okay so this one has got to go in here I'm pretty sure if I go over here yeah all right there we go hey so uh Colton what do you think are the odds this cable mod can't works with this power supply this time oh no you know this is not a modular power supply right hold on there's another one that is - was definitely interesting um he definitely knew a lot and I was kind of fun but he has such an interesting personality you think he kind of puts on this persona for being on the YouTube videos and he kind of does but he's also that energetic and craziness most of the time go ahead and open that up hey are you old enough to use a knife oh no [Music] okay you got a pretty dank set up now but have you like ever gamed on a high-end machine I don't think so have you ever experienced the high refresh rate like higher than sixty Hertz on a monitor I don't think so no yeah you'd know if you had cuz it's amazing all right one of my friends has a 1080 okay but he doesn't let you use it no you won't you want to give him a shout-out here for being like super nice and for sharing his stuff yeah crystal real awesome do you oh okay so you put those screws through the washers now I'm not giving you the washers go find your own washers these are mine are there other washers no they're not okay so next thing we need is the blue and white case that's mostly black it can be blue in your imagination you have a strong imagination oh thanks oh okay is it blue oh yeah okay so just shove it back towards the i/o and there you go just like that nice how you feeling pretty good pretty good feeling like you've achieved something today oh yeah well you would because you're the guy who watched as part of a builds guide so this is legitimately I think I've said this a couple times but this is actually usually the hardest part of the build for new builders if you get all these little things and it looks like you're supposed to plug them into the board not at all all you do is you bundle them all up you Jam them into the blades of one of the fans just leave it like that see these holes yeah see that I'm just gonna pop that in there and you flex this out you line up the other side with the holes oh I broke it okay go for it and if it clicks it goes too far oh no I'm just kidding the click is good so we've gotta put this on here so you just got to go grab those nuts okay you came back one nut short man you dropped your nut on the ground leave my your dad's saying you're going to let them watch these videos anymore why don't we get to the most exciting part putting this fan filter back on backwards and then the right way No why don't you open up your graphics card this thing is I would say pretty much top-of-the-line except that it is GTX 10 ATT I support 4G sync your monitor as do you think right oh you got the 240 Hertz monitor nice because you have g-sync you're actually only gonna see exactly the right number of frames without any tearing or stutter or anything like that look at this documentation it's got gold lettering there it is is it heavier than you expected actually it's a little bit lighter really see I take all this stuff for granted so it's kind of fun for me to see like people having their first experience with like this grade of hardware the graphics card is kind of I feel like the main piece and a lot of um gaming PC builds and tabs such a top-of-the-line one as the Strix 1080 who is pretty fun you want to put it in right oh yeah okay and then the yeah you got to move up a little bit though I mean no pressure it's only like a $700 graphics pretty nice that's it that's the performance piece I mean the 7700 K processor the 16 gigs of ram the 480 gig you know PCIe SSD how that's like performance - ok you ready sure hit it oh that's not a good sign now I'm just kidding Python go for it it's alive alright are you just using sweet to humor me you're using dated slang just to make me feel more at ease no no I'm genuinely excited so this is cool this is the actual refresh rate that your monitor is refreshing at so that's why no matter what frame rate your graphics card is pushing out you won't see any tearing or any stuttering that's GC all right and may I just say on my old computer at ultra-low settings it took like 10 seconds just a load of the map say it's uh I don't know I get so jaded because I tool around with the stuff all the time but I forget that there are people out there that are actually like waiting you know 30 seconds to get into a game nice you're sitting up like 170 180 FPS bad you're actually really taking advantage then of the extra refresh rate of this monitor yeah like that is a lot of updates per second and I can actually like see foliage on the ground yes all my life I had waited to see foliage on the ground in this games they're frustrated I think really made a big difference actually being able to look at people and target them whereas before it was just kind of a mess whoa I I'm actually getting kills for oh that's sad let's show you how to overclock your graphics card let's put your your next to the system here that very quiet right yep okay let's kick it up a notch that's the sound of performance so if you want the best possible temperatures while you're overclocking you can just go ham on the fan speed or you can actually use the user-defined here in order to set up your own fan curve then as far as GeForce overclocking goes these days it's pretty straightforward you drag the power target all the way to the end then you start creeping up your GPU boost o'clock GPU voltage makes less of a difference these days than it used to but you can try tweaking it a little bit of all the things that can actually kill your hardware when you're overclocking increasing the voltage is pretty much it looking the computer was fun and getting to meet all the people from honest media group was really amazing it was really interesting seeing how everything fits together and it was also a lot more simple than I thought it would be just pretty much just plugging things together honestly I think : is on my favorite people Alliance meet again oh I think that pretty much wraps it up for this episode of ROG rig reboot James you've been a pleasure to build this system with I hope you get many many hours of fun out of it doing schoolwork yep so thanks guys for watching and thanks to asus rog for allowing us to hook them up with this unbelievable upgrade 
so you might have noticed at some point over the last little pile here that that ugly wall that turns my skin orange in our videos is gone and it's been replaced by our new set but what you also might have noticed is that our new set is super dirty well our friends at Dyson noticed so they sent us over the brand-new Dyson cyclone v10 so that we can clean it up and take you guys for a little tour of our new space so look it's not how you're supposed to do that lock and load and come along for the ride we're gonna clean up and show you guys around pass sounds like a ray gun [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so let's start by meeting the v10 this right here is the design that made James Dyson look like like that James Dyson go to his team and say you know what guys all these other upright corded vacuums blown up we're not gonna develop corded vacuums anymore forget about it this is it this is the future I mean he's 70 and British so he probably didn't say it quite like that but this the sentiment is the same compared to their last gen it's got longer battery life up to 60 minutes of fade-free power and thanks to the new digital motor that spins at a whopping 125,000 rpm it even provides 20% more suction than the v8 making it their fastest vacuum cleaner motor to date and it accelerates to that in just half a second 40% more capacity in here it's got a one-piece cleanable filter so you just pop that out run it under the sink little kind of british looking faucets on there it's also easier to clean and you don't need much force to open it up and do their thing there yeah it's easy like that and of course it includes a bazillion and one accessories so let's get our tour started let's go in let's go in handheld mode here right let's start outside so out here you can actually see some hints of the old design [Music] not bad so behind me other than the green screen wall pretty much everything has changed actually even the green screen wall has changed if you look closely enough so this used to go about two three feet further that way but what we actually had to do was cut the wall off and then we took this wall right here and like by actually like kicking it over moved it about two to three feet this way so the other side of this one is what used to be that orange wall and is now the inner wall of the living room so we'll go in there in a minute but first I want to show you guys what we're doing with the outside so you can see right there we changed our minds about 12-foot high walls and then we ended up changing to 10-foot high walls so we have just kind of like a weird thing you can also see where the cable management comes in there's networking running right there in an armored conduit along the roof because that allows us to avoid the more complicated permitting process for permanent structures so the idea of doing exterior siding here which by the way vertical siding is a thing that people do was that if we wanted to do like a you know honey I'm home type of shot it wouldn't be immediately obvious as long as we move that orb that we are not in a real house look at all this dust also on the outside we've got a little bit of storage so some lighting equipment some you know pieces for videos that we happen to be working on right now and then in the longer term what we actually want to do is turn this into a somewhat convincing patio space so we'd love to put down like some artificial turf and maybe some kind of nicer looking concrete and then be able to kind of do shots like sitting outside on the patio there's a fair bit of work to be done lighting wise before we'd be able to do that though so for now what we generally do is you can see this diffuser right here and then we will just kind of blow enough light at them that will will blow them out and it'll kind of look like outdoors like you can see an example of this on the window with the blinds over there and the window with the plants over there which leads us to one of the other purposes out here so we created ourselves a little sort of forest back here so we could actually allow ourselves to see out into kind of a skybox like backdrop with plants in front of it uh since we're back here you can actually see a couple of examples of ways that we like the windows and then over on the other side we've got the color temperature of the light changed so that it looks more like evening [Music] Wow big choice wood no big deal so the living room was actually probably the most natural the easiest aspect of this project we actually ended up doing two different iterations of it now the original plan had been to take so this was the orange wall right here up where it's 12 feet tall and then this was the map wall which you guys will probably remember the original idea was to take these two walls and just convert them and then maybe expand a little bit over to where that spaceship thing was in the other corner so Yvonne set out to just do a makeover so we just changed the color we ripped the map off we got a couple shelves and it made such a difference to the feel of the videos that we kind of realized well this is what we got wrong we spent a bunch of money but ultimately we ended up with something that didn't look homey you know it didn't have pictures on the walls it didn't have you know plants and they're all things by the way plants and knickknacks lying around this one doesn't even have a pot what the heck happened to the pot you guys oh that is so cool look at this it's blue and red now it's purple anyway so what we realized was that you didn't have to do like a crazy set we just had to build something that felt more like a house so that was where the idea came from why don't we just treat our building like a giant sound stage and actually build a house inside it this backing had glitter so then there were just two main design goals here one was that we wanted the media center to look like cool and modern but also be really versatile so it didn't really matter what we put there and then number two was that we wanted this this sitting area hey fella go sit over there we wanted the sitting area to look like a place where you know people might actually be sitting and hanging out hello would hang out with me on his free time right yeah it should be noted that even stuff that's relatively simple can be complicated so check this out first I'm gonna clean this windowsill yeah babies so in order to avoid reflections on the glass in our windows they're actually installed to that on like a gimbal mount so there's a rotating post in the middle at the top and the bottom that lets us reposition them so that we can avoid reflections when we have the blinds open which we often don't just because like this looks a lot more convincing you got shadows and all that stuff then this so far especially with like extension cords running through our foliage here is this one on a gimbal too white yes it is now we we know the people that are living in the in the old studio house still and we know that they are planning a kitchen Renault so we seriously considered offering to buy all the hardware and cabinetry from the old kitchen set and install it here there were some things about the old kitchen that really didn't work that well so for example check this out now whoa look at that we actually modified an up desk so that we could have a height-adjustable island which is really great when we're shooting b-roll like honestly some of the stuff we did in the old kitchen like build guides was really really difficult because of the fixed height of this and then the other thing was that it doesn't have to be a real kitchen like this it's not a real sink which doesn't prevent people from dumping stuff down it which is why we have these buckets here because it's already happened a couple of times but it's not a real sink so we figured we could save some space in the kitchen by taking out stuff we don't need so like you might have noticed it doesn't have a fridge no fridge so then over on this side honestly like there wasn't much of a plan for the dining room and everything over here yeah like I think we've I think we've shot here a couple times but that's it this mostly just kind of collects dust because we can't really shoot out this door in spite of its cool magnetic closing mechanism just because we'd be going out into kind of ugly warehouse land and you know just looking at a double door that's closed over it doesn't look that amazing so if we were ever shooting you know out of the kitchen across here or something it wouldn't look stupid over there it would look like we were like we were in a house anyway one of the areas that we intended to use a lot more than the dining room was this over here so this was meant to be kind of like a reading nook it's little details like this that you'll never really notice in the videos but if you look close most of these pictures are LMG staff often me either dressed really funny like wrapped in cables or wearing you know VR headsets or dressed in drag so we've got colton and drag ed and drag is that Dennis that is a creepy ass picture anyway having something with death behind you this is something that I think people who are more familiar with filmmaking have probably always known but something that helps make stuff look more natural like a lot so this corner is one that we use a lot this one was intended for kind of the more professional or creative type products so things like you know a laptop or an all-in-one PC or whatever else it was meant to look like like a place where you might actually work or study but it's not the only desks that we have in the set it's definitely the dirtiest one because it gets the most use but that's okay we have a solution today yeah Davey this is not actually the ideal head for this but I guess it doesn't really matter picking everything up anyway now we're gonna finish our tour in what is perhaps the most over-engineered but well I think engineering is a bit of a stretch but whatever you get the point get get get in here so this is the bedroom and the idea here was again trying to maintain the ability to shoot in any direction and to do so we actually designed this rolling built-in bookcase so whether I'm sitting here next to this picture or lying in the bed you know hitting talking to a Google home or whatever else or grabbing this vacuum now with the tork brush bar head there's really dirty in here Wow the brush bar is actually doing a bang-up job on here I can walk around the entire room and it'll never feel unnatural this is also where we put our second desk the idea was that here is where we would do like gaming monitors and gaming systems and you know the more performance type stuff so it's the work over there and then game over here now something that you might notice in this room as someone who is watching a behind-the-scenes tour is that it doesn't really have a door this was intended to be the closet so this is one of those sliding style doors so behind it there's a couple of things one is there's an emergency exit in the event that someone is in here and that a hump that built-in bookcase is closed and two is actually access to the plant area that I showed you guys before so this is the way that we can get around behind the stage so to speak I love carpet like I love the feeling of carpet but the amount of just dust that it gathers is really horrible it's actually kind of impressive how light this thing is this is on minimum to like it picked up that giant chunk of chunk of stuff on the minimum power setting the main point Dyson's trying to make with this thing is that they don't really see the purpose in continuing to develop inconvenient corded vacuums when you can build something like this that does such a good job and is quick to just grab and go and run anywhere with whatever attachment you want like the fact that it converts from a full-size to a portable like that is absolutely incredible so they're just saying okay you know what forget it we're just not going to invest in those other vacuums anymore and I can totally see where they're coming from so guys you can check out the v10 at Dyson Canada dossier or Dyson com we're gonna have that linked in the video description and a huge shout out to you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed our tour of our new sets I hope you learned a little bit about the behind-the-scenes magic I know I actually did while we were doing this over a couple things I actually haven't noticed about with the sign until now and uh we will see you guys again don't forget to subscribe like all that good stuff check that okay how clean is the workshop floor now you could eat off it like a savage all right let's get this dust out of here check this out gently not by like you just press that button OOP done [Applause] 
so guys we are here on location at general fusion where they are attempting to build the world's first commercially viable nuclear fusion power plant and it might not look like much but the only way that the technology inside could be any more space-age would be if I was actually shooting on the moon today so why don't we go take a look after I tell you about tunnel bear tunnel bear makes really simple easy to use VPN applications so you can enjoy a more open Internet check them out at tunnel bear comm /l tt [Music] so what exactly is nuclear fusion well on an atomic level basically you take a couple of hydrogen atoms get them up to a really high temperature and then you like smash them together once they're fused you'll be left with a helium atom I'm Stephen today so cuz one proton plus 1 proton equals 2 protons and you'll get some energy or rather you'll get a lot of energy like like 10 times what you'd get from a nuclear fission reaction like the ones that power traditional nuclear plant so that all sounds super cool already and we haven't even gotten to the best part yet nuclear fusion works around the clock unlike solar or wind and it's a hundred percent clean and safe the reaction is actually incapable of causing a meltdown or other radioactive incident and as much as this might look like some kind of I you know death ray the only direct byproducts our helium like for party balloons and energy so no depleted uranium seeping into the environment for thousands of years no greenhouse gas emissions and get this the fuel for it is practically free you input deuterium a hydrogen isotope that you can extract from ordinary seawater with a centrifuge oh that's awful well and lithium and some critics might point out that these materials particularly lithium are not technically renewable but at least for heavy water the reaction uses so little of it and there's enough sitting around that by the time you run out the Sun will have enveloped the earth anyway so yeah I think we are probably good there well ok then Linus if it's a great why is fusion power taking so long ah I'm glad you asked while the fundamental principles have been reasonably well understood for decades Engineering and science required to build something practical in the real world are well in scientific terms a total to get right in order for nuclear fusion to occur between two hydrogen atoms they need to be heated up to a hundred and fifty million degrees Celsius that's about ten times hotter than the center of the Sun and you've got to do that efficiently no one's gonna buy a fusion power plant that consumes more power than it outputs duh so then how would you get something bad hot well you could use a device called a tokamak to make a plasma doughnut and then manipulate it with liquid helium cooled magnets sounds promising you could take a see here peppercorn sized piece of frozen deuterium and then bombard it from all sides at exactly the same time with what is quite literally the world's most powerful laser effectively blowing up the outside compressing the inside enough to start the reaction and both of those methods have actually succeeded at using nuclear fusion to get close to producing more power than they consumed but the problem is that via both of those methods it is extremely difficult to actually harness the power to generate electricity ah I'm gonna do that again general fusions approach is kind of like a hybrid of the other two and it operates kind of like a super high-tech diesel engine so first they use one of these guys to create a five million degree ball of plasma then they rapidly compress it with steam-powered Pistons the pressure from which heats it to a hundred and fifty million degrees at that point the deuterium kind of ignites releasing energy and if all this sounds difficult don't worry in real life it is way harder this is general fusions last generation large-scale plasma injector where they prototype their process of creating a plasma of sufficient quality that it can survive for long enough for the Pistons in the compression chamber to fully compress it so during a cycle these valves right up here will inject just 2 milligrams of deuterium evenly into the chamber which goes all the way around in a ring then 1 million amps at 15,000 volts so this is about the same as your average lightning bolt goes across the electrical feed right here and strips the electrons off the deuterium creating a ball of plasma these particles then spin around the ball of plasma wrapping it in its own magnetic field creating an insulating layer around the plasma to give it a longer lifespan from there these big electromagnets here will push the ball of plasma out the front of the injector into the compression chamber which would be under this part right over here now the rest of this guy which is actually about the front 2/3 is just for data collection every test that they run generates about a gigabyte of data and even after a hundred and fifty thousand experiments there is still work to do I guess that's why general fusion is so open about showing off their work because even if you stole all the drawings and built yourself one of these machines there are literally hundreds of thousands of variables to tune for plasma quality so you'd basically have built yourself a multi-million dollar paperweight on the subject of millions of dollars much of the research is actually done on smaller less expensive little injector prototypes like Spectre here these guys only take a couple of months to create instead of years and they give the team valuable insight in between larger projects mind you even this kind of thing does not come easy every aspect of this research is complex and expensive like okay here how do you know if your plasma is at five million degrees you can't just stick a cave probe in it ah so it turns out you have to shine a super-strong laser through the plasma and then measure the small bit of light that is deflected by the plasma and this is only about one in every quadrillion photons that you've pumped in that get turned into some kind of useful signal so interpreting that data is quite literally the full-time job of Bill here who has a PhD from the University of Maryland and that is just one example but they are making progress inside this cage is the largest and most powerful plasma injector in the world it's the latest generation of the one that we looked at earlier and they're running tests on it every day in hopes of using a similar model to create a fusion demonstration plant in as little as four to five years so unlike the other one this guy is actually hooked up do you see all these containers around me these are capacitor banks so when all of them are operating they'll be capable of 20 gigawatts of power that's enough to send 16.5 DeLoreans back in time simultaneously the problem though is that when you're unleashing a lightning bolt worth of power you throw out a ton of electronic interference it's such a big problem that all of the sensor data has to be transmitted through fiber optic cables to a nearby Faraday cage full of general fusions own custom-made digitizer boards they ended up designing their own because create an electronics engineering department was cheaper than buying gear like this off the shelf now general fusion weren't the first ones to come up with the idea of smashing plasma but the US Naval Research Lab zhe's incredibly named Project Linus ended up getting abandoned back in the 1970s because there were a couple of problems they just couldn't overcome behind me is a couple of solutions this is general fusions piston-driven compression chamber proof of concept now the real one would have many more Pistons but the operating principle would be similar every piston would push down simultaneously with the tolerance of about 10 microseconds injecting liquid metal stored in the Pistons and in the 1000 rpm spinning grid on the inside and that metal would squeeze the plasma bubble that would be injected from the top now the timing for all of this has to be so precise because much like squeezing a water balloon in your hands if you don't compress it evenly then it'll kind of splurt out or break apart and that would cause a misfire assuming everything goes right though and the simulations say it should the fuel ignites fusion occurs and that liquid metal gets heated to about 600 degrees Celsius after which it gets circulated through insulated pipes by a magneto hydrodynamics to a traditional steam turbine power generator just like what you would find at a coal or a natural gas power plant today which should make general fusions solution sort of a drop-in upgrade for an existing facility now fun fact it is not a perpetual motion machine because it does require a constant supply of fuel but some of the steam that gets generated is actually going to be used to actuate the Pistons keeping the cycle going general fusion hopes that once they reach production they'll be able to run one of these reactions every second generating about a hundred to 200 megawatts of power about the sweet spot for replacing existing coal power plants in developed countries and not so much that it would blow up the power distribution systems in developing countries the market where the most new power generation will have to happen in the coming years now none of this is a sure thing I mean nothing in life is but if general fusion and its investors which includes Jeff Bezos apparently by the way can stay on course then the future looks really bright not just for their company but also for the world speaking of companies with Bright Futures are you finding as a

so who knows are we live now it is where show time so we've got a great show for you guys today lots of good topics action every time yeah people died which sucks because like no I mean that sucks too but I meant the having great topic sucks because we burned through a bunch of time with inexplicable audio issues because yeah wait what is going on now what what even is this is this crashed what is what this oh that's pretty neat are we even or even like pictures frozen nice that's real - ah I've never seen it real cool go back to main that's working well don't go back to me yeah click on camera yeah right click properties refresh it you have to do it in properties which is fine oh no property is available so I think oh my goodness wait wait hold on hold on oh yeah I don't know people are just saying the screen share worked oh man oh man feels good feels good everything feels good right about now I love this no no I got nothing I'm just gonna I'm just gonna like I'm just gonna add a new one I'm just gonna add like a new a new hold on what am I looking for media source no no I don't want that I want a new new new video capture device there it is okay at existing a vio camera okay yeah the camera scene not there yep yeah now dude it there yeah yeah no no no no do you activate activate forgot that you had to messed it so that it would keep its dimensional properties so do we leave this at this point or do we spend people's twitch with yet another notification neither the tough question this is what you guys don't see behind the camera we tackle here on the win show to make the best show alright the greatest show yeah my friends called me there I'm kidding I have no friends nobody calls me my friends called me they said look you never show up on time you talk so quiet we can't understand a damn thing you're saying and every once in a while we're in the middle of a conversation and you all right so we've got a lot of great topics for you guys today Apple responds to the iPhone slowdown fiasco so does I fix it dropping their iPhone battery replacement prices they're not a sponsor today - $29 what else we got so somebody got swatted which resulted in them dying yes weddings not funny by the way no and this was like the person that got swatted gave a fake address but it was a real address and then that person that lived at the fake address died so they actually had nothing to do with the entire situation but we'll talk more about that later and then someone fell down while playing games in VR and hit their head on a table and died great week yeah stay tuned after the intro talk about it more [Music] [Music] yeah we would we would stream three times in ten minutes we would script that like for sure like the end sponsees fresh books you have to get the wine just above yeah no I have it it's above it's just not working because whatever you probably the refresh site OBS is not better than xsplit it never said it was bad it is better they're both they're both not at this time glaring issues ladies have different glaring issues we need to just yeah we need to combine them yeah except that then we'd end up with all the glare if you took the automatic game detection from xsplit and yet most but not all of the UI design from x-play yeah and put it on top of OBS I think audio UI is off that's what that's why I said most abominable this audio UI pretty good adding gain terrible what I want to know why is it that only VLC can figure this out okay a volume slider that just goes to a hundred and fifty percent why is it DLC had that going on a decade ago and literally no one else now people are saying it's quiet except if I laugh it's really loud yeah that actually just kind of makes sense because my life is really loud yeah no not nothing we get nothing we can do about yeah it's playing alright yeah well I'm playing recording suite 2018 at this point you know what maybe like honestly probably not 2018 but okay I will promise you it is not going to happen in 2018 I'm also certain there's people on the team that would have a hoot trying to make one of those I'm certain that there's people on the team who are already working on it stop we need to get the site launched okay it's coming there's some great things you guys are crazy they're awesome you guys are crazy oh oh first topic this week is yeah I know I know some people get frustrated with this but there's literally nothing I can do about it right now is a floatplane topic because this is officially Luke's last week Oh as a linus media group because loyally unceremonious day ever actually yeah you got your five year award at the Christmas dinner it was a silver medal and I'm not getting a gold one because he's firing I'm not firing you yeah I'm being forced to quit by fire so he was like here's your silver medal bt-dubs can never get a better one hey hey you can make your own you can make your own medals I'm gonna give myself a Goldman yeah you can make yeah I mean every floatplane medal will be a gold medal Yvonne and I talked about it we were like do we get five-year like company theoretically you're an employee of the company because of how it works you should actually it's strictly speaking yeah I've been employed by Linus Media Group Incorporated yeah for five years but I was like who Awards it to me who boards it to you I think you would award it to each other but yeah yeah come on no I know that's like I mean the optics of that are like giving yourself an award essentially I would I wouldn't do it ceremoniously I would just put it on a shelf at home you know what I mean I see I see so I would want it so that I could have my own representation of like whatever right but I'm not gonna like go up to stage be like I'm such a wonderful person congratulations me for sticking it out for five years we're not quitting myself yeah yeah for putting up with my horrible boss for so long he wants to have meetings on Mondays and Fridays what a crazy person crazy person um so no what were we talking about okay so so right so actually this is a great time to do a little bit of QA about what this transition means because I know a lot of people have been asking so the first question that we have in the chat actually I don't see it there but I'm sure it's coming is Luke are you gonna be on wedge Hill anymore sorry I have to interrupt for one second somebody said I don't think the CEO gets any metals works for me still get medals at floatplane and that means you don't sorry what was your what was your question are you still gonna be on when show yeah yeah I'm gonna be on win show next week I'll almost certainly be on the web show the week after that although the week after that is the wench of when we're at CES so it's always kind of how it works is always kind of who knows I'm certain but there if if I'm not on that one it's because of like some random reason not because I don't work for MJ anymore I'm still gonna be doing LMG stuff I'm still gonna be managing their security that's random I'm still gonna be doing wham show and I'll probably be on a video here and there we have one that we have planned to film yeah the year the year long concludes yeah you can stop tweeting me about it oh my god we know just let me it's a low priority yeah I mean okay because it's like I had some actor tweet me about it like they're high-profile enough that like I got a notification that they followed me and they followed me specifically to be like yo when the hell are you doing that I don't remember who it was but it was like it was like mr. actor the conclusion is install filters where you don't have fans it was like no it was like someone like significant I can't remember because I don't really I'm just saying like if you don't have time to wait for the thing and you're trying to build the computer just install filters where you don't have fans I don't really know actor people James Alan McCune I'm super bad with James in Madi on shameless and Jimmy on the walking dead Wow yeah oh no I recognize this guy yeah oh that's cool no so Late Late so so so guy tweets me and he's like yo yo hat line is tech whatever happened to that year-long PC airflow experiment you said you were up to last year I'm like we are going to do it just been busy I'm gonna be I'm gonna be that guy ride y'all about it so giddy up cowboy spell giddy up wrong but that's okay his skill set is not about spelling yeah and I'm like okay might not be until after C yes and he's still riding me okay I'll allow it this time looking forward to it also oh if y'all need a guesthouse for C yes I know a guy whoa cool I didn't even see that get him man that'd be super cool yeah CJ's two cents isn't the only youtuber tech show that can like talk to real celebrities BAM yeah it's a really funny thing like how like like it's weird because we're clearly like known like you were talking about going to twitchcon and people being like yo what up but then like we're will never be real celebrities internet celebrities the only way to be real celebrity is to actually do crossovers with mainstream media like a pewdiepie and is featured episode in South Park for example and you know what's you know what's kind of weird is I actually think there might be more obsessive tendencies for the like not real celebrity yeah people they're like attainable Sarah they're attained up there more attainable yeah there's less security yep because there's less money going around they don't live on like 15 million dollars some of them live in like an apartment or some normal house that has no additional security if you do events you probably have no security you're you're much more public in terms of like this guy's he's in some huge stuff I recognize him from multiple different things that happen his Twitter account is not that big yeah it's the opposite of someone who's like a youtuber who will have a giant Twitter account yeah you know they're less recognizable than exactly and I'm not I'm not trying to dig on you dude if you're watching that wasn't the point like there's lots of different things and they probably see you a lot more if someone's in a movie and they're a big movie star um for like two hours ish but it's more memorable it's more memory yeah but yeah I wish every once in a blue moon youtubers often really really commonly if they're a twitch streamer potentially like eight hours a day like it's way more personal there's a lot more obsession apparently he was on sugar pine seven just from what was in his Twitter bio he's ya know it's crazy um apparently people prefer LTT internet celebrity over Kim Kardashian but we weren't really talking about Kim Kardashian specifically that's another weird people are like can we do a patreon to save Luke that's awkward know what else someone also asked if you're gonna be doing last media group stuff from time to time can you be retained as a part-time employee that would be really weird and it'd be complicated and expensive too so if he's part-time at both companies then both companies have to pay like Canada Pension Plan separately and I don't I don't remember how benefits works as well but there's like and it would be like a really low amount of hours of part-time and then really randomly it would be like a bunch and then you'll go back down a really low like it's it's actually easier if we just keep it clean and Lucas just like a guest on the LAN show or like guest host the video here and there and he is the CEO of floatplane media that's his job yeah I was looking to see you a floatplane nope nope no technically that's me jokes but actually this is something that neither Luke nor I had looked up beforehand but see oh oh basically means you actually run the company yeah well I totally didn't know but yeah if you look up the actual definition of CEO is more what did it say it was like it was like it was like large-scale strategic decision maker yeah and then CEO was like operationally speaking actually runs the damn thing yeah oversight of operational procedures and efficiencies it had a really broad description that was basically like the guy that actually does the stuff so it actually works really well in terms of like definition of what I want to do a floatplane it makes way more sense so is floatplane a different building no no it'd be tape on the floor for now you know yeah someday though if all goes according to plan it will need to be flow plane we needed someone building it'll have its own it's at its own like quite a few employees and it'll like totally explode and we've had a lot of people tell us floatplane is gonna be a failure like you know the failing float plane is already failing my favorite one is when they spell it wrong yeah these people have no no access to internal numbers that already exists and it is not failing and it's not gonna fail and we're actually like really excited because sometime in the next hopefully we would measure it in weeks not months we're gonna have an alpha site up well technically you could go on the site now if you really wanted to supersize I've sort of I've said like it's not open in any way unless you're inquisitive enough to figure out how to get in there yeah and then and then hopefully not that long after that we are gonna get to the point where we would be able to invite on more creators I don't know what you're changing unless it's white balance he's done it before though he has done it before okay we'll defend him on that taryn's yeah I think he comes in this way with ripped underwear every time see oh wow that's what I needed I needed Terran ripped underwear before my long day so I'll have lots of time to reflect on that ah dang oh dang someone asked so I'll bring it up right now someone said are you doing your charity stream after this no that is narrow oh I'm doing it tomorrow I was like what well then why did you why did I know it's yo can i promote the charity stream on the lan show and I was like yeah go for it like are you doing it no tomorrow it starts at noon Pacific Standard Time why do you waste my time no is this funny to you well I won't anymore cuz I'm leaving you can't leave cuz I'm sending you wait no severance all right but yeah I know it's starting tomorrow at noon we've raised 21,000 for extra life so far this year I want to see if we can make it to 30 making it to 25 would be soup great making it - nothing more than we have is also fantastic yeah show up if you can dang man yeah that's a Luke underscore efr yeah okay on twitch outside of the charity screams I'd probably recommend not watching it's a terrible stream but the charity streams are great the charity streams are planned out we do like one game per hour this year is going to be 2017 in review we're gonna do 20 different games through 17 talk about what impact they had on the gaming industry times there's cool stuff it's pretty uncommon like when you're like like like are there any twitch staff in the chat right now global we're not literally breaking twitch's Terms of Service in your attempt to create a service that could allow people to break twitches Terms of Service literally but we would never encourage people to do that no like seriously we would we would not encourage people to do that okay probably not yeah so posted by dr. McIntosh on the forum we have our first news item of the day a mere 20 minutes into the stream Apple apologizes for iphone slowdown drama will offer $29 battery placements for a year batteries are apparently consumable components now this is a stroke of absolute and you'll have to pardon the pun here genius because for the price of people who would have been sitting in their stores earning an hourly wage anyway and batteries that are just basically being sold at like not a markup at this point or a very small market at this point so Apple actually gives up next to nothing here though they do create some additional bottlenecking in their in their cues in all likelihood for the cost of basically next to nothing Apple is hoping it looks like this is my perception here is all based on what I think it looks like they're hoping to of avoid lengthy expensive class-action lawsuit and a bunch of bad PR by doing something super duper temporary yeah so Apple is basically going whoa whoa whoa there's a lot of people complaining about a thing you know what here's some goodwill also we are not actually fixing this problem in any long-term way so yes go eat crap yeah am I am I missing something here yeah no it's pretty ridiculous so just in case people didn't know France as far as I know possibly other places I don't it's a different topic we can talk about we can talk about that now if you want well I think it ties in really what cuz you mentioned yeah avoid getting talk about the lawsuit in France a group in France called stop planned obsolescence has filed a criminal complaint in the French Court alleging that Apple has violated France's energy transition law and to be clear yeah this is the first criminal charge against Apple related to this dispute because it is officially against the law to do this in France like specifically the group believes the law on the energy transition of 2015 prohibits the practice of planned obsolescence which is defined by the use of techniques by which the person responsible for making for the marketing of a product aims to live deliberately reduced lifespan in order to increase the replacement rate the complaint is therefore criminal the law provides for a maximum to maximum sentence of two years in prison and up to 300,000 euros in fines and 5% of the annual annual turnover big deal like specifically stated in the law that it is illegal Apple can try to contort their pitch for why they did it in patterns of like the reducing shutdowns and stuff like that but that changes nothing yeah because the end user experience yes because you are still more likely to replace the phone because you have less battery and it is specifically happening because of digits do reducing lifespan in order to increase replacement rate because the proving the in order to replace increased replacement rate is difficult but all that really needs to be proven is the deliberately reducing lifespan and you could make a fairly strong argument that it's done to increased replacement rate if you can demonstrate that the replacement rate is higher which anecdotally from testimony from users should be fairly easy to do yeah especially for a product like the iPhone where so many people run out and buy the new one every year because it's faster this is something that I've been kind of curious about so I don't think you were involved in this video but we did a really interesting piece this must have been like a year ago anyways a long time ago actually where we took Swift tax flagship CPU waterblock over ten years I think it was eight years or something oh yeah so Jake worked on it yeah yeah so over a span of many years and we tested them all on a modern flagship high-end processor and what we observed is that every year there were these claims of 20% better performance or two-degree better performance or whatever it was and if you added them up it was nowhere near the difference between the first one we tested and the last one we tested now with the waterblock you could make the argument that every year those improvements were more to do with optimizing for the generation of CPU that was being released at that time yeah so the die size problems actually the CPU just generating less thermals no no no not that that's a thing because on the same CPU on that on the news the new block would do better than the old one every time because they actually did design them around them yeah okay now let's go back to the iPhone for a minute here when we're comparing performance on a year on a brand-new iPhone a year old iPhone and a two-year old iPhone as often happens yeah whether it's a you know written article like a non tech or whether it's us just holding up phones and going which one's faster how much of apple's marketing then has been affected by this when they talk about the performance improvement generation over generation think about it when people do independent benchmarks to look at apples claims no i'm sure we would have heard about it if there was some huge discrepancy there so is Apple using decayed performance numbers to talk about their generational improvement Oh scathing oh I don't know this is actually not something that I think I have the capability to test because you would have to you would have to get Apple to create for you a non degraded you know iPhone 6 ok so there's no Apple that's not what he's saying he's saying the difference of improvement would is probably in reality a little bit smaller yeah what they're claiming like if Apple says ok from the iPhone 6 to the iPhone 6s we improved 30% CPU performance and then if they actually degrade this one and then they say ok now with the 7 we've got 30% better performance it's not a 60% improvement over that first one it's not 30 plus 30 which actually wouldn't be 60 yes I know just don't worry about it the point is that it could be significantly smaller than what they were advertising I don't know there's not an accusation there's no allegedly even there's just just asking questions just asking questions floatplane data on lmg petabyte no sorry oh no someone's asking who owns the servers and all this kind of stuff oh okay it's it's not floatplane is its own company its servers are hosted elsewhere now I think there was a backup of something on like your nas at some point but that's been yeah and that was that was not like very early stages so we I'm not we're not we're not gonna say we haven't done anything janky that wasn't customer stuff no to be clear and we also at this time okay be I think the only customer data we hold is actually through the forum not through the floatplane site at all yeah and it's not it's not like your credit card info cuz we don't take credit card it's coming though yeah but then even then we won't store that information will be stored by strike alright so actually let's go back to what Apple is offering here so the offer continues through December 2018 for the $29 battery replacement they're also planning to issue an iOS software update early in 2018 that gives users more visibility into health of their iPhones battery so they can see for themselves if it's condition is affecting performance we've got a few people asking about the 30 plus 30 thing it's it's because we're talking 30 percent above so item B is 30 percent above item a item C is 30 percent above item B that doesn't mean that item C is 60 percent above item a yeah or even approximately 60 percent because if item B got degraded by 10 or 15% an item C is now 30% faster than that then it's only 45 ish percent faster than the original yeah okay um you're adding percentages of two different things and trying to come up with one it's not it is really interesting to see Apple but like the pioneer of built-in batteries that you can't replace really changing their tune on what a battery is to try and avoid any legal ramifications here so they said in its let in the letter that batteries are consumable components but then in 2007 this is actually a really really great quote Apple vice marketing vice president's hold on yeah this is great their their vice president of marketing said that most iPhone users will realize as most iPod custom as iPod customers realized that they never needed to replace their batteries um okay so based on their experience they originally okay as we've began to receive feedback about people are seeing slower performance we now believe another contributor to these user experiences the continued chemical aging of the batteries and older iPhone 6 and 6s devices many of which are still running on their original many of which are still running on their original batteries what other battery that you're supposed to put in it yeah well I've heard he's been able to do it the whole time my frame on my iPhone 6 is bent it got bent in my bag because hashtag bendgate so I don't even know how easily I would be able to pop the scrum why not put the battery in and then get this wall back on cuz it actually like buckled on the side probably easily no I haven't seen it it's bad alright anyway so the I fix it just to bring this up I fix it drops its iPhone battery replacement to $29 we don't really need to like post this link and stuff it to be a very short thing to talk about yeah but it's it's a kit I wonder if I'm sure you get the battery but it's do you get like tools and stuff yeah it's not any cheaper so the only benefit is that you don't have to wait in line in a Genius Bar but I think that having your phone yeah okay hold on so the like the iPhone 7 plus replacement kit comes with all the tools you need to do it and the battery yeah so if you buy it once and then you're able to just source the batteries then it's cheaper you can keep doing it for yourself repeatedly and you can do it for your friends and stuff and you just need to acquire the battery yeah but there is something to be said if it's the same price for just having it done at the store where if they screw it up they owe you a new phone yes so I personally if it was $29 versus $29 would just take my phone to the Apple store with that said part of the problem is that not everyone has easy access to an Apple store have you seen what comes in this kit oh that's pretty sick like they're very sick it has one of the nice screwdrivers and it has like the like the iPhone se cool but like there's there's different kits just so they make sure you actually have everything they're all pretty much the same actually but there's slight variations probably just the battery in the instruction manual but like you get some nice stuff you get three bits you get the really nice screwdriver which I actually like a lot I don't know tweezers ESD tweezers little suction cups speaking if I fix it who by the way isn't sponsoring the show today actual people who are sponsoring the show today yeah the drina's coffee mmm I

let me tell you guys if you are into hot jerky I have had multiple people go out of their way to contact me and say you know what I love hot jerky I can eat hot turkey all day when you guys said savage jerky is really hot I was like yeah it's probably not that hot I ordered some it's that hot I wonder what made things maybe soulmate doesn't have a sense of smell as far as I know or it's extremely really reduced I don't remember it's one of the tube so it actually helps them deal with spicy food like a lot and he can deal with like insanity levels of spicy food and he ordered some I

you I'm gonna just do a thing are you okay all right let's see let's see if it distorts oh oh oh risky rescue everything will be fine all right so else we got four topics today I feel like there's gonna be so you want to talk about people dying oh yeah I guess we can try to keep them fairly short that really thinks they're pretty important have to talk about it yeah so oh I want to talk about this too it'll be fairly short but yeah yep for sure keep it condensed all right where is the first one geez breaking news there we go this was posted over on PC Gamer calm so I don't know if we want to put like the guys twitch account or anything on blast definitely not gonna talk about who did it because I'm very against the last thing these people need is more attention exactly um I'm very against making celebrities around terrible people but Andrew Finch is the person who passed away in this whole thing so we can talk about him because he had absolutely nothing to do with this and it's very sad that he was involved in this at all anyways someone was harassing a twitch streamer to some degree saying that they were going to swat them as a prank and all this kind of stuff so as far as I know there was kind of a like bring it on bro that was proposed and super done by the way yeah and a fake address was given but this wasn't an actually fake address it was someone fake Street yeah it was someone's actual home and that home was swatted the SWAT team apparently oh here we go yeah in this case one gamer essentially dared the other two SWAT him but provided an address that wasn't his own but was nearby so that's apparently what happened police believe they were responding to a report of a murder and hostage situation at Finch's home when Andrew Finch came to the door he was shot and killed these situations are always hard because if if he I had his hands in a sweater or something like that yeah it could look like he's trying to conceal a gun I don't know what's going on I'm not blaming anyone except for the people that were involved and I don't want to name them the two main people that were involved that's what I'm saying I don't want to name them very very disappointing situation swatting in its own is is terrible and causing it to happen to someone that that someone that isn't even remotely involved is even worse so yeah this whole thing not good the officer who killed Finch when he answered his front door has been placed on administrative paid leave so which is probably good see what happens with that hopefully you get some psych help as well because he's probably traumatized which is another side effect of these things happening which is why they shouldn't be done so what calls for hot current hostage and very recent murder like the the guys on the SWAT call that yeah hard hard situation deal with moving on there's another one we'll just get rid of this one while we're at it a 44 year old Russian man was playing a Star Wars VR game the game that was being played has nothing to do with the actual story he fell and he hit his head on a glass table apparently based on the medical examiner's report the man continued playing the game instead of seeking any form of immediate medical attention and lost a lot of blood in the process he eventually succumbed to his injuries and died there has been no toxicology information done so there's no knowledge of whether he was like potentially under the influence of drugs or alcohol which may have promoted him not realizing how much blood he was losing well depending on how deep you get cut you can actually like not feel it very much yeah like that nerves are mostly at the surface so he could have had a like pretty egregious injury and he's in VR so he wouldn't be able to see it I would assume oh that if you're not drunk or high in any form that be able to feel it like I'm seeing enough blood to die but then it's also compulsive and it's warm and warm as is harder to really feel depending on how is like the game you are you might be sweating already so could fit yeah and if you're wearing like a sweater like to be clear I'm not saying that you know I'm not saying that you he probably shouldn't have known to like pop out of the game for a minute like check himself if you get hit if you get hit in the head any-any like if you fall in your head hit something it is bad there's no like there's no thing around that you should get yourself checked out to a certain degree make sure that you're not mildly consult player yeah yeah actually no means the only concussion I ever had was in rugby and I thought I was completely fine and my coach like demanded to drive me home and then partway on the drive home I was like something's wrong and we had to stop then I puked all over the side of the road because I thought I was fine but had a concussion so yeah check yourself out if you hit your head on anything head injuries are brutal very sorry to hear that this man passed away on two different news yeah this one kind of interesting you want to do gaming disorder is now a mental condition or to the world health supposed to by hey yo on the forum yeah yeah the original article is from Forbes here and I will just click continue to article because that's not a parent I did not okay do you have gaming disorder a newly recognized mental health condition probably well let's find out let's find ya let's see let's diagnose me okay gaming disorder is characterized by a pattern of persistent or recurrent gaming behaviors yep okay okay so far I'm screwed Digital gaming or video gaming okay both ha which maybe online okay Internet yeah or offline not over theater okay it's still screwed okay alright manifested by one impaired control over gaming for example onset frequency intensity duration termination and context okay I'm screwed okay yeah to increasing priority given to gaming to the extent that gaming takes precedent over other life interests and daily activities alright alright it doesn't say how many other life interests that's the problem so if it takes precedence over anything yeah I mean would you say gaming is more important than running to take a crap sometimes I've never I've never actually pooped myself but no but like but gamer bladder is a thing Oh totally a thing we're like you won't go pee for like a whole day because you've just been sitting down the whole time you brought all your supplies to wherever your gaming yeah you're eating you're drinking you're gaming the whole day goes by you stand up at all sudden you're like whoa and that puts pressure on your bladder and is actually not a good thing so okay sure number three continuation or escalation of gaming despite the occurrence of negative consequence okay yeah yeah I'm still screwed okay okay but there's a few other things here okay so the behavior pattern needs to be of sufficient severity to result in significant impairment in personal family social educational occupational or other important areas of functioning okay I don't think I've heard one of them previously in my life but not now yeah okay yeah I told my girlfriend that I was grounded on Tuesdays and Thursdays so I could raid but that was a long time ago okay a long time ago yeah this sounds like some of the some of the some of the like celebrities and stuff who have been accused of sexual assault we're like the defense's that was a you know what you're disordered man that's it that's all there is to it you were disordered yeah there's no denying it okay the pattern of gaming behavior must be may be continuous episodic or recurrent see oh maybe it recurs then you're done alright but yeah yeah but it's at Mei Mei so the gaming behavior and other features are normally evident over a period of at least 12 months in order for a diagnosis to be assigned although the required duration may be shortened if all diagnostic requirements are met and symptoms are severe so what happens if your so this inclusion basically means that in a could you be forcefully hospitalized in a more socialist country like say for example yes I think some people would argue Canada is pretty darn socialist yeah it could be that your tax dollars could be spent rehabilitating someone from gaming disorder so the inclusion in the you're gonna have to rehabilitate me in the WHL guidelines will mean that it will officially become a health condition a diagnosis that can be used by doctors official healthcare other healthcare workers and insurance companies so you can't be because there's some cases where you can be admitted to like a mental health hospital by someone who isn't yourself right that's a thing right uh I can speak from not my own personal experience being admitted but I definitely know someone who is admitted okay not if they're so good you pure committed to a hospital for gaming addiction it's like not of your own accord to be clear this is not gaming addiction this is gaming disorder Gaming disorders Gaming disorder gave me a disorder because it's broader could someone bring their kid I'd be like my kid likes League of Legends so the League of Legends it's illegal sorry yes if you're gonna be the ignorant parent okay my kid is addicted to the wall the wall yeah okay the wall the wall the lol yeah okay could you put them in a hospital imagine this like that has its own like essentially like white padded cell doesn't have video games could you have gaming disorder so bad that you need disability pay oh my god oh my god the twitch chats like they like League of Legends that's a disorder oh yeah bird that was pretty good I like that oh so wait but do they take away your gaming stuff if you have disabilities because then then wouldn't they just be paying you to indulge and you yeah but like that's like like okay I don't know what that what amendment it probably is there's probably some amendment where it's nobody's business what you spend your money seriously yeah it's just like in much the same way that you can like be disabled and you can be getting like you can be okay like you can get this I don't know what the government money is called because there's all kinds of different government money for different like there's disability and there's out of work but not disabled and then there's out of work temporarily and then there's like mental health disorder out of work and then there's like welfare I don't even know what welfare is exactly but like it's something to do with is it called welfare in Canada I don't even think so yeah yeah like I don't know some kind of social services some kind of stuff there's lots of different names but like I don't think they're allowed to tell you hey by the way the reason that you're not very functional is that you've like been super addicted to drugs for a long time and your brain is addled you can't spend this money we're giving you on drugs like I actually don't think they can do that so if they can't do that how do they prevent you from spending money on a graphics and they're not going to take things from you so I'm not gonna take your computer they're not going to tell ya like I don't think they can do yeah so you just get paid to play video games I mean if we're gonna do this like if we're gonna you know if we're gonna do this then let's just have a minimum guaranteed income and get it out of the way which we're working on to be fair Canada's working on that there's a pilot project somewhere in Ontario some little town because it is time like if if we're the the only option here appears like you're gonna go socialism there you go full socialism okay oh man this is this is this is gonna be there is gonna be some lawsuits and there's gonna be some whoa like some public admitting in order to get disability insurance or disability money yeah and like whatever can you imagine like it said specifically insurance companies can you imagine insurance companies being able to charge you a higher premium because you got diagnosed with Gamer disorder when you were like a kid or whatever like can you imagine what my goodness and this is so fake can we can we pay attention that to like it's really vague holy cow like if I if I like update a little mobile game under the table at dinner one time is that like impairing why my grandpa doesn't like it then that's what made your family function man yeah like holy cow all right this is cool this was posted by Tim Orff on the forum the original article is from techspot here and this was something you said um I'm 100% certain that I played EverQuest or Wow or something when my mom didn't want me to like did I did I like interfere with family functions we moved on to a different topic okay so edition over there this is [Laughter] [Music] awkward so okay so proposed DMCA not an actual thing yes proposed it's a DMCA exemption would allow people to resurrect dead online games this has been brought us it's pretty quiet the Museum of Art and digital entertainment my biggest reason why I like this yes is because honestly gaming companies have been in a really weird spot yeah it's not even entirely their fault I don't really have a choice No so like Blizzard going after the private server guys anyone else taking an online game that requires server login to some kind so it's just wow is an easy example for this and it's like been very recently largely it's also not a perfect example though because it's like technically still supported so even though it's just like newer versions of it let's use the matrix online sure Oh terrible game but let's use the matrix online someone still wants to play it someone is actively trying to essentially rebuild that game but the people that made the matrix online and the people that owned the rights to the matrix online or the matrix in general can't allow them to spin up their own servers because under like copyright style law that would be not defending your copyright or something it's it's not defending your something I think it's copyright so with this exemption that would mean that you don't have to go after these people to defend your copyright mm-hmm you don't have to that's no longer a thing so these gaming companies would be able to just let people you build small tiny little communities around their games that they don't want to or can't support anymore and it says in here EA the Electronic Arts online services shutdown list includes more than 300 titles and servers dropped out of service in the last four years and so anyone who tries to resurrect any of those things is going to end up with a seasoned assist notice from the copyright holder because otherwise if EA themselves ten years down the line and we had seen gaming franchises get resurrected after ten years of inactivity that's the thing I mean look at okay Serious Sam yeah would have been an example of that I don't know if it was ten years but it was a lot yeah anything valve does yeah anyway the point is if they ever want to resurrect that IP the fact that they haven't been defending it all this time weakens their copyright claim yeah against all of it so it's a big problem now something like WoW is confusing because with wow what people are trying to resurrect is like wrath of Lich King Burning Crusade and classic with are three different versions of Wow but why was still running and still exists yeah so it's in a very gray area I don't think I don't think you'd be able to win with this one because then how do you define a patch versus an expansion and how quickly can someone actually do this in Exeter etcetera so the last time this was brought up in 2015 it was shut down because the proposal because the specific games mentioned in the proposal could still be played over a LAN but the new request argues that local multiplayer is not really a thing anymore yeah it's so if you don't have the option it's almost never to play it on a land Nintendo still doing it and the servers are shut down then effectively it's just gone you can't have that experience anymore yeah and why for what doesn't make any sense I I'm a huge proponent of this and I don't think this is gonna stop companies like EA from being dickbags but it will allow people to ignore that anyways and be like well this is the DMC exception I'm just gonna run this anyways what's up oh sorry I just oh yeah yeah okay it's the last last topic sure posted by alluminium tech on the forum um Netflix ads HD are streaming to Windows 10 in the uwp app and Microsoft edge which we actually think we might have a better understanding of why 4k and HDR would be exclusive to Microsoft edge it actually there's some there's some things like especially in this that are a little bit more complicated to figure out why than what we did but in general edge seems to handle color color and some other video stuff better than other browsers which is weird sucks in like so many different ways but it's good at that so you can get HDR Netflix if you have a premium net fix plan you use Microsoft edge or the universal Windows app if you have Windows 10 with the fall creators update if you have an HDR display if you have an Intel 7th gen or newer CPU ambi not supported and if you have integrated graphics or a gtx ten series with three gigs of VRAM or more AMD not supported that's a lot of that's a lot of stars and asters yeah okay what is a premium Netflix plan is there non-premium Netflix plans yeah you're just like 1080p or 4k or whatever like I have a premium one so that means you have a 4k streaming plan yeah it costs like another six bucks a month or whatever Oh wasn't that included at some point I had no idea I got on the Netflix bandwagon like super late okay yeah all right so that's pretty much it for the show today thank you so much for tuning in you know guys again no no floatplane we will never see you guys again because he's going to Flo place oh yeah we've actually got a bunch of really cool stuff over on Flo plane right now should I go on to the actual site I want to do it on the site sure I want to do it on the site gonna be confusing for people again I already wasn't able to do support quest for this week sorry if you sent in a support ticket and you're like what the heck it will be responded to this weekend probably not tonight so I have to prepare for the stream probably not tomorrow because I'm doing a big 24 hour charity stream probably not Sunday because I'll still be doing the 20 hour charity stream and sleeping but either Sunday or Monday and it's a long weekend so I'm including Monday as in the weekend you're gonna have to stop doing those 24 hour streams we've talked about this I know it's 20 this time it's 20 yeah it's we're saying like 20-ish we're talking about it he's like yeah like I don't know what it is every time I do one of these 24 hours dreams I get sick yeah and like even if I sleep enough hours like I still feel like crap I'm like yo dude you're old yeah it's happening exactly the same I specifically act so the theme with this one so the stream that does the best is my like birthday charity stream mm-hmm and I think why is because I do a whole bunch of games but I do each game just for an hour and there's a reason why it's there it's it's my favorite game from that year and we iterate one game every year so I was trying to recreate that idea and someone suggested what if you just do games from 2017 so I went okay I'm gonna do interesting not necessarily good not necessarily bad but interesting games in 2017 so like battlefront 2 is gonna be involved oh yeah because we'll just talk during the stream about the loot box controversy and what actually happened with the game what happened at Yale like I stuff so to be games eating disorder confirmed yeah pretty much yeah no yeah exactly good call but yeah it like games that are discussion worthy is what we're gonna do a wood so so I axed a whole bunch that were actually discussion worthy because I was like nope nope nope nope nope I need to get this stream shorter so I cut it down to 20 all right i boo floodplain okay so that's a placeholder thing right there don't ignore that yeah but it looks like Kyle has a video up USB see all the things if you are subscribed to bit wit specifically but would altra yeah Kyle also has a thing here wait have we been fishing stuff live on this still yeah no I don't think we have oh well people aren't clicking public then dang it hooray okay I will your employees now yeah okay so there are if you ever actually tell people how to do it I don't think you did yeah Nick did super late but you never did did you did you told me not to make that video that I had already fully planned because you would do it no I should have just done that um I told me I should down to Leah's best case under 35 bucks that's are you live on YouTube oh dang okay mm so no one's been pushing public great all right I I did I published this which also has a description this thing's sick by the way cool 144 Hertz 300 bucks us Wow IPS 1440p Wow 28 inch Wow killer absolutely killer that's cool like the crushinator um we got it from an eBay seller the same guys who sent over that that pretty cheap ultra-wide like a while back interesting that's pretty cool handy wake up tech this video was done cool Oh brilliant oh I'm on oh well reasons why we don't use the site that's still being developed on um okay so that's fair that's fair what you said just there you were fair to me just now so to explain to the viewers who are probably like what the heck he's on his creator account so his creator account isn't technically subscribed to himself I think yeah I thought we fixed that but that might have been overwritten or no no you you fixed it for Kyle oh yeah but like it was like it was a temporary fix like a dumb fix like not a real fix wait what is this oh yeah why you do this to me what you can do is also not working I hate you so much I hate you with all of my heart and soul great all right all right so what do we got over there this is a cool video oh that's I've been waiting to see this thing for seven years the chiller resurrection is real there it is check this out that is a CPU cooler right there that thing you're looking at that I'm lifting up onto the desk so we got to originally make that thing it was the first oh man hold on did I work in and cix yet just trying to think I think it was my first summer with Yvonne so I've been like 13 years ago yeah so you resurrected a CPU cooler from 13 years ago yeah yeah so it's like actively cooled and all this kind of stuff that's it's like it's like refrigerant cooled it's pretty sick we've got a tech quickie on Dolby Atmos and DTS X because a lot of people actually didn't really know what they were by the way I always suggest it today and I was very surprised that we haven't done it we should do it tech working on crypto currencies oh we haven't in it Oh was it just like a long time we that was a long time ago is this does it movies maybe do a new one John's working on it okay cool Yvonne was giving me crap about it just like Austin did one I'm like yeah so did we she's like well he did one recently okay we'll make a new one um what else we got oh the beginning of this video is sick like it's actually awesome it's like epically cinematic and stuff what this is the lenovo 25th anniversary edition ThinkPad like isn't this just way over the top for why did oh my goodness that is ridiculous it's all just for fun yeah yeah we have the review of the dankest gurga Namit keyboard the ergo docks easy that's got LED lighting on an ergonomic keyboard because why not Dale the sleeper is live noise this has been really well received this is not I think strictly speaking as powerful as the last sleeper PC but it's super small 6 core processor and it's in this epic epic chassis really cool build tech showdown part 3 is up and the conclusion goes up tomorrow for those of you who have been watching tech showdown but I've been a little disappointed feedback on part 3 is a lot better part 3 is kind of where it picks up so part 3 is where you're gonna want to go watch it over on I'm surprised it's gonna be four parts um I didn't expect for parts when we were shooting long story ok so I think that's pretty much it for what we've got going on right now yeah cool there we go although I thought I had like like an exclusive behind-the-scenes that maybe I forgot to post I think I did ok just you know remember the market public see it's confusing because they're know there's marking in public in the CMS which we have to do and then there's like remembering to like post a thread in the forum now when I just want everyone to move over to the site I'm like it's not ready yet I know it's not right don't do that alright so thanks for watching this week see you again next week same bat-time same bat-channel thanks boy 
life you can tell what the ball oh boy we um are late and for that we are sorry only by 19 minutes need 981 at 9:00 depending on how you count it we don't technically have a new start time five o'clock but I don't know if we ever officially announced that Colton changed it because we were never on time anyway the point is this time we were learning while I was learning Luke was showing me a different streaming software yeah so this would be the first win show streamed on OBS yeah not necessarily because we think OBS is unequivocably better than xsplit no which it isn't but because xsplit has had an utterly game-breaking bugs for us for the last couple of weeks that has made it take about half an hour at a forty-five minutes of extra time after the show to D corrupt if I the corrupted video output and then upload it to YouTube so it's been kind of a pain in the arse which has mostly resulted in us like downloading the vaad off of twitch so that we can mess with it which takes a while because it's an hour plus long stream sometimes twitch takes a while to process that then you have to down which all makes sense which sense and is fine it's just a pain in the butt and we don't want to do that anymore so yeah the LAN show to be very clear there's pros and cons with both on OBS what else do we have this week oh yeah rate the news so Nvidia announced the Titan V and you can have one for the value price of only three thousand dollars we'll talk about what exactly you get for your money AMD and Qualcomm join forces for always connected pcs else we got nice hash was breached 64 million dollars of Bitcoin was stolen that valuation is going to constantly change so about 4,700 coins and this is in rapid-fire Ashley but damn AMD silently lowers Radeon rx 560 specs wah-wah start with the interesting news and with the super bad news alright hold on I'm updating I'm updating that nice hash number was 4700 coins stolen right so that is now seventy six point six million because Bitcoin has been like whoa lately it does that alright let's roll that intro ready [Music] that work like I knew it like that you like yeah you let you like those indicators maybe show me your indicators I almost made a very specific way too far joke but no it's good let's move on Titan V oh yeah let's talk about the Titan V V as compare we just you know what I've got a given video a lot of credit here for doing the right thing with this graphics card now this was supposed to buy max okay this is posted by max settings on the forum and hold on a second and the original article here is from a non tech I think it's kind of neat that max settings shared a post about $3,000 graphics card so Nvidia did the right thing here rather than confuse consumers by calling their product iPhone X but then 10 Nvidia called it Titan V instead of like Titan 5 which incidentally would it isn't the fifth Titan hold on a second now you got the Titan you got the Titan black it's gonna depend you've got the Titan X you've got the Titan XP and the XP PC and the X P P so no technically it is the six Titan now if they hadn't screwed up and had both a Titan XP which was you know what if you count what it actually says on the shroud yeah there you yes cuz the Titan didn't have the black filled in on the Titan word the Titan black did but it was the same same silver shroud then weight the Titan you know hey which one had the actual black shroud hold on we might be missing one here kepler maxwell pass gal Titan Titan yeah what was a Titan loves a Titan black boy which one actually got ya able to see a picture though which one actually got like a black shroud no so it was after it was the Titan X that got a black shroud yes okay okay cool so if we nor the one that didn't get a pee on the end of it the Titan acts Pascal which I basically did ignore so I think I could I can stick with that did we make a video for that or do we just rant about our way I don't think we did yeah I don't think so if we agree that only graphics cards that we do a review video of count then this is the fifth Titan okay okay that only we do it the ordered one what a way to yeah I heard yeah Wow I so I reached out to Nvidia yo are you guys providing review samples of this thing and they said I'm not surprised at all I'm not even remotely they said literally nothing that's the joke um and so I'm kind of sitting here going well okay I'm not gonna I'm not gonna wait around and find out what Titan Z I don't count the Titans either we didn't review it okay this is very convenient definition where if I don't decide that something counts it doesn't count this is a fun way to live the world live the world also it's live my life it also wasn't a different GPU perceive the world interpret the world yeah that's true is it was two GPUs yeah there see it mind you Titan black isn't the difference and it's not even that much blacker it's just black text oh yeah minor details um okay so right what do we have to say about the Titan V last night I love that the place they announced it was the NIP sconce conference because you know this is a pretty hot announcement you know anyway so they announced the Titan vide has a golden shroud now which is just Oh beautiful perfect why pick another color thank you you know it was like a few generations ago that I su stood their golden stuff so you can take a few generations old bored pair it with your new $3,000 graphics card that was like 67 no it's been more reason than that no no no a soos hold on a second a soos gold board we're making fun of this stuff on the couch at the old house you're drunk no no you're drunk yeah but they were old boards by then okay hold on here here's one of their stupid gold boards was it okay z87 all right all right all right okay z87 still that's how old is that no it's perfect $3,000 grafts card that board boom put it together best combination I mean what is it is this like isn't everything kind of going gold these days like is this just because of the iPhone do I have Apple to blame for this a graphic let everybody else the entire rest of the computer industry is like okay fine we give up everything's gonna be grayscale so black gray or white yeah and we'll put RGB lighting on so everything matches everything else maybe that's why actually because a very minor amount I don't like gold but a very adamantly gold jewelry I don't like whatever but a very minor amount of gold accent on something that's like blacked out looks pretty sharp a ginormous graphics card though is not like a small gold actually go with the monochrome computer which is like popular these days and then have your black and gold Titan yeah what are we actually going to see is there a picture of the backplate ah no because you only really see this side in the backplate unless you're going with like one of those vertical mount systems which was like I'm gonna assume that is black I'm gonna assume it's black this thing looks so I'm probably gonna be just a minor amount of accenting of gold on the side that you're actually having I'm gonna have to redo my how to paint your graphics card tutorial with the new Titan shroud because I can't imagine anyone you should be with it like real silver paint nothing I'm sure that's the thing sounds like poisonous or something I don't know probably it's alright so anyway what else can we say about this thing or paint available for purchase today three grand so that's almost four thousand Canadian rupees which sucks but like realistically soin videos policy on cards that are not intended for gamers is that they don't generally seed them to gaming press but gaming press wants to know how this thing performs for games and gamers want to know how this thing performs in games so the way that we see it we're kind of taking one for the team here we absolutely have to get one and run some games on it and see how it goes from there cuz the specs on this thing are ridiculous this is the same GPU as the Tesla V 100 which is apparently a $10,000 graphics so really we should all stop complaining because you're giving a $7,000 discount beautiful no no no no complaints here give me four this is targeted at machine learning scientists who want to simply install the card in their desktop PCs and not rely on a special server or storage or networking so it keeps the Titan branding as opposed to geforce titan and it'll have massive memory bandwidth yes it's using HP m2 memory 12 gigs freakin gigs of it and it has whistles HBM 2 to be clear a hundred and ten it says dl in here but I'm sure that means dual precision teraflops so that's 9 times Oh deep learning teraflops sorry that's 9 times the deep learning computing horse power of its predecessor 1450 5 megahertz boost clock this is a massive 815 millimeter squared I believe this was the largest of all time like single monolithic die I don't remember if it actually was but it is it is very close a tsm's did I already say 5120 CUDA cores holy crap so one side for Titan vs Li for compensator ah no no so that's really interesting guess Lionel um so so this is so the previous Titan XP was 38 40 CUDA course so this is a new architecture this is Volta and it has many many more CUDA cores and it has envy link connectors at the top but this was actually a developing story right as we were starting the LAN show there's a thread over on the Linus tech tips forum where people are talking about this apparently NVIDIA has come out and said it not only does not support us Ally because it doesn't have SLI fingers yeah it does not support Indy link so the fingers are there but Envy link is I guess considered to be a data center feature and not something that you would need in a single system so Nvidia is coming right out and making dual card configurations for gaming and then also for to be clear it doesn't matter how they market this people are going to use it for gaming yeah so now dual card configurations will still work for some workloads like something like SolidWorks doesn't require an v link or an SLI connector you can just have more GPUs in and it'll just you use more compute but where the cards need to communicate with each other not having NV link will be a disadvantage and for gaming they're just like nope you know last generation on generations ago we took away three-way and four-way on this stuff now we're taking away two-way this is just one card persistent boob done ha vapor chamber cooler 16 power phases 250 watt TDP and Wow it gets the GV 100's full unrestricted FP 64 compute and tensor core performance and the only real thing that differentiates it from Tesla is memory capacity memory bandwidth and the lack of nd link functionality it uses the standard geforce driver stack freaking cool huh okay well I'm excited to see how this goes interviewer writes there is no gaming information at all yeah we're on the Titan V page this is not like what in videos done in the past year they've gone like Titan Titan Z was a perfect example of this where they're like this thing is was it that one three grand - I think so Titan Z was really like this thing is thousands of dollars because it's a professional product not for gamers and they need to go on legree grand yeah retailer websites you go on NCIX or Newegg or whatever and there'd be banner ads using like nvidia assets that are like titan z the ultimate gaming performance yes like okay is it or is it not well this one there is absolutely nothing in there that's cool because it's cool because if they want this to be the non gaming thing that they keep on saying that they are original Titan was supposed to be yeah so this is just kind of coming back to its roots a little bit yeah cuz it's strayed pretty hard um all right AMD and Qualcomm this was posted on the forum by username the linus portal i don't know what a linus portal is i'm gonna try not to be weirded out by it I'm sure it's I'm sure it might not be your portal yeah yeah different would be a different linus like it's confusing anyway the original post here was from Engadget Boop aimed um Qualcomm join forces to power higher end connected pcs so they're going up against Intel's isom compatible systems so in a nutshell they're teaming up to make all these connected pcs on AMD's rise in mobile platform using Snapdragon LTE modems to enable gigabit connection speeds okay so apparently the pair of the processor and this like always connected chip will make it so that you can play something like League of Legends anywhere without Wi-Fi yeah okay I mean this is actually something we're talking about like just last week on the way show yeah yeah I mean more connectivity for these devices that now I mean a device like the LG Graham the last generation one not the one with the 8th gen processor that one's battery life is not as much but something like a last gen LG Graham is getting 9 plus hours in like a battery life test and in real usage can get well over that like sometimes 10 even 12 hours so having a device like that just be able to be connected literally all the time is obviously desirable so and you could theoretically have a laptop that was more performance it wasn't the performance of the laptop that was hampering the game you could play it's just this chip in particular that we're talking about so you could get a higher-end laptop that also has this Snapdragon x16 LTE modem and would be able to game other things just on that powerful system probably gonna be plugged in so we have our first all AMD laptop like not of all time like I'd probably at some point like eight years ago of moderner like - tech tips covered one like I don't remember it there's a long time ago Asus sent us over a gaming laptop that's got pull air a Polaris GPU and a rise in CPU so we're gonna be checking that out pretty soon cool AMD is finally relevant in laptops again or maybe they're not I don't know we haven't tested it yet but they're are they got design wins and that's a lot more than they could say over the last couple of years oh boy so I lost about three hundred dollars okay okay I'll say that the original article here is from Reuters which I will confess I did not know how this was pronounced until like less than a year ago I thought it was like Reuters goods yeah and like whenever I heard people say Reuters like just kind of you know on the periphery I thought they were talking about like steroids close attention that's funny I don't think I've ever attempted to pronounce it like with no pre-knowledge yeah I heard the name before I read the name yeah well you know what I've had enough of your I've had enough of your comments twitch chat which I don't even have to look at the twitch chat to know that I'm gay like skinned alive over there yeah so nice hash which this puts me in a bit of an awkward position because we didn't go as far as to recommend it Oh in our recent video part 1 of our Bitcoin / cryptocurrency mining exploration but we did show it we did talk about what the service does and it was cool and we were using it yeah which means that when they got hacked earlier this week we lost about 300 bucks but I'm not gonna complain because the total amount of money lost is tens of millions of dollars the headline is 64 million because that's based on what the value was right around the time that this news broke but it went up last night was huge I believe was the last night or the night before um it was yesterday morning or like yesterday yesterday your early morning I think it spiked up to like 1800 or something like that it was crazy do you mean early morning isn't like 2:00 in the morning um well I don't know I was at a shoot and it was like 11 a.m. my time 10:00 a.m. my time okay so it was like whenever it was a very recent that it spiked up and the value of this down yeah and even now it's like Tamale and more ya bout than it was when it first happened so this isn't the first time this has happened there's been so in this one put in particular there's about 4,700 coins stolen bitcoins stolen in in all there's been nine hundred and eighty thousand bitcoins that have been stolen from exchanges alone that total is worth more than fifteen billion dollars at current exchange rates and that is when they calculated it before so it's actually worth more now so here's the thing that we should probably do because there's over eight so there's been at least three dozen of these thefts on digital currency exchanges since 2011 including the one that led to the collapse of Mount GOx which was the largest Bitcoin exchange at the time so what I'm kind of thinking is everyone who wants to get into Bitcoin seems to figure out how to buy it or how to mine it and then I feel like it's really easy to get lazy about the other stuff you want to get into like cold storage how to store it how to dump it because the literally the only way to be 100% certain that your Bitcoin will not be vulnerable to a hack is to store it completely offline whether that's a hardware wallet yeah or whether that's a cold computer but by that I mean like a computer that's not on a network yeah so some people will even go as far as to store handwritten notes in safety deposit boxes in traditional banks and I think that's really something that is worth discussing because a lot of people are going into this whole bitcoin slash altcoin cryptocurrency thing thinking that once they Google a little bit and they find you know who the reputable exchanges are or the reputable wallets are once they find that they've got the equivalent of a banks type of security and to be clear if banks are not perfect either by the way but in traditional finance usually if a bank gets heisted depends depends how much money is in the account for example yeah I don't know all the details I just know I've had forever ago my like debit card got ripped off yeah and a few thousand dollars where the transactions went through it and I got my money back pretty quick so that is heavily dependent on your account you're a financial institution you use a credit union which back then may have actually been an advantage but maybe no longer is oh we could talk about it more offline anyway the point is people Google around they find something that looks for putable yeah you know everyone on reddit up voted or whatever else and then they kind of go okay yeah my money is safe there but in truth there is so much more to it and like as much fun as it is to buy some Bitcoin at 70 70 150 is I think what I got in at a little while ago and I I had I had abstained for the longest time and finally I was like you know what forget it I'm just gonna I'm gonna buy some as much as much fun as it is to look at that and go whoo I doubled my money over the last three weeks which I did and I'm feeling pretty good about it unless you actually know how to get it out and convert it into a fiat currency right now with the volatility of Bitcoin and for that matter real currency in general people gonna be pissed that we're saying this but like even just looking at charts and stuff it is so it's not even just necessarily fall a tile because volatile means that it dies right no it means it varies okay yeah so it is extremely freaking valen it's extremely volatile and to me currency is not currency unless it can be exchanged for goods and services and right now you cannot buy a car with bitcoins at the local dealer that's right yeah there's gonna be like some person yeah some dealerships somewhere I don't care that is not the point the point is that if you wanted it let's say let's say I bought $1,000 of Bitcoin and it went up 10x and all of a sudden I had $10,000 I wanted to go to like Joe's used auto auto lot or whatever and I was like yo I invested $1,000 in Bitcoin I'm gonna buy a car I cannot do that unless I cash out today so that's what I mean when I say as much fun as it is to have this money until you can actually exchange it for goods and services it's just paper and I kind of slurred my words there which was funny because I kind of said surfaces you could buy surfaces if you whatever you're into cars surfaces razor blades I don't care so I mean is that something that we should be starting to maybe do like a maybe make part of that multi-part Bitcoin series I think so looking into videos online about this kind of yeah one of the least documented processes is wallets and storage of your coins and one of the most important parts about it is wallets and storage of your coins and when this nice hash thing and people weren't saying cuz you're talking about the Bitcoin community right so people weren't coming at it from the angle you were yeah it is like you need to bring it into fiat currencies people were going at it from the angle if you need to secure your Bitcoin people don't understand okay loll I'm a duckie is paypal currency then or not yes because it's in a real currency it's just stored with PayPal Bitcoin is a real currency and by real I mean fiat currency I mean a recognized currency so yeah to be clear on the volatile thing I looked it up it does have a negative connotation sure it can have whatever connotation it wants but that doesn't change that it's a very volatile but it is but it's going up so volatiles like apparently not entirely both how specifically a negative thing okay so Radek in a bad way which it is it can it has mostly been erratic in a good way yes when it's not except when it's not which does happen and you might get screwed on a trade because I'm like oh ho but like so far holding has been a very good strategy like someone bought real estate with it recently right we actually specifically said that yes someone somewhere is taking it but there's coffee shops that take it there's there are sites that take it we're looking into trying to take it for floatplane subscriptions it's a thing there's there's certain areas there's a cruise that you go on that you can go on that you pay for with Bitcoin and I think all the transactions while you're on the cruise are done in Bitcoin there's some stuff but it would be it's not it's not the norm is what we're trying to say yeah so essentially taking it out of Bitcoin putting into USD is a generally safer way to deal with it but your USD you can still get stolen everything can still get stolen that's kind of an important thing to understand but stuff like cold wallets holding your storage and offline computers the effort types of wallets using Hardware while it's all this kind of stuff isn't as well-documented as most other things in the Bitcoin world and when something like this nice hash thing happens all the smug commenters are going you will you can't have it in a hardware wallet or an offline wallet like most people responding or like what is that how do you do that yeah and there there there is some resources on it but not a ton yeah yeah well let's uh we'll have a look at that we'll figure out a plan I think part two is gonna be the more optimized mining machine okay so that's mostly done we actually would have had the motherboard today but it got sent to North Carolina for some reason yeah long story okay um or Connecticut I don't know it was a us something and it had a C in it so okay it was a city or a state and it had a C at the beginning was in California I know that much anyway so so we would have had a ceases nineteen GPU board even though we're not actually gonna be using all nineteen slots so the reason for that get this is in order to run ninety why well Bitcoin what do you think no I but but even for Bitcoin why would you get that board because then you don't have to have more boards and more RAM sticks and more CPUs how expensive is that board two hundred bucks hmm yeah yeah so you save you because I mean that the cheapest the cheapest CPU is like forty bucks from Intel anyway but are you putting them all next to each other no the way that it works is you use use extenders yeah yeah so the slots are it's it's like this thing's hilarious I'll bring it up I haven't the b250 mining expert it's literally cut okay I thought you were just buying some like crazy server board not like dude this is like this is all wall yeah look at this thing is ridiculous there's all the slots it's like that's amazing so anyway the funny thing about it is that in order to actually use all nineteen six of them have to be Nvidia sgp 1:06 based mining specific card okay exactly six I think like the manual for this thing is HIGHlarious because check out these oh so these power like different slots and there's like a whole diagram and stuff and then there's like this diagram for like what types of cards you can install in what ratios in what slots in order to actually populate all 19 of them so these guys have to come up the same power supply as this one in case you were wondering and don't quote me on that I looked at the manual a couple hours ago actually there's two - RAM slots - RAM slots I'm even surprised there's four SATA ports ah yeah yeah what would you need that for it I would have expected he's got a USB 3 header - or one yeah yeah so so yeah so that's gonna be part 2 part 3 we're gonna take a look at a sick miners and then maybe part four will start to get into storage how to sell maybe like a part 5 it would be cool to take a look at some of the tools that people are using like crack into not just like Google not not just like googling what's the USD to Bitcoin conversion but like cracking has been terrible but yeah okay but some of there's a lot of different tools that PD are using taking a look at a handful of them and kind of going okay well here's some of the advantages and drawbacks of each of them yeah yeah I mean I think I think it would be something that would be very beneficial to the community at large like Krakens charts are super nice and really rapidly updated yeah but which is well half the time the site doesn't work well that's a problem which is you know a pro and con yes yeah speaking of conversations we want to have let's talk about I think no thing yeah so you don't drag stuff I know I realize that okay so I want to talk about that we actually thought for the longest time that don't know that well we thought and we might still think we might not be sure what we think okay but we thought that you weren't allowed to show man nips on Twitter are we doing it so I'm gonna find out once and for all hold on I'm gonna find out cuz we actually like fairly regularly have twitch staff watching our stream so we're we're doing our Mac Weldon's one today no no no we are going now normally Luke jumps in with the hands and covers the nips yeah and to be clear I'm not gonna do anything sexual because that's clearly in their terms of certain which I have wondered about K cuz if there's a girl on stream yeah and some dude puts his hands in front and it doesn't show her nips I bet you that would still be banner bull even though that's exactly what we did just with - what if he hasn't like an 8 inch or like a 12 inch buffer cuz that's often what I yeah like yeah like a 12 inch buffer like this yeah could be sexual yeah but maybe this isn't you know maybe okay so here it goes are we gonna get banned sorry apologies headphone users because that was probably terrible I didn't see any staff in check oh oh what's going on now oh I thought I thought the page actually like disappeared I was like whoa that's free we wrote the twitch Internet okay so Mac Weldon makers are the shirts that we're wearing believes in smart design premium fabrics and simple shopping Mac Weldon makes super comfortable clothes whether it's underwear socks shirts under shirts hoodies or sweatpants and this is awesome they have a line of silver underwear and shirts that are naturally antimicrobial which I'm very comfortable I'm not gonna I'm not gonna get judgy okay you know I'm not saying anything about you know our audience and you know or like twitch in general and what are the odds that you might benefit from an antimicrobial shirt see we're not going there but antimicrobial means that it'll help eliminate odor and if you've ever been to a land party I'm not gonna generalize but I will say that there are certain people you'll find someone at any land party who should probably be wearing an NG microbial shirt it's got a little bit over that's what I'll say yeah that's what I'll say so they want you to be comfortable and not smell and if you don't like your first pair you can keep them and they will still refund you no questions asked so go check them out at Mac welcome calm and get 20% off your Mac Wheldon purchases at Jeannie dot us slash small D small V big G big Y big I or small L I don't know which it is so I'm gonna paste it in the twitch chat slash it'll be under the video and you guys can click it because that's a better way to handle that right now is fantastic oh are they are they are they upset about me oh no they're just they're just making jokes about it Oh excellent good I'm never sure if I'm gonna make people mad when I'm like what cuz here's the thing is like the culture today is one of not being able to say things that are true sometimes and like I'd like to think that most gamers like back when I was going to Land's and you're there for like sometimes 48 hours at a time nobody leaves so you clearly haven't showered in two days and we've been sitting at your computer and here's the thing when you're gaming when competitively gaming the odds of you sweating in a stinky way are actually higher than if you were working out because stress sweat stinks more than exercise sweat so you're sitting there gaming you're like stressed out for two days you're probably gonna smell and I mean I'm not some people forget there ll say forget some people are bound to forget their deodorant that they definitely do own so but you never know like sometimes Mambo people are gonna get upset about these things and it's just like you know you never know what you can what you can actually say okay I mean this for a quick second alright this is where I don't know because we are in a little bit of like outrage II kind of culture yeah yeah sure but then we're also getting older yeah so is this like the old people say offensive things kind of situation like are we becoming the racist grandpa exactly except about like people who smell yeah like totally different category of stuff yeah but is that bar lighten up are people who smell becoming a subculture that you can't discriminate against TV because here's the thing all sniffs are equal I'm not gonna name any names but we had a situation at Lynas media group where I had to speak to an employee about his or her hygiene and I'm really not gonna name any names I'm not gonna give any hints as me no wasn't it oh I thought it was me oh no that was pajamas yeah it was a separate issue that was professionalism / I've probably given you crap about being sweaty at some time or another but yeah but no I'm not gonna I'm not gonna say who it was no I don't even know who this is okay no because that's because it's private well you did a good job yeah thank you um so I actually did have to speak to an employee about hygiene at one point and I really wasn't sure how to do it because is that discriminatory it's a difficult yeah because it's a difficult thing work they weren't showing up like in an in an indecent garb like they weren't showing up in an in a thong and no pants like something that's like clearly you know sexually inappropriate how's that yeah and and so I can I can tell you my solution in a way that will make it very difficult for you to track down who it would have been okay but at some point in our process of doing annual reviews I added a field about professionalism and about maintaining appropriate personal hygiene for the sake of the comfort in the workplace of your colleagues because I dunno about that field because I've been in there because I wore pajamas to work that was the professionalism oh yeah yeah yeah and so out of the way yes shorts yeah the short side I've never cared about the shorts have never bothered me it was it was when you would literally like roll out of bed go to work and be like wearing a shirt that's like stained and like pj pants that are ripped to hell like to the point where yeah to the point where it was a little indecent yeah every single pair of pajamas that I have as a hole in the crotch so anyone why new pajamas so so these are things that I've actually had to worry about like am I being the the the the the anti deodorant issed you know grandpa yeah it's like you shouldn't smell bad who knows that's it like I'm running into these situations that is a cultural thing like there's people who are anti anything that's unnatural shaving deodorant that kind of thing and you know maybe I'm crossing a you know a personal boundary by being like yo you smell in a manner that is my discomfort level is about here right now you know yeah I have no I have no idea so there you go anyways next sponsor they're like no this is irrelevant old people don't care about bad smell which is you know what no I'm not gonna get into it because maybe some of the best like groomed people that I know and I think it gets to a certain point where it becomes it becomes it's not that they don't care I think well okay some of them probably don't care like some people okay so there's two things there's actually a number of factors here I think some people get old and give zero FS about anything yeah and they're just like Yolo also I'm close to the end of it so I'm just not gonna stress about this stuff other people get to the point where they can't really care for themselves properly and like that makes them unhappy actually or it would be extremely tedious to do so so Steve Jobs apparently didn't shower I do know that that is a thing like not showering and letting your body's natural flora like take care of itself is apparently theoretically a thing I haven't actually like smelled someone when you do about grime in that case I don't know like what if you get dirty like a file you know that's my finger I smell like I know how this works not that kind I guess he smell fine he's no neutral no I didn't actually notice any smell different if I can walk into the room and nobody notices I consider that optimal yeah okay okay sorry let's just jump into our next thing savage jerky I'm going for delicious turkey the sirs yeah it's already

installed right now so I don't have like a super loaded up browser yeah yeah so that seems like a pretty good one I have for I think not a crazy man all right got a couple more topics here there's a leaked Intel sorry for point at some point yes there is a leaked Intel roadmap that's on wucf tech so we take it with a grain of salt this was posted on the forum by none lock 21 and apparently until cascade Lake X is confirmed for a TD T it'll be arriving on X 299 /lg a 20 66 in late 28 team so none of this is surprising at all because that's what Intel does every generation they want you chipset with CPUs then they do a CPU refresh then you get a new chipset then you get nuts okay um also this is groundbreaking news coffee like X s s not X will apparently get dual-core processors and there'll be more processor updates in 2018 along with Z 390 and B 360 chipsets blah blah blah blah blah blah no mention of eight core processors so those have been rumored and Gemini Lake goes in n series processors features ten watt TDP and four slash two core variants so these are 14 nanometer gold montt cores and those are apparently coming in the 52nd week of 2018 so end of next year ok neat now let's talk about stuff that's coming a little bit sooner this display post posted by aluminium tech on the forum and the original article here is from Qualcomm comm they've got a new CPU cutting watt wall the 845 mobile platform um yeah your next phone your next phone will have one of these unless you buy a phone right now yeah and then we're like Oh jeepers one or an iPhone and it will be a little bit better um how much better you say 25 to 35 percent faster than current Snapdragon 835 it can apparently record 480 FPS video at 720p or 240 FPS at 1080 that's pretty cool mind you like most phones absolutely kill their image quality yeah when you're recording at high frame rates so even though it is 1920 pixels by 1080 pixels it looks blocky and like trash yeah so yeah although the 25 to 30% faster thing is gonna be interesting to check out yeah this is the first qualcomm SOC to have a secure processing unit so this is a new subsystem to protect data like your fingerprints iris mobile payments sim and more that's interesting but it's probably like a super cracked already why would it be if it stores everything locally yeah but there's get their name right now American government thing oh I have to FCC in my head that's obviously not it yeah and I say NSA has NSA tools or whatever those of leaked repeatedly and considering how delayed this is compared to apples I wouldn't be surprised if it was like developed in cohorts with them I know it's like tinfoil Hattie but these things keep coming true so I don't know and those NSA tools keep leaking so like random pirate groups keep getting access to them and that it's super not secure so I don't know I wouldn't absolutely trust it but hey cool uh in other news this was originally posted on a non tech comm AMD has apparently silently lowered the spec of their rx 560 yeah to basically a previous generation spec update an AMD statement given to our sister site Tom's Hardware confirms the two rx 560 variants and AMD also noted that AIB partners so like sapphire Emma sighs whose etc would be responsible for communicating a given rx 560 models specifications Wow so you can either get 14 compute units or 16 compute units buying an Rx 560 this is trash and AMD should feel terrible and they should not do this so with an Rx 560 let's go with the 14 compute unit model you can get 14 C use and 896 espies now comparing to an Rx 460 which has 14 C use and 896 SPS what are the big reasons why people are pissed off is because it's essentially a 460 like if you want to sell slightly disabled 5 6 with less room why don't you just sell for 60s how complicated is that yeah Wow it's Polaris 11 like honestly it's the last time that like this is not the first time for AMD I don't know if you know this but I still remember one of the most pissed off that I have ever been about a technology purchase was when I bought a Sapphire Radeon 9600 non-pro and this was back like almost 15 years ago like back when that was a somewhat respectable card but nearing the end of its lifecycle so it was like a it was like a value gaming card so I already had my own gaming rig but I was upgrading my parents computer so that my siblings could play like Sims or whatever and what happened was sapphire called the card Radeon I ended up on the phone for literally hours with both sapphire and AMD support over this when I found out that this 9600 and in this case it was not marked in any way on the box that this 9600 was different from a normal 9600 when this 9600 had I forget what the difference was I think it had a narrower memory bus or something like that like it had a like a 64 versus a 128-bit bus or something along those lines and there were no specs on line other than the specific product page for this sapphire card which was like hard to find on their site that made it clear that it was not a normal 9600 I thought we were past this I don't really get why tech companies feel the need to rebadge especially in this manner when they already had a product that they could have just sold as this now there are some differences the new one compared to the 460 can go down to a lower TDP so as low as 60 watts versus approximately 75 watts and it's available with just two gigs of ram instead of just being a four gig part but I feel like it would have been a lot less misleading to just call this a two gig 460 and just make it available especially because like in their update statement to be clear they said we're working with all we're taking immediate steps to remedy to this we're working with all Adam board and channel partners to make sure product descriptions and names clarify the Cu count so the gamers consumers know exactly what they're buying that's not going to work we apologize for the confusion this may have caused that was intentional that's BS the reason why it's not gonna work is the vast majority of consumers don't know what a freaking Cu is yeah of course not we're looking at a model number our model names all they had to do and they've even done stuff like this in the past all they had to do if they were gonna do a cut-down one is call it le or Excel or something along those lines like there's plenty of precedent that already exists for how to do this properly and they just decided not to this is really bad for AMD because AMD was very much in the for the people yeah they're supposed to be like you know the good guy underdog like that's their brand image that ain't reject the last like major controversy that I know of on what this scale should be but this doesn't seem to be blowing up as much probably because not an insane amount of people are buying 5 60s and a lot more people had purchased nine 70s was the RAM issue on nine seventies that was the last big time that it was like this is essentially being lied about yeah all right I'm good man sneekybeeky stuff not cool what else we got here okay um oh yeah sure why not Oh steam no longer accepts Bitcoin oh I actually didn't even know that they accepted Bitcoin as payment didn't he the original poster here was vegetable stew we'll go ahead and pull up okay so first of all anyone who was giving me crap about using the word volatile to describe Bitcoin you can go ahead and give valve a bunch of crap for it too because there's all the instances of volatile or volatility in the first three paragraphs of their statement on why they are no longer I don't think it's completely invalid to use it's just gonna trigger some people yeah so yeah there you go so go ahead and get triggered by valve two I actually yeah I had no idea that they didn't accept it so when they first added Bitcoin as a method of payment transaction fees were as low as 20 cents now they've crept up as high as $20 per transaction these fees are passed on to the consumer and they result in unreasonably high cost for games also the value of Bitcoin is only guaranteed for a certain period of time so if the transaction doesn't complete within that window the amount of Bitcoin needed to cover the transaction can change well the normal solution is either to refund the original payment or the user or ask the user to transfer additional funds but both in both of these cases the users hit with the transaction fee again not to mention that this is like a customer service overhead nightmare for any retailer or a tailor they've said they'll reevaluate it at a later date and I don't blame them at all with all of that said are we planning to support Bitcoin on floatplane we want to and what are the obstacles right now you can if you can talk about it so okay the main obstacles right now to be completely honest is everything else essentially is a higher priority the site's not up payments for the current payment system the forum is atrocious and we need payments for credit card to work and we need the new implementation for payments for PayPal which will be Braintree to work and I want essentially I want the MVP of the site to be up I want able to be using the proper domain not going through the forum I want all that other kind of stuff done and then we'll look into supporting Bitcoin but there is going to be more issues once we start doing that how do we deal with fraud okay I literally don't know like on Bitcoin you mean yeah right I have no clue yeah that's fine like what if there's fraudulent transactions there's no I can't go contact someone's bank contacting the it's their wallet like I can't do anything like that I'm not entirely sure how refunds work I think we would be on the hook for the transaction fee for refunds right we're with most services you've got a refund of the transaction fee yeah and if that's if it's a $20 transaction for you that could drive us under pretty fast if yeah like there is a lot of potential issues we're gonna look into it I haven't looked into any of those issues I don't know so yeah maybe I don't know it's just not very high on the priority tier we just need to know can I do this no can I try I would really prefer not then literally working on it right now is it worth a shot come on let's try it you only live once whoa what's bad okay I even want to put a giant disclaimer here last time a whole bunch of people signed up for floatplane on the forum and paid for their access and then we're very upset when they couldn't log in to this site to access it yes just like last time this is not the site that is working right now at all to access floatplane it's the front page of the forum and then if you are subscribed it is at the top of the forum there's a floatplane section yeah I'm not logged in yet right now that that's normally how you access it yeah but you know I mean hey come on you only live only live once right baby oh that's weird I don't I didn't did whoo oh when did that happen can you use your thing no why I don't know can i that things being used by swedish bros for development oh okay so now what i can make you one dang it David you why are you what is this what are you doing well I know he's your counter usually do that and then just cover it with the camera right no I usually use the other one oh yeah okay well do it do a news topic okay or we can switch and I can set up a different account that you can use no it's fine just uh just do a news topic in the meantime it's not in the doc but you might even be able to talk about this while you're covering that and Nick has a link for me apparently Apple is acquiring the music recognition app Shazam interesting I actually did already read about this apparently it's some amount less than a billion dollars so that's good if you're Apple I guess cuz I don't know if I would pay a billion dollars for Shazam but I mean I don't know if this is reactionary or if this is something that they already had planned but this definitely helps Apple address Google's implementation on the pixel on the pixel to rather anywhere where the device is always listening to music around you as creepy as that is and will just display passively on the screen of your phone what what song is playing so other than helping Siri better recognize songs I don't really know what the benefit of this is for Apple but it goes to show you that they are they are sure willing to spend a lot of money to have it be slightly easier to find out what song and also I guess you could have just used Shazam but not do that for a billion dollars that's less than a billion dollars yeah so yeah okay why are you why are you trying to show that my blog wanna I wanted to I wanted to try it I was gonna link it to the other one and then I was gonna like go through and I was gonna you know but yeah there's nothing to use right now oh good like the videos aren't there yet no oh okay I thought they were no okay so we're making that part just work for live streaming oh no oh right live-streaming is gonna be a thing soon yeah yeah alright so right now on floatplane we've got the porsche designs making make sure that you're covering up we've got the porsche design book 1c look I'm driving a laptop oh I actually didn't put that together right away oh oh my goodness we've got our review of the arrow 15 X this is a thin and light with a gtx 1070 Wow it's pretty impressive and they managed to do it with the touchpad in not a stupid location does it can we can we get a little spoiler does it throttle um it's really good okay yeah it's like really impressive we finally yeah pretty much every laptop throttles under combined load though yeah so we finally released a video on Vega frontier edition the teaser for this is amazing yeah this is this was a freaking saga Brandon's smartphone camera showdown which we promised in the next week or two after whatever video I was recording when I was like yo Brandon why don't you do your the smartphone camera showdown is finally up on floatplane so he compares the iPhone 8 plus with the no date with the V 30 with the pixel to excel so we don't have the iPhone 10 in there but my understanding is a is that it is a pretty similar camera to the iPhone 8 plus so I'm not too worried about it we've got the eve V the crowd-sourced surface competitor and then I don't think this handy tech has made it onto YouTube yet either handy tech old is new again so we've actually got a lot of stuff on there including a couple tech quickies there's overclocking void your warranty for example so if you cannot wait to find out then you can sign up for floatplane where you'll get one week ish of early access one week ish it's ish don't worry about it yeah all right honestly I don't know what else we got Oh Nintendo games are coming to the Nvidia shield in China yes no way / weird I actually did miss this yeah I are game console still no no yeah they're not outlawed so what what is that Nvidia and Nintendo's partnership with the switch something something yeah so Nvidia provided the hardware something something so they teamed up in China today Nvidia shield is getting Nintendo games what so you can play new super super mario brothers we Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess and punch-out what yeah apparent all of them have been remastered in 1080p for the shield this is from SlashGear by the way what I don't know where this Mario Galaxy is coming why can't I get this why is it only in China oh I hate you so much Nintendo every time you seem like you're getting cool you're actually not cool and you're just like a little bit cool oh man oh this which is not available in China yeah there you go that sucks alright well I'm pretty much I'm pretty much done thank you for tuning into the wine show we'll see you guys again next week same bat-time same bat-channel bye it starts [Music] [Music] [Music] so it'll give you a warning you 
Any Apple diehard will tell you that some things just cannot be expressed on a spec sheet. These "Je ne sais quoi" of usability or industrial design can elevate the experience of using an object. Be it a phone or a pair of premium toenail clippers from merely practical to... ...ethereal, but at what cost? Well it turns out the answer is $2,500 Introducing the Book One from Porsche Design. A laptop designed to get your motor running And I'll tell you about it right after we keep the LTT motor running with this message from ZOTAC. ZOTAC's ZBOX PCs are great for applications like streaming and gaming They feature Intel 7th Generation core processors in tiny form factors. Check them out at the link below. Okay, so the industrial design is pretty impressive. It's got a matte anodized aluminum chassis with soft campers and polished edges And all 1580 grams of it looks and feels amazing when closed with a hinge design that is subjectively anyway among the best that we've seen on a 2 in 1. It's got just the right amount of resistance and goes all the way around without requiring you to take the screen off first or Leaving a weird gap like the Microsoft Surface Book does. By the way, Porsche Designs claims that the hinge design was inspired by the gearbox of a sports car. But I think it's just as likely that the marketing department thought of that after the fact. Anywho, that's not the only trick up it's sleeve. Like the Surface Book, and incidentally the Starship Enterprise, Book One can also be separated from its base entirely and used as a tablet by holding down the eject button on the side and pulling it apart. A process that is slightly less jank than the Surface Book. The 13.3 inch 16:9 screen is actually pretty nice with a 3200 by 1800 QHD+ resolution and 10-point multi-touch along with support for the 4096 Pressure Level Book One Pen by Wacom that looks as the rest of the product, and that can apparently run for eight months off of it's fun-sized AAAA battery. The I/O is probably best described as thoughtful I mean there isn't a ton of it, but it's really well placed. The base has a USB C port that lets the book one charge in just two hours, then two more USB 3.0 ports for regular stuff and a microSD slot for expansion. Then the tablet portion has a very welcome Thunderbolt 3 port, A 5 megapixel camera with IR for Windows Hello And a headphone jack that doesn't leave the cord floating in the air, like Microsoft's design. So, as advertised it's all pretty in premium, right? Well not so fast. We did find a few skid marks on this road While the keyboard is easy to type on, the key caps are smaller than the keys on the Surface Book Because the gaps between the keys aren't as finely milled meaning that you have a little bit less keyboard in the same footprint. The keys themselves also seem to have A bit of a resistance right at the top of the stroke that puts the typing experience a bit on the fatiguing side if you have dainty fingers like I do. As for the Microsoft precision certified touchpad, well, It's big, works beautifully and actually handles very similarly to the one on the Surface Book. Except that on the Porsche Designs it makes this noise that Well, I don't know let us know what you guys think Finally, the suspension is a little looser than I'd prefer, the screen has enough bezel that you'd think it has like an extra touch bar on it or something and Because of the way the hinge is designed, the detached tablet has asymmetrical corners. Now this stuff may sound pretty nitpicky. But this is the kind of scrutiny that you expose yourself to when you charge a premium for your premium design So should you buy this notebook? Maybe. But not before we take a pit stop to talk about the internals. The Book One had really good specs when it launched. But that was back in April, and yes, I know we're like way late on this thing But, we wanted to check it out anyway because it's cool. The point though is that that was before Ryzen Mobile, moball..? Or, Coffee Lake were things that existed. As it is today, everything but the dual-core CPU holds up pretty well. And thermals are pretty good as a half hour of stress testing in AIDA64 Never made her throttle and noise wise, she never stood out against our offices HVAC. But, you might have noticed that I never specified what graphics card is inside and that is because There's no discreet graphics. So no, you won't be able to play Mankind Divided at 1080p even on low settings. Making it kind of hard to recommend the book one since the new Surface Book 2 has an 8th Gen Core i7 Processor and a GTX 1050 for about the same price, back to whether to buy them I'm the kind of person who would prefer a graphics card to a sexy hinge and a sexy design. But, Porsche Designs clearly believes that there is more to the device experience than raw horsepower, and we'd love to hear from you guys in the comments below. Which one would you lean towards? AIAIAI's Modular TMA-2 headphones system is going wireless! They're launching the HO5, their new wireless, Bluetooth pair of headphones. Now the TMA-2 features more than a thousand possible configurations meaning that you can create your own personalized product that fits your specific needs while being able to change individual parts along the way. Now existing TMA-2 users... You guys are actually really gonna love this because you are not left out in the cold, you can upgrade to wireless while keeping your original sound preferences.

after months of delays and tens of millions of devices shipped by their competitors Apple's late entrant to the home smart speaker game has finally arrived but can it possibly compete with the Google home max I speak her twice sighs armed with the almighty Google assistant yes but it's also a little more complicated than that [Music] Kable mod pro series cables use extra thick wires for a fuller more robust look merged terminals on the component side of each cable have also been eliminated for a cleaner build check them out below despite some people's observations that it looks kind of like a giant toilet paper roll subjectively I would still say that the home pod wins on the design front the seamless 3d mesh fabric looks great from any angle though I would recommend washing your hands before you touch it the capacitive glass top is an elegant haptic and visual interface displaying volume buttons when you're playing music and a beautiful listening animation when you're talking to Siri and we even found the physical interface more pleasing to use tapping or holding volume buttons feels more intuitive than the slide gesture you have to do on the Google home Macs and it's nice to be able to Hale Siri without using your voice a feature that Google removed from all of its home devices wrong now the home pod is small but don't let that fool you it's much heavier than it looks at five-and-a-half pounds and this is thanks to the incredible amount of hardware that Apple packed inside it it's got a four inch subwoofer at the top six microphones around the middle and seven tweeters at the bottom and not just regular tweeters these are really cool for one thing they are horn loaded which allows them to more efficiently turn mechanical energy into acoustic energy increasing their effective radiating area and making them sound bigger than they are and for another their diaphragms are balanced mode radiators meaning that they can produce high frequencies by rippling or low frequencies by moving the diaphragm in and out the old-fashioned way so if the home pod senses that the bass demands will make the subwoofer distort it will actually offload work to the tweeters and there is more to this technology than just using good speakers both home pod and Google home Mac's use special low frequency calibration microphones to give themselves spatial awareness this functionality does allow these devices to map the room around them and then apply automatic bass correction to increase clarity now Apple said in their keynote that the home pod would direct certain musical assets like the main vocals to the center of the room and ambient sounds and backup vocals to the side which is really good news because otherwise an omnidirectional wired speaker would not be ideal a lot of the time so I guess it's all of that stuff combined that made this thing take so darn long and also what allow the home pod to avoid distortion even when it's turned way up so the rumors are true it sounds really really good especially for its size but what about the elephant in the room the Google home max from our evaluation it actually sounded just as good but with a different sound signature while the home pod has pronounced mids and highs that are very forward max offers a wider soundstage with deeper chest-bumping bass thanks no doubt to its dual four and a half inch high excursion subwoofers although this is interesting while max gets significantly louder before it starts to compromise on sound quality at lower volumes the home pod can actually deliver surprisingly strong and pleasing bass compared to the max do we think to its ability to transfer sound down into the surface its resting on okay then so they both sound great but these aren't just speakers they're smart speakers which brings us to the next question we have to answer which one is smarter while both assistants offer the usual fair-weather stock prices news we were disappointed to learn that unlike her competitors Siri on home pod doesn't search the web so while she can rely on native API hooks to answer questions like who is the president of Friends the answer I found is Emmanuel macron at this time she stumbles on novel queries like how long is the average ferret I can't get the answer to that on home pawed ferret typically has a length of 15 inches it's very geebo of you Siri sad although your mileage may vary since some people have reported it working but while that's a clear disadvantage today the two devices are about equal when it comes to response time latency and their ability to hear your commands over loud music and home pod does have one awesome feature that Google home doesn't have yet Siri send a text message what do you want to say with that said home pod does not have voice recognition profiles like Google home does so in theory anyone could ask your home pod to read out your last text message whenever they want I found your most recent message from Edsel hey fire buns last night was amazing speaking of privacy while both devices allow you to turn off the microphones Max is the only one that lets you do it with a physical switch so which one should you buy then we actually think the answer is pretty simple and comes down to whether or not you use Apple music see with a Google home or Amazon echo you can use all the major music platforms Spotify Google play music Pandora iHeartRadio you pretty much name it including Apple music and the same goes for the home pod so why did we bring that up ah because it's how you can interact with those services that makes all the difference here with Google or Amazon solution you get full voice control with everything but Apple music which is limited to next song and pause with the Google assistant and even then only if you are casting your entire device via bluetooth by contrast the home pod does feature voice control with Apple music but only Apple music so if you're using Spotify the only way to control it even if you have an iPhone will be through the buttons on your device and there's some more general inflexibility like we've come to expect from Apple unlike the Macs the home pod does not include a three-and-a-half millimeter jack for third-party speakers and it requires an iOS 11 device for its initial setup that's right Android users and even those of you with older iOS devices you will need to go buy an iPod touch on Craigslist to get your home pod working well mostly working which brings us then to the features that Apple promised that aren't out yet and won't be until airplay two launches later on this year one the ability to connect multiple home pods in stereo and to multi room playback from airplay to devices be they home pods or Apple TVs or whatever Mac's can do both of these things today so then that answer wasn't so simple after all but it's okay I have a summary if you don't have any wooden tables and you're already deep into Apple's ecosystem with an apple music subscription and a bunch of money sunk into iTunes home pod is a beautiful piece of hardware and a fantastic speaker but if you are almost literally anybody else you're probably better off with a competitive offering like a Google home Macs and a ly XA enabled Sonos or even some regular dumb speakers plugged in to an echo dot hey Siri tell me a joke [Music] well this whole experience wasn't very funny at all this has been quite the project so far yeah I know hey Siri read out my last text message I found your most recent message from Edsel

Oh, ho ho you guys are in for a treat today oh This right here is a relic A PC cooling solution that I haven't used since the last time that AMD had a relevant high-end desktop Processor and so what better way to celebrate AMD's revival as a bonafide high-end option, thanks to the thread Ripper 1950 X then by resurrecting what I call The Chiller! A sub-zero liquid cooling device that might not look like much, but like the Uhhh Thousand-year bird-of-prey, I don't want to get in trouble with Disney hmmm has got it where it counts [Intro song]: Lazlo Supernova Okay, so step number the first and I have already done this before but it never hurts to do a sanity check when you're gonna Do something INSANEEEE is To make sure that what used to be a window mounted Air-conditioning unit is still fully functional, so here's your hot side This is called the condenser So this is where your phase change coolant comes to have the fans blow through it and change it from a gas to a liquid This is our compressor, which compresses that fluid and then right over here This is our evaporator So this is where the compressed fluid goes to be exposed to something hot in our case it'll be our CPUs heat And Evaporate, then it gets moved back around to the condenser full load and aida64 About 73 degrees on the cpu okay. Cool. Now, We know that. Let's see how much of a difference we can make There's that hand mark beautiful While that's running we're gonna need a few supplies First up is a care package from none other than the legendary. ?? Funny story like two months before I decided to resurrect that thing [Speech fades out] So since the last time I went sub-zero for like a 24/7 system There have been some changes to the conventional wisdom so it used to be That we used dielectric grease in anywhere where there were pins around the socket and Kneaded eraser was the most popular thing for filling in the bigger gaps around the socket Not so anymore nowadays apparently we're just using Vaseline anywhere where there are contacts, and then we're using this stuff Paint it on to the board because it comes off really easily liquid tape We're not as concerned about condensation as guys that are doing like crazyyyy You know liquid nitrogen overclocking or anything like that Because we are not going that low and it should be noted that we don't have to put this on too heavy Because we're not trying to thermally insulating or anything like that We're just trying to keep moisture out of everywhere that the brush touches Oh, you know what I can probably just use the big brush for this whoa Here we go Daffu Duck Ensue's Technically removing things like stickers would probably be a pretty good idea So again, I'm just really not that concerned about it. Oh look at that, ohhh Abuse, hardware abuse! Yeah, I don't think ASUS is gonna want this board back the other important thing here is that we've gone with a metal top one so this is a Nickel topped version of the block and the reason that's important is that if we were running oh shoot these These Barb's aren't gonna fit. I'm gonna have to go get different ones whoops Okay, then so if we were running a different version of the block this plexi here could crack and over the long term it would Be degraded by the kind of coolant. We're using is that my Vaseline I hear Yeah dog okay, I'm just gonna jam that in there and Vaseline it up I mean the Vaseline is supposed to make it go in easier, but so normally you would really you know cut around Capacitors, and you would do a super amazing job of getting it all nice and tight But the idea is that this is the actual thermal insulation Now the key to any good Insulation application is no air gaps This is literally the worst insulation of all time not every thermal compound is suitable for Sub-zero cooling some of them actually perform worse if you go, too low so this one is WOOOAHAHAH???? SHOOT That was not what I meant to do stop it. Oh, this is goopy thermal compound We also actually have to insulate our block and the reason for that is that if think about it. Metal is quite thermally conductive, right? so if we have below ambient coolant Running through it This block is actually going to sweat And it's going to drip on to the other components of our system if we let it oh One thing we're going to need to do before we do that though is get our tubing attached So there are better tubing's you know what I'm just not even gonna say what I'm using because there are definitely better tubing's for subzero Applications, but one thing that we are doing that's a little bit unusual is I'm using 3/8 inch tubing over a half inch barb And this is kind of a classic Aka old people water cooling technique I would actually expect this to do a reasonably good job like I'm gonna leave this running while I go down and do WAN Show later and I do not expect there to be any condensation on here So that right there Is the CPU area and then next up you really want some of this stuff, so this is another arm of Flex product, and it's just uhh  uhh An insulation to thing that you can that you can throw on to the tubing oh, okay, this is legitimately kind of a problem Maybe with like, a stick. Do a couple layers of this guy followed by another thing that will be different from this guy Is he really putting that graphics card in there again you knowing what he knows from last time Yes, yes he is This is there's nothing about this project that I recommend trying at home Okay, literally Literally dangerous, yeah like how was there enough room for oh? This has been moved like oh look at this That's been shifted Why did I do this? Why am I showing other people this? Like where's this screw from? There we go now you might be wondering if this is actually enough airflow And the answer is yes, so the whole cooling system actually requires three plugs one for the compressor One for the pump and one for the cooling fins now what we're going to do is fire it up for real Kate why aren't those cooling fans spinning play on hey there they go, okay? Dang it Jake this is what happens when you put Jake in charge of zip tying the stupid fans before you start Okay, so now we need to figure out our tubing runs We're gonna go from the outlet of the block and we're gonna give ourselves a little bit of slack and then we're gonna come through this cable management hole here, and then we're gonna go underneath the evaporator, and we're gonna let that kind of pin it down so that the Warm liquid is as far away from here We go the outlet of our reservoir as possible so that it has to travel across the evaporator Before it can be sucked into the pump so right now. It's at 80 degrees Fahrenheit (26.6 C*). Whatever the hell. That is I don't know Fahrenheit Anyone's wondering no this is not to code and also no it will not be staying running for very long There's so many things that can go wrong here So many things to go wrong and what can go right, a cold CPU, is this really worth it *Linus hit his hand on the fan and the camera dude who changed genders twice is laughing* That's dang it oh, I think we're ready. I hope I have enough I sincerely hope this is enough and Here we go again And now we don't actually want to run a sub-zero cooling system without the system running Because then it gets too cold you get condensation for sure We need some heat to offset it So let's see if the system fires up here CPU initialization is going This thing better fire up why is CPU initialization still going System's up cpu fan speed error. That's fine Like I had said before having some airflow around the socket is definitely a good idea Some air flow around the RAM sticks is good as well let's have a look at our initial temps, hey! We haven't even had the chiller running for very long, but I'm expecting them to be pretty good What 52 degrees how doesn't make sense Got water flow right 52 degrees I'm finding that very confusing The only thing I can think of is if it's grabbing the temperature off of an external sensor and then just using an offset Because the CPU is probably not that cold like that coolant is still close to room temperature Okay, so for our next trick. I'm dropping a thermal probe into the liquid and Finding out how cold it is that we're running so far so, but we're at about nine point two degrees Celsius and let's see what aida(64) has to say about our temps here ah Ah, that's more like it So yes that CPU temperature was reporting with some sort of offset near the socket, which as you guys might remember? We insulated so the CPU diode at somewhere between 10 and 20 degrees That actually makes sense because you should be a little bit over the temperature of the coolant while you're at idle Okay, WAN show's over and whoa it's working Fantastic! HOHOHOHO There we go Minus 20 degrees on the coolant minus 17 degrees on the CPU freakin Fantastic We're looking at CPU diode temps that are under the ambient temperature of this room by seven degrees Seven degrees less than the ambient in this room freakin unreal So, it's frosted over Anywhere where the evaporator is expose to the air which makes perfect sense you? Guys can actually get a pretty good look at what our uninsulated tubing would look like Check that out remember this tubing is black you guys remember that black tubing It's just completely snowy, and then this stuff insulates better than that stuff for sure But you see the pump would also have to be insulated here check that out cool, right Okay, so by this point you guys are probably wondering Why? Why? well believe it or not this was at one point in time anyway a fairly popular way to get sub-zero temperatures Relatively speaking and the reason for that is that compared to direct Dye cooling with an evaporator this doesn't have to be custom done. So you don't need any HVAC certifications You just go buy a window AC unit strip it down and do this compared to that it's much cheaper and Obviously compared to regular water cooling you are able to get Much much better result so even now that it's been running for about five minutes We are still sitting at less than thirty degrees on the diode something that is going to get us significantly Better temperatures, which could lead to better overclocking Now as for the disadvantages those. I hope are fairly obvious disadvantage number one is that to do this properly is extremely time consuming And... Ummm Yeah very few people end up doing that everyone kind of does it pretty Janky. disadvantage number two is it's extraordinarily difficult to relocate your PC because this thing is Exactly as heavy as it looks Disadvantage number three it's loud like check this out Putting my mic into the thing here super loud and disadvantaged number four is it can in some cases Result in dead hardware if you're not careful about your insulation now for my part I'm actually expecting like as quickly as I did that I'm expecting my insulation job to have held up just fine I'm gonna shut this baby down, and we'll take look at it here though, so yeah, we're doing just fine here This is barely even cold to the touch out to the very edges of our insulation here the problem is just that it's easy to make a mistake And Anything worth sub-zero cooling is probably expensive and high-end so unless you can afford to lose that stuff You might not want to take the risk and the last Drawbacks a lot of drawbacks taken a long time is power consumption and heat so in addition to your system You have to run an air conditioner that not only Doesn't cool down your room it actually spits massive amounts of heat into your room so you can Air-conditioned your air conditioner, so you can air-conditioned while you air-conditioned So thank you very much Asus for sponsoring this Fun little video where I showed you guys a whole lot of what not to do Thanks you guys for watching if you disliked it You can hit that button but if you liked it hit like get subscribed maybe consider checking out where to buy the stuff we featured at the link in the video description zenith extreme We've been really happy with this board for our thread Ripper testing also link down There is our merch storage has cool shirts like this one as well as our community forum, which you should totally join 
- did you see the razor phone - where's your unboxing of the razor phone - why haven't you reviewed the razor phone yet well because I didn't get one but that changes today razor just sent over a care package this is it the 64 gig and only version of their new flagship first-ever mobile device the razor phone oh that's how the box opens okay so there's a big long letter about how much you love razor ok that's good then razors characteristically excellent packaging you've got a razor sim removal tool wow that's actually a really cool sim removal tool alright cool yeah they've got my attention so far we've got well it's there so there's a Type C - three-and-a-half millimeter adapter a type C - type C charging cable a wall wart and the razor phone itself so I watched the keynote I have a pretty good idea of what to expect from this device but what I actually didn't do is watch anybody else's unboxings or reviews of it because I really wanted to save my impressions for myself and first impressions this is a really really big phone like I might not have grabbed the right devices for kind of hands on size comparison here I've got an iPhone 10 and you can see it absolutely dwarfs that this is definitely a phablet sized device I've got a Galaxy s8 it all right there it is next to a pixel 2xl so those are much more similar in terms of their size it's not actually a lot bigger in terms of its total width or its total height compared to the pixel 2xl but there is something about blockier phones that makes them feel bigger in the hand with that said something that I think Razer has found a good balance of here is that it's still because of it because it's got nice flat edges you can still kind of support it like this and using it one-handed is not going to be the end of the world in a pinch especially if you're someone who has larger hands than I do okay this is just not working so let's try 2.4 gigahertz maybe I'm just entering the password wrong twice in a row it's gonna pop the sim out of my 5 T since I'm actually done writing up my review on that one and I'm ready to start using the razor phone as a daily driver and we'll see if maybe throwing a sim in it it's gonna give us enough of a data connection to get through the setup process here yeah sure well I guess I'll just do this 250 mega update on my mobile data hopefully it fixes the Wi-Fi issues maybe that's what it's for you know what it's okay everybody needs an update now and then we have successfully updated razor phone let's start over Hey look at that alright we have a Wi-Fi connection no problem Cal be right back once I've signed in wow the display has kind of a blotchiness to it I'm not sure if you're gonna be able to pick that up on camera but you can really see on white white backgrounds that it's not quite a pure white can you see that has kind of like a grid kind of pattern to it interesting you know so far it actually reminds me a lot of like one of Sony's older experience it's got the fingerprint sensor on the right it's got the kind of squarish blocky shape unlike Sony though it's using a basically stock Android with just a couple of modifications oh it looks like that 120 Hertz display is enabled right out of the box I feel smooth I'm still seeing that slight pattern but honestly it's the kind of thing you could probably get used to in exchange for that sort of buttery feeling to the interface I'm liking that oh I could get used to that okay so first thing I want to do here is get the developer options enabled so that I can turn on yeah there we go okay interesting so we've got a live framerate counter that's telling us exactly what refresh rate the displays running at here so you can see that when the image is static it's actually turning way down to as low as 20 frames per second then when you move around actually you could see it hits there while it kicked in it's jumping up to 90 frames per second really cool okay I'm gonna just fire up the Google Play Store and get a game that I know supports 120 Hertz we interrupt this video to bring you the real reason that I couldn't connect to the Wi-Fi Alex here walked in complaining that he couldn't get a device on the Wi-Fi and I realized what we're out of IP addresses that's probably also why all the smart light control modules aren't connecting yeah so I'm calling tech support on my razor phone sounds okay I guess mailboxes fall I have to try again later worst IT guy of all time look at all this crap look at all these devices why are there so many devices what is bad address nobody names anything you know what let's just kick it off we found the button so I'm just gonna open it right up to all the way down to let's say 30 and hopefully we don't step on anything okay try and connect we'll give it a second okay yes and back to you Linus okay so we are back to our unboxing of the razor phone let's go ahead and fire up Simpsons tapped-out a game that supposedly supports 120 FPS on this 120 Hertz display and of course there's an update it's not as many as this phones getting okay age to continue I don't like it but I'm 31 oh go away tap to play anonymously to start playing well the game some things in the background you know what that pattern that I noticed before really only noticeable on plain white Wow those speakers get really loud I gotta say I was impressed by the speakers on the pixel 2 and the pixel 2 XL but these absolutely blow them away okay I'm not sure that this is the kind of game that benefits like the most from high frame rate but that's cool I mean the zooming when it's not hiccuping here is really smooth okay next order of business we could try another game the ones that are included world of 10 they don't have a lot of color in that game titanfall ass Hey okay between now and the full review I'm gonna have to spend some time in that one like I'm I'm picturing giant robots like like twerking you know late no no Brendon no oh wow all the all the no over there okay that's fine I'll spend more time on the gaming aspects of the phone before the full reviews the last thing I just want to have a quick look at is the camera now this is something that Razer has already even acknowledged that they're gonna have to improve a little bit you know other than like ah quick test shot of something I'm not going to be able to do much with it now but I mean other than some you know aliasing around his head or whatever I'm not seeing anything that immediately makes it stand out as being like terrible here's a pixel to excel so yeah there's clearly some finer detail in this guy already but you know really it's gonna come down to how usable it is in the day-to-day so there you have it unboxing of the razor phone full review to come if you guys dislike this video you can hit that button but if you liked it hit like get subscribed me but consider checking out where to buy those stuff we featured at the link in the video description also down there you know what I'm not gonna do the full outro forget is just unboxing 
let's copy the world's ugliest fan did you want to go to warehouse now and start doing water cooling and then we'll head out okay after let's go look for water cooling and then yeah we can come back both teams were given permission to do their water cooling with stuff from the Linus warehouse problem is Luke and Linus didn't actually get the message so the BS mods guys get the first crack at it tech showdown is brought to you by synergy - in partnership with g.skill be quiet and cable mod synergy - makes sharing your mouse and keyboard between multiple computers so simple that anyone can use it learn more at the link below we could do cream accents with a brown base we have to commit to something it's two o'clock okay I don't think it's the greatest idea the rat but like I think for us to win this we really needed like a super killer idea and I don't necessarily think that we have one so let's do it so let's get this banged out as fast as we can do you want this kind of candy color or do you want this kind of this kind of candy color okay here's here's the crazy idea I'm sorry I'm changing gears on you again that's weird but if this is around could we use the gold caps and do the face brown but that would be that would match the fee that would match the color scheme but not the overarching theme forget it I I said it done the thing and we're all gonna just forget it Brandon wasn't recording that anyway this is a pretty ambitious project that we've put it in front of ourselves everything's flat we're fucking you know we're gonna lose right let's just try not to get humiliated I don't want to give them the satisfaction okay I'm just gonna cry I think because that's probably fair let's just give up let's just take all the candy off the shelves literally jam it into our Tower and build a computer that could have to be kind of cool I think we could make that work a dark spin to Candyland the dark side of candy and like the the like Dion Candyland is like if we could illuminate the Candyland sign I don't think that would even be that hard and have the D like kind of falling off and not illuminated Oh God okay that is a lot of work that's like two hours of work yeah but the Candyland sign we're probably pretty important okay what color green no because it doesn't look like grass so we get fake grass from somewhere and then I'm not worried about the color too much so we could just go with brown okay so I think what we're gonna do is kind of divide and conquer rather than trying to tackle everything together we have the general theme kind of figured out Luke kicked my ass with his diorama skills in the second text showdown something like that so Luke is in charge of making this the well you guys like talk a little bit or something you know okay and then I am on transforming this desktop surface and figuring out how the scenery is going to work so I'm gonna Home Depot he's gonna Michaels we're both gonna look for some inspiration and I'm like gonna roll with this vlogging it up over there this dress right now so I'm gonna get this finished so I got to coat this I gotta figure out some paint coatings for some other stuff since I'm covering things I might as well figure out this horrible zit on my nose now that about a beer shot I'm finding this place pretty oppressive I just got to get out of here and working with Luke the worst it's the worst so we've stripped down the case we're know we're painting it painting it inside outside some accidents colors pulled the tray out everything plastic forever is gone we're gonna be doing hardline water cooling hopefully two GPU and CPU we also might use these gigantic this is a 400 millimeter reservoir these might be actually mounted onto the desk and not inside the computer which will bring the hardline across the computer in the desk and tie the whole thing together so we don't have an actual plan really but we made it look like we did element we we just wanted them to sweat a little bit so we when we get a good mod it's usually revolves around a lot of elements so we're trying to just develop each key element is some of the things we know that we're gonna use we're gonna have we got to have movement right we know that we're gonna do some big candy like giant well we hope if as long as we can find them okay we want some big giant yeah lollipop whatever things we're gonna of course light the underside of the desk we're gonna try to use the sawhorse desk parts we're gonna try to close those with acrylic and then we were probably gonna do something with some sort of signage or a whole front skirt on the front of the desk and do some sort of signage like call it something-something candy shop like women twinning winning team candy shop we just ran into an empty plant right here and so we know that our competition is in the store so we're gonna let some air out of their tires to slow them down just a little bit you know I just I thought this was gonna be like you know a by the rules competition these guys just keep camping it up in my aisle here camping it up in my aisle they're trying to scope out the competition Chaz if you guys have anything worth hiding okay that's good we are so fucked just five that's the under side like it's fine okay so I have a little bit of this gold left I don't think it's enough so I bought another one but we can return that if we don't need it this was just in my car don't worry about it ignore that so this is I believe the same gold but new it's not the same at all so that's cool these are these are rollers so what I think I'm actually gonna do is I'm gonna go chocolate brown on the edges and green turf on the top so the desk actually has like a two-tone look and then do you want to do chocolate brown for the legs too ah not necessarily I still think we should get the wrapping paper which it just occurred to me we appear to already actually have oh okay so I wonder if we can just borrow that here's a white there's actually a bright red spray balm in the workshop right now okay check out my toy store haul as well okay one quick thing I got the fondue machine they didn't really want me to vlog in the store so here's my vlog getting the fondue machine I also got a bunch of multiple chocolate for it oh yeah so how's Matt guys yeah I figure we could just like really cross that out and write something else I think I think this will be good that's like accessories and stuff you you have to buy them at like see their heat sealed you have to buy them as like sets this is just a bunch of extra stuff so I have I have like a palette that's cool and I have like a cage that goes around it if we wanted to have like some finished candy in there I have I tried to get as much of this kind of this could be like wasteland behind the computer because I don't know what that absolutely this could be yeah and then our hazmat guys could work on that I got the hazmat guys come with hatchets for some reason so I bought them to throw in some brooms for them so hazmat guys have brooms now what they only came with hatchets yeah I know right we're like pickaxes or whatever you would call that remaining plutonium with pickaxes yeah sure why not so right so this is the like area behind it or whatever and these guys are like working on it or whatever yeah cool I love that so we should leave us to like a fairly significant amount of space behind the computer if we can okay maybe the behind the computer isn't even hidden on an angle behind it it's like beside it over here and then Candyland is over there cool that's good you sound worried I'm worried I'm like I could not possibly be more worried right now we are we're gonna get our ass I think them being allowed to do like super crazy multi loop water cooling and us not is like not really fair oh I don't think that matters I think that's a complete waste of time super matters oh no way are you kidding me what yeah but remember like he's gonna go wow there's his water cooled yours is not your club absolutely we are not allowed yeah doing it now is probably an issue yeah even then I don't think look I think if we try to go head to head that's for the keyboard if we try to go head to head those are stupid like hardline water-cooled build versus hardline water-cooled build we're gonna get our asses kicked anyway they're gonna do a better job of it right so we're better off executing our style better then they would execute their style or not better than funner and I know fun is not a word but that was sort of my point we're the funner team you know it's like we don't really get it but we seem nice you know one of our shirts don't fit yeah we're going for the sympathy vote Brandon where do you want this lens synergy to is designed to be easier and more seamless to use than synergy one features include sharing from anywhere with automatic control of any other computer without reconfiguring SSL encryption to protect your keystrokes from attackers dynamic networking so it detects the best route based on your setup and being able to always run in the background on all your operating systems so you can set and forget and it even works across VPNs and tricky home networks if you get the pro version you can get access to other cool features too like clipboard sharing dragging and dropping files copy pasting lock screen synchronization and lots more got some nice piece thanks Brad still live we got stuff from the candy shop stuff that stuff our chalkboard that we talked about enjoyed we got some of these lights right here that we're gonna use above and below RGB yeah RGB you everything all the stuff and then our sparkly stuff with Georgia we got some sparklers glitter glue stick things and then all they associated like you know supplies paint rollers that kind of crap nothing too exciting so alright let's get moving go in there yeah we're running out of that back you don't have to worry about the edge so diesel yeah by the time I gotta clean up a toast okay okay we're happy to do that in the morning okay all right so and what I can tell those guys haven't done anything that looks good so yeah we could just wait a whole nother day don't touch that because it's not secured in any meaningful way okay the idea evolved from a flowing river of chocolate that the user can consume into having it be like like a candy place themed into having some things maybe be wrapped in foil but then be chocolate inside and then into now the tower is a factory and outside is like where the workers harvest the materials to make candy look I can't even stand up what well no that's fine we'll just hot glue everything I mean all of those changes occurred within a span of a couple of hours meaning that there's been very little decisive action and very little time to act on it wait the decisive action is the action I mean this is what this is what I'm talking about because we get fun you know like that's what this project is supposed to be about it's not supposed to be all like serious who can build the best you know modded computer or whatever look at these guys are like so I don't have the paint booth set up right now which means that this is pretty much our best bet like people white this isn't ideal talk tape talk to hit me with the talk tape nice throw okay they're measurement of a good day how much painting you can do maybe it isn't about painting I'm gonna spring into action springing into action for day two let's get on this first things first I need to get another coat of my stain on here got my got my dark brown stain I got one here you know got other ones that I can't show you cause it's too hot for TV I mean that's hot to some people I think like maybe we could do like brick Street kind of deal and use like KitKat bars and have the wheelbarrow there and they're like laying them out on top like GPU or something totally cool this is honestly not the one I wanted they didn't have the one I wanted in stock but I think it'll get the point across it's probably good enough yeah so I'm gonna work on getting this while you finish disassembling I'm gonna work on getting this cut out and I want it to line up as perfectly along the sides as we can get away with I've reflected a lot last night and I'm coming into today feeling a lot better actually today is a fresh day it doesn't have to be affected by the failures of yesterday so this is what we call the comfort surface I think we need a most pad or else we'll lose some points because their comfort surface is like exceptionally uncomfortable yeah oh it's not exception I mean it's a little uncle you definitely read mark your hand like real fast this has to come off and I need to do some more staining tell me objectively does it look bad like no and you're gonna cover it anyway so what does it matter okay while Luke and lioness are going with brown the other team is getting started with good old-fashioned white hopefully their plan for painting won't be as big of a letdown as it was in scrap yard Wars yeah son I just finished cleaning off all the stickers that were on the case so we could paint where those were and then just kind of wiped it down with dinner to get it ready to paint okay so I got full coverage on the first coat I'm gonna let that sit and it might take a couple hours I'm not sure how to get these grates off of some of these parts but I'm working on it great did it yes will make it great again we need to jury-rig ourselves some way to hang things once we're done painting them honestly Luke I think a good enough paint job plus our X Factor could be enough to do this maybe because I honestly don't think the judges are gonna look that closely at the paint the biggest mistake yesterday was not just like going with something and then just like frantically doing it I think that's what we need to do for the next three days well that's yeah yeah I don't know if I agree on the first part but that is what we need to do now there's kind of a wild card here because like I really didn't see this team assignment coming I mean literally no one did something not even cool yeah oh yeah you were here for that right yeah Colton's like what that doesn't make any sense I'm not gonna be the kid on the schoolyard that wins about the teams I'm gonna be the kid on the schoolyard who makes the best of his crappy team Lucan Linus might have a shot at making up for their slow start they're going full speed ahead with whatever half big idea they have but will it be enough find out next time on tech showdown 
The original inspiration for this video came when Alex craftily turned the Surface laptop he'd just finished writing the review for into his daily driver, and realized that our model, unfortunately only has 8GB of RAM, with no way to upgrade it. But does that matter? Well, the commonly held wisdom for years has been that, unless you're some kind of power-user, 8GB ought to be enough for everyone. Well, hold on. With Windows 10 and Chrome devouring memory like Kobayashi at a hot dog-eating contest, we've been regularly seeing memory usage over 20GB just from web browsing on our writing workstations. So, we started an investigation. EK Water Blocks' MLC Phoenix lineup is designed around Quick Disconnect Couplings, and brings a modular approach to connecting and expanding your water-cooling loop. Learn more at the link below. *plink plink* *intro music plays* So, our testing rig has a Core i7-7700K, a GTX 1080Ti, and a 1TB SATA SSD. Then, we equipped it with 4, 8, 16, or 32 gigabytes of RAM. At each stage, we tracked pagefile usage with Performance Monitor, then, opened up tasks until we noticed activity. Once you reach the threshold where the system starts to swap data out of RAM and onto the boot drive, you might not necessarily see the system slow to a crawl or anything like that, but you could see a dip in performance or responsiveness if a tab or an application that you go to access has already been paged to your SSD or your hard drive. So first up is Chrome. We'll be looking both at how many Chrome tabs are open when Windows starts using pagefile, and how many are open when Chrome eventually becomes unusable. Bear in mind that not all tabs behave identically, I've seen some use 2GB of RAM on their own, but, we chose a mix of webpages that we feel should be representative of typical browsing behavior. With 4GB of RAM, we actually hit the pagefile with just 5 tabs open, and then after 13, Chrome crashed. Alrighty then. With 8GB we got to a respectable 25 tabs before any of them got swapped out, and managed 40 before the situation went totally south. With 16GB of RAM, we reached a fairly unreasonable 80 tabs open before pagefiling, and then Chrome finally crashed at around 180, then with 32GB of RAM we got all the way to 165 tabs before paging, and, frankly we didn't feel like going through actually kind of laborious process of opening and loading 350 to 400 webpages in Chrome tabs, just to see the program fail. I mean, if you want that many tabs, you're kind of doing it wrong, and this is coming from me. So, let's move then into gaming. If all you're doing is playing a game, I think you might actually be surprised by how little RAM you actually need. "Deus Ex: Mankind Divided" for example, which recommends 12GB of RAM, didn't suffer too badly, even with only a single 4GB stick. Although, with that said, "Rise of the Tomb Raider" had some serious issues that were only sorted out by bumping up to 8GB of RAM. After that, though, performance didn't change for either of them when we jumped to 16GB or 32GB. So okay then. 8GB for gamers? Actually, maybe not. I mean, what if, *whoo* you don't painstakingly close down all of your running applications every time you launch Steam? For those folks, we popped open our 10-tab test suite and an instance of Discord, to see if 8GB could handle it. And, surprisingly enough, there was no difference at all, with the exception of "Rise of the Tomb Raider". That game seems to really love its RAM. So then, depending on the game, you probably won't need 16GB of RAM to play it, but, it won't give you a ton of breathing room for the future, and you might need to limit your background tasks for the best experience. So then, what does anyone need more than 8GB of RAM for? Well, I would argue that, any kind of workstation is going to want at least 16, and you might be surprised to find out that even more is pretty common for those kinds of systems. Alex actually has a number of Excel documents from his engineering days that, believe it or not, will not even open on a computer with 8GB of RAM, and has had some simulations of fluid flow or suspension movement that crash out, even with 16GB of RAM. Video editing can also be very demanding. But, this is heavily dependent on your workload. If you're cutting together short to medium-length 1080p videos, 16GB should be plenty. But, the sky is the limit here. If you use tools like After Effects, you can expect 16 to be an absolute minimum, and as the complexity of your project increases, so does your RAM requirements. Our latest season of "Scrapyard Wars", for example, because of how darn much footage was in the timeline, immediately crashes with anything less than 64GB of RAM. Although, for more information about how much RAM you need for video editing specifically, you can check out our video here, where we tested it with up to 128. Now, it should be noted that all of what I'm saying concerns system memory, and not video memory, which is used for loading in 3D objects and textures for your graphics card's use. This is very important for games, and also professional applications, but is probably a discussion for a different video, one I can almost guarantee will end with, "well, it depends." ;) One interesting side note before we wrap up is that as we moved up from 4GB of RAM, our system boot times actually got slower. It was only at most a second more, but, (and this is cool), if you're aware of a Windows feature called SuperFetch, it actually makes sense. SuperFetch tries to intelligently pre-load some programs into RAM so that they'll launch faster when you need them. So the idea is that if you run out and buy excess memory, it can still be used for something. Which doesn't mean, though, that we're saying to do that. As you might have noticed, RAM prices are out of control right now, so our recommendation for general users and gamers is: 8GB, if you're looking to scrape by and be ready to upgrade later, and 16GB if you wanna be comfortable for a while. As for the workstation users out there, well uh, it depends. ;) And you know what else it depends on? Yeah, it doesn't depend on that at all, forget it. Corsair's new Light Loop fans. These things look freaking incredible. They have dual RGB lighting loops with 16 independent RGB LEDs in every fan, that are split between two separate loops, allowing for nearly endless customization. The included Corsair Lighting Node PRO enables dynamic lighting effects with other Corsair LINK-supported devices, and they've got complete PWM controls so they can be controlled anywhere from 600RPM all the way up to 1500RPM depending on whether you want them to be quieter, or cool more efficiently. So check 'em out over at the link in the video description, because come on, baby. It's RGB.You know you love it.

In July 2014, man did not yet know the dangers of backing just any random Kickstarter or IndieGoGo campaign, and swimming in childlike naivety and blind optimism over 2500 people backed Jibo. A social robot companion that the creators, Jibo Inc, promised would do everything from making video calls to reading bedtime stories. And this was long before the Google assistant or Amazon echo existed. Now, for my part, it was pretty obvious that Jibo was too ambitious to be anything but an enormous belly flop onto a bed of hot coals. But coming off of the success of my then recent flaying of the Brunton Hydrogen Reactor, I was looking for a way to up the ante. I was looking for something even dumber to roast, so I bought one. Three and a half years later... My very own Jibo finally showed up. Was it worth the wait? Was it worth nine hundred US dollars? Of course not. Don't be a Jibo. This video was brought to you by Be Quiet. The Dark Bass 700 is extremely versatile and features RGB LED lighting, plus a Tempered Glass side panel window, and more. Check it out at the link below. Laslo - Supernova Hey Jibo... Return to sender! Looks-wise Jibo is kind of like the illegitimate love child of Pixar's Luxo Jr. And Eva from Wall-E He, and Jibo is a HE, stands 11 inches tall, (27.94 Centimeters) with a glossy plastic finish on a body that is essentially a stack of rotating blocks that allows him to move with, "Hey Jibo, spin around." "Don't mind if I do." ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Amazing naturalness! This is something that the team there did really well, and as you can see his movements are fluid, nearly silent, and made even more lifelike by his awareness of his environment. (snapping a dozen times) Jibo is equipped with six microphones that he uses to orient his face toward you when you speak to him. And we've even seen him turn towards the sound of an opening door to see who entered the room with the two cameras at the top of his face. One of them is for taking photos, and the other is for depth perception and facial recognition. Yes. Facial recognition! Jibo can be trained to recognize up to 
15 people, casually including their names in his responses, wishing them Happy Birthday or randomly interrupting their lives to rattle off a fun little fact. Sometimes it really does feel like he's looking at you! which makes it all the more troubling that there is no way to disable his microphones or cameras other than just shutting him down. Which you do by scrolling to the settings on the touchscreen portion of his face, that tragically isn't OLED, giving it a gray glow that leads many people to see his face as: - Two beady little eyes, and a giant mouth, rather than as a single darting and blinking eyeball.
- IMMA FIRIN MAH LAZAH! BAAAH! One surprising feature is that he has an onboard battery so you or the kids can unplug him and plop him down wherever you might need him. Nice! ( ͡°ꔢ ͡°) Okay, but what could you actually need your, chubby robo buddy for? Well, compared to other smart speakers like Google home and Amazon echo, shockingly little. Jibo can't play a YouTube video, or a song from Spotify, he can't record a video or audio clip, he can't read you a bedtime story, he can't sing you a lullaby, he doesn't support personal calendars, and if you tell him: "Hey Jibo: Repeat after me or to execute your last command again." *Le Waiting* (Jibo): Umm...I can't remember what I just said. My short-term memory will get better in the future though. Ok then. I mean, at least it can answer the kinds of questions we used to love firing at Siri back in 2011, right? What's the weather outside, how far away is the moon? (Jibo): The distance from the Earth to the Moon is about three hundred seventy four thousand six... Things like that? Uhh.. Well, yes and no. Jibo has limited resources for finding answers to your skill testing questions including Wikipedia and Wolfram Alpha. So that's good, but also Bing. So... He doesn't always get the answers right. Hey, Jibo, who is the president? *Le waiting again* *Le Beeping* President is it common titled for the head of state and most Republics. Hey Jibo, who is the president of the United States of America? *Le waiting once more* *Le Beeping* The President of the United States is the head of state and head of government of the United States of America. "WRONG!" - Donald Trump (Billionaire and President) 2016 Speaking of things Jibo can do but can't do well. THE NEWS! Unlike Google home, which offers a laundry list of news recordings from major publications, Jibo only offers news from The Associated Press. Which might even be passable if he didn't read it out in his own voice. According to the Associated Press... *OMG Le Waiting!* Japan's U.N. ambassador, Koro Bessho, says the international community must keep the pressure up so... No one wants to listen to a talking computer for more than like two sentences tops. Speaking of speaking, I've got kind of mixed feelings about Jibo's voice. The sound is more robotic than most of his competitors, but his tone and inflections are sometimes industry-leading in there naturalness, though this is usually only the case when he's giving you a canned answer, bringing us then to Jibo's personality, which somehow seems to match his physical form pretty much perfectly. He's quirkier than the more pragmatic assistants that we're used to. Hey Jibo, what's your favorite book? *LE WAITING* I really love instruction manuals. There are so many, it's hard to choose one favorite. And I wished him a good morning after 12 o'clock once, and he replied, sure, I guess it's morning somewhere. I may be wrong, but I don't think it's morning. But he still doesn't feel like a social companion because even though he sometimes looks at me while I'm sitting at my desk and recognizes my face and even says hello to me before I say anything, he doesn't listen for my response or carry out even the most rudimentary conversations. He only responds to commands. So he's the most animated, lifelike robot, we've seen yet, and yes, I'm including those creepy, uncanny valley bots like Sophie, but the fact is... Although somehow Time missed this.. WRONG! he's almost completely Useless! Especially when you consider the pitch from the original crowdfunding video. I mean, yes, he does have some smart-home functionality, thanks to if this then that integration... but it's very basic, and yes, in theory, his abilities could expand with over-the-air updates and a developer SDK that's coming out in the new year. But honestly, what kind of developers would be stupid enough to invest their time in a platform with such a small user base when there are an estimated 20 million Amazon echo devices out there with A-L-E-X-A (ALEXA) Realistically, it was a good idea. The world is headed towards digital assistance in a big way. But Jibo Inc tried to do too much with too little and their only hope for a return on the last few years of their lives at this point is to be bought out by one of the BIG GUYS. Just like my only hope for a return on this stupid purchase is to have the whole team here sign it and put it on eBay in hopes that one of you out there is an avid collector of ridiculous crowdfunding rubbish. Hey Jibo.. Twerk. Never gets old. All right, without any ado... (EDM music playing) Man! If I was  gonna throw away $900 three years ago, I really wish I had bet on Bitcoin.

Engineering samples or reviews samples, they're cherry-picked so that the media outlets like Linus tech tips will see inflated performance and Overclocking numbers so that you yes, you Jerry will get suckered into buying a new CPU every year right? well That's what people keep telling us and this common knowledge has been around for years now so today in our inaugural installment of sh*t viewers say we are going to either prove that there is something to this or debunk this myth once and for all Thanks to ZOTAC by the way for bringing us today's video the MEK 1 PC is an ultra slim Desktop built for gaming featuring a sleek robotic themed design check it out at the link below to learn more Intro So here's how we decided to run our test we grabbed our sample core i5 8400 and not to play favorites our sample Ryzen 5 1600 X then we went to the local, NCIX Sorry memory express to buy retail chips of the same to compare them against For your peace of mind we will upload the entire Uncut clip of us buying the chips and running our tests on them we're gonna have that link below anyway let's talk about why it might make sense or might not for a company to seed reviewers a Superior sample now the obvious answer we hear all the time is that they would get articles Boasting of better performance numbers or a better overall user experience In that initial oh so important wave of launch videos and articles Enticing consumers to open up their wallets All while not actually having to provide that level of performance or polish at retail But conspiracy theories aside would this actually make business sense Imagine this you've got a lemonade stand where you sell the freshest Tastiest lemonade on the Block on day one, and then you swap it out with lemon pledge Now a lot of people are gonna show up to buy on the second day, but as soon as your reputation for selling. What is Literally furniture polish spreads the kids across the street who were selling cheap powdered lemonade the whole time are gonna Take the bulk of the market share Now we're not saying this has never happened Think back to watch dogs and no man's sky and III both Ubisoft and Sony respectively showed off beautifully complex worlds with tons of graphical detail and then both of them ended up being significantly simplified upon release now while in some industries it is possible to get away with this kind of BS in General the negative. PR has the potential to completely stall future sales So it is not a risk to be taken lightly and in electronics the up to Multi-billion dollar investment that goes into designing and fabricating a processor design makes this kind Switcheroo and economic impossibility like it's not a different paint job So then let's look at one of the other theories Maybe they're just taking golden samples off of what is otherwise the regular production line Now that one is much more likely But it doesn't really hold up to closer scrutiny either From my experience and others earlier CPUs are produced at the tail end of the manufacturing Learning process when viable yields are lower and compared to the more mature units that come later Can actually require more voltage to maintain a specific clock speed not to mention that they might have poorer memory? Compatibility or might output more heat at the same performance levels Even the couple of weeks between early samples shipping out and retail availability can result in Improvements now there have been and there always will be exceptions to this But it is far more likely That we are dealing with the same silicon lottery as any other CPU because you got to remember even on the same wafer No, two processors will have identical characteristics So if it doesn't make any sense why do people still think it's happening most of the time as far as we can tell it just seems to be a fanboy argument justifying why someone disagrees with the results being published by the dishonest media and Frankly we're just so tired of hearing it that we not once But twice the first time we bummed up the footage so we had to start over including buying two more CPUs Anthony Not once, but twice went out and bought these CPUs so we could show you this TLDR for gaming we found basically no variance in frame rates even in direct x12 mode while synthetics actually favored our retail chips as For productivity tests on the intel side our chips traded blows back and forth but not a clear-cut victory for either side and we put this down to normal chip or even run two run variants due to the Dynamic and reactive nature of turbo boost and then as for team red It was pretty much even across the board so for better or for worse AMD appears to be shipping Exactly the same product today that they were in April of last year and then to back that up we even tried overclocking both of our AMD chips our Intel ones were locked but both of our AMD chips had identical clocks at identical voltages and identical temperatures, but even crashed at identical settings So in summary then this conspiracy theory is busted for the two major cpu players and While nothing that we've said today is going to prevent people from making these arguments in the future What I hope is that it has at least armed the rest of you with the ammunition that you need to shut them down Once and for all it doesn't make business sense. It doesn't make engineering sense. It just doesn't make sense But you know what does make sense switching to ting ting is the mobile carrier that's focused on customer service and customer satisfaction When you call ting if you have an issue for whatever Reason you do not speak to a robot you get put through directly to a person And you don't pay extra For the privilege in fact the average ting bill is only 23 bucks a month per device because of the way they billed you pay Only for what you use now if you're stuck in a contract and you switch to ting they'll cover 25% of your cancellation fee up to 75 bucks and if you use our link Linus ENCOM to try out their savings calculator and see if you'll save money you can actually get another 25 bucks in service credit or Towards a new device so go try it out So thanks for watching guys if this video sucked. You know what to do break that one Yeah
But if it was awesome get subscribed hit that like button or check out the link to where to buy the stuff we featured in the video description Maybe literally these ones maybe we'll put them on eBay. I don't know also link town There's our merch storage has cool shirts like this one and our community forum, which you should totally join We have so many processors and how? 
Okay I've got my dual socket motherboard And I'm sure you guys have all gone through this at some point in the past where you're like building a new system and like The first part arrives and you're like 'oh wow! This is so cool to look at' because I have nothing else that goes with it, but then Okay, it got real and two of my eBay CPUs arrived, theoretically these are 28 core Uh 8176s or whatever they are something along those lines I got those then I got these Yeah theeeese. These are 32 gig modules. These modules have more RAM than what I would consider to be a high-end gaming system in one module And I was like 'no way! Now I can test it'. Thanks to audible for sponsoring this video experience the world's largest library of audiobooks today with audible and stay tuned later on in this video for a special offer. I wasn't sure if either of them would be real or working so I actually ordered two sets of what claimed to be 28 core CPUs on eBay. And look at this, it's even marked on the spreaders. This is a P8136 That the seller says is a 28 core But then I was like 'hey, can you send me a CPU-Z screenshot?' And they're like 'sorry I can't' and I was like 'well Can you double check with someone that it's 28 core?'. They're like 'I can't'.  So let's hold on first. Let's double check this so absolutely nothing. Intel Xeon 8136 you can see I've googled it before but other than an eBay listing oh Oh, and there's a thread discussing that eBay listing and other people saying That this is really sketch So This takes up a lot more space on the bench than most motherboards. Okay step number one Does this fit yeah cool? Um... If it turns on I'm gonna be turned on okay, so we've got dedicated eight pins Okay dedicated 8-pins for each CPU Oh, that that fresh eBay smell that thermal compound all over it *sniffs CPU* OH! That's good stuff. Okay, so here's problem number I've lost track, but this is a problem. The LGA 3647 socket Has no CPU retention arm The way it's meant to be held in is by the cooling solution But almost nobody is supporting this socket because this is an enterprise Xeon socket. Intel's workstation chips are actually using LGA 2066 but with a different chipset So ASUS went off the rails with this thing and there's like no coolers to support it and it's got this bizarro land Mounting system here with like threaded stuff here in here, and then these posts that are different size here So I'm hoping to just kind of wing it by literally holding the CPU in place We're like the unknown side, the random side The spooky side No one no one knows what the hell's going on side including the seller. If no one knows How did you put 28 core in the listing? You're the only people on earth with this CPU as far as I can tell where did these come from where did they go? Where did they come from cotton-eye Joe? Oh, this is really dumb what I'm doing right now. Okay *gasp* Wait okay. This is bad, CPU just lifted up. Okay. I got it Jake. I may need your hands at some point Oh my god. Why are you doing like this Okay, what do you think, is it gonna boot? Uhhh Maybe Yeah, I'm going with a definite maybe on this one too here we go Oh, wow, that was... Jake: A whole lot a nothin. ...pretty anticlimactic. *taps button impatiently* oh boy Um... Now most dual socket boards.. Oh! Uh, okay. Post code 'zero zero' that's not generally a good sign. Let's think. You want to try the other one of these first, or do you want to try the other chips? Jake: Uh... I think you should try two. Oh, I mean that's even more jank than I was kind of hoping to get but Jake: Hold on, I got an idea... ...Hoho, that's heavy! *laughing* Put that on there. Holy sh** Linus: Oh, yeah, this is titanium. Jake: Holy crap! Here we go... That weren't a good sign... Wow, crap, okay. Well hold on a second there could still be something else Let's try the other chips. Okay. There's some action Um... They're warming up this time So that's gonna limit how long I can hold these in Okay, go ahead and hit the power my thumbs burning *flicks power switch* Okay, it's time to consult the manual So it occurs to me... we have... actually seen this socket before in our Xeon 5 video This is that bizarro cooler than it used So this gives us a few more exciting options. I don't actually know if this board is Xeon 5 Compatible, but it's the same socket so maybe we could try this chip to see if it fires up then we could try this cooler on one socket to see if maybe it is a mounting pressure issue. Still got options oh and of course, it's torques *screams like a goat* Okay, this looks like it may not actually be quite the same cuz there's like a thing here And... what? What is this mounting system? Ohhhhhhhhh This is a narrow ILM This is a square ILM Crap! So we're going for hopefully enough mounting pressure Whoa (x5) Hello! Jake: Hello! Okay! That's fine. That's fine. We've got a postcode this time though. That's a better sign and also This is less likely to be CPU one anyway, so I'm gonna put it back where it was right? *board beeps* Okay one long two short Okay! Reserved for future AMI codes perfect, brilliant! Okay, let's try a different, uh, let's try different chip. Let's try the other one Okay... Come on... 'AF' Maybe f*** Well it could be 'Good as f***' like 'Neat as f***' Okay, it's completely different Which is maybe good and maybe bad? Why... Okay, so the manual says one long beep and two short means no memory detected So we put those CPUs back in And we're trying the higher mounting pressure on them *board beeps* Okay, okay, so kill it *flicks switch off* Okay, so let's just put some more memory in because one of the Classic symptoms of a bad mount in the socket is that some of your DIMM slots won't work properly So, I mean this is if nothing else a bad mounting system Okay so the working theory right now is that it's probably a mounting pressure issue so Last attempt before I just patiently wait for a cooler. I need to get up higher so I can put more weight on it Oh wow That is terrifying Jake: What did it just turn on? I just put more pressure on the CPUs and the system turned on do you want to turn it off for now? *flicks switch off* Okay, I'm gonna put more pressure on Okay, let's try the other ones Okay Centered down there Centered down there okay more weight, I'm good Jake: Want me to try clearing the CMOS? Linus: No actually. Jake: 'AF'... Linus: Ugh, this is the same as before! Okay! It's been like another week two weeks. I don't know the point is today Was basically Christmas because first, and yes, it's only the 19th But it's still Christmas because first, check this out so I've got those engineering sample processors that I ordered when I thought that Intel wasn't gonna work with us on this but today... I also got Ahhhhhh! Ahhhhhhh! Oh Look at this. Oh, it's beautiful So these are Intel Confidential's I don't remember what skew these are but they're 3.2 gigahertz base So they're a lower core count and these ones Xeon Platinum 8180s these are the top-of-the-line But it was the kind of 'I ordered new computer hardware Christmas' where ah, a little crooked there Where I didn't have a piece that I needed still But then today again They arrived!!! These are Intel thermal solution box coolers for the Xeon processor scalable family, this is the one Active cooler that I could find on the market For the square ILM socket I finally have Everything we're still gonna try That eBay processor first. I really want to know if I got ripped off With how hard this is clamping down honestly, I do not feel like I wasn't putting enough force on it before I really don't think that was the problem so theoretically, if these work, and I have two sets of 28 core processors if they don't and I still have one because sometimes it's nice to be Linus tech tips and Have Intel send stuff over to you sometimes. Do you get sweaty when you're working on expensive stuff? Little bit Yeah, me too. I need a graphics card Wow So the 8136 doesn't work Now I'm wondering if maybe there's a problem with our board at this point So let's try let's try a retail chip So each of these Xeon 8180s Yes, I think 8 or 10 grand something like that retail No pressure though. You know I mean don't they know that people drop things Okay, so this is with a very probably known good chip this time If this doesn't boot up then I have my doubts about Something. oh did that just change yeah? Yeah, it did Does it just have a really really long POST? How interesting would that be what if it has some kind of first boot process? Where it has to go through some kind of detection thing before it can then? boot up Properly the next time and it's really long. Okay. We are attempting a USB BIOS flash back with their crash free BIOS thing. We have a problem though And that's that if you look at the BIOS revisions here the one with the higher revision number is dated earlier than the one with the lower one so let's pull that out and Try again, I wouldn't have thought we could make it worse, but we did 0-0 post code, this is 2666 megahertz 32 gig sticks I wonder if it's been a ram compatibility thing this whole time Because I've never actually tried different RAM Okay, new plan. We're gonna try the 32 gig sticks from seven gamers one CPU Instead so these are older slower memory modules these guys are 2133 Instead of 2400 megahertz which is like bleeding-edge for servers right now maybe We'll see better compatibility if we try something a little bit older 97 B2 98 and you know No no no it was just RAM compatibility oh oh come on No, it's up, Oh Sick Overclocking yeah, yeah, I want to overclock. I mean not now I want to get it like working reliably first But wow you just key them in.. look at this! 5 billion volts no no do I just type in Auto Wow that is jank oh There they are 56 cores to boot it up. Okay, it still won't boot into Windows Just a little more troubleshooting it's finally booted so these are the retail chips and Check this out Take that mother f****** I still haven't tried firing it up with all the RAM in it This is the RAM strategy, okay, two sticks here ten on the table And I haven't tried any of the eBay chips because I wanted you guys to Come along for the ride Let's find out if anything works I'm like half excited and half terrified. I really hope these work because I am almost Definitely passed any kind of buyer assurance deadline through eBay at this point or PayPal I Really really hope this thing works now that I've had the board booted up If this doesn't work then I'm pretty sure that I got scammed. One thing I did find out is that some of my Posting issues may have simply been related to memory training, and if I had just waited longer Which wasn't something that was easy to do when I was holding CPUs into the sockets This is not a solid indication right now that things are going to go well though I actually hate that this TV has like such a pretty Screensaver like when I see a thing change, I'm like Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, okay hold on a minute here whoa? Okay They booted genuine Intel CPU zero thousand percent at Flippin brilliant, okay Alright, let's fire this baby up so our last CPU Got a score of about seven thousand in Cinebench, and that was with retail 8180 chips I've seen engineering samples that have more information than this But what we do know is the base speed of 2.1 gigahertz we know that they're 28 cores That's really exciting so these are Probably what they said they were which is 8176s yep Xeon Platinum 8176s the eBay gambit worked Nice and these are qualifying samples which I believe means Generally they are pretty close to retail chips so this is not the be-all and end-all of benchmarks certainly, but we can get an idea of whether we're close to what we have with the retail 8180 I want to see what it turbos to Not bad not bad at all ok so that's a significantly lower turbo speed we were turbo up around 3 gigahertz with the other one and Our lower score does reflect that but That's a hell of a chip for what we pay for it Now let's try the mystery meat Platinum 8136 time is this a straight-up scam Remember, this is the one where the eBay seller was unable to Confirm anything about it. unable Ok yeah, this is not looking promising so far. It's just been on AF the whole time You might say it would be [pun warning] disappointing AF damn Wonder if I can still file a dispute here it is shoot 'Return this item' is not there anymore. Oh, that's not good. Can I even leave feedback no? I can't I can't even leave feedback anymore wait, hold-on, no view similar items Twenty-six hundred US dollars plus shipping brilliant, so I guess the lesson we learned then is buying engineering sample processors off eBay can work or it can super not but if you order a part number that Doesn't exist at all then the odds of its super not working from our sample size of one seem to be pretty good Thanks to audible for sponsoring this video.

with Black Friday coming up it's the time of year to spend your hard-earned money on gaming upgrades manufacturers know this well and the last quarter of the year is typically so chock-full of new products and promotions that it can become impossible to keep track of them all so with all the different options out there how do you figure out which car delivers the best value for your dollar well you could spend a few days compiling the mother of all benchmarking data spreadsheets or you could just watch this video because we kind of did all the work for you just like toddle bear does all the work of setting up a VPN for you to try on a bear for free go to Tunnel Bear comm /l tt we've got that linked below [Music] if you don't feel like watching the rest of this honestly that's fine we've got recommendations for 1080p 1440p and 4k 60fps gaming linked in the description below if you want to learn about how we got to those conclusions then watch on just like last year we need to start by defining value value is not determined by price alone but by how much performance you get for that price so we might recommend expensive cards that you wouldn't consider affordable and still be able to call them a great value next we need to ensure that for every recommendation in this guide the real-world performance that you'll get will actually be enough for the resolution you want to run your games at if we just looked at value by itself we could end up telling you to go buy a seven dollar el cheapo graphics card that gets two frames per second that would be fantastic FPS per dollar but a terrible gaming experience so what would be the friggin point on that subject we are going to be focusing then on three main categories of gamer all that high detail settings 1080p 1440p and 4k which is why you actually won't then see any budget card recommendations they weren't able to meet our minimum performance requirements regardless of how great of a value they were so our methodology for finding the best values out there was pretty similar to last year now due to how cards clock speeds are determined these days with heavy emphasis on automatic tuning that's done through GPU boost we will not be focusing on the minimal performance Delta's that might exist between vendors gtx 1080 and then their Em's GTX 1080 because even a factory overclocked 1080 GPU on the fancy gigantic card is going to end up a lot closer to a normal Founders edition 1080 than it will to a like 1080i something a completely different GPU and this general rule is true throughout both AMD and NVIDIA line ups as for which GPUs we looked at we limited ourselves to ones that are actually available for purchase brand-new directly from a large reputable seller so we picked the three lowest priced models of each one from Amazon and Newegg then averaged them so that we could be confident that you can actually go buy something at about the pricing we're using in our value calculations we specifically left out used hardware and the reason for that is because while an older gentleman and deliver decent performance at the same time it won't be covered by warranty in all but a few cases and not everyone's comfortable with that and we've actually run into situations before where we've gone and recommended some second-hand hardware only to see the demand and therefore pricing shoot up shortly after we published our video ok with me so far now let's talk about our performance metrics obviously testing over 40 cards and three resolutions in a wide enough variety of games to give solid recommendations wasn't going to be feasible so instead of trying to find the actual frames per second of every card in every game like last year we used one card that was very likely to show up on performance charts at all three of these resolutions from reputable sites like guru 3d and PC perspective and then we logged the relative performance of any of our cards that we could find compared to that reference then we used that relative performance to extrapolate what the expected FPS might be now in some cases we had to extrapolate from an extrapolation and then everything got a little fuzzy for a while and I think at some point we were visited by the spreadsheet fairy but anyway the point is it is imperfect we know thanks to the amount of data we collected including benchmarks from FPS RTS and RPG games we're confident that after applying a common sense filter like we ignored products outright that will obviously thermal throttle we've got a pretty clear picture of which cards will perform consistently better and which ones will perform consistently worse so at 1080p there are only really a couple of choices for Team red the RX 570 and 580 were far and away the best there little brother the RX 560 did manage similar FPS per dollar numbers but it wasn't able to consistently deliver a high quality 1080p experience as for team green never thought I'd hear myself say this but if all you want is 1080p you can actually save a few bucks the 1063 gig is less powerful and has less video memory which hurts it at higher resolutions compared to AMD's offerings but it met our performance bar and on average we were able to find it for forty to fifty dollars less moving up to 1440p the RX 570 and 580 once again deliver along with the 1063 gig the highest FPS per dollar by a significant margin unfortunately for team green they're offering just doesn't have enough raw power for us to recommend it here now with that said we aren't saying that higher end cards are a bad idea at this resolution the gtx 1070 and 1070 TI are our recommendations if you want much higher frame rates and fewer stutters and you're willing to pay a bit of a premium for it finally for the ballers among you if you want a game at 4k at high details 60fps there's really only one choice the GTX 1080 Ti anything else other than a Titan XP though it's FPS per dollar would be obviously worse since it performs about the same as a 1080 Ti would require you to turn down your in-game settings turn down your resolution or turn down both in order to reach 60fps obviously there are other factors to consider when you buy a graphics card like in videos excellent shadowplay game recording software that obviously isn't supported on AMD cards or Polaris's efficiency for cryptocurrency mining if you want to make a couple with your gaming rig when you're not busy gaming on it and then as to individual cards well the design of the board and cooler the length of the warranty and any game bundles should also weigh in to your decision but as I've said before to narrow your search you can find in the description of the video three solid choices for each resolution happy shopping and if you guys are looking for a

this video from CES 2018 is brought to you by Dollar Shave Club get a great shave for just a few dollars a month that dollarshaveclub.com slash line is linked below so we're here in the Corsair suite where they are going more tempered glass and more RGB than ever before what a freaking surprise so behind me I've actually got a case that includes no RGB lighting whatsoever this is the Obsidian 500 d and i'm just gonna put it in front of that one for reasons that I will reveal quite shortly this is Corsairs first case with integrated native USB type-c in the front including that 20 pin connector on the inside that is supported on newer motherboards it's got a tempered glass side panel it's got support for two hard drives and three SSDs on the back of the motherboard tray and water cooling support is actually pretty wide open as well it can take up to a triple 120 millimeter in the front and a dual 140 millimeter in the top and part of that is thanks to its extremely efficient that's fine extremely efficient use of its internal space so it's got a lot of room up here for a big radiator and fins and then it's almost no clearance between the motherboard and the power supply basement down here now this guy's going to be 149 or something along those lines and should be available pretty soon but honestly this isn't the one that I'm not excited about oh yeah there's a removable fan filter I'm not sure how it comes out but no removable fan filter so I'm just gonna put that aside be right back this is the sexy one so this would cost quite a bit more if it were to make it to market it's got curved tempered glass on the front just like the concept slate that we showed off last year slash did a video of quite recently it's showing off the vertical GPU mounting that is also available in its little brother and it is also planned to include Corsairs light loop RGB fans so the plan if it were to become a real product would also be to include a Corsair commander Pro so you can RG be affected up and estimated may be hypothetical pricing somewhere in the 250 dollar range and for how good this thing looks it could be the case to beat if you're into mid towers with tempered glass an RGB but let's say you're not into RGB and you want to spend a lot of money course there has a new power supply for you it has been four years since the ax 1500 I and it finally has a big brother although it should be noted it's actually two centimeters shorter this is the ax 1600 I uses gallium nitride MOSFETs in order to achieve its astonishing 94% efficiency at 100% load that is four percent higher than the 80 plus titanium spec so the reason Corsair hasn't done a successor to the 1500 I is that anything higher than that would trip a 120 volt North American breaker anyway well they got this thing so efficient that is only pulling seventeen hundred and thirty watts from the wall at a hundred percent load meaning that it won't trip your breaker whew it also comes with coursera link support and my favorite this was actually something that I suggested to course at one point why do you guys just have these stickers that you can't remove I was like can I get a new sticker waiting you why don't you just do magnet oh oh it's got magnetic magnetic logos you can put it on whatever way you want it comes with blue and red and white and then the stock is just the the traditional corsair matches everything gray this guy's going to be priced at for $99.99 holy okay well uh thanks to Dollar Shave Club for sponsoring this video here at CES 2018 if you haven't tried Dollar Shave Club it is about more than just razors they've got razors they've got other shaving supplies they've got you're a peppermint scented bot wipes for men they've got all kinds of great stuff and instead of going to the store and remembering to buy that stuff fighting with the key and the lock to get the cartridges out of the thing they just deliver it to you once a month for just off you box so go check them out at the link below that's dollarshaveclub.com slash Linus where you can get their shower shave starter set for just five bucks so thanks for watching guys if you dislike you can hit that button if you liked hit like get subscribed so you don't miss any of our great CES 2018 content we'll see you at the next suite by the way 
ah that's better if you guys watch this channel chances are you've got a fond memory of a ThinkPad whether you were trying to get need for speed to se to run on your parents work laptop or you were actually doing important things for yourself the ThinkPad was always up to the task with its rugged design and nipple for mouse but are those just rosy eyed memories or were these actually fantastic machines that would still hold up today well the 25th anniversary edition is here and it might be everything I remember and more speaking of remembering remember to check out Sennheiser's PXE 550 wireless headphones they feature up to 30 hours of battery life noise guard hybrid active noise cancellation and more you can learn more at the link below rising out of its box the ThinkPad anniversary edition is soaked in nostalgia everything about it just feels right the keyboard the track nub and even the way it beeps at you when you press too many keys at once the outer build quality feels exceptional dare I say even up to the old IBM standard and every surface is sturdy while also surprisingly smooth Iowa is the modern minimalistic trend is nowhere to be seen it's got Ethernet HDMI 3 USB 3 ports an SD reader and Thunderbolt 3 so you won't be left stranded no matter what you need while you're working just like an old thing pad on that subject let's meet the og device that we'll be comparing it to we took a trip down to the local electronics recycler free geek Vancouver and picked up this sweet ThinkPad 560 X a model from before IBM had stopped making laptops and sold that business unit and its trademarks to Lenovo at 20 years old this thing well before we would even think about using it it needed a really good scrub but after some love from a mover moving tool a new CMOS battery Wow look at that duck cursor man and some old-school Windows know-how from Anthony it was ready to go so let's look at the specs of both computers the ThinkPad anniversary rocks a solid the last gen core i7 7500 u dual-core CPU which is so much faster than the pentium MMX Tillamook in the 560 X that there is no meaningful way to compare the two it's got 170 times more memory with 128 times the storage and the only real disappointment here is probably the GPU 10 series graphics cards have been out for about a year and a half now and the GT 940 in here is better than nothing but it won't handle anything but older game and maybe a bit of acceleration in Photoshop or premiere to its credit though the anniversary edition kept all of its components nice and cool while remaining quiet although it can air sometimes on the side of lower clocks for longer battery life and lower temperatures rather than higher clocks with more heat and more power the keyboards on both feel almost identical save for the very soft semicolon on the 560 X and that's a good thing since they both have amazing keyboards the keys have a super long travel with this great tactile feedback and the layout that might be a bit strange these days might be wrong it's morning jieb oh shut the fuck up like it would be easy to accidentally hit function s instead of actually saving your work for example but it's nothing you couldn't get used to and pretty much every G you could need is present I give it an A as for the trackpad to its credit it tracks well and is surprisingly smooth to the touch but it is pretty small since most of the vertical space here is taken out by the left right and middle clicks for the red pointing stick between the G H and B keys let's talk about that with how god-awful the track pads were 20 years ago it is no great mystery by people who actually had time sensitive work to do prefered these little nubbins but these days not everyone is going to like a track point even with the four nipple options included in the box and it does take a little getting used to but we would never take points off for including it because for us the anniversary edition ended up being all about options for certain tasks like highlighting text or quickly switching between mousing and typing the track point was as the kids say on point for casual one-handed operation while sitting back the touchpad was generally preferred and for bigger movements the included touchscreen was a definite blessing though I wish I could say the same about other aspects of the screen the balls Lenovo where is my dedicated brightness adjustment slider this experience has been totally ruined for me ruined yeah I'm just kidding the 1080p IPS display with a matte finish isn't cutting edge but it's still great for productivity and is definitely better than the 560 X's 800 by 600 HP a display that has pixel response times in the hundreds of milliseconds it really is too bad that it's old owner didn't spring for the TN panel for so the ThinkPad 25th anniversary edition also includes lots of options when it comes to authentication with Windows hello added to it's perfectly acceptable webcam and speakers and a fingerprint reader to the right of the keyboard then once it's unlocked assuming that you went for the option with a second hot swappable battery this thing will keep going almost all day now unsurprisingly the ThinkPad anniversary edition isn't the premier multimedia laptop on the market no high resolution display no amazing speakers with Dolby Atmos certification and it sucks for games but it is easily one of the best laptops for productivity and in many ways it makes other devices these days feel like decorations or toys with its excellent keyboard pointing stick and battery life now I don't know if it'll still be working 20 years from now like our 5 60 X but I also don't see why it would let you down it's everything we like about modern notebooks with everything we remember liking about classic ones so if you were thinking about pulling the trigger I say go for it as long as you can afford one or even get one since it's a limited production run this episode was brought to you by tunnel bear be easy to use VPN app when people are shopping for a VPN one of the features they look for is a kill switch so before you connect to a network your device starts to send information about itself and what it wants to do and it tries to establish connections with all sorts of things and there are other devices out that are trying to connect to yours well a kill switch stops all of this from happening because before you connect to your VPN all your traffic is unencrypted so in the few seconds it takes to connect you've probably already broadcast your IP a few DNS requests or a search query well vigilant bear from tunnel bear stops all of this behavior from happening by blocking all outbound and inbound traffic so nothing leaks out before you're connected this keeps you private throughout your entire connection time and it even kicks back in if your connection goes down for some reason and you have to reconnect so for

nVidia max-q design GPUs have given us some really interesting laptops this year most of which have been Laser focused on providing crazy performance in a size we haven't seen before Gigabyte had a bit of a different idea Sounds crazy, but they were like what if you could just use a power efficient max-q GPU in like More like a regular laptop for maximum awesomeness Well what you'd probably end up with is the Aero 15 X Also maximally awesome by the way is today's sponsor, Sennheiser You can check out the PXE 550 wireless headphones at the link in the video description The arrow 15x has a clean professional look to it that actually reminds me of older Dell or Lenovo business models Except with a carbon-fiber accent on the back and RGB lighting on the keyboard to keep it from getting too boring and corporate it also has almost no bezels bordering the display and the feel of the whole laptop is really solid say for a Slightly wobbly screen hinge at just under 20 millimeters thick and 4.6 pounds it doesn't quite Qualify as a thin and light, but for the power that it houses, I would definitely call it portable It's rocking an Intel Core. i7 quad core 16 gigs of ram and a GTX 1070 max-q making it suitable for anything from heavy gaming to light workstation use that is assuming that it's adequately cooled and Adding to the portability is the fact that the i/o includes full-size USB 3 Ethernet and Thunderbolt 3 so there's no need to carry around any dongles if you don't want to back to cooling though obviously That's going to be a challenge for a device like the Aero 15 X With only the CPU loaded we experienced no throttling though and temps in the mid 70s with That said with a combined CPU and GPU load like gigabytes compact bricks gaming desktop the Aero 15 X's CPU throttled down Significantly it seems though like this is something that they could fine tune with a future BIOS or driver update because under full load We could hardly even hear the fans gaming performance is Really strong though a max-q 1070 isn't quite as fast as a desktop 1070, but in this machine Actually ends up within spitting distance and given how slim it is I'm willing to forgive it a couple of frames here and there besides on its 60 Hertz display It won't be making much of a difference anyway Which I guess leads us perfectly into our biggest beef with the Aero 15 X it hurts Me to say this, but 60 refreshes per second at 1080p really isn't enough It's not a bad display at all especially if you're into the gaming workstation angle since its x-ray color calibrated out of the box and in my opinion 1080p while not as crispy as 1440p or better isn't too bad for the size but with this kind of CPU and GPU Performance we should easily be running at a hundred fps or more in many modern games and right now Buyers of this device aren't getting the full experience unless they hook up an external monitor And I've got other issues as well the webcam placement you either get a view up my nostrils Or if we adjust it you get to stare at my right hand oh Right you're down there, so when is like I don't know a magnetic like clip-on mic or something with just contacts in the top of the monitor coming That would be sick no bezels. No privacy concerns and no viewing angle compromise Moving down from the webcam though is lots of good news on the keyboard There's a pleasant travel distance and a solid feel to the keys with a fairly high Actuation force so fans of Cherry MX blue switches will probably really like this one I found it awesome to type on some gamers might find There's a little more force required than they'd like I could see your left pinky getting a bit tired But overall really liked it and then going lower still we've got a perfectly usable though somewhat unremarkable Trackpad it does what it needs to do with solid tracking and a clicky feel Where the arrow 15x really shines compared to other gaming laptops especially? Compact ones is the battery life with almost six hours Of unplugged productivity it is among the best battery life. We've ever seen in any gaming laptop especially one with this kind of performance and Opening it up. Which is pretty easy if you have the right bit reveals How exactly gigabyte achieved this feat, it's beautiful Manufacturers or at least gigabyte anyway are finally listening to me that is a Ninety four point two four watt hour battery that is right near the legal limit for what you can take on a plane with you and I Might cry a little here because it's also got sockets for adding more m.2 storage and upgrading your RAM instead of soldered solutions for either of those So that's all fine and good, but like all the other max-q laptops. We've seen it comes at a cost literally This version here will run you twenty two hundred dollars, which means if your wallet is tight and your backpack is large you can get more performance for less but While the Aero 15x doesn't give you the best bang for the buck and really it doesn't Excel at any specific task it also isn't the worst performance per dollar or for that matter It's not the worst at anything Nothing else that i've seen yet gives you everything that it does all in one place portability productivity and gaming highly recommended great work gigabyte Need to see a 120 Hertz display with g-sync next time Speaking of things I'd like to see you next time your website on Squarespace Squarespace is the place to go if you want to build a website you just pick one of their gorgeous templates And you add some text you add some pictures It's all cloud-based so you can see the changes you're making in real time and boom.

okay so you're looking to get into computer-aided design or CAD but you're not quite sure what kind of a system that you need do you really need one of those multi-thousand dollar workstations stuffed with pricey professional-grade hardware or can you scrape by with consumer gear to find out we loaded up SolidWorks his website and looked at their suggested system requirements which were basically useless so then we took it a step further and asked SolidWorks to provide a license and nvidia to provide some of their Quadro graphics cards which they both graciously provided and we resolved to test it ourselves today's video is brought to you by ZOTAC their mech one PC is an ultra slim desktop built for gaming featuring a sleek robotic styled design check it out now at the link below [Music] let's get this out of the way right off the bat SolidWorks can be run on lower end hardware a laptop with a core i5 CPU integrated graphics and eight gigs of RAM will actually get the job done just fine if you're making single parts or small assemblies let's say up to around ten parts or so in fact I go as far as to say that it'll be plenty to get you through engineering one thousand three but you won't get much further than that the performance won't be optimal and while on a desktop running a simulation or a render for a day isn't going to be an issue hitting a laptop with a hundred percent load for 20 hours at a time could end very poorly in fact that's how Alex the writer of this episode lost his first laptop back when he was in school so you will need a desktop at some point but there's a ton of information out there about how that desktop should be configured and it ranges from pretty good - super outdated all the way to downright misleading so to cut through the BS we did a bunch of testing to give you an idea of what kind of experience you can expect with different classes of hardware we used both spec view perf which gives you an accurate look at CPU and GPU performance while manipulating a model and a render of this alpha cool 360 radiator to give us a feel for rendering performance we'll discuss different GPU choices first since a small misstep here could easily cause you to pay a high price for terrible performance on that subject NVIDIA GeForce lineup might look pretty good on paper or when compared to intel's integrated graphics for example but once you line it up against AMD's rx 580 and Vega line up they get completely stomped at times the real-world performance between the two is actually you Julie similar to what you might expect with a gtx 1070 being within spitting distance of uh vega 56 and so on and so forth but this changes dramatically when you throw contours and shaded edges into the mix which for some reason completely tanked the consumer grade GeForce drivers with all of that said team red shouldn't act too high and mighty here because big and hot Vega 64 is impressive lead melts away immediately when you pull out the big guns or rather the really small guns this is the entry level and power sipping quadrille p1000 that stomped all over all but the highest end consumer cards and then from there the quad Rose which also have extra features like real view rendering continue their dominance thanks to their superior driver pathway like the p2000 a $600 card was able to beat out the Titan V which is a $3,000 card and a prosumer one at that the only real oddity here was that the P 5000 and the P 6,000 ended up beating the GP 100 maybe this was thanks to our particular workload favoring higher clock speeds over higher memory bandwidth with all that said not everyone can afford a thousand plus dollars for a mid tier quad row so our budget recommendation is an rx 580 if you're a student who plans to mostly game and occasionally solidworks it up you'll be really happy with its excellent bang for the buck but if you're doing any kind of professional work you need to get a Quadro the sweet spot seems to be the P 4000 it's relatively affordable and its performance allows you to create massive models with 500 plus components in 4k without drops in framerate with that said if your firm wants to throw some of that sweet sweet engineering money your way a P 5000 will tear through just about anything that you could throw at it as a side note here by the way SolidWorks doesn't support multiple GPUs so SLI won't give you any benefit whatsoever moving on to CPU options for modeling in theory all you should be concerned about is single core performance meaning that the core i7 8700 K should be the winner and in the real world it is and buy a lot now that's not to say that multi-threaded muscle will go completely unused though for simulations and for rendering the time to complete goes down nearly directly proportionally to the number of course that you can throw at the problem and this makes Intel's Core I 9s and Xeon W's and AMD's thread ripper chips look pretty attractive for folks who plan on doing this kind of work regularly with that being said if you're doing lots of rendering it will probably be in keyShot or blender and simulations will probably be taken care of by abacus or Altair hyper works in which case high multi-threaded performance yeah it's still definitely a good thing but a core i9 is out of the question because intel's h EDT lineup lacks support for ECC memory xeon W's will have a hard time justifying their trade-off in terms of price and thread Ripper single threaded performance makes it far less appealing besides for most CAD designers these types of workloads can easily be set to run after hours and usually with help from other nodes on the network bottom line then unless you're trying to build a one-size-fits-all type of machine in which case you might have to spring for a Xeon w4 modeling the core i7 8700 k is still our recommendation as for AMD's Rison processors they're just unfortunately not an optimal choice for SolidWorks and 8700 K in our testing with a quadrille P 5000 scored eight percent better than an r7 1800 x with a Quadro piece 6000 and the 1800 X also losses in multi-threaded workloads as for system memory you're going to need 16 gigs ran as a minimum but you won't need more than that until you're working with models that are well over 500 parts in size and as for SSDs we found that nvme or obtain SSDs didn't have an appreciable impact on performance beyond how quickly your model will load though as a reminder here we were really focused on modeling rather than simulation performance so in summary then if we were to recommend a computer for SolidWorks we consider the best bang for the buck budget workstation right now to be an intel core i7 8700 k a quadrille p 4,000 16 gigs of ram and a 512 gig SSD placed in whatever case is quiet with great airflow so for our workstation which will be keeping together we've got a silverstone fto for now when and if entry-level 6-core coffee lake Zeon's show up they could change our recommendation here depending on pricing but for the time being they don't exist so they're not an option now if you want to scale our build down you can save a buck with a core i5 8400 but I wouldn't go much lower and you can swap out that P 4000 with ap1000 or a P 2000 as your budget allows if you want to scale our build up however because maybe you convinced your boss that well time is money you know and he or she gave you a blank check for a build then you will get some more benefit all the way up to the top end like yeah Xeon w21 95 which is the 18 core equivalent to the core on an Extreme Edition and a Quadro p6 thousands so if for whatever reason you've got that option then go for it not because it actually makes a ton of sense we talked about that already but

are you sure we are live now I remember the thing you were gonna fix the recording light that's what it was we don't have one but that's okay guys we've got a great show for you today we actually oh man we made some crazy crazy pants videos this week and by we I mean me and other people not you oh it is what it is dude it is what it is but you guys did something really sick this week too that's right yeah so what uh yeah it's um apparently didn't excite people who were reading the the the wine show title last week you know it doesn't love you okay it was one of the lowest viewed when Joe the lead funeral last year the people that care care a lot and I love you for it but a flow plane went alpha you don't show that oh yeah yeah I know no I don't I don't want to show that I super don't want to show that I'm gonna put oh you know what I'm gonna put don't put it login we put minesweeper minesweeper doesn't come on Windows 10 does it no it doesn't that is so stupid the windows team that Microsoft hates fun why what is wrong with them I hate that you gotta go to the Xbox team for that alright anyway well we are off to a super when shall we start to the show today there folks let's go ahead wait this is wrong man why is it called tez like that right yeah yeah we rock on okay so check this out so I'm on my home which the only way to navigate to home right now is to click this which is not super intuitive will get that sort of note don't worry about most websites work that's fine the mobile the mobile one is a little weird the desktop right that's completely fine that's fine say that should probably be like a more kind of different kind of home like actually like float playing home where you browse creators and stuff whereas like there should be like it like an awl or something but we'll figure you know what he and I are gonna work this out but basically you can see videos from creators that you follow or you could go to the important ones Wow take that Kyle and you can see what's what's gone up in the last week or so so this is it like this is actually the site so subscribe using credit card it's a little yes you can okay it's not like really in the sense that like the the credit card data is being handled just right it's just like the the site itself around it okay it works it's working but check this out you can see the videos that we have up on flow plane that are not yet on YouTube so I think most of these are already up yeah and just so you guys know if you have a forum account actually regardless of if you have a subscription or not but if you have a forum account that has a flow clean subscription or a bit with ultra subscription you can go to full plane com connect the account by we're not going to show you because LastPass is gonna autofill some information but if you go to the home page yeah there's a more sign-in options drop-down button thingy majiggy click on that click in sign in with the LCD forum connect to your account and then you'll have access to whatever subscriptions you currently have oh smart way to go because you have add-ons disabled because you can enable add-ons in incognito if you want it but yeah click the sign in with ltte forum option the other ones don't work right now as well don't worry about it click it can be cited but don't be before I'm often connect your account you'll have access which is great so there's a couple at least a couple videos on there that are pretty freaking cool this is really cool we've got three VR headsets running off of a single motherboard single tower using virtualization we did the top five most insane cases yes that is a case that is a real case you can buy it if you're baller enough these are the feedback on these videos is really good and you can actually see the aforementioned feedback on the floatplane website check that out no way Oh hold on I don't know if audio is on sorry guys no way comments oh okay we should probably fix that jumps back on video yeah oh no maybe that what happened there but anyway check this out comments comments hey hey hey Dig Dug at all this is my first visit here so these are my initial impressions look and feel the site is spot-on hekia very professional-looking there's teething problems there is like needing to logout and then in again after subscribing okay yep were you even aware that one yeah yeah okay yeah the video buffering is an issue I'm stuck as low as 480p okay no that's weird because we've actually been we've done pretty well there um cool to see it might be a location thing there's still some like using in that needs to happen there yeah should I do it switch 1080p see how well it goes there has been some minor problems with that and we've been doing some Rika jiggering cool look at that so that might be causing an issue ah right cuz I think we're trying to change it so that it remembers your last what you last selected properly without jumping to 360 first and then jumping back and then jumping back out and usually if you like pause it and then do it again it works because alpha whatever we're actually also having some issues with our connection here oh of course the second I switch it's like so it's working yeah it's a typical right right I suspect that's actually not flow plane although it could be at this point because things are things are in a pretty delicate state right now but anyway the alphas up the ending now yeah yeah it works every other time we've shown on winch oh and it will work again yep do not worry uh what if we go for topics this week like did anything oh right yeah things did happen no no no the Samsung Galaxy S 9 happened nope nothing happened that happened what else do we have horizon 720 700 X is rumored to may have maybe be happening at some point okay I think this is sort of a big deal this is back to the Samsung Galaxy S 9 word on the street is that Samsung might be nerfing the version of the phone oh so that it's not too much better than the snapdragon 845 version that's so as to upset their customers okay so that's pretty that's pretty interesting you know that actually kind of makes sense I celebrate oh go ahead it's dumb but it makes sense celebrate is advertising they can now break the security of iOS 11 including the iPhone 10 what else happened this week our intro worked then [Music] right you got Nazir's copy brought you by synergy 2 and brought to you by honey I mean anything sounds kind of weird when you say it like that but honey sound especially weird apparently the sound is super quiet on the intro you know whatever nice someone says they needed that for bingo so you know needed what you're lost is someone else's gain and control nice all right I don't know man I don't know man alright let's jump right into our first topic here how would how would that be for and someone's gonna lose their bingo if we start talking about tech and he seems like one of minutes into you know it wouldn't surprise me there's a lot of stuff that happens on this show a lot that probably shouldn't happen on the show no the creator of wine show bingo tweeted me I felt I felt pretty special yeah yeah that's good that's good so this was supposed to be Edward the weeb on the forum thanks for that and there's the unnecessarily loud laugh tile the original article is from WC CF tech AMD's second-generation rise in 7:00 at 2700 X rumored to be 8 core 12 excuse me 8 core 16 thread 3.7 gigahertz base up to 4.2 gigahertz boost with xfr so what this tells us is that second-generation risin is looking like a pretty small sort of tweak you know ironing out a couple of wrinkles you know don't expect all of a sudden to be getting you know 48 core versions that are clocked at 5 gigahertz or anything like that evolutionary rather than revolutionary but let's see 16 Meg's level 3 cache for makes level 3 I'd be surprised if it does to be perfectly honest this is gonna be priced above then or do you think they're just gonna I think they're gonna slot these in above the existing ones here you can see the spec sheet comparison so there's the 1700 here's the replacement 2700 X so we're going down to 12 nanometer which gets us anywhere from 200 to 300 megahertz higher clock speeds at the same TDP one year later so I mean okay I can see some people being disappointed because Rison was like I forget what AMD was quoting it was like 40% or like 60% better than their previous generation but it's not fair that was because AMD actually hadn't really done a whole lot in the last four to five years leading up to it and so as much as it's easy to harp on Intel for these incremental generational improvements in cpu performance now we're seeing that when all AMD has to work with is a very small manufacturing process shrink it's really hard to do those generational leaps and performance the way that they did way back in the day like when AMD went from the Barton core to a sledgehammer clawhammer I think we're the first were those the first Athlon 64 within minutes so financing and like when Intel went from the netburst family up to Conroe so that doesn't really happen that often anymore and you did Sonny now that I think about it when Intel did it way back when that was because they had been not necessarily sitting on ass for a few years but they had been barking up the wrong tree for a few years that's for sure yeah so hmm I wonder how long it has been since we've seen like a massive improvement like wow where can we find the last one maybe it would be Athlon 64 on AMD side yeah no just in general the last time we saw a really big generational improvement with that said Conroe to Intel's integrated memory controller was a pretty big leap to because we went no because they introduced quad-core first hard to say in terms of I know I know it wasn't in a lot of different ways but in terms of like customer understanding and usability which is a weird thing largely due to naming but okay Andy bridge you think so I think a lot of people kind of got it more okay so you know what I'm gonna pick my moment for me the lot the biggest CPU improvement in performance was not actually Barton to claw hammer for me the biggest difference I saw was from and yeah again my point is not just performance stuff like I felt like the community like paying attention to forums and stuff like that I felt like people understood more but that one because the the product naming scheme I think made more sense for a lot of so I think it was Winchester was the last single core know vet Venice might have been San Diego oh crap which one was it a salon 64 models okay um the camera is tilted what yeah okay so I oh no no it's uh it's not centered yeah the thing is yeah whatever also there's some worry and your sweater if we want to get really you know it's very things that we don't worry about on the land show so for me the big one was going from single core Athlon 64 to I think it was the Toledo core going to dual core Athlon 64 because that was it wasn't a big improvement for gaming because back up that camera still dude what are they sorry just keep going I'll be back I think I do okay Oh max is here mac max is coming to save us because it wasn't a big improvement for gaming you got to remember that games did not benefit from dual-core CPUs back in those days but what it was was a huge improvement to the gaming experience if you had things running in the background and it was a huge improvement to really the experience of doing anything at the same time that was one yeah yeah yeah yeah really happened from yeah and that's a really big deal especially in terms of user experience yeah yeah and it's like this it's the same way and you know the funny thing is I remember arguing on forums about dual core back in the day because people who didn't see the bigger picture who just saw the benchmarks on whatever the site they preferred was and saw that in all their favorite games it didn't make a difference those people would come out and say you're paying literally twice as much for literally twice as many CPU cores and it doesn't make any difference and it's the same argument that I would have with people when SSDs were first starting to gain popularity where they'd go well the benchmarks don't indicate a significant difference in performance other than like boot time and they're very low capacity it feels really different and that's what it was like then yeah and honestly since since the first good SSDs so like back when Intel launched the X 25mm I haven't really had that experience again what was the first I'm not gonna Google I was ask you you probably know what was the first generation that Intel introduced Kay for their unlockable SKUs I believe it was the 2600 K yeah yeah so this is kind of no no no no there was an 8 7 5k was this yes and back then the so the 8 7 5k was Linfield yeah Linfield so Linfield was architectural II the same as bloomfield which was the high-end socket 1366 platform I think it'd be fair to say that Sandy Bridge popularized that though yeah so that was a big difference for you I think so I found on forums and discussing with my friends and all those kind of stuff people understood it a lot more when sandy bridge came around and they changed the number schemes of things there's easier to understand like I v i7 really 2600 K a 2500 k k non-kpop whole we're taking this to a strawpoll because it could be my little bubble I don't know I want to know okay so there's a couple of angles to this but but I'll get into it okay core I X more or less confusing okay than before and to be clear if you want to understand the entire stack it might even be slightly more confusing but if you're like is this one better or worse it's it's kind of easy okay guys hit that strawpoll I've got that in the twitch chat hit the straw poll so okay so here's the problem within a generation and within a product family remembering that laptop product family is not the same as desktop product family and not the same as you know enterprise product family then I can see core i3 Core i5 core i7 being simpler to understand however from generation to generation I would argue when it got WAY worse I'm just saying with that generation yeah it brought people into understanding yeah and I feel like a lot of people held on after that but yes it got messy it was really confusing I mean nowadays you'll see posts on craigslist where people are just saying core i7 pc yeah $300 whatever but we're way beyond we're not in the Sandy Bridge generation anymore okay okay and now and now I think understanding has gone up as a whole so you see that you go I know that's BS and then you look into it I think the understand and I know people are wow this is like 50/50 I don't remember the last time I saw our community this evenly split that's crazy easy I I think it I think Sandy Bridge brought the understanding of the entire industry as a community up and I think people held on whether this is people saying is it confusing in general now using now it's a mess now absolutely but I think like the knowledge base as a community has gone up okay and you can argue like well I was on overclock net back in 2003 and we understood way more back then sure yeah definitely OCN is not a good sample to pick from though yeah cuz you're all hardcore you guys are not representative of the general population all the forum dudes yep probably knew what was going on yeah that's not who I'm talking about I'm going a little bit I mean forums as in like gaming forums and stuff not like overclocking computer hardware forums so this is an interesting point on it cage in twitch chat said something kind of insightful LTT viewers are more technical in general so if 50% of us see it is more confusing regular people have no hope I don't think that's but what's interesting where I'm going with this is think about it this way I think regular people who go yeah I get it I 3 is less than I 5 is less than I 7 would actually vote less confusing yes even if they didn't know it but they were really confused or are totally wrong right definitely yeah so which is what I liked about Sandy Bridge right they just over years or different launches in released okay so this is interesting this is a really good point from NFS em 654 it's with Sandy Bridge some of the core i5s would dual core with onboard graphics yeah so this was before Intel standardized on onboard graphics being on everything because they were still building the IGP you on the package but not on to the die yet so quad core chips didn't have enough room for onboard graphics and the dual cores did meaning that inter compatibility on motherboards was actually quite confusing so I'd still maintain I think the overall knowledge base of the community went up and some of that's definitely boiled into okay there was a really weird naming change that just happened what's going on sorry did I say Sandy Bridge Linfield I'm sorry Linfield Linfield I think a lot of it was what's going on and people talking about the differences between different processors and what threads are and all of this other kind of stuff and like the differences between threads and cores a lot of these conversations started around the Sandy Bridge time and a lot of people actually cared about processor specs right now it's kind of a mess and a lot of people are interested in CPUs but the more recent interest in CPUs has been hey there's competition now what's better to explain to me what's better and I like AMD finally have something to upgrade to yeah I'm not necessarily saying that it was a good thing I'm not saying I'm just saying that the the I think the knowledgebase it's a whole increased at that time right and I like that all right let's move on to back I don't know I don't care anymore let's move on to the Galaxy S 9 so this was posted in the forum by d13 H for our d2l I ve died hard to live in the very worst leet-speak of all and there's no spaces yeah but anyway noticed that édouard the web had your like cat ear long purple hair photo thing that was alright article here is from TechCrunch calm with the galaxy their headline is with the galaxy s 9 samsung put the fingerprint sensor where it belongs and i guess that's probably the headline because there isn't a whole lot else to say about it I actually missed my briefing today that I was supposed to attend oh no I still don't have a device how will we know what its specs and stuff are but fortunately sort of news flash for the kanay in PR team the rest of the world is a thing and the Internet Wow the Internet oh and so I can just read about this stuff on other publications website that's amazing where they already know this stuff because they already had their briefings like a week ago not that I'm salty or upset or anything it's just that it's like whoa bigger net being in Canada is like a big like a big dick slap sometimes you don't matter yeah your population is literally 1/10 of the u.s. less than the state of California do you know what we don't give a spit anyway it's got the best DXL mark rating ever of 99 though it should be close it should be noted that the pixel 2 is at 98 and the iPhone 10 is at 97 so we really are splitting hairs at this point looks pretty similar to last gen but better camera as I just mentioned snapdragon 845 in the US and China and then Exynos whatever the crap it is something 9 something something else where they moved the fingerprint sensor to a more useable spot I think already said that they're gonna have an emojis though to be clear they're not normal emojis like apples the more like we Me's or bitmoji remember Me's well I don't know probably the biggest antenna fanboy you know did they have it on the Wii U yeah wait did you have a week you had a week yeah I play more we now than I did when it launched it's still great my sisters yeah I only play Wii Sports yeah my son loves Wiis but we sports is amazing I actually I interrupt this very compelling news about the Samsung Galaxy S 9 to bring you a personal confession something that is actually really hard for me to talk about it's it's it's actually related to the Nintendo Wii so as some of you probably know my son is about five and wow he's also Lee something shut up okay let me just I need to ease my self into this okay so my son is almost six and could you maybe enjoy this a little less I'm so excited sorry continue my son is almost sick shut up just keep going just chill out I believe in you so my son is almost six and he's been playing Wii we actually created a me for him when he was like three and a half I was like trying to see if like the stick wiggling was simple enough that he could do it wasn't he wasn't he wasn't ready yet but over probably the last year or so he's gotten to the point where he actually uses the wheat more than the vibe which is depressing for a whole level yeah but but he's gotten to the point where he's played enough Wii Sports that first like he would he was like a pro in Wii tennis right you know how you can play against the computer and you get over a thousand skill level and you're a pro tennis and the tennis one that's not the tennis one is pretty easy and but he got to the point where he was not just a pro but he had a skill level of like sixteen hundred and fifty or something which was more than mine mine was fourteen hundred and something but the reason that my skill level wasn't very high was I never played single player I would always play against my wife or like my sister-in-law because the last time I used the Wii was when I still lived with my wife's parents so it was like the family console and we'd like to LaRonde on Sunday night playing Wii Sports or whatever yeah yeah okay so so I was quite a bit better than my skill level would indicate so he would like he would go all like five-year-old kind of sulky my skill level is higher but you still beat me like without without even using like the cheap return whenever you miss a power smash there's a cheap return that if you time it's not even that hard to time but it's ungettable on both the forehand and the backhand if they don't manage to power serve and so I would beat him to like without even using that then and he'd complain he'd be whining about it then like a couple months later I'm playing against him and he takes a set and I'm just like oh okay like I wasn't really paying attention I was holding the baby on the other hand and I was like oh shoot okay darlin can you get down I got a I got a beat your brother it.we tennis um then he takes another set I hope what I'm like okay full-on cheap mode now so I'm I'm doing cheap returns like ungettable returns I'm power serving everything to him and I win it okay so I take I take three sets in a row and he's like oh I almost beat you literally like two weeks later he sweeps me and I'm like is this petty know what I don't care rematch ask for even I asked my five-year-old son for a rematch he beats me again straight again I don't even feel bad about him kicking my ass at Wii boxing because we boxing is quite frank who can flail the best and I'll like I'll play against him and I'll like trying time punches and it's just like come on it's better to flail like it's actually better to flail and it's so funny the way he plays it is so funny I have a video of him doing this so I'm saving for his wedding but instead of just like going like this she gets his whole body just like so the kid the kid will like she'll come out of playing a couple games of Wii boxing like dredged I'm like wow this is great because the whole idea behind the Wii was that it was more physical yeah yeah until like jackasses like me figured out that they could play Twilight Princess like this yeah you know like yeah I'm still joystick waggling or whatever but I'm not I'm not moving yeah so I can still kick his butt at golf I can still crush him at bowling actually almost got a perfect game I I missed one pin on the first one which made me feel a lot better then all strikes through to the end and then I missed one pin on the end so I'm actually really glad I missed that one pin at the beginning because otherwise that one at the end would have destroyed me as a person yeah oh oh is there a Wii U one okay cool maybe I should get a Wii U probably cheap and then what's the what's the last game oh the baseball baseball movie is just stupid like yeah he beat me at baseball but like baseball is just a matter of like who luckily connects with a pitch because as soon as a human is pitching you could just throw all the cheapest garbage and it's like unhittable do you have the improved sensors I don't okay I don't think we sports is Wii MotionPlus compatible though so I don't think it matters the Wii U controllers have it built-in yeah and they're the same size as the default controllers okay which is kind of nice cool and I believe all Wii U games work with it because it's the default controller yeah okay well maybe maybe I'll get a weave at some point but anyway that was my confession it actually happened I was actually trying already trying all right like I was I was hitting cheap shots that I knew he didn't know about this is like playing like NHLPA 94 and doing wrap arounds on the bottom when someone else doesn't know about it like that is three ferret that's how I was playing wrap arounds are pretty easy to like pick up on if someone's doing it to you yeah yeah dude man like I that's pretty rough yeah what is the number one game that would hurt for him to be better than you at you know I'm not really that good at anything um like there's there's games where I just really wouldn't expect him to ever be better than me like I don't think he'll ever be better at a side-scroller just cuz that genre is not really popular like like modern side-scrollers what like trying like that's not it like there's some like really niche like ultra hardcore yeah like you could argue the to super meatboy is a modern ish side-scroller but even that's like years old and and like it's a dying it's it's it was like a it was like the you like press down on the chest of the corpse and it's like like it's not breathing anymore it's just like a last last gasp so to speak doesn't know like I so yeah I wouldn't it yeah Cup heads nod that's not it's not Super Mario World yeah it's it's more advanced than that there's more there's a lot more to it so if he were to beat me like if you were to be better than me at like Super Mario World I'd feel pretty devastated but I don't expect that to happen it would be kind of like it would be kind of like me being better at shuffleboard than my grandparents like yeah if I put enough time into it I could probably do it but I wouldn't care yeah like I'd be concerned about him so badminton no I fully expect him to be better at me than better than me at that I am planning to when do you think they'll happen I'm gonna be paying like $75 an hour for badminton coaching for him within the next few months Oh like he is going to prodigy level he's going to the best badminton facility in Canada oh he is going to be get sits here actually arguably there's been there's been more national level players but the other other places have done well too they've had they've had good products as well and then if he's good enough I would happily pay for him to train overseas if it comes to that so as far as I'm concerned if he is not beating me at badminton by the time he was about 11 or 12 then we need to reevaluate cuz I'm not that good so he's into it yeah he likes it yeah yeah gave me very broad like no he's all week I knew that I wanted to get that out of you so yeah twitch chat knows that you're not just being with like no not kind of dad yeah he's already playing a couple times a week he likes it um I also fully expect him to be better at martial arts than me although by the time he by the time he gets like a ha oh shoot this is gonna happen sooner than I had sort of thought about but by the time he hits like 9 or 10 he hits like red brown belt I'm probably gonna have to try and get back into this I don't get passed too quickly there but yeah I fully expect him to be better than me at everything if he's not that I failed as a parent cuz that's your job can I be like a boss along the way a boss yeah I think he's probably gonna be quite a bit smaller than you for ever have you seen his mother but he'll pass on he'll be more skilled he'll be like the light character that you choose that's the funny thing about that is there's a reason that like the UFC doesn't have heavyweights fight lightweights okay chun-li wouldn't actually stand a chance against Blanca but the little dude that he just made you Jitsu can kick my butt so that's the thing okay eventually I'll get with that said if you weren't jujitsu Eng and you just went for a football tackle yeah does that still go down that way probably it's a very nice guy okay so within the constraints of the sport you get your butt kicked but yeah um speaking of within the constraints of Bancho let's start with synergy two if you have two computers or more and you have one desk synergy 2 is the way to go it's a software based mouse and keyboard sharing solution that works on Windows Mac and Linux computers is that out on floatplane yet because that is a sick video do you know about this yet no we did a showcase piece for synergy and we were kind of sitting around going like okay how do we how do we do this yeah there is a there's an export for this I'm just gonna pull it up I don't think it's actually live on floatplane yet but I'm gonna pull this up because it's really cool I just want to show the demo here but we were sitting around going you know how do we how do we do a video for synergy that's not just a shield piece that's like actually cool we were like oh I don't know maybe we could just do a shield piece and then it might actually be cool and it worked out really well check so okay that ended up being a little more a little more dramatic than I hoped I'm just gonna skip ahead to Texas so they're all firing up that's windows 7 OS 10 or Mac OS sorry Windows 10 and Linux and then what I can do with this monitor this is that LG monitor that's cool right that's cool and then you can switch fullscreen with the remote for the monitor so I was using the remote there you can just go you can get out of picture by picture and go fullscreen to any one of them in 4k 60 and then you can press another button to go back to your tile setup cool right that is pretty cool so you can effectively be using four different operating system workstations at once and switch between fullscreen and having all of them and then when they're all on so there's a toggle for synergy to that they're adding or they'll have either added it by the time this goes live or they've added it already so that through the task bar of any one of them you can toggle synergy 2 on and off so that when you go fullscreen your mouse doesn't fly off the edges yeah because all of the the fullscreen versus not fullscreen that's being handled in hardware by the monitor not by the seamless to soft that's a really cool setup isn't it I can actually think of a lot of different industries that would like that oh absolutely so it's one of those niche things but for the people who are into that pretty freakin cool so anyways soon as you - makes it easier than ever to mouse and keyboard share between multiple systems they've got new networking back back-end that helps with complex networks they've got oh the ssl encryption has been moved from the pro to the basic tier so all users can benefit from encryption and the new background service on all platforms lets users control all their machines before they're even logged into the computer so get 50% off your purchase of synergy - we'll have that linked down so do you

get back to the galaxy yes 9 do we even care tonight nine hundred and 60 FPS limo that's cool HD 0.2 22 seconds so probably end trigger I guess I'm hoping so Oh instead of trying to time your button press it will apparently a I tried to detect where the action is in the clip and apply slow mode of that part yeah I guess that point two seconds you wouldn't even have time for end trigger okay this is interesting so the original article hears from a non tech I was just browsing through and I don't really know how this wasn't bigger news I mean a non tech called it awkward first results that's one way of putting it but in a nutshell it'll be either Exynos 9810 or snapdragon 845 and if we go down bippity be a bit a bit bit bit oh what's the final clock speed that they'll use blah blah blah blah blah blah blah active blah blah blah memory latency etc etc okay big little design here we go here we go woo so Geekbench for single core performance snapdragon 845 got absolutely first by the 9810 how very interesting last generation etc etc okay again oh wait that's still Geekbench for us it splits no PC mark work 2.0 so the 9810 does not crush the snapdragon 845 here where is it yep there it snaps making a 45s right up on the top but basically oh thank you for that okay what seems very clear something's wrong Oh No Oh Luke was plugging in my power did I actually not make it almost got it by like milliseconds almost got it oh man oh that was great good I know it's fine they can't see it um okay oh man okay so clearly there's something kind of wrong and basically the writer checked in with Samsung here we go I did get confirmation okay here we go Samsung spokesman confirmed that the demo unit was running special firmware for Mobile World Conference so these results because you can clearly see they're totally bummed up because the PC mark score has the Exynos 9810 getting creamed by even the last generation Exynos yeah last generation Snapdragon and of course current generation Snapdragon so clearly something's wrong here so confirmation that the demo units were running a special firmware and they might not be optimized he's having a hard time believing they would so drastically limit the performance of the device for show units honestly I don't find that that hard to believe all kinds of games get played with the phone firmware for shows and even for reviewers but check this out did get confirmation that samsung is planning to tune down the Exynos variant to match Snapdragon performance Wow so I'm actually not sure how that wasn't bigger news because I can see a lot of different ways that people can get upset about this and I can't see a lot of ways where people wouldn't be a little upset about this so the two ways I can see people being upset upset number one would be if I got a snapdragon 845 galaxy s nine because there's always controversy there yeah and with Apple it was even so what was it a ten was the first one they did it on where they dual sourced from TSMC and and then one of them was better than yeah one of them was arguably sometimes better than the other and it was mostly in terms of battery life where people were getting upset because one of them was a little bit more power efficient but it was close enough I was things within 5% like it was close enough that you were also playing around with the variations in battery capacity at that point so I can see people being upset about getting the perceived trashy err chip the other thing I could PC people being upset about is if you're in the European or Asian market and you've got an X and O's 88 95 didn't having it be nerfed and see this is probably one of the actuation yeah what's that Samsung this is probably one of those situations where Samsung realized that this these problems could happen so they decided to try to quietly make them the same so that people wouldn't argue which you know from a certain standpoint I kind of understand they're like we just don't want people to freak out so if we make everything the same that it's great but then people are gonna freak out because then they should have gotten an advantage is this San Siro is this Samsung kind of going well you know the Canadian region probably won't care about this phone until such time as it's available through Canadian carriers so let's just not bother briefing them like is this them going you know what you know outside of the US Americans probably don't read you know non-american news outlets so they're probably not gonna like look that closely at the Exynos version so like as long as we seed all the US outlets with snapdragon ones should be fine like are they is this them going okay as long as we keep it contained within a region then no one will figure this out and you know the mainstream consumer probably wouldn't is that what's happening here Wow I think okay so I think it's been proven many many many times that nerds are gonna figure it out mainstream consumer no mainstream the consumer is not gonna care there's an iterative number they're gonna see that's the s9 and they'll want it if they're getting a new phone for whatever reason okay I've got a lot of people asking this and we really need to we really need to address it I can't find the first person who asked it but let's let's go down to this one who was it okay whatever the question is why here we go der Fuehrer 123 ah seriously why doesn't Samsung use Exynos in the US and China and then another person asked why does Samsung a not a designer and fabricator of mobile CPUs I use there why do they use Paul comm CPUs in their phones and the answer is actually a little more interesting than you might at first think there was a different word I was looking for and I'm know it was like delicate and but it wasn't delicate it's a little more subtle a little more whatever I forget so the reason we read junk I'll say Radio compatibility is actually one factor but Samsung could probably figure out how to support more bands with their chipset if they really pretty sure they wanted to hard enough but one wants nuance thank you that's them know those the check oh thank you chat nuance I just I read it in channels like absolutely so there are business reasons for doing it so first of all within samsung's different business units like for example their fabrication unit that also as you guys probably know builds RAM or NAND flash or even processors for competitors within Samsung's different business units I have it on fairly good authority that Samsung unit a won't actually get a discount compared to the open market from Samsung unit B so if Samsung Mobile wants to by NAND flash for their phones for storage they don't get like a discount compared to if Apple we're buying it it's all down to that business unit the the fabrication business unit needing to make the best profits they can and negotiating deals based on volume based on capacity based on all the things that they would normally do so there's one reason why Samsung Mobile might not be married to Exynos chips reason number two is that building a CPU is really hard every time look at Snapdragon 810 even Qualcomm who has been other than Apple basically the undisputed leader for a lot of the last few years can really screw it up sometimes so if Samsung were to just say AHA for our note and s line up we are not going to use your top tier chips we're gonna stop marketing Qualcomm technology being good we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna burn this bridge because we can make our own CPUs that if Samsung were to do that and then flub up a generation or two generations of chips they could put their Galaxy S or no products at a significant disadvantage compared to the LG's and HTC's of the world guys who didn't invest in that fabrication technology but also aren't taking that risk so Samsung is dual sourcing not just to make up fabric fab capacity which as far as we can tell us why Apple does it also to play the different fabricators against each other oh yeah that's another reason so that they can play Samsung's own business unit against external ones where was I going with this right so there's also a business reason for dual sourcing not just to make up fab capacity but also to hedge your bets so Samsung has the ability to ramp up and do X in US and more regions if you know Qualcomm chips are dead again but they can also cover for their own dud in the event that wall comes technology is significant you join and Samsung they can't really okay I'm what Hunter said certain they can't afford it but I'm gonna say in this immediately they're also legally required to use their chips in their phones it's a 25 year old agreement weird so that's another one but but having another big launch failure will be really bad this close to their phone bombs remember to Samsung could also just use Qualcomm chips in their lower end stuff it's not like Samsung doesn't have a bazillion models of phones yeah but why they might do it on within a single model there's a lot of reasons so there's that and then there's all the other stuff that we're talking about as well all right apparently also Qualcomm CDMA patent and licensing so until CDMA goes away they'll just basically be forced to but with all of that said I have an X in O's Galaxy s8 it works fine in the States but it just might not work on all carriers so it wouldn't work on Springs who else is still CDMA CDMA will be going away sometime in the next little bit it can't be that many carriers though I don't think it's that mean I don't know who used the CDMA still who in Canada ah Bell did until recently I don't know if they do anymore they might be just some now yeah I don't I don't pay that close attention so 18 really they're all still using it Sprint Verizon and US Cellular I didn't know Verizon was still using CDMA AT&amp;T Mobile or GSM hmm fun according to Google anyway and then apparently Bell Mobility in Ontario Quebec is still CDMA Oh tell us the CDMA here there you go interesting but we don't know necessarily that they're only using it yeah so yeah again I don't pay that close attention to that stuff because I'm just not that big of a cellphone nerd if I'm gonna be honest with you guys uh what else do we have for news oh I don't know I'm just go drop it with a doc for no reason happens once a show really bad timing I don't know why it does that perfect celebrate is now advertising they can break the security of iOS 11 including the iPhone 10 for pretty cheap too articles from Forbes now do you have to have the phone physically in their possession yep so you'd have to ship it to them and apparently it can cost as little as fifteen hundred dollars per unlock their service to determine or disable determine or disable that's a big difference actually because determining if you get someone's phone temporarily when they lost it and you ship it off and get their PIN and then get it back and get whatever you want and then be like oh my god I found your phone yeah not great yeah they can determine or disable the pin pattern password screen locks or pass codes on the latest Apple iOS and Google Android devices yeah brutal so we have to take this with the claim of with a grain of salt because celebrates business is breaking security of devices for like forensic data analysis so you know they might just be looking for some free press but it seems like it would be sort of a bad move to put out something that's designed to get you a bunch of free press and then anytime anyone contacts you about you can't actually do it yeah so they haven't even publicly announced it but apparently they're advertising the capability to their customers so it sounds pretty credible yeah it can determine or disable the pin the pattern the password screen locks or pass codes on the latest devices Wow Wow pretty brutal not a fan of this really that's pretty much it actually is there like anything else that happened this week that like is super important we don't have anything else in the doc because James has been busy on a really cool project have you even seen this yet no like you're so out of touch these days Wow so we built um your son in tennis why don't we play I'll play I'll lose but I've been down I'm done I'll get rekt but it sounds entertaining anyway it's a cool product so I was kind of inspired by the tape deck that we have in our house for some reason and you know how you use used to be oppressed like a physical button like a mechanical button to kind of to switch things so I was like you know what be really cool a gaming setup where you've got like a tactile button for switching between your different devices different devices yeah so cuz you know PC gaming is not the only kind of gaming yeah so James and Anthony collaborated we didn't actually end up with as cool buttons as I'd hoped they're like vandal resistant switches unfortunately but but what is cool is that I wanted to work like an RGB element into it so they built a desk not quite scratch built but like use the Ikea desk builder then modified it quite heavily that has a bunch of circuitry in the top including a an Arduino and an HDMI switcher so that what you can do is there's three RGB color coded lights on the front for the three gaming systems that are in shelves working their way down along down one side yeah and then when you so when you press the red one it does the top and then the RGB lighting in the drawer illuminates and the input switches on your monitor this legit sounds like a sellable so you're on your PC thing then you press the second button the RGB lighting illuminates matching the button the middle one and you switch to your Xbox press the third one you switch to your PlayStation 4 Pro that's really cool pretty cool right you guys should figure out how to sell this as a kit it's connect janky still it would require significant further development to make it ready for primetime I'll be so cool though but you know we okay so we know a lot of other guys out there have been doing like setups for a while yeah and so for us you know we we've had some ideas for setups like you saw the projector one right with the processor built into the Dow's very cool yeah so we've had some ideas for setups but like we really wanted to find a way to make sure that what we're doing is different from what anyone else is doing so that was where the idea of projector built into your desk or like a physical button to switch inputs between your different gaming systems came from and I like it I think this is something that we're gonna continue to do and you know I'd love to see people's ideas if you want to post them on the forum I am actually fairly active over there yeah I don't post a lot but I do read a lot yeah yeah I really I'm really happy with it alright so I think that's pretty much it cool we have a ton of people know that yeah viewing - we've got like six thousand viewers and then we've got a bunch of people cheering oh this is a new thing oh yeah so it used to just show the top cheer like ever yeah now it shows the weekly top Cheers and it like totals there Cheers so like this dude I'm a broke dude who's hilarious hilariously number one tear right now that's why you're broke yeah then maybe you stop that if he talks in chat if any of these top three talked in chat they have a little metal next to the name and Hisle show one his will show a - and be silver his Oh show three and be bronze and then the one guys got it okay new it's a new thing apparently there was there look oh I'm a broke dude shows one right next to him on a gold medal oh no there was other news ah the Xbox one x and the Xbox one s are getting 1440p support so that's dope what yeah that already be there no they supported 1080 in 4k oh and so now if you don't care about 4k which you probably shouldn't because you're gaming on a TV um oh so you can tell it oh okay okay cool right I see what you mean now that's very cool actually yeah okay I'm totally on board now apparently first I was like what the heck apparently there was a Nintendo switch news I don't know what it was what no no okay you can use a PlayStation 4 controller that's an article that I saw earlier that was gonna meet anyway I think the 1s and the 1x supporting 1440p is a way bigger deal because if you use a console at like in a dorm or whatever you probably don't have a 4k TV I probably don't have a TV at all you probably have your desk which if you're smart has like a big monitor so you can use that as a monitor and as a TV you're smart and you're a baller although they're not that expensive these days especially like compared to a TV anyway this point is a big monitor will probably be 1440p if you don't want to spend a whole bunch of money for 4k and anything if there's big screens in dorms at all they're probably TVs and they're probably real old right okay so fine if you're a baller student you can get one of those Korean 1440p monitors on eBay you can hook that up to your PC and now to your Xbox and you can get better image quality we know about the github thing github got nailed by a massive DDoS and they recovered real quick good job github there we go yeah it was huge though it's a gigantic DDoS but yeah they recovered quite quickly good job github see you again next week same bat-time same bat-channel bye [Music] slow mo from madrenas like yeah we're already past the 300 so um yeah good think you see does the greatest do does no no that's just someone we have the best DDoS 
when we first saw the specs of the new Xbox 1x we were intrigued to say the least there's 40 compute units it has native support for 4k 60fps gameplay are there asterisks next to these claims are gonna leave us disappointed or are we finally looking at a console that achieves both affordability and a PC like gameplay experience speaking of not being disappointed today's video is brought to you by tunnel bear tunnel bear makes it easy to privately and securely browse a more open Internet and to try tunnel bear for free go to Tunnel bear comm /l tt [Music] so even though it's being touted as the most powerful console ever Microsoft's latest keeps the familiar Xbox one branding rather than adopting a new name that would immediately indicate an all-new experience but this makes sense on some level although the Xbox one X is graphically more capable than last year's Xbox one s the changes to its internal architecture are evolutionary rather than revolutionary you'll be plugging in the same ports and playing the same games on the same controller just with prettier pixels so if you think about it buying a console has become more like a PC than ever before there are now two models of the PlayStation 4 and three of the Xbox one whose primary difference is our form factor power efficiency and graphics card configuration just like the gaming computer shelf at a Best Buy or something like that that is not to say though that the specification differences between the Xbox one X and its predecessors aren't significant on a sheet of paper to some people they're just higher numbers the higher clock Jaguar CPU is literally just that but looking closely at the graphics configuration of this new custom chip reveals that it's closest desktop PC equivalent is probably a Radeon rx 580 which is a very capable card so in practical terms they make possible the big selling point for the console its support for 4k gaming at 60fps natively understandably Microsoft hasn't been shy about this hardware investment marketing the Xbox one X as a premium experience now of course that doesn't mean you can expect to find a water cooling system and an SSD in it but it is equipped with a beefier vapor chamber heatsink than we saw in the Xbox one s that kept the hottest part of the system at a reasonable 70 degrees under load without getting obnoxiously loud and there's a one terabyte hard drive that is advertised as up to 50 percent faster a benefit not just to game load times but also when the system needs to stream in higher resolution textures as you wander around open environments feature-wise the 1x is state-of-the-art it comes with out-of-the-box support for both HDR 10 high dynamic range redundant I know you can learn more about it up here but basically it amounts to deeper blacks brighter whites and more vibrant colors on supported displays along with that there's also Dolby Atmos a surround sound technology that encodes audio as objects instead of individual channels for greater positional accuracy and realism with the proper home theater hardware Atmos is a game changer BB Atmos headphone is also supported with a $15.00 add-on purchase but the gears for dolby headphone experience and even some canned demos they were pretty underwhelming so I would hold off on this one at least for now now let's look at the visual experience we gathered our competitors and settled on a test suite of games that showed off the Xbox one X is different ways of rendering 4k content let's kick things off with four to seven this was one of the titles Microsoft demoed prior to the One X's launch to show off its native 4k 60 capabilities unsurprisingly the Xbox one X absolutely shined in this game not only did it give us much better detail than the upscaled 4k from the 1s it was even a little bit better than our $500 PC which was running the game at 4k on the recommended preset at around 45 FPS anti-aliasing helped our PC a little bit but the Xbox one X showed off details we couldn't quite make out on the PC even the controls on the dashboard inside our car and it did so while running the game noticeably more smooth so yeah score one for the One X here though of course this is a Microsoft exclusive game so the ps4 Pro didn't actually get a crack at it let's move right along to shadow of war another native 4k title but one that only runs at 30fps on the One X this game looked more or less equally nice on the ps4 Pro and the Xbox one Xbox Turk wallet' II and the 1s again was noticeably less sharp due to the lack of native 4 okay support the system that gave us the worst overall experience at 4k was our will our $500 PC which had to turn down to the lowest preset to be playable but obviously we are aware that that could be due to video memory limitation and should be noted that at 1080p and ultra details it kept pace much better now let's look at Assassin's Creed origins which uses checkerboard rendering at 4k on both of our flagship consoles this ended up being a very similar story to shadow of war with the ps4 pro and Xbox one X looking nearly identical the one asks a little bit less sharp and the $500 PC was only playable on the low preset until we turn down the resolution but you should note that on PC there's a lot of performance issues due to some funky DRM stuff that's going on a weird aside here is that although Ubisoft called Assassin's Creed on the Xbox one X the definitive version of the game we were very hard-pressed to notice anything that made it stand out but Microsoft says it isn't all about 4k and they claimed that the more powerful processor in the Xbox one X will like we've been doing on our PC during our testing allow the use of higher quality assets at 1080p so we turned down the resolution of both our One X and our PC to 1080p then cranked our PC presets up to ultra quality on each game and to the Xbox's credit all three games looked nearly identical with the small caveat that we needed to enable the favored quality setting on shadow of war this customizability is a fantastic trend that we support and we'd like to see continue but if you're going to be gaming on a 1080p display for the foreseeable future this doesn't necessarily give the most powerful console ever an unequivocal recommendation that's because for us if we're going to have a similar gaming experience anyways we'd rather go for a more versatile PC that isn't restricted to one specific console ecosystem with that said the 4k experience is a bit of a different story if you have to build a PC from the ground up for $500 especially if you're including windows that price the Xbox 1x craps all over the 4k gaming experience you'd be having if you want to buy brand-new hardware from a store with a warranty and all of that and not do the whole scrapyard worst thing at this point in time but if you're comparing to a ps4 Pro which is a hundred bucks cheaper and has the same support for technologies like HDR and Dolby Atmos bitstream pass-through along with very similar gaming performance in a fair amount of titles while that hundred dollar premium gets you the awesome UHD 4k blu-ray playback if you're going to use that and most importantly for the majority of people more powerful hardware that should deliver a higher percentage of games at krispy 4k sixty there's also the awesome benefit of Xbox play anywhere which allows you to play your games on both Xbox and PC with just one purchase which is great for both being able to play with your friends despite being on potentially a different platform and as an awesome value add you do have to wrestle with the always infuriating Windows Store on the PC side but I'll take it if it means that I get my game on both platforms without paying twice super cool another thing to consider is that if you've already got a PC with a 4k display and 500 bucks burning a hole in your pocket it might be worth upgrading that will likely net you the best 4k gaming experience for your money but the Xbox one X absolutely has a place in the market if you have or will soon obtain a 4k TV HD are for an added bonus and if you want a console to take full advantage of it the Xbox one X will deliver the best frame rates and the highest resolution for consoles and before you scream about it know it's not a replacement for GT X 1080 it's not a replacement for a Vegas 64 these things can run 4k at i popping frame rates that's wonderful but it might be enough to stem the tide of exponent peasant station jokes at least for a while maybe in some corners isn't it I Who am I kidding it's not going to do anything I'm sure there's already a massive war in the comments of this video before we even got to this section so whatever at least the

So my plan today Was supposed to be an update on the dual socket 56 core machine I got my heatsink from Super Micro. I got my instructions Look at this color color instructions Wow amazing I got my cooler And I specifically said I specifically said The motherboard uses the square ILM, it doesn't match up Because these are for the narrow ILM and the motherboard uses the square ILM And I cried First I was sad, and then I was mad And then I was super excited because I actually had something that might even be cooler to show off to you guys So check this out this is the world's highest box to card-sized ratio Video card that has existed in at least 10 years, because this used to be a thing, like I remember back when Asus Would have video card boxes that were literally like this big. Chain Tech like those companies They had these giant boxes and the idea was that they were too cheap to Buy shelf space, to buy frontage space in the retail stores right because that's what you have to do That's how the retail industry works. They were too cheap to buy the placements so they just made these gigantic boxes, so they wouldn't have to pay But they would have to get a ton of space on the shelf. Isn't it brilliant. I mean where's Chain Tech at today, right? anyway, so ZOTAC has apparently just reused a box from an existing GTX 1080TI, you would think except that this arctic storm thing here that looks like a sticker and this mini, these aren't stickers. They specifically went out of their way to create this this gigantic box for this tiny graphics card But its size should not Not dissuade you, it should not tell you anything about its power because this is a full-fledged GTX 1080Ti and it is the size of like a 1050 so ZOTAC has not only Engineered a full 1080 TI into something that is the same size as their previous 1080 mini they have also created a fully custom water cooling solution so you can see here they've got They've got coverage for the VRMs right here They've got pads on the memory modules right here and right down this side and then they've got a GPU contact area for the 1080 Ti so they have created a fully custom water block solution for it as well Now I do have some misgivings about their water block design It does not appear to be all copper which depending on your loop configuration May be an issue for you or may not I'm actually a huge fan of what EK is done with their Aluminium lineup of products all aluminium products that are lower cost and designed to go together But if you're mixing and matching you can run into issues even if you use anti corrosive Additives, so what all we got here, we do get a DVI port, we get three DisplayPort ports We get one HDMI, we get a slightly taller than a PCI bracket PCB So they have cheated a little bit there, but you kind of kind of give them give them that because realistically with all of this space on the top for the Connections you were I mean you were gonna have to have a bit more space above the card in your case anyway Now one thing I wish they had done was rather than come out this way I wish that they had gone with fittings on the top and on the bottom like this but again I'm you know I got to go easy on them dual 8 pin connectors so I would expect to be able to overclock the stuffing out of this thing and In terms of included accessories, they got a couple six to eight pins And then they've got a couple of 3/8 inch fittings I remember I still remember back when half-inch fittings used to be the the cat's pajamas and..Oh interesting I think these are aluminium Okay, so yeah, it's aluminium block intended to be used with aluminium products I would recommend or at the very least make sure you use a healthy mix of anti corrosive additive all right so to fully Appreciate the scale of this thing I want to show it next to a couple of other cards first of all Here is a Titan XP collector's edition So it is that much shorter, it is a little bit taller see this there we go So it is a little bit taller But it should theoretically actually that would be really interesting It should only take up a single PCIe slot if you were going to cut off the DVI port like we did in our single slot Titan mod Then compared to one of the most ginormous graphics cards of all time the 6990, this thing has Way more power much smaller size, and it'll run completely silently assuming that you have a water cooling loop Woah So there you have it. I don't really have a standard outro for these classic unboxings Subscribe and like and maybe we'll run the credits if someone other than me chops it together 
okay okay I know what you're thinking water plus a high amperage transformer that can literally blow up and take the rest of your computer hardware with it what could go wrong good idea or bad idea it's here and our goal today is to find out if the usual benefits of liquid cooling quieter cooler operation can also apply to a power supply and we wouldn't be able to do it without tunnel Baer tunnel barrier makes it easy to privately and securely browse a more open Internet Tritonal bear for free at tunnel bear comm /l tt [Music] so the first thing that caught our attention about this product aside from it being a water-cooled power supply was the standard G one-quarter openings complete with bits power logo under the modular power connectors if they were trying to do a quality job they definitely found a solid partner so let's keep going then the internals do still have a fan making this a hybrid design similar to a Seuss's poseidon series of graphics cards but at the bottom of the main PCB there is also what appears to be a full-length water block it doesn't seem to have any fins but it does have a flow meter interesting now the NDA that we signed prevents us from tearing down our unit to show you exactly what that plate makes contact with but everything we can see from peering inside suggests that the internal heatsink array is pretty typical of a normal air-cooled power supply and nothing on the fan side suggested that special design considerations had been made to accommodate transferring the heat to the water block so maybe the top mounted heat sinks run all the way through the PCB holes to the base of the block or maybe there's just a big thick thermal pad on the bottom of a completely normal power supply we actually don't know but none of this prevents us from answering our original question anyway so let's move on to find out if cooler and quieter can be achieved through FS P's method whatever it is we tested our unit in both air and liquid cooled mode and also compared it to one of the best air cooled power supplies on the market the corsair ax 1200 I we ran each of them at idle 2/3 load and max capacity taking both thermal and acoustic measurements now one does not simply make a system consume 1,200 watts of power without some seriously overkill hardware so to achieve that we rigged up an X to ninety-nine platform with the 16 core core I 979 60 X overclocked to 4.2 Jigga Hertz then we threw four overclocked Titan X Pascal's on to the rig for some gpgpu rendering and ah beautiful just over 1,400 watts from the wall so with some CPU voltage adjustments we got our system dialed in to about 1200 watts we then used cable mod extenders to be able to have the power supply in a separate room in order to control sound leakage first up then our air cooled testing at idle both units remain silent neither of their fans turned on nothing to see here at 2/3 load the FSP fan spun up to about 800 rpm and our formal imagery showed hotspots inside the unit at over 77 degrees Celsius our xx sound meter read 44 decibels and I'd say subjectively it was about as loud as a d5 pump at 12 volts by comparison our corsair ax i reached only 700 RPM and was ever so slightly quieter at full 1200 watt load the fan spun up all the way to about 1200 rpm reaching 50 decibels and it was definitely audible over our 12 volt t5 pump making it the worst offender in a hypothetical system being pushed to the limits we saw two significant hotspots with our thermal camera and we even experienced some strange clicking and crackling noises for comparison our course air hit only 950 rpm at 46 decibels making it significantly less noticeable over a d5 not to mention that there was no crackling but it was noticeable over a d5 so maybe there is some improvement to be had from water cooling and besides this the hydro PTM Plus 1200 watt was never meant to be air-cooled so let's throw this fish back in its natural habitat with a 240 millimeter liquid cooler hooked up we started with this power supply at 2/3 load and oh well that's kind of weird the fan turned on it did spin at a slightly lower rpm than when it was air-cooled but while our noise measurements did go down we actually didn't find that it made a noticeable difference compared to all air that mid point heat spot was gone though at full bore the fan spun up to 900 ish rpm quite a bit lower than when it was air-cooled but it was still audible over a d5 with pretty much the same heat spots on the fan side so what happened here well without being able to take the unit apart to confirm our the block is only cooling the back side of the PCB theory it remains just that a theory but one that is somewhat corroborated by these renders that we found on FS B's website to be clear we did observe an improvement and it is possible that a liquid cooled power supply could achieve better cooling and noise characteristics than an equivalent air-cooled one but the implementation on this one did leave a bit to be desired we had really hoped that the fan wouldn't be needed at all as long as the water cooling didn't fail so I would like to see a second attempt at this concept but maybe one that is more tightly integrated with the water block actually directly making contact with the heat producing parts of the power supply maybe then FSP would be on to something as it stands at the time of filming we actually don't know the price of this unit but we don't think it really matters anyway however much it is we really don't see the point of paying extra for it over another high quality high wattage power supply unless you just must have everything in your system liquid cooled for like último bragging rights speaking of ultimate bragging rights you

okay so picture this your SOS got a feminine-hygiene emergency and cannot leave the house to get her own bio waste management products so it's on you but you do not feel like going to the local grocery store and listening to the cashier making that stale joke about your own flow so what's the solution well for us it was to get in the car drive two-and-a-half hours down to Seattle and visit the Amazon go pilot location the world's only retail store where you do not have to have any human interaction whatsoever you just grab what you want put it in your bag and leave but what's the experience like well we're gonna tell you after we tell you about Tunnel Bear be easy to use VPN that makes the internet a more open place giving everyone access to the same content check them out at Tunnel Bear comm /l TT will have that linked below [Music] okay so step one is to get the Amazon Go app once you're signed into your account you don't need Prime this QR code right here allows you to scan in any guests that are with you though do note that anything they take will be charged to your account and then enter the store you can't get in without your phone but Amazon says that handy-dandy Amazon staff members will be on hand with charging banks if for whatever reason you need to juice up before you go in so let's try it I mean okay we're inside so it kind of looks like a regular grocery store so how does it work Amazon isn't being too specific about the details but we do know a few things one is that the place is absolutely peppered with cameras see those black boxes up there there are literally hundreds of cameras inside what is only an 1,800 square foot store according to one article I read they are designed to read camera friendly codes that are printed out on each of the items but these just look like regular UPC codes so I'm actually not sure about that what we do know is that while it was present in the original patent filing RFID technology is not being used and we also know that they are using computer vision algorithms in order to understand what you're picking up and they are also assisting this technology with additional sensors like for example weight sensors in the shelves themselves pressure sensors and load cells each of those components together increases Amazon's confidence in what exactly it is that you have picked up and put in your bag or your pocket or whatever the case may be so in terms of product mix and pricing it's not like a giant grocery store like you can't even buy a full gallon of milk or anything like that but I mean it's pretty competitive with what you'd expect from like a neighborhood grocer or like like a corner store like this curried chicken wrap is six bucks whoa what this is interesting so these food items these are marked with those camera recognizable codes that I was talking about before because I guess you know if it doesn't come in a package it's a lot harder to tell the difference between curried chicken wrap and tuna wrap Oh BK b kelly b k LT wrap does this have kale in it you guys are you guys are killing me here bacon kale lettuce tomato wrap I mean if I'm gonna have like the trendy Seattle experience I gotta have the wrap with the kale in it would you want Dennis well I don't know man I don't know what to tell you okay then just get it I tell you man this is like weird stuff cuz like normally sitting in a store putting stuff in your backpack like here let's get something to drink - Dennis what you want want Apple I'm getting snapped and the sunburn drinks I don't think so no I don't think so sorry you're gonna have to have the only like 98% Amazon experience here harmless coconut water do you want the harmful one or the harmless one you want the harmful one well this one's harmless I don't like I feel like someone's gonna come tackle me okay so we got all our snacks now we've got to get what we actually came here for we can choose between the always infinity and the Tampax pearl let's let's go with the let's go see always right here but with a twist I have a challenge for their system I want to see how it handles me putting this down in the wrong place and then picking it back up all right thank you yeah cool let's say I'm shopping first an alcohol and I kind of go do I really want this not sure I want to see how it handles it aha yep yep okay you know what I actually don't want some alcohol after all but if I come back without these I'm gonna get in all sorts of trouble so let's head for the exit like my reflex as I'm walking towards the exit is like okay I gotta get ready to take off my bag and take my stuff out and put it on the thing so theoretically now as I walk through what they're calling the transition area Amazon is going to do a small transaction on my credit card $1.00 just to validate that it's working then they're gonna build a balance of it once they've totaled up everything that I took bear in mind guys that if you over draw your credit card that's on you to deal with any kind of penalties or fees that are associated with that so here it is [Music] there we go there we go nice get up and go your trip time was 26 minutes and 27 seconds your receipt is ready check this out so Amazon is actually so confident in their system that they've built in a feature where if for whatever reason you're charged for something that you didn't take you can actually just remove it and crazily enough they're using the honor system which if you think about it actually isn't that crazy because it's tied into your Prime account which is tied into your credit card Amazon can use machine learning not to mention just common sense in order to figure out if people are abusing the system okay so let's see how we did boom got it very a however that's pronounced got it bacon tail lettuce and tomato wrap diet Snapple iced tea raspberry diet and coconut water nailed it okay so it got everything but how does the system handle an item that was accidentally not charged cuz I mean nothing's perfect well Amazon so confident in their system and seemingly rightly so that they have actually apparently told another news outlet that managed to walk out with a yogurt they didn't pay for you know what go ahead keep it the yogurts on us because they seem to believe that the system is so accurate that even with those occasional misfires they're still going to make up for the cost of cashiers plain clothes loss prevention security people and well just the normal shock lifting that retailers refer to as shrink not bad considering it's got kale in it actually I was really good maybe the craziest thing about this whole experience is that let's say I decided this you know kale sucked or uh you know what I don't need these pads after all if I wanted to return them at this time there is literally no mechanism to take this back you you'd have to talk to an associate and give it to them but the way that the refund would be processed would be identical you would just go into your receipt you would select an item and you would remove it I don't need it or whatever and no questions asked they will give you a refund not only do you not have to return it there is no mechanism to return it they're gonna have to find a solution to that in the long term okay so in summary that was really freaking cool but as some of you may have noticed it is now go for a walk in the rain time because there are definitely still some issues and some concerns that I have about this technology so issue number one is that before Amazon as they are undoubtedly gonna do in the next year or two rolls this out in Whole Foods locations they acquired them less than about a year ago now they're gonna have to figure out how to address the limit on the number of customers that can be in the store at one time right now you just make a line outside the store but if your whole pitch is line up with shopping that's obviously a dumb long-term solution issue number two is that a tree additional grocery stores loyalty program actually tells them a lot more about you than just what you bought with data especially if you're a regular shopper like what you buy how much of it and how often they can extrapolate a lot about not just you but also your family and Amazon hasn't talked a ton about what data they're collecting how long they're keeping it for there's nothing go specific in their privacy policy but if I was a betting man I would put good money on Amazon collecting all kinds of extra data like your movement patterns around the store how long you looked at a particular item before buying it or not buying it which advertising kiosks were endcaps you found the most attractive and they're gonna use that combined with what they already know about you from your online profile to build an incredibly detailed picture of who you are and what you're about and this ignores some of the less obvious societal issues that we're gonna be facing as technology like this becomes more prevalent so it's estimated that in America right now there are three and a half million cashiers and you know Amazon side of this story is that you know yeah we don't have any cashiers but we're still gonna need humans for food prep restocking the shelves checking ID in the alcoholic beverages section they say they're still going to need humans for that for the foreseeable future but you know I'm kind of looking at this going well yeah but regular grocery stores also need people for food prep and stocking shelves I'm not sure if this math is gonna add up and you know if I were to be sitting here with a crystal ball figuring out what I think the future is gonna be I see no reason why those jobs couldn't eventually be replaced as well so that's something that we are going to have to figure out as people over the next yeah we don't have as long to deal with as we might have hoped speaking of not having a long time to deal with something have you ever called your mobile carrier and been stuck on hold for like 10 minutes 20 minutes trying to deal with something well not with ting ting is the mobile carrier that's

one as well as our community forum which you should totally join alright let's get out of the rain this stuff tastes like sorry I bought it 
I have some great news for anyone out there who ran out and bought two of invidious collector's edition Titan XP Star Wars graphics cards for a total of twenty four hundred dollars to run an SLI and that is that the new Titan V which will actually outperform that configuration in many games for just $600 more doesn't have any Star Wars branding on it whatsoever so as long as you buy your card purely for Star Wars and not for performance you should feel pretty good right now okay now technically this box has already been opened because Anthony is already hard at work on our full review of this card but I still wanted to go through the unboxing experience with you guys because damn it I spent $3,000 on this graphics card so I intend to milk it to the fullest extent that I can and to that end nope not working okay here we go so it comes with some documentation including a QuickStart guide and a support guide that's actually unusual for these well right this isn't a sample card I was gonna say the samples never come with these okay that's not very interesting Titan VIII support guide okay that's not very interesting either it also comes with one of these not sure what it is yet but it better be gold just like the card because if I'm gonna spend $3,000 on a graphics card everything should be silver silver DisplayPort to DVI adapter okay if I intended to do that is a good shot alright and then we've got it right here the Titan V graphics card so what do they have to say for themselves oh right 5120 cuda cores so compared to the Titan XP which is an incredibly powerful card in its own right that's got 3840 CUDA cores so we are expecting this to be 20-25 percent faster right out of the gate then it has the same amount of memory 12 gigs but it's using HBM to memory so that is much much faster which may or may not have a ton of applicability in gaming but will definitely help with the Titan V's intended use case which is apparently like deep learning a I and really the same kinds of workloads as in videos v100 as in videos v 100 the only card that they've got on the market already using this same Volta architecture now you guys might be looking at $3,000 graphics card here going well that's an unreasonable amount of money and I would be inclined to agree with you but compared to that Tesla view 100 it's actually less than a third of the price with much of the same capability so it is a little bit slower and as you can see here the NV link fingers that you probably saw previously when we showed off the GP 100 are actually covered and to our knowledge they are disabled so it does not support envy link but other than that for someone working on you know an AI type workload on a desktop this aims to be the ultimate experience with all that said you guys want to see it game I'm sure so so I'm gonna say the detailed run-through of our entire test suite for Anthony's review but I still want to have a quick look at how the Titan VIII compares to the Titan XP so here's the settings we're using in GTA 5 3840 by 2160 I will change that to fullscreen but in terms of what settings were using FXAA very high or high sort of across the board here tessellation high and then all the advanced stuff turned on so I've already got my numbers for the ty next P let's go ahead and shut this baby down and get a new graphics card installed you know I gotta say I am NOT a huge fan of the gold ID it really smacks of well apples doing it but not in a tasteful way like this is by far invidious tackiest looking graphics card in the last you know three four years anyway really ugly like what and it's like I realize this is maybe seemingly insignificant complaint for something that's designed for professional use and is you know capable of gaming but is really a professional card but at this kind of price it should be perfect there it is there's our Titan V powered up for the first time ever only three thousand US dollars I think it included free shipping though so here we go the first image its ever output it's like when we think about how long we're actually gonna use this card because we bought it strictly for a comparative testing like benchmarking against other things like it's costing me you know a dollar per minute to run it so I'm gonna take it in I need a drink no water left it's out for solid water come on alright so I'm just dialing in my settings here because grand theft auto is a giant piece of crap when it comes to actually remembering what you want fly and benchmark jet benchmark tests I haven't actually looked at any results that are online yet so this will be my first experience Titan XP who's still warming versus Titan V Wow listen to that coy line you hear that listen to it went so there's a black screen right now listen to it when I hear all getting close it's kind of crazy to think that we've gotten to the point though we're running Grand Theft Auto at 4k at very high settings is maybe not demanding enough to see a huge separation between graphics cards we might even be CPU limited a little bit here even though I'm running a 59 60 X Extreme Edition all right so oh wow okay so just so you guys know this is where you're looking wow that is not better so we can't draw any really concrete conclusions right now this is one game at one resolution against one other card and one set of in-game settings but what we can say for certain is that right now the Titan V is not a great value compared even to in videos Titan XP which is not a great value compared to the 1080 Ti with that said the word on the street is that Nvidia is planning an architecture that's sort of based on some of the same principles as volta but that doesn't have some of the deep learning like tensor core stuff built into it so that it can be a little bit less expensive and hopefully we're gonna see that sometime in 2018 but for now Titan V is not a card for gamers as expected so thanks for watching

for months now graphics card supply has been completely tapped out thanks to every gamers worst enemy miners and no not young people who screech into the microphone but they're awful too I'm talking about the kind of miners who are using Hardware both PC components and more specialized equipment to calculate what are called hashes for crypto currencies like Bitcoin in exchange for a reward effectively mining for money but how do you get in on the action can you just fire up your old PC and start making money let's investigate [Music] mass drop is now featuring their custom configured AKG K 7x X audiophile headphones check them and other drops out at the link in the video description let's get this out of the way first to make a gold rush analogy the days of walking on to a random plot of land you know sticking your pickaxe scissors or whatever into the nearest mountainside and sailing home in a golden ship are basically over but just because mining the most popular cryptocurrency Bitcoin is no longer practical for the average person with a an extra graphics card or two that doesn't mean that you can't mind for something so as always around here we started our adventure with some overkill hardware bringing our 10 GPU server out of mothballs up from 8 gamers one CPU theoretically 1080p eyes are the most profitable but we have to ignore cost to buy what do you mean ignore classes to buy what do you think I'm like native graphics card sneezies so then what we ended up with is 5 dt x 10 70s for GTX 10 80s and then a single 1080 TI it's not gonna be like the highest-earning rig but we can use this to run some important benchmarks and determine whether our plan will be profitable I guess we had to get upstairs one trip yeah sure I was about to say the same thing oh come on it's just like complete disregard it's fine who cares I care it's just it's fine like we're just not gonna drop it so it doesn't matter right you got because you never drop anything ok here ok technically not the way it's meant to be rolled I don't think but Yolo we left it any higher so I got my ankles ok thank you oh don't shift it Pat you know I think we actually could have said 11 in here if we used the katana I think it throttles a little bit I think might hang on the katana would be a terrible terrible idea saying I think we could've well I do this Jake's gonna work on installing the whopping two sticks of memory out of the 24 slots on our board here cryptocurrency mining doesn't really benefit from a ton of RAM with that said though it may benefit from a large virtual memory space on your storage drive and then he's also gonna throw in two of our 22 core Xeon processors wait I yes I know that's really stupid they're just the only two CPUs that we had lying around that were compatible with this board and we actually have to populate both of the sockets for this because otherwise we won't have enough PCI Express Lanes for all of these freakin GPUs are you struggling I don't have enough do you have any more this tickets less than four hours AHA here and I was right oh it's cuz he's here not because I had no confidence and you're doing this by yourself ouch and you're gonna drive up all of our insurance premiums when he has to go to the fuck emergency and get that inserted up and there we have it we are now ready to boot up our system actually almost cooling is sort of a concern in a system like this so we're gonna go ahead and throw our fans back in here and then Jake are you ready with that shroud just gotta get this gaff tape I'm stuck wouldn't want to be wasteful you know there's are you really reusing tape yeah this tape is still sticky how cheap do you think I am is this an yvonne initiative I mean this chassis clearly isn't designed to have graphics card um yeah I don't know how we're gonna fit this in here off of it I think you kind of have to just cram the tip in between two of them like it was made to fit come on we used tape look it's not sticky I told the gaff tape is amazing I never told me that okay well gaff tape is amazing so now we just need some power okay 24 right oh right yeah dori I planned for this we could have easily done this experiment with just a normal motherboard or 4G yeah but that would've been so lame it's like power me please look I'm working on it okay please give me power I'm failing come on okay we're in ready well good ah yes slightly less annoying where all the 62 degrees from right here [Music] that was terminally unimpressive okay there we go that's more like it that's how you know it's working okay so while we're waiting to fire up windows and install the Nvidia driver which by the way takes a long-ass time on a system with 10 GPUs let's have a look at power consumption we're looking at 400 watts right now 400 watts and I though at idle so basically no matter what kind of hardware you're using mining is gonna add a lot to your electrical bill so it's this real cost that's associated with it that prevents casuals from just using old hardware to mine these days it is all about efficiency so our Pascal based cards consume a similar amount of power compared to previous generations but they run the algorithms needed for mining much more quickly than previous generations and the more calculations that you can perform per watt of power consumed the more profitable you'll be the other key is to mine smarter almost no one is mining for Bitcoin directly these days because over time the difficulty of generating a reward by mining goes up a lot so people are opting instead to mined for an altcoin like litecoin aetherium z cash or even dogecoin yes for the uninitiated that was and is a real thing scratching the table oh my god that got a lot heavier I'm so happy I'm not carrying that side that's fine I'll be on the bottom this time oh wait I'm going backwards again what the hell no you go backwards also I just locked this door wait my elbow needs to unlock it wait why are we standing like this this is not a good strategy yeah and you slide that way and I'll slide this way yeah uh-huh I got it if we drop it if it's not that big of a deal hold on don't push holding sort of counterintuitive other side is there it is yep really are you serious yeah holy that was painless so now that it's installed the plan is to use a market place called nice hash that pairs buyers who want to rent hashing power with sellers who have hashing power like us so what's cool about that is that after you run the included benchmark which can actually take a few hours with this much gear and had trouble with the 88 threads worth of CPU that we're rocking in this version of the software anyway it determines which algorithm is most profitable for which piece of your hardware at any given moment and runs that giving you a real-time readout of how much you're earning before electricity costs and then paying you out daily as long as your balance is at least point zero zero 1 of a Bitcoin that is after taking their cut it's booting right I think so okay so over the weekend Jake I didn't really help spent a bunch of time babying this thing through crashes and blue screens and we have finally got it mining stabili TM we initially thought that the issues might be related to thermals because let's face it the cards are really close together by the way your ducting seems to be falling off if you want to go have a look at that get this letter in here what with afterburner up on screen it's actually pretty clear that our climate-controlled server room has that under control we're hitting 82 degrees top some of them are a lot lower like 70 even but actually that reminds me we haven't factored the cost of air conditioning into our profitability equation but that's something that we can really look into during part two of our investigation so getting back to this machine you might have noticed that there are actually only eight GPUs in the system now see that we pulled out the middle - that's actually due to an Nvidia driver limitation that specifies a maximum of eight GPUs per operating system so shout out to Gary over at asu's for that tip so that means our final power usage is a cool 2,000 watts no biggie then for our remember for power supplies let's talk about the return on our investment to buy that configuration would run you nearly 18 thousand US dollars at an average of eleven dollars a day in profit again not accounting for air conditioning it would take around four and a half years to recoup that and that is assuming stability in the cryptocurrency market stability what stability in the cryptocurrency market right what a joke so obviously this would be a really stupid mining setup to go out and buy however if you were a little more how you say not a complete idiot about your part selection assuming that your power costs are similar to ours at around 10 US cents per kilowatt you could actually get your upfront investment back a lot sooner so we're gonna investigate a more optimized config in a follow up video but this config for about $5,000 that you're looking at right now is kind of what we're planning let us know if you have any suggestions in the comments first let's get back to the original question does what we're doing make any sense well if you have a bunch of spare modern hardware lying around collecting dust actually yes so we're planning to leave that system running until Phase two when will report on our results and then compare it to our second system but if you have to go out and actually buy Hardware to do it your return is likely going to take so long that you'd be better off doing what many people are doing and trying to buy and sell crypto currencies more directly as they rise and fall though there are certainly risks associated with that as well so why did everyone run out and buy all the video cards and high-wattage power supplies driving up prices for gamers well while the profit isn't anything earth-shattering many miners actually resell their hardware when it's no longer profitable recovering much of the upfront cost and then keeping all the money that was made while the systems were in service so let us know in the comments what you guys want to see in future follow ups here because we have hardly begun to explore this rabbit hole we're planning a future build with 19 GPUs in one system so that's gonna be a thing and we'd love to talk about Asics as well those are pretty interesting but we definitely

I think on some level Intel must know that their product naming scheme could be less confusing Where that level is well your guess is as good as mine because they have certainly never admitted it to us And yet here we are with an Intel sponsored deeper dive into the core x-series Their high-end desktop processors where we'll cover the key options available and what they might be most useful for Okay, so first a little context Intel's X 299 platform is divided up into two major architectures Kaby lake X and Skylake x Kabylake X is essentially their consumer 7000-series chips with more heavy duty traces Slightly higher clock speeds and the higher power consumption that goes with it as a result it differs significantly from other CPUs that fit into the LGA 2066 socket Intel intends them as entry-level chips for folks who want to get into an h EDT or high end desktop Motherboard and then upgrade later, but so far they've been most successful in competitive overclocking Especially in light of the six core options that are available on the Z 370 consumer side of things now Skylake acts on the other hand is where the meet set here we've got two classes of processors core i7 and core I 9 All of them have unlocked multipliers for overclocking Intel hyper-threading technology quad channel ddr4 memory support for avx2 and avx-512 x86 extensions and They share skylake X's new cache set up of 1 Meg of level 2 cache per core matched with a shared level 3 cache That's much smaller than previous generations but in practice proves more efficient in most scenarios Where they differ is in the core count? Which increments by 2 for each step up the product stack the number of PCI Express Lanes Which is lower on core i7 models and the implementation of turbo boost max? 3.0 so CPUs with 8 cores or more get 2 max boost cores while the 7800X gets zero turbo boost max course now we won't be doing a deep dive on Every skew just the top tier core i9 7980XE to show what the platform is capable of in multi-threaded and virtualized workloads the core i9 7900X the jack-of-all-trades and The core i7 7820X, which we believe should be the entry level CPU for most buyers On this platform, let's start with that last one it has 28 PCI Express Lanes so that's enough for a full speed graphics card a couple of nvme SSDs and Some high-speed networking, so it's about right for an entry-level workstation Which is great because that's where this chips performance shines it actually has the highest base frequency in the entire skylake X lineup it shares the highest boost frequency with the 7900 X and it also shares the highest 2 core turbo boost max 3.0 frequency at 4.5. Gigahertz making it a great fit for a workstation that isn't always used for work moving into core i9 territory we leave behind the 28 PCIe lanes and step up to 44 where we get perhaps the most interesting CPU in the x299 line up the 10 core core I9 7900 X when this guy launched we reviewed it quite favorably Thanks to its major performance improvements over its predecessor the core i7 6900K and even the 6950 X Now to be clear not everyone is going to see a performance improvement versus the 7820x But if you want to have full unbottlenecked access to many connected PCI Express devices be they networking storage video capture or expensive accelerator cards this is where you want to be and You get another 2 cores for workloads that can take advantage of them as well the rest of the core i9 lineup is what I would describe as tweeners that is they are in between the 7900X 2 cores per step and the highest end cpu intel has ever released on a desktop platform the $2000.00 18 core core i9 7980XE This thing is an absolute beast and it shows in both its performance numbers And its power draw it blitz through our testing suite pulling off similar per thread performance numbers to its fewer core brethren and even beating out our 22 core xeon E5 2699 v4 and It managed to pull 500 to 600 watts on its own when overclocked it doesn't win any bang for the buck gaming awards But for those that need this kind of performance be they video editors 3D animators using fluid simulation or anyone who's doing high-end computational work that can't be offloaded onto a GPU Well it could be that for you Raw performance is all that matters because time is money and a cpu that outputs faster can pay for itself pretty quickly Skylake X represents a healthy improvement upon the previous generation And it's a solid choice when it comes to both per thread and multi-threaded performance now we just hope that Intel's plan for a more dynamic and risky future brings us even more performance next year and the year after that Because we're insatiable like that So thanks for watching guys if you dislike this video you can hit that button but if you liked it hit like get subscribed maybe consider checking out where to buy the stuff we featured at the link in the video description Also down there.

this video from CES 2018 is brought to you by synergy synergy to makes sharing a single mouse and keyboard between multiple machines easier than ever check it out at the link below okay guys now this this is some crazy stuff I never thought I would live to see the day Intel and AMD technology in one box one box made by Intel this is the Hades Canyon nook it is their most powerful nook ever by a very significant margin and it is running an 8th gen Intel Core i7 processor and Radeon rx Vega mobile graphics now they're gonna have two different models that are gonna be available in bare-bones units just like previous Nook so what you get is you get the CPU the motherboard the case the power supply and oh right graphics so you got to add your own RAM and your own operating system but this thing is loaded for bear on the front you got your power switch yeah sure whatever reset or whatever that is SD reader 2 USB 3 ports HDMI out for VR yes my friends VR capable right you've got another USB this one's a Type C and you've got a front audio jack then moving it around to the back I got one that's not plugged in what this thing has 6 display outputs two HDMI 2.0 2 mini DisplayPort 2 Thunderbolts at the back there's your power and also another audio jack Thank You rear audio on small form-factor really appreciate that that also does optical out 4 more USB threes to land ports because you know whatever we're just going to cover the whole thing in in i/o anyway and Oh check this out that right there is validated for a hundred watts of cooling because inside this thing on the high-end model there's a hundred watt model and there's a 65 watt model you're gonna find a quad core hyper threaded processor the top-end one is actually overclockable and they've had it running up to five gigahertz in the lab and it is cooled by this frickin thing so the entire back half of the entire back is dedicated to heatsink with this sexy vapor chamber that covers one of the most unique processors that we have ever seen so right here on this side there's your quad-core Intel CPU right here on this side there's your Vega base yes my friends AMD's custom silicon solution department but same guys that have worked with the game console makers are actually providing a GPU to Intel and this is an HP m2 memory module so all three of these are sitting on this really special layer that I can actually even show you guys because it's so small that it's called an email and it allows high-speed communication between all three of these components so effectively this is a full PCI Express 8 X Gen 3 link between the CPU and the GPU unbelievable and the whole thing is so thin that you're not just gonna see this in nooks you're also gonna see this integrated in laptops and Intel's expecting performance in the neighborhood of better than a 10 60 max q out of this tightly integrated solution they're also estimating that compared to Intel integrated graphics which we saw in the skull canyon look last year that we can see up to a 50% improvement in performance now it is a little bigger and it is a little thicker it's 1.2 liters compared to 0.7 liters for last generation but if you're looking for a tiny powerhouse of a machine I don't think you're gonna find anything close to this on the market not that this is actually on the market yet so let's get to that it's gonna be coming sometime later this year pricing is gonna be $7.99 for the 65 watt non overclockable version and approximately this is all estimates $9.99 for the overclockable one which CPU and GPU will be overclockable and you're gonna have to add your own ram your own operating system and your own storage which is interesting cuz they got - I've got two slots in there so you could put like a regular SSD or maybe octane that would be a cool idea I wonder if Intel thought of putting octane in there for super high-speed storage speaking of thinking of things have you guys given any thought to synergy - since the beginning of this video well you should it's the new generation of software from seamless that lets you share a keyboard and mouse between multiple computers be they Windows Mac OS and Linux it's pretty freaking cool and it's easier to configure then ever including now the ability to work around complicated networking configurations and automatically find the best path so go check it out at the link in the video description that's seamless comm slash synergy slash CES 1 and you can get 50% off so thanks for watching this video guys you can dislike you can like it's up to you you can also get subscribed and make sure you don't miss any of the rest of our content from CES 2018 although I can't promise there's gonna be anything else more mind-blowing than this can you see that it's crazy 
so while it used to be possible to mine for bitcoins on your old laptop due to the constantly increasing difficulty it's no longer practical on mortal computers not even with multiple high-performance graphics cards so then how do you do it allow me to introduce the bit main and minor s9 a bare-bones computer of sorts except it has no display output no way to plug in a keyboard and it only does one thing mine sha-256 crypto currencies like Bitcoin oh and we've actually also got an l-3 plus one open that one update which does script coins like light coin and a d3 which mines x11 cryptocurrencies like - so the goal today is to find out if these things are worth it and no Austin that is not trademarked I can say it [Music] so if you've seen part two of mining adventure already you should have a pretty good idea of what a fairly efficient GPU mining setup looks like but even that is nothing compared to an ASIC miner for example the Radeon HD 7970 was released in 2012 and mine Bitcoin at an efficiency of about 4 mega hash per watt so ignoring the few companies that never really shipped an end-user product in late 2012 Avalon released the Avalon 1 an ASIC miner that didn't at the time astonishing 165 mega hash per watt a huge bump over GPU mining so how could they possibly achieve this well graphics cards and CPUs are designed to be able to process a huge range of different calculations which is what makes them incredibly useful in our everyday devices this versatility is great but it limits their ability to do one thing really really fast so application-specific integrated circuits or Asics these are as the name implies designed and purpose-built to do just one thing and while that might not make sense for your gaming rig for a Bitcoin miner that only needs to run one specific formula it is a godsend at least for the people who own them because of the nature of crypto currencies the increase in overall hashing power in the network that's caused by a massive influx of specialized mining hardware is a big part of what made bitcoins difficulty go up even further and I mean way up so when the Avalon one came out Bitcoin difficulty was at around 3 million by the same time the following year it was 600 million so if you fast-forward to 2017 there are a bunch of players in the ASIC market including bit Maine whose hardware we have with us today you know silicon and Baikal banks to whom Bitcoin difficulty has reached a whopping two trillion so all the folks out there running GPUs for mining those guys are focused on altcoins like what we showed in part two so options like the narrow Z cash and aetherium are all popular at this time by the way huge shout out to marshal at og BTC on twitter and francisco over at by vm net who helped hook us up with the ant miner s9 the l3 Puffs and the d3 that we're taking a look at today so let's crack the d3 open here huh so much for the warranty sticker we'll just put that right there I mean what else would we do with a multi-thousand dollar specialized computer that's out of stock quite literally everywhere I mean as a general rule machines that dang it I called it I'll just go as a general rule machines that essentially print money are in pretty high demand so unless you've got friends in high or low places they're mostly obtained by preorder and the problem with that is that the wait lists can be as long as several months meaning that by the time they arrive they might not even be profitable anymore and that's a really relevant point here because this d3 miner now makes barely five to ten dollars a day before electricity costs while drawing a massive 1200 Watts from the wall by default when these things were announced people were buying them left and right with dreams of making their money back in a week and then it's just pure profit from there on they definitely didn't learn from the effects of early ASIC miners on the Bitcoin difficulty curve which naturally went way up so now that it's open then let's let's have a look at what's actually going on here so the d3 unit has three of these hashing boards each containing hold on so fifty and I guess it would probably be the same though it's just one side it is just ones from both sides Wow cool so sorry yeah fifty a six they're held in place by an aluminum case then which doubles as sort of a wind tunnel with these high airflow fans on either side so most of the mass of this thing is actually just the glued on heat sinks for each chip so if we just plug back in the hashing boards to the controller here be very careful of course don't worry I got this and then connect this wiring to our controller here which by the way see this guy right here is a mini Linux computer and then we wire up a power supply we got one yeah here we go here's a power supply we should be pretty much ready to mine right I think so I mean we should probably put this cover back yeah yeah we'll be back in a minute okay I know you really like dropping things but it knows if you didn't drop you're not gonna I don't trust you so you can actually use a regular computer power supply but with house port the supply of those is these days in many cases people end up using these mining specific ones so the only real difference is just that it only outputs 12 volt and then it just has a wack ton of 6-pin PCI Express connectors also because it's not designed for consumer use the word on the street there is that they are pretty loud so you need a network connection because your miner needs to be able to find and submit any work that it needs to do I want something done that's not too bad that's fine yeah just give it a second don't be fooled my friend it gets worse much much worse Oh Oh oh that's a great noise so just like with blowing mature on from one of our recent videos I wouldn't recommend getting any bananas or fingers anywhere near these things so at this point with all three of them plugged in updated and mining at current profitability levels we can see the s9 making about 33 bucks a day pl3 plus about 50 in a day and the d3 while the efficiency is pretty poor as we noted earlier at about nine dollars a day so we're gonna come back in a week and see what we've been able to mine okay so we're back again it's been about 16 days since we installed the a6 in the the empty not to mention not heated room over here and where are you pulling up the pool statistics now okay cool our s9 has been mining a fork of Bitcoin known as Bitcoin cash and has been earning actually over our estimated amount about thirty to forty six per day after our powers accounted for during this period so if profit were to maintain like this we'll be able to pay back the s9 at twenty five hundred dollars in about two and a half months not too shabby with that said if you were looking to pick one up for yourself it may isn't even accepting pre-orders as of when we were filming this and we've been seeing them priced at over five thousand US dollars on the second-hand market the l3 plus average de bout thirteen dollars a day after power giving us around an eight month ROI time definitely worse than the former even if you are overpaying leaving us with the d3 which Jake actually found firmware that allows it to draw 900 watts instead of the stock 1200 watts at about the same hash rate so we've been earning an average of seven dollars a day after power giving us an ROI time of just over seven months that's actually better than the l3 plus since it costs less though I wouldn't recommend picking up a ton of d3s since x11 miners are nowhere near as far into their development as bitcoin and litecoin Asics and as such are likely to see big improvements in efficiency as time goes on driving up the difficulty curve so then in a nutshell at the right pricing an ASIC miner takes up less space and can yield better ROI time with less software hassle and no construction time compared to GPU mining but it comes with higher risk worst-case scenario GPUs can be resold for some fraction of what you paid but since an ASIC miner has no value outside of mining the specific crypto currencies it's optimized for when the profitability is gone it just becomes an expensive paperweight this video is brought to you by skill share an online learning community with more than

okay Lana's name a sickle that's actually better than their orange note you can do it did I can that's easy aliens Terminator 2 and LTX 2018 that's right my friends LTX is back and this time it's bigger badder put in a good game and even more X here than ever we're gonna have more space at the world-class Richmond Olympic Oval more booths including land gaming multi-headed VR PCs and some mysterious follow-up to 16k gaming which I don't even know about yet and more opportunities than ever to hang out with the entire linus media group team and also luke tickets started measly 35 canadian pesos and they're available right now on the brand spankin new LTX 2018 website so check it out at the link below and be sure to follow ad LTX Expo on Twitter Facebook and Instagram to get all the show announcements as they happen in real time or as close to real time as will be available because there will be a slight delay for us to go like this with our fingers we'll see what the show but in fairness Matrix Revolutions was terrible 
honey now you want CIPS theoretically yes ready okay we're live oh man I'm gonna do the worst scariest thing in the world but is the audio okay why would you do that okay I mean strawpoll I am gonna do the worst scariest thing ever and I'm gonna promote a a fan created oh no a fan created thing here I'm posting this in the chat my friends trying to a window it automatically generates on a bingo card no no you shouldn't be looking at it because I've only seen a couple of them myself okay basically it's kind of like a like it's like a drinking game like a take a shot every time Luke laughs too loud or Linus apologizes for being late I'm sorry we're late by the way except it's bingo you don't win anything other than satisfaction and thank you we should okay fun game it's a fun game to play you go to win show bingo calm for all I know by the time people are watching the archive of this stream a little of it'll have been converted to a phishing scam so we don't do it right yeah but anyway for right now this moment it automatically like pseudo randomly generates a bingo card out of a bunch of possible things that can happen during the land show and you get to fill it out while you watch so we should in my opinion gamify watching the wine show even more than that so even more than that you can get BOTS in the chat so you should drink every time you hit one one one cell and then you should have to drink like I don't know buddy what do you have to do when you when you actually get get a row life's like skull something yeah yeah yeah totally okay okay what else do you want to get I was thinking if we if we bring a bot in that manages the chat and you can post like you should whoever made this bingo thing should make you unique identify our keys for every single person that's playing so when the bingo game is done you just post your key in chat and it takes your score from that website and actually like attaches it to your username on the LDT like lan show chat you should be able to gain scores and then every once a while you should be able to be like exclamation mark brag and it'll say what your overall score is why are people subscribing we've had a twitch subscriber two-two three-three twitch Prime subscribers and a paid subscriber since we started there no no that's the one I was talking about okay oh okay apparently Brendon Potts has been subscribed for 17 months in a row 17 months 499 times 17 actually this is not difficult math eighty five dollars you're basically a hero more twitch prime you only get half of that you only get well no I know but that doesn't that doesn't make what the heck 15 months in a row for secure is this just all coming up now because like we never dream basically yeah so because your live and now people will do their renewals because they get to post see how that's a gray yeah yeah yeah all your base are belong to us so he was able to send that message along with his subscriber renewal so that it showed up gray along with everything you know I appreciate the old memes it makes me feel less old you know anytime I see in all your days yeah or like you know ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny you know any of that kind of stuff I kind of go you know what this is great this is great I feel young right now in this moment and then I'm like oh my knee doesn't last very long yeah we got a great show for you guys today a lot of great topics actually there's some pretty crap topics yeah I will talk a little bit about meltdown inspector maybe Luke could talk a little bit about how they've affected floatplane development it's particularly sucked for us for like reasons that aren't immediately apparent but yep um with all that said we also have in our news Intel hits a 17-year high on their sales Outlook great another another new record the biggest crypto hack ever so the the Krypto lovers will be like no and the Krypto haters will be like yeah and we'll probably be somewhere in between yeah and then wow this new google app lets anyone publish a local news story that sounds like it sounds like won't be terrible at all every single thing posted there will be triple-a level content not what happened thank news it sounds like Facebook oh my god it sort of does alright let's go the intro oh my god you can read hyperlocal stories about your community right from your phone just like the local paper that we all throw away the second it lands on our clothes that because we don't care do people actually care you know what I shouldn't say that people do actually care about local news like it was cool it was cool getting in the newspaper like John really cares about like where people are from and like what they're doing now or whatever like he he's like really into like who else is a you know Duke alumnus or like from it down whatever like alumni affiliation kind of thing is much stronger in the states though yeah I don't think people care nearly as much up here you and I think that's a geographical difference to a certain degree you would I also never graduated fair I was close I went through like most of the process we got a straw poll this straw poll da mãe local news local man and like okay I went to a football game at the U of a University of Arizona and I went to a what was it a basketball game or something at UVic when I went to school there yeah and like I'm talking like Arizona school versus school and BC yeah and the the difference was astronomical the the like like the end like the atmosphere I was into it when we were in Arizona wasn't even my school and I was like this is sick there was people like giving free beer couldn't drink it pop and like burgers and hotdogs in the parking like party I basically don't even necessarily party just like come on join the family kind of situation so like barbecue yeah it was barbecue family barbecue just in the parking lot so when we're walking from our car to the stadium they're like hey do you want some stuff so my understanding is that some Canadian sports are kind of like that like the Grey Cup is supposed to be super Taylor yeah yeah it's not like that's one day a year yeah and this was a no random college game you know CFL game is like that yeah what it wasn't a championship game it was just whatever there was like a big parade with the music people I don't know what you call them again band no marching marching band the marching you're so fired I'm so fired here and like the game was amazing anytime anyone scored if it was the other team Oh everyone is all upset if it was their team the entire basketball it happens a lot yeah like that's my problem that's football that was football that was the one in America was football the one in Canada was I don't even remember cuz it didn't matter I see Stephen volleyball no offense volleyball lots of fun to play not much of a spectator sport about half the arena was empty like there was some like sponsor stuff and then I think we left like three-quarters way through cuz we were just bored it was just like so different and I could understand how it fosters like school mentality if it's mr. Nix mr. nix 1001 hell we tailgate for any reason yeah okay it's a thing fair enough and it's cool though it makes you feel a part of it and then you you you you feel a part of it the second you show up because of the tailgating okay I didn't say beach volleyball volleyball they are not the same sport at all they literally don't even have the same number of people don't take okay they don't take place in the same place yeah they don't have the same number of people on the team and one of them gets watched once every four years there you go that between volleyball and beach volleyball yeah and to be clear I'm not hating like I love anything with a net someone said what's with the tailgating is an excuse to drink in public okay yeah I guess so cuz in a lot of parts of the states that's very all right I'm gonna start banning people who post the holy crap Jen oh you need to stop you need to calm down there we go guy posted the same message like a bajillion times anyways what were we asking I don't know something but anyways yeah I understand how it facilitates the like I care about this community environment right because immediately when you show up you're taking care of in a certain degree you're you're fed right you're taking care of you're invited in just like insanity to me because like I can't imagine a situation where I would go anywhere and I would be fed by someone for no reason yeah what you like seems pretty cool like it is pretty cool yeah and it was good stuff like it 8 News yeah I don't know so local news um someone gave me a poster because I didn't have any like shirt or anything to hold so they were like here's a poster of the team so I could hold up a thing right it was cool I had in my room for a long time anyways 53% of you guessed local news and 47% of you know local news so we seem to be split right about down the middle people who care or don't care about local news mind you I mean okay if Google can capture 53% of the general population using this service then it's clear to me that there's your phone was trying to listen to you gonna be lesser gonna be lesser lesser quality local news than ever before your phones like what was that you want this happen no I guess we might as well jump into that as our first topic since we've kind of been talking about it for a while oh there you go bulletin yeah Google is what it's called so it's like a bulletin board except it's an app for contributing hyperlocal stories about your community for your community right from your phone you can put a spotlight on inspiring stories that aren't being told so basically News is dead and this is the replacement I mean this is democratization of news I mean this is something we did a piece a little while back it was not a very successful piece where I made like a streaming backpack yeah and I was like this is the future of news people just being somewhere and streaming and like this is like what I would consider to be you were I think I think the reason why that didn't work that well was you were slightly too ahead of the curve maybe well yeah but now and things have gotten better to be able to make the setup better yeah but now IRL streaming with backpacks is like a thing and it wasn't really when you made it well whatever I was trying um thought it was a cool idea so I was like okay but a step above you know just having a phone out or whatever would be building yourself like a transmission processing backpack so that you can so you can transcode to multiple destinations so that you have multiple SIM cards yeah a nice high high resolution and better audio quality camera so that the feet isn't potato level we're going back and this is just sort of it's it's just another branch down that same path where ultimately local news stations are dying this is not debatable it's not you know it's tappable I don't think this place is I'm just I'm just reading there's one line here people everywhere want to know what is going on in their backyard at a very local level ranging from local bookstore readings to high school sporting events to information about local street closures if this is curated well enough and sorted well enough because there is so many things that I will not care about yeah but also on like a Friday I might be like man what is there to do right now what am I gonna do this weekend so and if I can do like events near me I've been blown away by the number of things that go on in the community of Surrey yeah so that for example I was dropping my son off for a preschool one morning and I just saw like a sign in the foyer that was like hey we're doing a we're doing a starry night movie night Fang that's free there's face painting there's I forget what else there was but there was like some activities to do for kids and then at dusk they were gonna bring out the big blowup you know portable projector screen thing and then they just had like it looked like one of the staff just like brought their projector from home and it was fine like it was cool was fun dad speakers which is good that's plus and they played sing I'm sure they didn't have a license for it but you know yeah whatever cuz it's just a janky stupid local event that nobody even knows about anyway but that was that was the issue nobody knew about it so it was actually reasonably well attended given how difficult it was to find out about it but then I started looking into and there's like tons of stuff like that it would be cool lots to do if read aloud because like Zane I I can't pronounce his last name but Zane from daily hive Vancouver is a good curator of local stuff right okay but like a lot of people don't even know that yeah I would have no way of knowing that yeah yeah so like if he can post his awesome articles that go to daily hive and he manages people stuff into I believe a little bit we were kind of hating on it yeah and now I'm down okay okay if it's done properly okay and like one thing that I would like to is if these are able to be sourced and if the source can make money okay so it doesn't look like there's a monetization strategy but this is interesting Google is planning to work with local news organizations to help them find and potentially publish some of the stories as long as they give credit to the original authors so they've already got a strategy to to sort of propagate awareness of the bulletin app through the medium and it is ultimately going to replace that's isn't that awful I mean it's like you know it was gonna happen anyway it's just like can you imagine can you imagine this like Google walking in and pitching this to a local news organization so you know this I don't think so I don't think it works that way it just says giving credit to their authors not the platform yeah but yeah yeah let's see okay let's see yeah cuz I can picture this Google walking in and going yeah so this is great you guys you know realistically you can't lay off any more staff because there's like four people here but you know so you're not saving any money but you're like able to get more done with the money you already saved because you have no money we'll just we'll get all the local news stories for you and then you can just sit and talk about them we're gonna be like we're gonna be like local reddit except there already is local reddit so you know what we're like curated well please wait created okay it's read it the local reddit for around here is terrible yeah okay our Vancouver that's really bad that's fair okay so there you go the app is in a limited pilot in just two cities seemingly arbitrary Nashville and Oakland they're apparently both Google Fiber cities so I was just gonna say that's not that random because of Google Fiber and it also says they have high poverty rates and lie beyond the focus of the big media hubs so it's cool okay so cool neat all right all right so so Google bulletin we're down now really depends on how they do it okay I think there is absolutely the potential for me to be down and have it installed in my phone and use it quite often there's also the potential for it to be a giant steaming heap of garbage okay I did never ever use it cool it's free its lightweight for telling a story by capturing photos and is it that's it Wow okay impactful I don't know how James wrote so many notes on that good job maybe you should write for bulletin no one will pay you but all right so this is from the original sources from newsroom dot intel.com root cause of the reboot issue identified they have updated guidance for customers and partners so the saga continues with the whole meltdown Spectre thing so over the weekend they began rolling out an early version of an updated solution to the reboot issues that they reported on January 11th just so you know what what is that oh is that the quick rollout yeah interesting good job AJ yeah good job AJ sorry keep going um something something reboot issues early version make a final release available once testing is being completed but basically apologize for the disruption this changing guidance may cause the security of our product is critical I didn't tell etcetera etcetera okay let's get to our notes here Oh so as of January 11th Intel was notified that the first patch they issued for meltdown inspector vulnerabilities was causing random reboot issues it was later learned that the bug was affecting has well and Broadwell platforms and on January 22nd they made a blog post advising that OEMs cloud service providers system manufacturer software vendors and end-users stopped the deployment of current versions of the patches as they may introduce higher than higher than expected reboots and other unpredictable system behavior so let's jump into our so this was posted originally by Evan err on the forum and our next one is from vegetable stew and the original articles from PC world this is just another update on meltdown inspector let's go ahead and pull this up actually I remembered there's no point in me going over my stuff because we covered it on the first show that we covered so Intel's plan to fix meltdown in silicon apparently raises more questions than it answers so Intel has said that they plan to deploy a hardware fix so these will be silicon based changes to future products then directly address the Spector and meltdown threads threats those products will begin appearing later this year Intel's chief executive Brian krzanich told investors hmm I've assigned some of the very best minds at Intel my best people are on it the best are the best people you know what just because I didn't watch that particular episode of The Wine Show can you give me the TLDR of how oh okay so I'm affected floatplane I'm gonna forget part of it which is the technicality of exactly why this happens this way but we use a piece of software for the virtual machines and we use a version of it that's free and there's a version of it that's paid I don't remember exactly the reason why we use the other one I covered it properly last time AJ's gonna skin me alive I believe that the reason why we had to use the paid one now is that's the only one that got the update to manage this stuff I don't remember why we were able to use the free one before though yeah I think the free ones just older versions so if we want it to not be super owned by meltdown well yeah I believe it's meltdown specifically I could be wrong though I forget which one is which then we needed to upgrade that upgrade would have been at the cost of $900 per CPU like per physical CPU her physical CPU so that's kind of a little bit of a unique situation because most people are like oh no our things are vulnerable now we have to patch oh no we patched performance went way down we saw that with fortnight the game actually if you want to look at a really really cool rundown of how this has how this could potentially affect an organization check out for tonight's breakdown of how it impacted their servers it was actually really really good graphs and write up some stuff that they did but yeah our biggest issue was like hey we want to not be vulnerable so super expensive amounts of money now through a lot of brain Kijiji ring and planning and all this other kind of stuff I do not want to update now we have a plan and everything's fine and whatnot but like pill Perry says should have just used AMD okay you should breathe more there's a winch oh I believe I believe it was was it just before CES you should read more ouch okay aside from just reading more what AMD servers the that's part of the read more that I'm talking about it like we looked into this we were like hey let's just do that no not a thing what AMD servers yeah we're not building our own servers just case anyone - how many epics do you really think they've shipped most like just saying so we use OVH for floatplane people are like epic which by the way wasn't released when we began building out floatplanes infrastructure yeah one for that one up hand building every server that we use for flow plane we're essentially renting servers off the OVH which is what most people do that are using dedicated staff if they're not using the etiquette or public cloud but if they are using public cloud type situations you don't get the choice anyways yeah you use whatever validated setup which by the way someone like OVH is gonna have Hardware on the hand whether it's hard drives SSDs sometimes motherboards sometimes are really slow it no no that they're gonna have hard for upcoming for upcoming platforms we're talking three six nine months in advance if you're an important partner that's buying literally thousands upon thousands of Xeon CPUs they make sure that you've got this stuff for validation well ahead of time so to imagine for a second that epoch which launched what August in August they announced it I think some like that whatever sometime in the summer to imagine that that's that's anywhere near a for rental server it's joke I've wanted a server with one of those for awhile this isn't like a mu they're really using in tooling it's basically the only option yeah because they typically only have like here's our good better best extreme they're just gonna have a handful of validated builds and that's it and there are some more options sometimes but we need fairly specific things yeah there are exceptions like we had a data center before that would allow us to ship our own Hardware there yeah except they were just except they were terrible yeah like there's a cool feature did we ever get that server no oh they were supposed to ship it back to us those bastards it had a bunch of enterprise transitive than those enterprise drives those bastards we could be mining burst on the if we could ever finish plotting them no that's not gonna I've gotten one-and-a-half drives in that 47 Drive machine RGB plotting um no I'm not GPU plotting because I put in a GPU and it like was supposed to work right there and then it just didn't it doesn't work automatically oh okay I'll send you all have to figure it out anyway I also have a dual Xeon system that I can start plotting on as well just to import the plot file yes so I'll figure it out I'll figure it out but basically I'm doing a mining side to adventure side quest adventure where we're looking at hard drive based - it's weird it's weird it's pretty cool but it's weird it's fun I guess but Linus is evading the question are you evading the question we're doing a video all right so let me have a look at what else we got for topic one question yeah I didn't even the question yes mining yes happening I mean we're doing a whole video series around it what you guys think was going on what question was there but you whining no I said forty-seven drives I'm like mining what else would I be doing with forty-seven drives other than petabyte project which by the way I had a couple people internally telling me we should be mining on the inactive petabyte server super not an option because oh you know what I actually don't have oh no I do I do have it I do have it super not an option because check this out Oh phase one of the vault is like oh phase one of the you might want to switch the no no I just get scared no no no it's fine it's fine everything is okay extra large icons no no I hate extra large icons no I hate large icons which ones do I want uh medium icons this is the quality content at all to ensure this happened where's the where's the diversity amount what where's the just property right-click properties no no no I'm gonna gives you a fancy GUI no no no huh I refuse ah content oh that's an interesting one tiles tiles is the one so I've only got 40 terabytes left and when you factor in that Z Drive needs an offload so this is the nvme server we're gonna have like 20 terabytes left in the first stage excuse me sorry sixes Christmas um that's my girlfriend's fault though completely it's entirely her fault I was fine she came over and was like I'm not sick and then like hours later was just like coughing up a storm and I was like thanks for that no I'm no I'm sick thanks hon yeah so we're gonna have to roll out the second one very very soon yeah you don't want it so mining on hard drives is a very new frontier and there's not very much data in terms of like how bad it is for your drive or anything yeah and those are expensive drives they're like supposed to be reliable and stuff yeah speaking of crypto actually let's jump into this so the source here is coined Escom coin check confirms the reason why you should not use online exchange wallets as much as it possible [Music] so I'll tell you guys most of the crypto that I own and I do have some I bought on an exchange show them this so most of what I owned I bought on an exchange but it is not on the exchange anymore yeah and the reason for that is that while an exchange is really convenient so I actually had it on there for like a week while I was waiting for my hardware wallet yeah well in exchange is very convenient when you and when it was on there I was like oh well I'll sell some of that and I'll buy some of that and I'll do this and like actually I played it right which is there's not an indication necessarily of skill but I played it right it was that a really good time to be playing yes it was I won bigger than I lost and that worked out really well but the way to do it is you get everything off the exchange and you keep it in a hardware wallet preferably one with no online access whatsoever yeah so there are dedicated devices for that strongly recommend that you know and if you've got everything in an offline wallet then if an exchange gets hacked your crypto will not be part of the crypto that gets absconded yeah yeah Wow 58 billion yen approximately five hundred and thirty three million u.s. dollars whoo yeah the precise amount stolen may not be fully known until further checks have been carried out into the intrusion ha ha at least over 400 million sorry I'm just no it's crazy so the price of the coin which is specifically nem I'm not entirely sure which one that is because there's 10 billion different ones but nem coin the price of that went down 13% which isn't even like in the grand scheme of how fast coin values have that bad it's like an average Saturday like it's not that big of a deal so it looks like it's likely greater than the amount stolen from mount GOx in 2014 when converted at cash yeah three hundred and forty million dollars though it should be noted that given how much less crypto currencies were worth in 2014 that proportionally this is a smaller impact if you convert up mount gox's theft to what it would be valued at now yeah or especially a month ago yeah yeah so that's a thing that happened you know as usual you're gonna have people on all sides of this whole this whole crypto thing that's going on here the bottom line is this you know I don't think either of us is anti crypto are you anti crypto I recognize a lot of the bad things that are associated with it crypto as a whole I think is actually really good I don't know if your block chain technology technology yeah I don't know if you've heard what the Canadian government's planning on yeah that's super cool do you want to click so okay I only know rough details about this so I could get some of it wrong it's not a topic for this week but the Canadian government has spoken publicly about the interest of adopting blockchain technology for some of its internal spending of tax money yeah so you can see where tax money is being spent and how it's being spent that is awesome because I have said my entire life that I personally I'm gonna just show slight amounts of political alignment here but I have no area Mar what am I gonna do fire you hey I have no issue really with taxes but I would like to know what my taxes are going towards yeah it's annoying having a whole bunch of money taken from you and being like I have no idea what I just improved because it's cool to think of like I am contributing to society with this money yeah but it would be nice to be able to be like oh there it goes oh it helped to fix that road or it yeah contribute to that school that would be a lot more fulfilling X percentage of it went to federal issues why percentage of it went to local issues you know that would really give me a better idea of you know what I would want to say at a town hall meeting yes whatever else and like sure maybe some of it went towards Trudeau's lunch when he was on a trip that has to be paid for somehow I'm not gonna feel bad about that I just want to know what it's doing it'll feel cool if I can know what it's doing um mr. Nix is post in chat this is funny what but but I think both of us I both of us hold crypto I'm I'm long a couple of different currencies so take that for what it does but mister Nyx's you post here in the forum basically sums up the biggest problem with it right now Wow that's worth a hundred thousand dollars I hope you know what to do with your $47,000 if you want go ahead and spend that two hundred and three thousand dollars the volatility is real oh yeah and the lack of regulation something that gets pinched as a benefit of cryptocurrency is a huge issue it's also a huge problem yeah because there's no well there's there's no regulation you know and there's great things that come with that and there's terrible things that come with it there's terrible things that come with that there's basically no there's no laws that prevent people from manipulating this much smaller and easier to manipulate market and oh damn has it happened yeah what I mean there was that recent example where it was a bit which ones the bad one that connect gold oh boulder cash which one was the one that was particularly brutal I don't remember which one but the coin itself wasn't the problem yeah yes how it was set up and how it was promoted and how the other coins were temporarily abused around its inauguration and all the coin itself is not a problem it was the things that would not be legal in normal markets that happened around it but I don't I think it's cash I don't even remember people are saying it was Bitcoin cash yeah yeah yeah so I you know I think we should we should consider doing our own coin so this is yeah yeah we should seriously as part of mining adventure I just got stress pains in my neck as part of mining adventure we should do we should be like here's all the ways this can be manipulated and usually we're doing you know usually don't buy this yeah you should list out like these are all the potential things that we could do yeah to abuse the creation of this coin these are the things that we're going to do late coin Wow oh my god okay go ahead I'm sorry I'm still listening there's got to be some way so that like everyone that's current oh my god if you could make that will be such an interesting version of mining if you sit in twitch chat and there's a bot that registers that you're in twitch chat and then it like sends you coins based on how long you're in twitch chat before the show went live but after it was supposed to go live so you make money by waiting do complicated we're just gonna if we do this I'm sure we're just gonna copy someone else's open source court code for their coin and do nothing unique but that's what most people do anyways so it's fine they're saying that exists lots of people want floatplane coin people want dazeem on what Linus coin float coin when coin coin lots of late coin by coin late coin float coin float coin luke coin heck yeah heck yeah so you know I think it would be a really interesting is oh my god that's a weakened that's what we can reward the bingo that's how we can distribute coins at the beginning is generate a whole bunch we can distribute them through the bingo game do you know that people want more and then you can brag and chat with how much you have so there's like a social status thing so you can put you can buy social status because that's how dirty this whole time with samurai salesman Luke go home alright why don't we get into the way that we actually make money around here heck yeah sponsors sponsor number one is spectrum do you find yourself staring at a monitor all day that can be hard on your eyes over time and make it tougher to fall asleep well spectrum is an affordable long-term solution to staring at a computer screen using a software solution like flux or Twilight will not give you the same type of blue light filtering that these stylish glasses do their features include that they're stylish also that they're made of glass high-quality one year warranty and the product is extremely durable another feature includes another feature is loquat lock up low color distortion so compared to other blue light filtering lenses that I've seen before I don't feel like I'm just looking at the world through a blue lens yeah yeah light sources do look more yellow it is slice little bit of yellowing but not very much but red stuff is still like mostly red everything just seems like it has an extremely mild warming filter and they're the highest rated among their competitors on Amazon so check them out at spectrum glasses dot-com slash collection slashed prospect or at the link below I'll go ahead and post that in the chat and you can save 10% off spectrum glasses using offer code Linus it's pro spec boom Oh prospect that could be wrong that big sense you know what I'm just gonna go with the genius Lee because that's what I know Luke that's what I know that's what my genius is all right so do we have any no we're gonna do fresh books first and then we're gonna get upset at the people who stole our stuff okay fresh books fresh books is the super simple to use invoicing tool that actually does a lot more than just allow you to create and send slick-looking invoices quickly it helps you track your time with their timesheet function manage your expenses and keep track of who owes you what it allows you to take payment on your terms even allowing you to take deposits on your work before you begin and their mobile app has all the functionality of the desktop version including allowing you to track your time track expenses as you go and well of course send invoices one of the best things about it is that you can see when your client is seen your invoice and put an end to the guessing games and if you have any questions you can reach out to their support staff where you will speak to a real live human no phone tree no escalations no return calls just answers go to FreshBooks comm slash win and enter when and how did you hear about us section when you sign up for your 30 day free trial I'm gonna go ahead and link that in the twitch chat as well if you guys run like a small-time tech repair shop or she's gotta still be common it was super common when we were it's gotta still be common like I did tech work when I was in high school so did I yeah like there's like no good reason that I can think of not to make some money on the side if you're just passionate but like these days it might be more based around fixing mobile phones and stuff but there's there's still tech work oh absolutely like battery swaps yeah what do you like these are we getting that the add nod of approval I think so you like the thick frames on me hey okay huh you know it's funny I never thought of myself as a thick frame guy like I don't know have you seen my prescription glasses yeah yeah they're like they're small they're small yeah I could pull this off you think I probably need like an overall style update though yeah yeah all right you can go cold that's all right bringing us to our last sponsor savage jerky so they actually hit Colton you still there okay so Colton Noether and Colton ran an investigation Colton ran an investigation come on come on over here come over here we need inspector Colton back I think remember when you solved the mystery of people of the utensils yes I do okay my finest pieces of work here finest company finest Channel super-fun one of the finest channels Superfund episodes of all time and probably the single most valuable thing Colton has done since he began his employment investigator we have to solve another mystery who took our Savitz Turkey I don't know man I've been I I sent a message to like our group a group chat and and no responses I looked around the office somebody ate it but the thing is is that we had a lot we had a lot of water jerky like somebody must have just gone to town like you guys have probably seen the boss yeah it's not a small pretty huge yeah like there is some of it that's empty but most of it had quite a bit yeah they were like there was an easily one or two zones just jerky we're gonna we're gonna say this sort of one sit front and like it's enough that you couldn't have like accidentally opened up a package started eating it because like it's delicious and they're just like oh no it's gone between many packages yeah you're like oh 14 packs of jerky I guess I'll do see ya I guess this is total and like some of it was so spicy that you couldn't conceivably have eaten it in more than in less than like many sittings let me see somebody walking by somebody's like like if you ate it in one sitting you wouldn't be sitting Oh for a while or you you know what I mean you know what I mean no sitting we're gonna find it we're gonna track it down okay so can we ask Savage today they're sending us more it's that good okay okay so anyway savage jerky it's made with the best ingredients without nitrates or preservatives it's a snack that's full of spice and flavor but isn't bad for you they've got 13 different flavors I love the maple buffalo bacon any any mo whole flavor is excellent the traditional flavor is excellent that if you're into it the Carolina Reaper and the ghost peppers like people people who was it was mape me that was like yeah whatever no jerky is well to savage for me yeah and then he had like issues the next day yeah yeah they also make barbecue sauce hot sauce and a spice rub but I'm sure he tanked it and you can use offer [Laughter] because because you don't actually go in the tank that's gross I use our code ltte to save 10% on savage turkey fried eggs oops oh not that we can eat them and stuff right now yeah yeah they're good you'll just have to take our word for it yeah they're yummy so that's pretty sad if you go down yeah okay so this was posted by dragoon 20005 on the forum and you know what this doesn't surprise me at all and it wouldn't surprise me if this is true of other motherboard makers as well but as ROC has said in a statement that it's aware of the current hold on am i muted here oh it is aware of the current Intel micro code version that might be detected a lot of security vulnerables working closely six 100-200 z 370 and X 299 motherboards it blows me away that X 99 is not included yeah I like that since that was a high-end product until June of this year yeah gigabyte joined the list last year despite originally saying their products weren't vulnerable AMD joined the list releasing patches to address both variants of Spectre so here we go CPU by code update so basically a soos was the first to address the issue I mesial so etc so if you are running an older CPU you know I can see people shouting forced for system obsolescence here I can also see the other side where the manufacturers are going well hold on a minute this is like four or five year old product how can we possibly be expected to be continuing to provide support for it you know but Wow one thing I can say is that whoever's to blame it is not the consumer yeah so that's a thing and I think that for a security vulnerability it is fair to expect to be receiving support and it's not getting done and there are multiple issues at play here one of which is a symptom of the computer industries overall inability to responsibly manage itself because I can tell you guys right now with the margins that they have many of these companies simply could not afford to roll out all of these updates they actually wouldn't have the engineering bandwidth for it they actually couldn't do it but this this sort of points us to an overall larger systemic problem and that is that the computer industry and consumers are partly to blame for this as well has been on a race toward zero I don't think so you don't think consumers just ultimately turning away from the higher quality product refusing to spend more for it and just buying whatever's cheapest you don't think that contributes I don't think that's happening that much well remember this is this is an ongoing problem we're going back 20 years now like we're going back to when computers were treated like you bought a high-end computer once in a while you bought a quality one versus being treated like commodities yeah but I think consumers are going to do that in any market that you're in that's how markets work if it's good enough they'll buy the one that's cheap enough to fit their field and when you're looking at like gaming consumerism you're looking at like okay I want to play these games I need this level of thing and then you buy the cheapest thing that can hit that level that's okay let me throw a counter-argument at you because it's not like there weren't opportunities in the past for people to learn from a mistake like buying a motherboard from a cheaper vendor having it be trash and having their customer support I mean people complain about the customer support of computer hardware manufacturers incessantly but then they turn around and they still buy this stuff like there's an excellent thread over on Hardware canucks about Canadian warranty service horror stories and these resources are out there but the consumers continue to support vendors that when you go when you break it down I guess I'm aren't charging enough in order to fully staff their support departments to provide adequate service I guess you probably know more because of the sales numbers of being a p.m. because from my perspective looking at posts on like our forum and my own purchasing habits and the person habits of my friends we buy cheaply but usually within known constructs like I've dealt with customer service from a few companies yeah and I will often buy from those companies or not based on how the customer service wins so in the broader scheme of things it is amazing how much of a difference people will it's amazing how many more people will buy something when it is $4 cheaper but I I feel like that's got to be a thing across all markets and the the reaction tools tools is a great example of people buying what they believe is quality because they think it's gonna last it is hard to break into the market as a cheap that same time actually you expect to be able to buy a tool and keep it potentially for the rest of your life can write to a computer where you can keep it for three years exactly so customer expectations have shaped how much they expect to spend on these things which has shaped how much people can make when they sell them like it's look I'm not to be clear I'm okay I should maybe blame is the wrong word yeah I don't think customers is it is a difficult thing to do because consumers are gonna act like consumers act and always act the same way blame is the wrong word here but I would say that consumers and manufacturers have contributed to what is an overall systemic problem tributed sure yeah because we could sit around and like we've got people saying you know they should recall all of these they should do this they should do that that's stupid it's like it's just a stupid thing to say because it just doesn't work that way and everyone just lose their computers like it's like if it's like if we released um you know really would just shut down like you can't yeah like the whole internet would just shut down like we don't actually want a world where MSI gigabyte a Zeus and asrock they just don't exist we don't want that we have to find we have to find a compromise here and it seems like they think the compromise is 100 series and up and as a as a okay here as a customer who's rolling x99 systems in our production machines I can tell you that I bought into that and we didn't pay for all the hardware as you guys know we did a video about it but we do have money invested into them so as someone who invested money into running these machines in a production environment seven months ago or eight months ago or whatever it was I am super not impressed that I'm not getting supported here so I don't know where the right compromise is but I'm not happy about where we are now and I guess I I don't really have much more to say than that yeah I I think I think I guess the takeaway from this is pay attention to how different companies react to this yeah there that's that's a great takeaway so guys here I mean what we can link you to we can link you to the article where this is being tracked actually no it'll be on the forum later we'll have it in the when topics 11 in the lam target land topics forum and check it out so find whoever supported this best write it down put it on a post-it note stick it to your wall Google box next time you buy a motherboard buy from them yeah and let's see if we can start to reverse the tide because ultimately that's what it's gonna take unless the consumer habits change and these companies feel like they're gonna get a return on the investment that they're putting in to support they're not gonna do it because that's how business works you invest where you're gonna get a return so brand loyalty I think is is generally kind of not a good idea but I don't see this as a brand loyalty move because you're making a logical decision that's based on how a company acts and like if something like this was to happen again you're making a decision that is based on how that company would react to that situation so it is actually in putting value into the product so you can look at the overall value proposition and go look this has more value to me I'm going to purchase it not I'm brand loyal to this company I'm going to purchase it I've made purchasing decisions based on companies one of them that I've told stories of on the wine show before is EVGA because of how well they treated me in the past when I was not a creator right this is when I was absolutely on my own it's a long story so I'm not going to go over it but they were awesome and I don't buy everything from EVGA clearly you can see my builds yeah done them here but in situations where I'm like oh look one of my options is this and it's pretty darn close to another one I have often gone with them but I don't buy their stuff exclusively at all because I'm going for what I think is the best value of that individual point in time do you want to totally change gears yes posted by se to Mitch on the forum original articles from CBC a Canadian has been charged with spamming twitch what Brendon Lucas out of the can-spam is subject to a court order preventing him from spanning which I know right so the 20 year old has been charged with mischief in relation to computer data by the Supreme Court of British Columbia local guy for allegedly sending a hundred and fifty thousand offensive messages through twitches chat suspensive the messages hit more than a thousand different channels and included racist anti-semitic sexist and homophobic slurs thanks for representing Canada you could face up to ten years in prison as well as a civil order barring him from using creating or selling certain types of software including any robot bought crawlers spiders blacklisting software or other software that could be used to target the streaming platform he allegedly used a service called chat surge whose stated purpose is to flood destroy or simply demolish any twitch TV chat room the bots were posting an average of 34 spam messages per minute on some channels the rate was 600 messages a minute employees at twitch dedicated more than 300 hours to tracing the attacks after receiving over 375 individual user reports regarding spam messages containing racism homophobia sexual harassment false implications of viewbotting and soliciting child sex exploitation material what Wow so this all all allegedly happened between February and May of 2017 and he was charged on December 1st of 2017 Wow interesting this prompted the company to file a civil lawsuit on March 31st 2017 against Shaw Communications PayPal Holdings CloudFlare who is privacy corp and who is guard Inc day an Apple was charged on December 1st of 2017 what if there's a shooting at everybody speaking of Apple we yeah I was actually kind of thinking maybe I would do a video updating people have been asking where the heck is our iMac pro coverage oh yeah do you know about this have you heard about this no oh so we we accidentally broke it which happens from time to time yeah no one ever Apple is outright refusing to repair it even at our cost what so right now because it's so new replacement parts are not easy to get an Apple is just refusing to repair it so the store contacted Apple HQ and they were just like no don't don't do it why yeah that's a wonderful question isn't it so I was thinking maybe we'd do a video about that at some point Wow so did two rossmann that's an interesting that's an interesting idea well no I mean okay the issue is not that we can't repair it it's not not rocket science it's got a blown power supply and a broken display we just need a new power supply in a new display whatever the issue is that Apple has a brand new product that for whatever reason not they aren't equipped to they're not saying hey give us a couple weeks I don't know if he's interested or not but I really feel like tieing Rossman into this they're saying hey we are not gonna do it go take it to an Apple certified repair shop somewhere else Wow yeah like what's the point of an Apple store yeah speaking of you know supporting customers and all that we're not asking them to do it for free they even quoted us they told us how much it was gonna cost we agreed to it they held it for a few days and then we're just like what we are not gonna repair it what yeah no I know no no no this is like pretty frustrating what how can I'm truly something in the contract but if they take money for something no they didn't take it yet they just quoted it but they took it physically right they took your product yeah they took the product you should be able to like charge them a rental fee or some bullcrap oh you wouldn't be able to do that if that were the case in every repair shop anywhere that doesn't end up being able fix something would be would be open to that kind of but that's that's that's a decision that's not an inability no that's not a like we tried I could just say oh you must have misunderstood us we can't fix it in which case that's a pretty funny video either way yeah Apple cannot fix the iMac from whoo okay so good luck if it breaks but Rosman probably can't yeah you probably can um okay last last topic today this is cool this is off Windows central.com Microsoft is building a truly modern version of Windows 10 for PCs ho named Polaris they're planning to strip out legacy components in favor of a more modern OS with better battery life like what I don't know what a wonderful question apparently better performance it will feature seashell Microsoft's upcoming Universal shell that shared across devices instead of the legacy Microsoft shell it will also ditch win32 components and apps like notepad or paint in favor of a uwp first experience just like Windows 10 mobile oh wow what it's working on an updated file explorer built on uwp why do they do stuff that like just it's obvious that people will hate okay so you notice how hard it is to get into your network settings now yes ever since the fall created absolutely a nightmare it's ridiculous like you hear a lot and then Auto changes settings back you change something and they'll just set it back that drives me absolutely bonkers like you get stuck here now and like I can never remember is it is it property no no it's not properties is it thanks forever love cars are prominent not Hardware properties is it you know status it's not intense enough there's all this white space you have to scroll for no oh oh wait hold on is it network and sharing center I think what you're looking for is oh no I think you can get to here there we go finally finally there click finally and get this if you want to connect or disconnect a VPN oh my it the stupid thing it doesn't just connect or disconnect are you are you kidding me at least to their credit you can connect and disconnect a VPN by clear now but there was an intermediary there was an intermediary yeah where you couldn't do this still and you just had to come in here and do this and every time I loaded this straight to here it wouldn't work until I clicked on another tab and then click back like is shocking help no no that goes here now the one that you pointed that goes here what that's the problem yeah this goes here I thought that's as of the last couple of updates what yeah yes no I was just using that as my shortcut know you can still right-click I think and open networking into no that's still that's this again that's this no - so there's no straight right this is never what I want no I can't think of any reason I would want to look at this page where's the like how it handles with home and oh hold on hold on oh oh this is just bad UI design that's this is clickable yeah I didn't even realize this was clickable I thought this was just crap yeah so you can click here and you can get to the adapter settings okay yeah they don't look like buttons yeah until you hover over them I viciously hate Windows 10 and it sucks because this really cool Microsoft Studios game is in beta right now called ste of Thieves yeah and I want to play it and I tweeted like does anyone have a key and like awesome Sean from Microsoft is like you go bro and then I'm like wait I can't play it there's someone Windows 8.1 Wow use the Windows Store it's a Windows Store game sadly because the Windows Store is a terrible experience but it looks like a really cool game so I want to play it and I don't have any spare SSDs so I'm gonna install Windows 10 on a 500 gig momentous XT I think that's what it's called those like those like SSD hard drives really just have a lot of cash yeah I'm gonna install Windows 10 on there OBS Chrome and see if thieves and that's it and it'll be a horrible experience because this can be on a hard drive yes yeah so if everyone play the game it'll be on a hard drive because I've just ice I literally sat there for like half an hour basically staring at my computer being like I really want to play sea of thieves but I really really don't want to use Windows 10 and that's it came to there all right so thank you guys for tuning in to the LAN show oh right um early access on floodplain yes huzzah oh do you do you want to talk about any of the cool stuff that's going on a full thing can you talk about the cool stuff that's going on you're killing blog posts there's stuff happening I'm not I'm saying it I'm saying it we processed a credit card transaction a lot of them a lot of credit card transactions and they resumed and they worked and they recent yes the subscription the subscription mechanism worked that is a huge milestone if you've ever like developed a platform you'll know that that's a big deal because you can't even do any of that stuff until you've got a lot of the other back-end mechanisms also working and it like associates with accounts and it grants you access properly and when your sub dies it takes away process properly in and what are we talking about this stuff it's cool I want to slam a whole bunch of these things really close to the launch of the platform okay it's like think of it like sex a piece no most intense orgasm right at the end a penis can only be so wide okay before it just cannot be processed anymore okay you need to you need to just calm down that like massive you know like you know butcher shop meat size direction and just kind of bang out these these news updates on insertion overtime for time is yes one okay so back to my screen here this could be quite possibly the greatest ltte video of all time this is sort of so we actually almost lost one of our cameras at CES not gonna name any names I'm hella someone left one of our camera bags just at the bell desk basically and it's just cold Luca giantic it had I didn't call him one I said maybe he had one different ones offensive ones probably I don't know maybe all depends how sensitive you are I got four that's confusing right I got hardcore SJW dat the Amazon ghost story oh oh yeah anyway um yeah I had an encounter I had a real live encounter it was great I'm sorry yeah anyway so this video was almost lost because it was on an SD card that was sitting in that camera and it is perhaps the greatest watched LTT video of all time I have watched bits of it I haven't watched the whole thing hold on but we're gonna watch a little bit of it now along it was so cool this is like the coolest product of all time and this is possibly the greatest LTT video of all time so that's not a digital screen nope nope nope those are physical objects yeah and this is this this match this match is epic this matches that pic I'm not gonna spoil who wins but it's an epic match me versus Luke mano-a-mano whose clothes real-world pong yeah real-world pong just like seemingly every competition we do the Amazon ghost or video is up so I went down to buy myself some always nice um heck yeah got in trouble for that that's what you got in trouble yeah interesting hey not from Amazon that was my SJW encounter okay the DIY micro SSD micro SD SSD this was an adventure is that that that was good that was fun that was really fun uh mining adventure part three is up a sick miners dad dead uh are they worth it that answer changes from day to day hey guys the iMac pro review from a PC guys perspective that's up just the review the rest of the content has to wait until we can put it back together scammed on eBay six core system it's 19 min that's a really good video the whole thing is really good 19 minutes long for editing on it's good the hosting is good good job yeah I was a good video yep great work a prime yeah so we've also got a couple tech cookies how does Bitcoin work we've got a lot of really good feedback on this video people are saying this is one of the better summaries out there okay also what our Pentium gold and silver because who the crap knows yeah what what Intel's talking about these days and if you are subscribed to bit wit and you can also get a really access to okay Kyle stuff where is it the happiest place on earth breaks down is a really wholesome actually fun to watch video Kyle's has fantastic humour wifey sauce is hilarious they go to Disneyland it has almost nothing to do with tech and it is great I don't know I like I clicked on it to be like oh the upload worked in bubble blow I want to see how the service is going because some people whatever and then I ended up just sitting there and watch the whole thing and was like I feel good about stuff now this is gonna be a good day speaking of the upload working you guys have retooled a lot of the backend is the performance on the player still good oh it should be just my click Wow yeah it should be good wow did you guys see that instant playback I think you might have to play again oh really oh okay so this video quality and this is actually not that great so don't judge our 1080p based on this and it's going through twitch yeah not fair anyway that's a cool poster thingy the-the-the the pacing and the editing in the beginning before they go to Disneyland is really good and then it's hilarious once they're there I don't know they just it's good very good alright so there you go there's the update on flow plane sort of a lot of great content over there though so go sign up if you haven't already and hopefully very soon we will have annual subscriptions working again that'll be by soon so the reason why I launched is very soon the reason why annual subscriptions got cut wasn't because I don't want to give people a discount for it subscribing annually I absolutely want to do that because then that encourages people to subscribe annually obviously that's why everyone does that but I didn't want to lock people onto the current payments platform because it's garbage so I'm hoping that we can watch the new site get you on the new payments platform then there will be the discounts for yearly and if you were subscribed yearly and then now you're subscribed at monthly don't worry you'll still be grandfathered into the nice price and are we gonna find a way to work that how are we gonna do that okay we'll figure that out still some things won't actually be that hard okay okay cool yeah all right cool um people want the sjw story ah is it a good idea I don't know I don't know no I got a go all right I'll do it really quick okay I'll do it really quick so basically you're playing with fire here I know I don't okay I know one thing to consider oh no I don't we are not a federal institution okay that's fine there is laws against certain things in Canada anyways okay okay so anyway I'm kind of done shooting the piece and I'm I'm waiting to get my receipt on my phone and so Dennett like I'm holding the stuff I bought and it's like kind of awkward because Dennis has to keep his camera pointed at it because we want to see the push notification okay so we like we can't really move so I've got like I've got these like pads and we put the food in the bag so I just have these pads and I have my phone and like my mic battery's dying so we need to like swap the batteries and we're trying to hold everything we're trying to like anyway um so this person comes up to me and goes are you guys like vloggers and I'm like oh yeah and she's like did I say she the person because I'm not gonna assume the person the person kind of makes a face and goes and as part of your bit that you're here buying pads and that that's embarrassing and I'm like and then I don't actually get a chance to say anything because that's perpetuating something something I kind of was tuned out by that point and and it's totally natural and it's fine I'm like yeah it is and that's fine and that's good and as a wife he's probably buying them for yep and you know it's one of those it's one of those conversations where it's like look honestly I am NOT personally shy and I don't feel awkward about natural bodily functions no because who gives a shit get it but I'm also not gonna pretend that people don't feel a little awkward when they have to go to a drugstore and buy condoms or yeah tampons or suppositories anything that goes on your genitals up your genitals or you know up your butt is just you know what people feel a little awkward about that malucia nary reasons why you feel awkward about those things and that's fine too basically the premise of the video is you know I need to buy something the original plan was condoms actually the original plan was was extra small condoms and I was good it was gonna be a joke at my own expense because I was gonna want to buy some condoms they needed to be obviously I don't need those because but but the joke was gonna be I need to buy some condoms and I hate I hate telling people my size you know and so you know I need I need a store that doesn't have cashiers so I'm gonna drive all the way to Seattle so I don't have to show the extra small condoms to the cashier okay and we called the head and they don't carry condoms so we were like what's the only like personal care or personal hygiene product that you carry and it turned out it was tampons and pads so we had to adapt it and there you go that was it and the funny thing is I was sitting eating my lunch on a bench in the building next to it and an Amazon staffer who happened to be female comes by and she's like oh is your bit that you don't have to talk to the cashier about the pads that's hilarious that's something I didn't even think of as a benefit for this store because when when husbands and boyfriends have to come in and buy pads and tampons they can do it discreetly brilliant and and she goes on on her way which is like yeah we're allowed to feel awkward and we were even we were talking we were talking for a little bit more actually and I go yeah you know I actually took flak over this over this angle for the video and she goes oh you know that's uh well you know I'm from the East Coast and I was like well you know I'm west coast and I got nothing to say about about that but you know East Coast sounds great oh man you know it's just it's one of those things where people are gonna be offended or not offended my personal my personal philosophy on the whole thing I don't get real personal on the land show very often but my personal philosophy is you know what it is very easy to get offended in life you can get offended by almost anything it is really hard to get along and so what we all need to work at is getting along and if everybody focuses on that and if we focus on people's intent rather than on exactly the words they used or the way that they used them it would be a better world yeah that's all I have to say don't assume people are trying to be jerks thank you for watching the land show we will see you again next week same bat-time same bat-channel assuming we haven't been you know assuming we can get past the picket line of people who are upset in front of our office yep [Music] they'll see 16 yeah go see 16 is crazy 60 federal institutions you are essentially as a Billiken it's really complicated and there's other bills that affect it so it's a really difficult thing to understand and just saying it during the outro is not gonna make enough sense I would recommend doing research on it don't just read the bill because there are other bills that affect it so it's more complicated than that anyways 
It is official, my friends. The bankruptcy auction of my former employer, NCIX.com, has begun. It's today. I've got my voter card - this is my registration. So, it's the previewing day. We're gonna go in, we're gonna see what's what, and then we're actually gonna come back tomorrow. The NCIX Tech Tips gold play button is in there. That's my s**t I want that, and I'm sure I'm gonna find some other stuff too. Check this out: For any unfilled orders, please contact your credit card company to charge back. We are sorry for any inconvenience. We're done. We're f**king done. All right, let's go. Synergy 2 lets you seamlessly share a mouse and keyboard between multiple computers. Check it out at the link below. So I've been to auctions run by these guys before, and it was at their facility, and everything was kind of, like, put into bins and carts. But on location, the rules are a little different. Like, even at the check-in desk. The computers here, they're up for auction. You just - you go ever - like, is this toilet plunger up for auction? No, no, it's not, okay, so not everything, but a lot of things. So in here is where they used to assemble all the NCIX PC computers. I was actually in here must have been a month or two ago, and I was chatting with the the owner - former owner - I don't know how that works, but I was in here, and it was like crazy, like basically Screwdrivers down it looked like everyone went home for the day And then just never came back so they've they've kind of staged things a little bit make it look a little more you know auctiony it looks like any machines that were in the process of being built and or like this one's got a lot of dust in it look at this And or I don't know maybe we're in for Repair, or were being used as demo systems have just kind of been set up all along the counters here For people to to bid on them some pretty good stuff in here So the way that these auctions work is everything is kind of grouped into Lots So you can't just bid on this sapphire HD 2600 XT as though you would want to, you got to buy this uh One terabyte two and a half inch hard drive This test blank. No way There is so much like epic loot here look at this Alienware Compu 2000 stress balls This is doing nothing for my stress right now You could do like a techie Archaeological dig in this place and that was already true when I left five years ago Please keep this door closed. What are you gonna do about it? Alright ok this is fun. We found a home for the stress ball I found on the floor. Stress, stress is all gone now, and we've got some other good stuff here, too So this this was my bad like 8 years ago. I cut a PO for this This is the mountain mods. It's UV green acrylic Stylish that that stayed fashionable UV green acrylic and it's an external radiator mount with like these handles on the top So you would basically like separate them, and then you would screw in your radiator on both sides And you could just mount the radiator and just plonk it down on your desk Needless to say that concept didn't really take off and making matters worse if you were to buy one of these today I hope you have a thermo chill PA series radiator because otherwise it won't fit and those have been discontinued for over half a decade so Sorry NCIX I done goofed on that one. Another thing I bought that never sold, These that mod smart these were the primo chill guys Sometimes they moved ok some colors, though Not as successful as others. More danger den stuff Oh no an AM2 hold down for the Swiftech storm. Oh, oh ok here's another good one. I guarantee you I bought this too Apogee GT, yup So I actually cut my teeth as a product manager on the water cooling category Because no one else wanted to do it look at that yellow label there, baby. This is the DB one from D Tech do you guys remember D Tech? I didn't think so Danny from D Tech. Good guy good guy, man. They made the best Barb's in the game back when barbed fittings were cool This is a fun bin if you want some truly legacy stuff like this looks really good But this is a gtx 760 and this doesn't even look good But it's like funnier than it than it looks it looks like a crappy graphics card. Uh-huh it's a PCI card This is a Phys X card, Phys X by Ageia. (Phizz X) This is the future Okay, I need to find out how much the minimum bid is because like I just want to do a retro unboxing of office XP professionals still sealed Adobe Illustrator CS2 like clearly not worth anything but Oh, its an upgrade... You have to have CS1... Terrible. Now that is a dead operating system if I've ever seen one. Hey, I've got an iPad 2... Here's a pink case for it as long as I'm willing to buy 30 of them and also holy crap There's like a couple hundred cases for the Galaxy Note Not the note 3 or note 5 or note 8, the original Galaxy Note Oops. That wasn't me. What is this stuff? Okay, so the way these things work like Everything is as is where it is so a box like this might be a treasure trip Oh check this out. This is X270 something- no X99 not Z270. So like whatever is in here is in here Huh also not Z270, that's another X99 board it's got like laptops laptops for days in here And boxes for like phones and stuff too like is this a blackberry phone? No, see empty box. But this feels like there could be a P9 Plus inside... and there isn't. So you go you're gonna go through this stuff pretty carefully one thing I know for sure though is that Craigslist is going to be flush with hardware deals, hardware deals for days on Craigslist with markup after this auction I I mean it is kind of depressing to think about it being reduced to this like to the point where Your promotional pens are in a bin for auction [one day this might be us] Now this kind of stuff is sad like I remember Irene I worked with Irene she doesn't have a job anymore Yeah, she was really nice. I guess I didn't really have anywhere to go with that... Yeah, no I actually have nowhere good to go with that. That's kind of a bummer. Wonder what Irene's stuff is in here. A Sears bag and some gloves Holy s**t Is this all of the customer records? This isn't for sale, right? Throw away, okay? Yeah good. Shred hopefully... Ok so here's all the good stuff Here's a bunch of like current motherboards X370 pros like here's a rampage 5 Edition 10, it's like a 600 700 dollar board Here's all the graphics cards that are worth anything as well, so your 1060's, 1070's. I mean this should give you some idea how bad the GPU shortage was that a retailer went out of business and had literally 20 graphics cards in stock... Oh wow, they've still got one of the water-cooled FX processors ooh, and a Core i7 extreme from like four or five years ago. Ouch. You can buy all the lunch room chairs lunch room microwaves mini-fridge. this is the aquarium as I called it or the boardroom. I just felt like I felt like a fish sitting in here. This was the CEOs office. so Apparently he set it up with a projector at some point. It wasn't like this last time I was hanging around here but I've had a couple of, actually I've had a couple of very tense meetings in this room so Someone had told me that the gold play button was in the CEOs office, but I didn't see it there Do you know if the gold YouTube play button is here, okay? So I'm messaging my old boss because I really want that gold play button But in the meantime we did get some clarification on this one There is an auction lot for it, but here, get get wide because there's a lot of stuff I got to show here to buy it. I have to buy all of these awards all of this crap this dinosaur this basketball signed by Dirk Meyer This TV this stand and these two plants over here Really? For a silver button? I might be better off Just telling you guys go subscribe to Linus cat tips, try and get another twenty thousand subs over there get a cat tips play button It's been a long time since I've been here So it wasn't the wisest move ever, but yep. It was my call to do half of the room Green screen green and half of it So this is actually the original chroma key blue And then they repainted this one for when the other team moved over here after they got booted out of their previous studio If we uh, the idea was we'd be able to green or blue screen in this room, but what happened in practice was We just ended up with a lot of green cast on everything that we shot on the blue wall This will be the last time I ever walked through here. I haven't been here in like Well over two years, three years... Huh Well, I guess this is as good a place as any to end our tour I guess we'll be back tomorrow with Bidding what are we gonna, buy?

secret bookcase speaking of duplicates why do you need two rock bands most bands have one drummer okay everything in here looks pretty on the up for you know YouTube celebrity we got some you know sparkles and glitter and Christmas decorations we got a charging set up with got some phones some battery bangs we got a gigantic Oh God oh yeah at the lightsaber that's fine this is cute is this just garbage or is this like a decoration it's for videos it's for videos except that it's you just throw garbage in it that's for cupcakes no you know what I don't buy it so I have to confess I cheated a little bit because I've been here shooting a video all day but I asked for some tools and as far as I can tell Justine doesn't own any tools that aren't pink I mean why would i if you were ever wondering what happens when a washed-up youtuber does a book or audiobook well they sent me all of those and I'm like you can use CDs what is it any wonder he thought you were creepy no it's not I deserved the restraining order her to be honest with you does YouTube know about this do you think they would even want to send you a play button if they knew it was gonna sit in the garage well I thought I would put it next to a picture of myself why not completely normal oh that's a sad story that fill in the 187's oh it's dead yeah water damage Oh Dropcam I'm not sure put it down okay so in here we've got some pretty normal stuff like oh I don't know a 150 terabyte storage server with a custom nameplate that we set up today so that's pretty cool we had Ethernet wiring for it here along with Ethernet wiring for it here recessed power Wow now it is one thing to organize this not feel like overkill label thing professional organizer they organized for me you know what I'm wearing this for the rest of the video oh my god there's more BMO's oh yeah I haven't opened those ones yet this this is where you keep a gaming PC of this caliber oh it has such a beautiful paint job it's actually incredible who is this from it's for origin look at this beer oh my god I missed this thing so much this is my first gaming PC oh wow this is like GTX 580 I think ax 1200 I power supply this is like the bee's knees from a few years back they even do the custom name thing on the back for you and this is how you repeat you know what I'm calling the guys at origin I'm getting you in trouble this is just labeled drone and it's empty so you're professional organizers didn't do a great job this thing is cool like fur coats yeah get more more gift wrap what is this what is that this gift wrap oh this is like an obsession you're like a hoarder me to open needed unbox well no I picked up on that you needed to open them but like what old tech okay what classifies as old tech Wow this is an iPad air this is old tech this is 2015 netbook I can't remember the password to it alright alright I've had enough punishment let's get this over with here oh hi I guess I should have knocked what the hell there's more wrapping paper in here this is like this is beyond weird dude okay to be fair every time I need wrapping paper I can't find it no I've already read on Amazon Prime now and it arrives in 15 minutes no I don't know buy this okay we've got another Xbox one and the guest room gigantic what is this 55 inch 55 inch TV this room 2 is wired up for you to do your wall mount TV here and your coax and your Ethernet maybe have it down there this house and it's down there too I'm surprised there's no wrapping paper in here thing you got your hand towels okay more TV mounts more Ethernet more coax another recessed wall mount this another gigantic TV yeah this is this is what I this is my nighttime TV this is your night so so far by my count yeah you've got ether yeah I guess this is kind of typical so many like I can never find a lightning cable in it the biggest Apple watch graveyard of all time what did you do to this one I dropped it so this is the og iPhone I forgot how thick it was I know it's crazy right yeah like wow if this thing was really thick like okay 11 iPhones okay you don't necessarily have like a huge hoarding problem you just have like a significant hoarding problem cool bathroom bro great shower you can sit down in the shower if you're tired why would you need an Ethernet coax in the bathroom what bag instead of moving into a place again with the intention of repurposing one of the bathrooms as a server room well why wouldn't you is the question I'll be honest with you I'm a bad guy me too I'm a bubble bath guy yeah so yeah but oh my god there's a dead bee in there is it really he's still alive yeah that's oh we're gonna have to put him out go oh gosh she's swimming about this oh he's not with us any longer wait you you knew this was there I'm not touching it more Xbox controller I have a problem it's this one here if I find wrapping paper this is my neck drawer many cute knives that's my tactical pen because you can't travel with knives so but you can travel with a stabber yeah is this another TV okay this is my office TV and what else do you have in here another Xbox one lease more Xbox controllers yeah another one wait wait look is this another Xbox box in here so this is it this is where I just seen videos are created see this is the dongle world that Joni I've envisioned these dongles this is this is the future my friends this is this is what Apple wanted this was actually the reason that I came down here we had to address this I saw a picture of this on Twitter this is Justine system for storing her archived data this is terrible literally all of this is making its way onto that white and pink server that I installed a little bit earlier and thank goodness for this which brings us to the last corner where we've got a Hello Kitty guitar do you actually play I used to Wow and more evidence of Justine's amiibo problem this video was brought to you by tunnel bear the easy to use VPN when people are shopping for a VPN one of the features they look for is a he'll switch because before you connect to a network your device actually starts to send information about itself and what it wants to do and it tries to establish connections with all sorts of things so kill switches keep this behavior from happening and before you connect to your VPN after you've connected to a network all of your traffic is actually unencrypted so in the few seconds it takes to connect your VPN you've probably already broadcast your IP maybe a few DNS requests vigilant bear from tunnel bear stops all this stuff from happening by blocking outbound and inbound traffic so nothing leaks out before you connect and if your connection goes down for some reason vigilant bear kicks back in and stops all the traffic till it comes back so try telling bear for free with no credit card required at Tunnel Bear comm /l tt we're gonna have that linked below guys if you just liked this video you know what to do but if you liked it hit the like button get subscribed maybe consider checking out where to buy the stuff we featured yeah that's part of my standard outro I don't think they could buy all this stuff like this stuff is like crazy stuff you know we'll just put a link to Justine's channel you can go check out her channel down there also linked in the video description is our merch store which has cool shirts like this one and our community forum which you should totally join I need a t-shirt 
So my buddy Dongsu Park over at Z-otak He emails me every once in a while, but we've got more cheap Korean monitors Just like that last time we sent to a cheap Korean monitor, and a lot of the time I'm like ah that doesn't really look that Amazing you guys not that impressed oh   O ooooooooooh Not this time I have not been able to find Anything online that is comparable to the cheap Korean monitor deal that I have for you guys today Today This is the crossover fast 144Hz 144 it is a 2560 by 1440 IPS panel 144 hertz display *grunts* Then I will get out of the box eventually for 299 US *Intro* Okay, so first things first, let's have a look at what kind of goods we get for our 299 U.S dollars we get a lot of bubble wrap Wow okay, we get a remote that's weird. You get a power cable we get a love this apparently it is easier cheaper for them to do this, this way they just send you an Asian power cord, and then they send you an adapter so that you can Yeah, adapt it to your North American plug Not the most elegant solution ever, but hey it gets the job done we also get a display port cable We get a closer look at that Remote that I alluded to before got kind of like a little Winky like Napster guy on there and then we get our own tool and screws there - presumably assemble this thing and Assemble we shall this comes in more pieces than your typical Monitor stands I like the construction though You hear that? It's a train. It's the game train To the station So the way you orient this bad boy is you kind of look at the Marks and the angles and you kind of line the thing and then it kind of goes on a little something like that ten out of ten instructions dick not stuck inside the monitor stand this feels like kind of a stupid thing to do, but I'm actually gonna set up the monitor in front of the 65 inch OLED TV from LG that I've got going on here the reason being is that that's really not actually that great for gaming So it's nice to have other options First we got to get the stand on here though this also Well, built I will give them credit for that but not especially Outstanding in terms of like height adjustment or anything so you're you're definitely giving up some for your $2.99 144 Hertz freesync IPS display and that is The robustness of the stand to their credit though at least they've got a vase amount that one really drives me crazy when you got a cheap stand and They didn't build in the necessary internal reinforcements for a third-party mount You guys want to see me strip on camera And of course it doesn't look perfect. I've cranked that so tight alright So There it is pretty bare-bones if you ask me But Can it make up for it with the gaming experience? To find out we are gonna be using something really really special Now I'm not a televangelist So I'm not gonna give you guys the whole thing about planting a seed of a dollar and someday it will return to you 10,000 X But that is what happened today, so I first met Charles about ten years ago How what's the safest way to take this out of here? I won't be able to pull it up Can I try? Whoa, that's a heavy system Feels like yeah, I was gonna say So I first met Charles ten years ago on This was back when I was building high-end systems or at least what I thought were high-end systems we're about to see that redefined when I was building high-end systems back at NCIX and I had noticed him originally because he had all these really expensive invoices like six thousand dollars like regular, and I'm like dude What are you doing with all this stuff turns out? He was building some really special systems also in We have we we shared We shared we had something in common right off the bat our favorite case the Silverstone T-J07 anyway The first time I met him in person he was in Desperate need of a really special set of fittings for a thermo chiller radiator some British standard plug that was very uncommon even for water cooling crap ten years ago and I actually didn't want to get rid of them because they were they were fairly unusual they were Like even finding nickel-plated thermo chill fittings back. Then was really tough. These were really nice ones They had ribs all the way down. So they sealed really nice, and I was like You know what Charles just for you so Since then He's actually been I mean not full-time that he's been hard at work on what he calls the xform @mb x2 this is a truly special case based on the original t jo7 and he brought this here for me a Special system that he hand-built himself in this chassis Absolutely one-of-a-kind and we're gonna use this to power up our monitor Okay, here we go so some assembly required you guys see that Totally custom fan mounting all aluminum, but I'm not gonna like bang it together. This is not a train Okay, this is this is a piece of art We're gonna do a full showcase of this thing down the line for now. We're just going to be using it - yes I'm gonna draw your attention stop stop back to the monitor back to the monitor, so it's got four HDMI ports I didn't talk about that before one DisplayPort an audio passed through and a DC in Jack. Let's go ahead and Get this baby fired up This is pretty cool To put it mildly Like I feel like an idiot having a blue Ethernet cable now Look at this, now I have to fix everything. Thanks Charles This is not a gift. This is an obligation Look I said look at the monitor this video isn't about that. We're gonna do a video about that later stop Can't tell Wow okay quick boot Okay, I gotta say. I'm glad it comes with the remote though Doesn't come with batteries, so I'm gonna have to go find some because this buttons on the back of the monitor thing is basically unusable I'm just trying to adjust the brightness color, effect, temperature Gamma, ultra vivid what is this? Where's just brightness? Look at this hey you're supposed to be looking at the monitor. Not the computer. We've been through this Yeah, they lost it hella Okay, what is this? What is or mayshen set apparently. It's what I need because that's where brightness is and We are back This is actually really impressive Like this is right up there with Some of the lowest motion blur that I've seen on an IPS that and this this machine and this monitor are match made in heaven this thing's actually running it over a hundred frames per second at 2560 by 1440 so if I lose it's only because of me There is uh no excuses for anything at this point like here You can actually maybe even see it a little bit here. Just how there's no There's no motion blur. There's no streaking behind that I am really impressed with this thing especially for the price Like it won't make me good at counter-strike. That's for sure but I'm still reloading. I got two guns here come on. It's not fair You dead Like this gaming experience has been available for a while, but now the difference is that it's cheap I'd like to be clear three hundred dollars is still a lot of money But in the context of what we would have paid for this kind of an experience before It's pretty affordable the only comparable things. I could find was a 144 Hertz 1440p $300 monitor on monoprice, but that was a TN panel and then for an IPS with those specs you were paying Quite a bit more So to be clear Not everything about this thing is perfect this menu can die in a fire I'm just turning up the brightness a little bit because this game is kind of kind of dark. Yeah, that looks that let's find out But it's got a lot going for it. I am super impressed for 300 bucks and Yeah, you can check that out of the link in the video description while you're at it If you guys are interested in learning a little bit more about this beast before we do our follow up video The case itself is actually for sale on mod 1, so we'll have a link to that in the description as well 
It's time for ROG Rig Reboot, So Many challengers approached only three were successful. And this is one of them. Charlie say hi. Hi Hi Internet. Hi mom. Hi dad No, no your dad's over there. so Charlie hails to us from, where you from man? Florida Oh, oh wow so you were right in the heart of it? Yeah So you have power to go plug this into right? Well we have power just not wifi yet. Wow all right well That's pretty lucky man. Well, everybody you know safe and cool? Yes. Rock on glad to hear that okay, so today We are gonna be building a rocking machine. Have you ever built a computer before? No. No, this is your first time? Yeah. Well today that changes Welcome to the party. Let's get started The Asus ROG Strix 1080 TI comes with Asus GPU Tweak II - which allows you to monitor performance and Helps you stream. It also features their game booster as well as a free one-year premium license of Xsplit Gamecaster Learn more at the link in the video description So what do you want to start with? Motherboard. Good choice! So even though you've never built a computer before have you watched a build guide? Yeah I've watched a lot of them A lot of them, all Linus Tech Tips guides right? No. Have you at least watched a Linus Tech Tips guide? Yeah, you don't make many of them anymore. Oh wow So that's the kind of video we're making All right shots fired, shots hit the target. Let's all just wipe up our tears and continue. holy crap Corsair There we go Your system at home You were the one with the laptop right? Yeah. Super Ballin' laptop That's great for gaming. No. No not so much hey? My computer is an HP laptop My computer is an HP laptop It's a... My little laptop, and then right next to it, I got my little $25 mouse I don't actually know what brand my mouse is, I kind of got it cuz it wasn't really expensive pretty much You know really you had like a Pentium core with HD integrated graphics. And tell me something HD Intel graphics How high definition are they? 720p is good. Yeah, that's what they'd like you to think Okay have you ever installed the CPU before? No. Not even touched one. Okay, so here. Not yet Okay, you can touch it. No just kidding. Okay. You can touch it Yeah, all right, so you want to line that up real carefully. There's no force required so all you got to do... Hang up, that was it, lower the arm down. You have officially installed the CPU Yay Okay have you done RAM before? I mean, I took RAM out of an old computer Fantastic alright, let's do it Why am I even here? Cuz I don't know everything, I memorized How do you do the motherboard and that's pretty much where ends. Haha so tell me then charlie what was your plan if somebody ever did give you a Computer worth of parts you were just gonna assemble the motherboard and kind of... I just go on youtube and watch a guide and build It with that. you've got all the answer --
 kids today, man So tell me something Charlie what's gonna be the first thing you do when the system arrives at home Mess with the RGB and then I'm gonna go to the steam store and buy a games with really good graphics so that I can see those For the sake of thoroughness We could pull the board out we could relocate this standoff. We could put it there mmm. Thats too much work Wait stop, we missed something really important Oh, no, you didn't do the satisfying plastic peel off the RAM. Enjoy this. You only get to do it once Oh yes. Look how shiny it is now. We also have to figure out where our hard drive is gonna go because This hard drive cage. Did you say it was going to go up here? I did say that but Let me tell you something about adults charlie Sometimes well they don't lie But they say things without having really thought them through. Are kids your age allowed to use knives? Yeah Yeah, okay, don't decide. I don't know mine are like 5 and 3 so... All right now leave these fans because I have something better RGB fans It's gonna be lit. That's what the kids say right? yeah When that RGB lighting is giving you an extra 15 frames per second you'll thank me I tell you man. It is so easy to build a computer these days And like have it look awesome Current to a thousand years ago, I can imagine it was hard since thousand years ago to go to computer You sure your name is Charlie. Yeah, sure it's not Alec oh I'm gonna confess something to you Charlie You messed up? no! So how come you picked an AMD build? cuz I like to ryzen better plus it feels like They actually care about prices. even when he's not paying for it. He's going for the perception of who's treating the customer more fairly So you said this machine is for gaming and school So surely 480 gigs on your boot drive is not enough for the library you want okay? Well that's fine We've got you covered 2 terabyte drive Then you got to make a big decision here possibly the most important decision of the entire build Do you want to put it on the bottom or the top? Is there really a difference? No Hey, there's two on the other side Then we need that SATA data cable that we set aside much much earlier and then misplaced And then found. Go for it, open it up Enjoy it savor it Oh I ripped it Those are all the good vibes. Oh, I ripped it again See I used to wonder why people watch unboxing videos, then I watched an amateur open a box totally get it now. oh There's cool on top yeah, it's a cool logo. This isn't just any old yeah This is a Strix 1080 TI Wow There it is. That's what's gonna run all your Minecraft and There are Neopets Believe it or not. It works as cool as looks. If you were to run cheapo games like Minecraft on it believe it or not these fans These fans wouldn't even have to spin Wow because the heatsink on it is so big this thing has like The entire thing basically covered in aluminum fins Okay now The most important part of installing the graphics card. Not dropping it? Okay. Okay, the next most important. Yes It's got a typo on it. I think hey really look at this GT X 1080 TI "Gamin" it's kind of embarrassing. It's not gaming. It's like it's like gamin' yo So line up your ports at the back Hey, you can tell if these are.. yep you're good did it I just installed this graphics card! sure did and you started with the best graphics card Now this is cool your graphics card actually includes an RGB lighting header So we can hook one of our RGB lighting strips that we have from cable mod up to it Cool! Alright, cover your eyes. Okay. Just follow a follow the sound of my voice Okay, okay. This is the time for the big reveal. Don't trip over that big block in front of your foot no I'm just kidding. There's no block because I moved it Turn to the right and experience 180 Hertz gaming So that is what high refresh rate with g-sync looks like So however many frames your GPU spits out that's exactly how many frames get displayed here So you don't see any tearing you don't see any lag. see you don't even have to give kids these days a game They'll just play move the window around if you throw a high enough refresh rate monitor at them now Let me show you something else. That's really cool. Come around on this side That's nice RGB yeah, that's a nice RGB and and We'll get the utility loaded up, but check this out see this RGB logo here and the logo on the back of the graphics card It's synchronized with the RGB strip across the top here. I got one other cool thing for you too really Listen to it That's STRIX for you. Well family won't get annoyed at all. well I'm sure they'll find reasons to get annoyed because you're always gonna be on the computer or bugging them to go on the computer The day was awesome actually it was really cool. The build was my favorite part and then it was also fun at the end to test the computer and stuff I was definitely not expecting a 1080i So while Charlie plays around with the RGB settings on the video card which also Controls the RGB strip along the top I guess I'll bid you guys farewell thanks for watching this episode of our ROG rig reboot, huge congratulations to you, bud for Winning this whole thing Rate the system you gotta tell me out of 10. 10 out of 10. perfect like your style then alright Thanks for watching guys 
Tv gaming - most people think of it as just for console players. Or, at least they did. Nvidia at CES 2018 got the PC gaming world super excited about big-screen gaming when they showed off their 65-inch big-format gaming displays, or BFGDs and then promptly gave the entire community a serious case of the blue balls when they announced that they wouldn't be coming until sometime later this year. Well, what if you don't want to wait until later this year? Good news - because mostly under the radar there has been a way to get high refresh rate gaming in your living room, on a big-screen TV, for months. The vizio p series runs at 120 hertz and you can buy one today. But there are some compromises - so are they worth it or should you keep waiting? World of Warships is a free-to-play historical online combat game from Wargaming, featuring an exciting blend of action and strategic gameplay. Stay tuned later in the video for an exclusive offer. ♪ (Upbeat electronic music) ♪ So the 65-inch variant of Vizio's flagship P series behind me here uses a VA panel. That means that you can expect good, if not industry-leading viewing angles, color gamut, and overall image quality. But - and this is important for gamers - it also means better pixel response times than a typical IPS. And, at normal viewing positions those other disadvantages melt away somewhat, in light of its 120Hz capability. So, it's pretty compelling, at least on the surface. But it still requires some further investigation. High advertised TV refresh rates are typically just motion interpolation - an effect that subjectively looks terrible, and objectively introduces additional input lag, so it's really bad for gaming. But I mean, the panel itself, like many TVs today, runs at 120Hz natively. So what that means is that, if a manufacturer chooses to expose it, separate from any motion compensation nonsense - which, by the way the P series doesn't have, anyway - the TV can, and will, accept and display a true 120Hz input. With a catch - Hdmi 1.4 doesn't provide enough bandwidth to run 120Hz at our panel's native 4k resolution. So we're stuck at 1080p. But - I mean if you've ever played around with a retina resolution calculator, you probably know that unless you've got eagle eyes, the difference between 1080p and 4k on a 65 inch tv can be difficult to discern from further than about ten feet away. So this might still be viable, but we need to answer some questions first. Will 1080p to 4k scaling cause blur and quality degradation? How is the input latency of this display in its various modes? And what about the rest of its features? So to answer, we grabbed our test bench and our 8k high-framerate RED camera, and a seat on the couch. We started with our biggest problem with other TVs - input latency. And we're happy to report that at 120Hz in game mode, it was basically imperceptible. Subjectively speaking, it was actually pretty close to other 120HZ displays that we've tested, and using our Makey-Makey, we measured an average end-to-end delay of roughly 40 milliseconds, regardless of game mode. So it could be better - but it is definitely acceptable. Bumping up our resolution though, we see a jump to 78 milliseconds - though it should be noted as well that this was with game mode on, and at 4k, game mode did end up making a difference. So, this is still not too shabby for a TV and it's fine for casual games, but to say we could tell the difference between high refresh rate mode and 4k would be an understatement. As for image quality, again it's pretty good -  it's not OLED but its blacks are deep and, thanks to the 128 zones of local dimming, contrast stays high even when it's dealing with small bright objects on a dark background. The app experience is really cool - it's got a built-in Chromecast that Vizio is calling SmartCast, and it pairs quickly with Bluetooth 4.0 and uses Wi-Fi to actually do everything from powering the tv on and off to accessing all of its settings. So fire up that app, turn the sharpness setting to zero, and for the most part, enjoy your TV. For the most part. The scaler - well, it's not horrible but it's not gonna blow anybody away either. It is certainly no M cable. Though with that said, if you're using your TV with a PC - as we're kind of proposing here - you may actually prefer it that way, since it does prevent the text anomalies that the M cable can produce in its current form. Now with five HDMI's and a component input, though, we aren't stuck with PC gaming all the time. Modern consoles will run about like you'd expect, so actually better than a typical 60Hz tv with high input lag, but not as good as switching to 120Hz on a PC and as for retro content? well, at lower resolutions, you'll see a big drop in quality as expected - blurry text and characters with no obvious way to improve it, and unfortunately that sharpness function doesn't help, it just puts a sharpness filter over top of it, and as for 720 and 1080p modes, on a Super NT, we actually got pretty clean results. Tl;dr: if you can pre-scale your retro games you will actually get some pretty darn good results here. And in fast 2D games, it gets especially good if you enable the Clear Action backlight-strobing function. This reduces visible motion blur at the cost of some brightness. So bottom line, then. High-performance big screen gaming - what do you do? Well, LG actually has a couple of OLED models - the C7 and B7 that have this same 1080, 120Hz functionality. But i would recommend against gaming on OLEDs - not just those ones, but in general, because bright, static on-screen elements, like huds or speedometers are very, very likely to cause permanent burn-in - bringing our options, then, back to the P series here or waiting for Nvidia's partners like Asus with their BFGDs. So with a BFGD you get variable refresh rate with G-SYNC, which is kind of a big deal. You get 120Hz at full 4k resolution -
 assuming you have the hardware to run it - and you get even lower input lag, with an Nvidia Shield console built in. However with the Vizio, you get instant gratification because it's available now, a well above average big-screen gaming experience, and a pretty darn good TV overall. Also, if my speculation is anywhere near correct, and I think it is - you also get a price that is anywhere from one half to a third of what Nvidia's solution will cost, so... The P series is actually looking pretty darn good. Let us know in the comments which one you'd prefer. Thanks to Wargaming for sponsoring this video.

- happily por la première fois Dupre present ssvf lemon super excite a possum all participles casi la poubelle video mode may hace para well know the famil group francais sponsor is in at the unity levira in experience Kiev Remo oh do come oh my apologies to all the francophones out there whose language I just butchered anyway we're on our way to Normandy right now to see the symbiotes demo car this is a vehicle that is so exclusive there is only one of them in the entire world so you wouldn't be able to order one but I wouldn't worry about that because it's also so high-tech that you wouldn't be able to afford the multi millions of euros that it took to develop it anyway vous voulez levar vet blah Elan Z [Music] okay here it comes and nobody in the driver's seat Wow it's beautiful everything about the design of the symbiote s demo car was done with a purpose its dual motor rear-wheel drive electric powertrain accelerates it from zero to a hundred kilometers that's 60 miles from my American friends in just six seconds it's almost completely smooth with front vertical air intakes and side wind deflectors to reduce drag and turbulence for better efficiency and it's chassis was reimagined from the ground up for electric power and autonomous operation so I can just let go completely okay nothing because no conversation about the next decade of automotive technology can ignore the safety and convenience advantages of well implemented driverless technology so the symbiote demo car is bristling with sensors in the front and rear bumpers you'll find Lyde ours with five radars positioned behind the bodywork and a belt of twenty ultrasonic sensors all around the car these rear vision cameras help track nearby vehicles the door handles conceal lateral cameras one on each side two front cameras are positioned in the upper part of the windshield with a third wide angle on the bumper and around back are two more one on the bumper and one cleverly concealed and there were no diamond logo okay ready the vehicle supports three modes of operations normal or classic a sporty ER version of that called dynamic and AD mode when the third one is activated the exterior lighting turns blue indicating to the cars around that it is operating autonomously and the cars brain capable of level four autonomy takes over allowing the driver on authorized roadways to focus his or her attention entirely on something else like I feel like what I'm doing right now should definitely be illegal while it handles complicated tasks like maintaining an appropriate speed and following distance relative to other cars merging and exiting highways changing lanes to overtake other cars and functioning alone in traffic jams while all of this is happening the operator can actually monitor external sensor data in real-time on three customisable OLED screens from LG while basically sitting back and enjoying the ride the seats can be adjusted for a little more legroom - a reclined zero-g mode for chilling out while your car takes you wherever it is you're going or even tilted 10 degrees towards the front seat passenger to converse or even watch a movie together then taking things to another level renault has designed in collaboration with ubisoft as part of the symbiote demo car the ability to wear a VR headset piped into the car's onboard sensors and transport your driving experience to another setting altogether this is crazy now none of this happens without some significant advances in mobile connectivity so the symbiote demo car features relatively obvious things like an always-on internet connection for streaming audio or video content navigation and traffic and calendar updates from your digital assistant but there was also some stuff that I didn't expect VX - or vehicle to infrastructure connectivity can display helpful information like nearby tourist attractions on the dashboard screen it can warn the vehicle about any upcoming hazards like accidents or poor weather and it can even allow navigation through toll booths without any intervention required from the driver whatsoever and the craziest part about that is that using RFID tags built into the car it can actually identify not just the users in the car but even which seat they're occupying by their phone and adjust the seat position music and climate control to their preferences now this exact vehicle is not heading to an assembly line in France anytime soon and some of its features like the massive heads-up display adjustable opacity glass and the smell emitters that changed the scent of the cabin depending on the driving mode are unlikely to make their way to the mainstream anytime soon but that isn't really the purpose of the symbiotes demo car the reason renault created it was to show what will be possible tomorrow by actually building one today and many of the technologies featured in this vehicle like the devil a speakers are expected to make their way into production vehicles in the coming years what a freaking time to be alive so thanks to Renault for sponsoring us out here the French government for allowing these tests to take place on public roads and to you guys for watching if you thought this video was cool you can check out Renault on social media for future updates at at group Renault on Twitter and at Renault on Instagram and Facebook 
let's begin with the important stuff the V in Titan V isn't a Roman numeral there have actually been six Titans now making this one number seven instead it directly signifies the Volta architecture that this card is based on and to further drive home the point that it is not a gaming oriented card NVIDIA has decided to forego the GeForce GTX in the product name not that we won't game on it of course after I tell you guys about iFixit there protec toolkit gives you the tools you need to tackle any electronics repair challenge visit ifixit.com forward slash linus at the link below to learn more [Music] so to help manage overhead our test setup is a little different this time around we're gonna be testing our productivity and our gaming loads on our z 270 bench for its fast per thread performance while we'll be doing our scientific testing on our X 299 bench where those workloads are more likely to benefit from the extra CPU cores let's kick things off then with the boring sciency stuff I'm just kidding so Titan V manages a higher 97th percentile framerate in Deus Ex mankind divided then the second place Titan X pees in DirectX 11 mode then it continues the curb stomping in DirectX 12 Middle Earth shadow of war also sees a huge spike in performance over the Titan XP and while Assassin's Creed origins dials things back a little the Titan VIII still ends up on top so I don't even really need to say it but given these scores and our synthetic results Titan VIII is right now hands down the fastest card on the market for gaming and it isn't even supposed to be what sets this Titan apart is its FP 16 and FP 64 performance along with the inclusion of invidious new tensor cores which are special compute units that are optimized for deep learning and AI oh and while we're at it Nvidia is also showing off HBM to memory for the first time in a Titan so V does end up with a smaller frame buffer than the Vega workstation cards or the HBM 2 equipped Quadro GP 100 but it may end up making up for that through sheer brute force its whopping 5120 cuda cores should make it the fastest part available for compute should but when we first took the shrink-wrap off and loaded up some compute benchmarks we actually found that many cuda focused tasks simply wouldn't run well it turns out that while previous gen raishin cards were built around CUDA compatibility version 6.1 and earlier Volta and by extension the Titan V bumps this up to 7.0 and new compute kernels need to be compiled to support it so blender most coin mining algorithms and other tests were affected with users reporting even more incompatibilities that we didn't see oh I'm getting flashbacks to the Vega frontier edition thankfully the open CL layer still works though so we can get rough numbers for benchmarks that support Nvidia cards in open CL mode with the caveat that open CL does have some overhead compared to CUDA starting off with Lux mark we've got Wow are these numbers even right Lux mark is super parallelized so those extra CUDA cores pulled double the performance of the Titan XP and far higher than even the Quadro GP 100 Chaos groups render sweet v-ray brings us another win for the Titan v shaving a cool three seconds off the GP 100 in second place moving on to compu bench we see the gap close for the level set segmentation benchmarks but then the Titan V pulls way out ahead in the computer vision optical flow benchmark leaving everything else well in the dust and it continues to assert its dominance in most of spec view Perth where 3ds max CATIA maya energy and showcase all have it at the top but it should be noted that the quad rose do fire back in some of the other tests thanks to their enhanced driver code paths as for coin mining well the rumors are true it is a beast especially an eighth hash but with that said the $3,000 price tag is going to kill your ROI time and it doesn't even win in every scenario Vega frontier handily outperforms it in Kryptonite whoa that's a lot of testing and it looks like Volta is mostly living up to its promises so far but we've got one more test up our sleeves for its compute performance deep learning using imagenet 12 on caf2 Titan V managed a significant lead at both tested batch size thanks to its tensor course but maybe even more interestingly it even wins without them enabled against the GP 100 a truly monstrous feat because for context you guys that card is still almost triple the price well ok then line is fine Volta is great for compute big whoop what does that mean for me okay I'll get to that first we need to talk about thermals and power because this bit is really important while Titan V manages to throttle a bit harder than the GP 100 and the GTX 10 atti in our testing and while it has the second highest idle power draw in our entire test lineup thanks at least partially to Nvidia using TSM C's 12 nanometer manufacturing process it's also got the lowest full load power draw which is bonkers considering everything we know about its overall performance so then back to your question what this means for you is that the slightly cut down and maybe higher clocked enthusiasts consumer variants without any tensor course are going to be mind-bogglingly fast but that's a conversation for another day here and now what we have is a quadrille killer at a third of the price for most workloads and one that can game faster than anything that's ever come before it though I'm not saying you should go out and buy one if raw horsepower for compute is your jam and you won't benefit from a bigger frame buffer or multi GPU with envy link these connectors they're dead you're looking at your next card right here though you'll need to roll your own CUDA kernels or wait until compatibility level seven is mainstream by which time there will probably be a Quadro variant as for the gamers well the lack of g-force and the branding says it all is just not worth it even for you mr. worm is meghamala over there I mean do you really want something that's not even SLI compatible anyway so you have to run a single card in your system like some kind of a peasant so think of the V not as something to buy but as more of a teaser for what may come in 2018 I know that I'm feeling sufficiently teased right about now speaking of teasing fresh books they don't tease they

first you used our guide to buy the best cheapo keyboard out there then you complimented it with the best sub $15 Mouse then you actually ended up replacing the original cheapo keyboard with a slightly less cheap but still inexpensive mechanical one and now it's time to complete your I spent all of my money on DLC equipment set with one final piece a gaming headset for less than $25 because you guys love a deal [Music] this cyber monday mass drop will be launching 40 of their best deals along with flash sales which will be live on their site for just 12 hours or until the item sells out so check it out at the link below first up well I'm not gonna mince words this is our cheapest pair the IP a P a P whatever the vibration gaming headphone and it costs just $10 now I actually don't mind this personally but we're getting off to a bad start here vibration is just part of the product name not a feature which apparently disappointed at least one unlucky buyer with that said ap must have put the money that they saved on packaging to good use because their headset actually sounds okay if a touch base E and while exquisite is definitely a stretch for $10 the build quality on these things is surprisingly okay they're lightweight deep and cushy air pads and self adjusting suspension style headband make for a comfy listening experience though they do get pretty warm while the long and it's weird it's kind of greasy feeling cable and included splitter make them convenient to use with your desktop phone or console there's an integrated volume wheel and mic which despite not having a boom or a mute button for that matter sounds on par with most of the others in our roundup test test test this is the apogee vibration gaming headphones microphone sound at just 10 bucks and if you plug in the extra USB you get multicolored breathing LEDs you can't control them but hey it's a bonus at this point I like this one now let's meet our next contestant just because your headset is cheap doesn't mean it has to look cheap but the GD 40s from headphone Ninja definitely do both of those things they're made of ugly cheap plastic and crude pleather and they don't fit well even on their smallest setting they don't seal on my ears properly though if you've got a real melon head then sure plop them on at least until the poorly padded headband digs into your skull on the plus side they've got a semi bendy ish what they're calling blade style microphone that's a boom microphone if you're not a ninja in your spare time and a braided cable with an inline controller that just looks almost as stupid as it feels in your hands they actually sound okay but with all these other problems who honestly cares next up the sadies SI 708 for $15.99 and a second are these things actually getting worse as the price goes up these things look more like pretend headphones for kids to play gaming team house rather than an actual product I mean just listen to that build quality and fit gets a big fat fail too if you have large ears these are on-ear headphones with hard uncomfortable padding and if you have small ears then they're sort of on ear headphones with hard uncomfortable padding sound quality at least has been pretty consistent across the headsets we've looked at so far but with that said the bass on these manages to stand out as extra money and it's one of the only ones that doesn't come with an adapter for console play and and while we're at it wait a minute this thing's got the same crappy inline controller as the last head set I guess at least it has emi shielding to ensure a good mood and to their credit the mic does conceal pretty nicely along with the rest of this thing in the garbage if your garbage can has a lid the Soumik g 9:23 comes in white or black and advertises and not one but two places on the box a long hard microphone with high sensitivity ironically it's actually one of the few mics that stood out as especially quiet and distant sounding this is a test of the Soumik g nine to three stereo gaming headset at $17.99 to their credit they are not uncomfortable though the cops offer some articulation and the inline controls are small and equipped with a appreciated clip but the build quality on this one is really bad like think how bad it has to be to stand out in this roundup and look how far the mic sits from your mouth and listen to the headband adjustment mechanism they also included this inexplicable plastic bag is this supposed to be a carrying case next up then is the excellent GM one at 1999 tons of padding actually makes this one reasonably comfortable despite the rigid design and while it sounds grating and low quality to the headband offers a lot of steps to help you find the right fit like the $10 headset this one also has LEDs but it's just static blue all day and it also has inline controls but it's one of those ones that hangs at an awkward length and the sound of it dragging across my clothes is definitely not invited to my next birthday party I'm afraid not even Bill and Ted would approve of this one next the $20 double in twos are kind of like a souped up version of the $10 ApS at least at first glance I can say positively that they are the first thing we've seen that comes close to premium feeling today with a soft touch finish braided cable and flexible boom mic but that beauty is only skin-deep or in this case a flimsy piece of pleather deep the ribbon of metal in the headband digs into your head in a matter of minutes oh and the caliper pressure on these is unfortunately so low that small and medium noggin folks alike won't ever feel like they're really staying on making matters worse for some inexplicable reason they put the mute switch right on the mic meaning that you have to make a bunch of scuffling noises while you take off the included windsock every time you want to use it next we have the version tech G 2000s which turned out to be the potion each whatever that means G 2000s when they arrived and on the subject of ink while they do definitely feature analog connectivity as advertised on the box they're actually blue not orange they've got a super flexible headband though for when your mind gets blown watching tech quickie and after a break-in period for that stiff headband foam they would be pretty comfortable if the ear cups weren't so shallow that my ears were pressed against the for some reason convex covers on the drivers this is honestly enough of a deal-breaker for me that even lighting effects can't make up for it but if you don't care about that then sound quality is similar to the rest and the boom mic is in exactly the right position to sit at the corner of your mouth if you're a catfish on to the wait a minute what's this a recognizable brand the N SIDS 500 ones have better build quality than their Red Ranger glossy plastic suggests and are actually among the most light and most comfortable headsets in the roundup today and they sound all right - with ample base without being too over-the-top though like the rest they do become pretty distorted and muddy at high volumes the mic boom pivots and bends which is really nice but with that said even correctly positioned the recording quality isn't the greatest this is a test of the MF IDs 501s for 2499 bringing us finally to the stylish Patriot Viper v3 30s these guys have got a soft touch finish breathable fabric ear pads a nice ratcheting headband with a braided cable a nearly invisible fold away mic and integrated controls on the left ear cup they're one of the only two sets in the roundup to come with a travel bag and even though it's pretty Drac it's significantly better than the other one but with all that positive stuff said they're also the only set to stand out as overly tinny sounding they're not super comfortable and they are the most expensive one that we looked at today so which set do we recommend then as your new daily drivers well since they mostly all have comparable sound and mic quality it pretty much came down to comfort build quality and price which makes it really hard to beat the $10 a piece whose multicolored LEDs and construction put them way ahead in terms of value especially when you factor in that they cost less than half as much as some of the other ones we featured MSI's DS 501 does cost more but was significantly more comfortable to my noggin and then if you don't dig the suspension style headband I'd say go for the be excellent GM ones this episode was brought to you by tunnel bear the easy to use VPN app when people are shopping for a VPN one of the features they look for is a kill switch now before you actually get properly connected to the Internet and you can start browsing your device will actually start to send information about itself and what it wants to do to you know that hotspot in the airport and before you connect to your VPN all of this traffic is actually unencrypted so in the few seconds it takes to connect you've probably already broadcast your IP maybe a few DNS requests or a search query vigilant bear from tunnel bear stops this by blocking all outbound and inbound traffic so nothing leaks out before you connect helping keep you private throughout your entire session and this is cool if your connection goes down for some reason vigilant bear will kick back in and stop all outbound and inbound traffic until the connection comes back so for a free trial of tunnel bear go to tunnel bear comm /l tt we've got that linked below so thanks for watching

this video from CES 2018 is brought to you by the symbiote demo car from group Renault we'll have that linked in the video description so we're here in the asus rog suite where they've got a ton of amazing display technology on display first up is their 144 hertz 4k HDR gaming monitor that we actually saw demoed like a year ago the PG 2 7uq but the key difference is that they are actually going to be shipping this thing really soon so that's a large 27-inch g-sync display 144 hertz 4k pretty much can't go wrong unless of course you're into ultra wide gaming in which case might be more into the PG 35 VQ so that's a 34 40 by 1440 35 inch g-sync 200 Hertz display so that is double the refresh rate of the predator x34 one of my personal favorite gaming displays also here is a Seuss's flavor oven videos BFG TV display what are they calling it yeah yeah BFG D or big format gaming display I don't think they have a model name for it yet but in a nutshell it's a 65 inch monitor effectively because it doesn't have a TV tuner but it does have a lot of features that are appealing to gamers so it uses a VA panel with a three thousand to 1 contrast ratio it runs out a hundred and twenty Hertz 4k resolution with HDR and it has a built-in Nvidia shield so you can play Android games you can stream Netflix Amazon Prime etc but most importantly they're boasting ultra-low latency so if you're a couch gamer that looks like it's going to be the solution sometime later this year the most visually interesting one though is probably this guy now on the surface this looks pretty boring it's just like a couple of rubber pieces at the top and bottom and then it's a strip of PMMA which is a plastic material similar to acrylic but what's special about it is the Fresnel style lenses that are cut into it so traditionally the way to achieve bending of light would be to have like a big bubble lens but instead this just has a bunch of slits cut into it all along kind of similar to the rings that you see inside of an HTC vive and what it does is if you put it on top of the bezels of Zeus's PG 2 v 8 q gaming monitor it makes them essentially disappear by stretching the edge of this screen and the edge of this one creating a bezel effect now it's not perfect you do lose a little bit of light so they are a little bit dimmer but I will say that if you're into sim racing the experience is significantly more immersive they're optimized for a hundred and thirty degree angles and they're working on getting it working with the PG 35 V Q and pricing is expected to be able they don't know but they're saying under $100 which like I would hope so but like that seems pretty reasonable if you're into surround gaming so there you go I took apart their demo anyway this video was brought to you guys by the symbiote demo car from group Renault we checked it out quite recently it's their level 4 autonomous car that I actually got to drive and I use the term drive with a serious asterisk on it because we managed to take it out on the freeway with my hands completely off the wheel the seat tilted back and then at its most extreme with a VR headset on that was actually simulating what it would be like if I was in a completely different environment whatsoever with the car sensors themselves tied into the VR headset so you guys are gonna want to check out that video to see the latest in autonomous driving innovations we're gonna have it linked in the video description so thanks for watching guys dislike or like check out well I mean you can't buy any of this stuff yet but check out subscribe so you don't miss any of our CES 2018 content 
liquid metal it's a hell of a drug you know first yeah deal it'd your CPU and then that high wears off so then you like liquid metal your laptop and again you're rewarded with amazing temps and even a performance boost and that keeps you going for another week or so and then you notice something getting kind of hot in your pants you know the idea it starts small but then it grows grows getting more and more solid what if you could make your phone run cooler and faster with liquid metal well guess what that's a super risky maybe even bad idea so we're gonna show you how to do it after we tell you today's video is brought to you by shade tree sunglasses shade tree sunglasses are hand made from hard wood materials featuring polarized lenses a variety of designs and even cool new carbon frames get 10% off your next order through our link below [Music] so it is common for phone performance to nosedive during any workload that takes more than a couple of seconds with gaming being a common culprit so your processor starts out cool and fast then the hotter it gets the more it thermal throttles so liquid metal likely wouldn't do anything for that initial cold performance but it could allow us to maintain peak performance for longer so we chose the razor phone as our victim excuse me a test subject compared to most phones its thermal design is very respectable but it is still not perfect check this out our first 3d mark result puts us in the top 83 percent of razor phones so that looks pretty good but then a second run immediately afterwards gave much worse results and it dropped all the way down to 20% worse after a 15 minute stress test that is the kind of performance impact that you would notice in an extended mobile gaming session so let's get started then you'll need a good set of screwdrivers and prying tools some isopropyl alcohol some paper towel some conformal coating cotton swabs and a heat gun because getting inside phones sucks and of course you'll also need liquid metal will be using thermal grisly conduct anat now your phone's disassembly process will be different unless you have a razor phone but we'd recommend watching this whole process anyway without skipping around if you plan to follow along so first we made sure the device was off then we took a heat gun to the speaker grills with the adhesive softened we peeled them off with a prying tool next we removed this combination of regular Phillips and Torx screws we recommend always placing things like this in a parts tray in the same position as they came out of the phone in so you don't have to guess which ones go where during reassembly then we used guitar picks to keep the phone from snapping back together while we pried it apart until well it pried apart and the screen popped off then once we got inside and took off the cables for the LCD screen and battery giving us our first good look at the razor phone's heat pipe cooler it's insulated from the battery and actually seems to be designed to use the screen to increase its surface area for heat dissipation pretty cool with the stock thermal paste removed it wasn't entirely clear actually how to proceed we lifted this small copper heat spreader very carefully with a razor blade not to be confused with a razor blade and then had a planning session so if liquid metal gets on anything aluminium the gallium in it will destroy it with corrosion so what we've decided is to put the best thermal compound that we have between the copper sheet and the processor and then liquid metal the heat pipe to the copper heat spreader with regular thermal compound all around it time then to execute we applied conformal coating around the CPU with a cotton swab to act as a line of defense if the liquid metal spills off the CPU then to put our copper heat spreader back on we used arctic silver thermal adhesive which you mix up in equal parts and then spread across the surfaces that you want to stick together just like an epoxy we then cleaned the copper spreader and carefully placed it back on removing any wrinkles with a guitar pick and clamping it all together for about 20 minutes to make sure that it was set moving over to the back of the screen we applied a generous amount of thermal paste here and then it was finally time for liquid metal we put a small drop in a cleaned parts tray then picked up a tiny bit with a cotton swab this was carefully spread out over the copper heat pipe you only need a little bit of this stuff to do the trick time for reassembly if you are performing this mod on a razor phone by the way I would strongly recommend that you get new speaker grilles first because they don't just stick back on so we used what we fondly refer to as that sticky tar crap to put them back on as best we could I give it a 4 out of 10 anyway hitting the power button it boots so now it's time for the payoff or lack thereof we weren't sure given that we weren't liquid metals all the way to the chip itself if this was even really gonna work so in 3d mark we immediately recorded our highest result yet but not by a very significant margin cautious optimism that best at this point then on the second run whoa no decrease in performance whatsoever also in the Vulcan test which comes after the OpenGL one is finished running we went from very middle-of-the-road performance compared to other razer phones to being in the top 4% and our other benchmarks saw modest gains and performance - so this phone right here it's got ugly grills but you could game on it indefinitely and see virtually no drop in performance an A+ result so then would we recommend performing this operation the answer is no given the low mounting pressure for the cooler and the way that phones get moved and tossed around all the time we believe that the chances of the liquid metal shifting and damaging the aluminum inside your phone or even shorting something out and bricking it entirely are too high also we can't know how much of the performance increase came from the liquid metal and how much was simply from repai stting the phone with a higher quality thermal interface material so bottom line then unless you're going for bone performance records it's really cool and the results surprised even us but I wouldn't recommend voiding your warranty over it speaking of things I would recommend ting is the mobile carrier that's focused on customer service and customer satisfaction when you call ting you don't speak to robot you get put through directly to a person and you don't pay extra for the privilege the average ting bill is just 23 bucks a month per device and if you're stuck in a contract and switch to ting they'll cover 25 percent of your cancellation fee up to 75 bucks the cool thing about ting is that you only pay for exactly the airtime and data that you use and data is now just ten bucks a gig beyond the first gig so try out their savings calculator it's over at Linus ENCOM we'll have that link below and find out if you would save money on ting when you sign up at our link you'll get twenty five bucks in service credit or towards a new device so thanks for watching

Newegg reached out to us with a pretty cool proposition they were like hey, here's an idea. Linus Why don't you pick out a bunch of products that you think your audience will like And we'll put them on sale for Black Friday So, Immediately we thought hey why not build an entire new rig where each and every component is on sale.

But not this time newegg is knocking 30 bucks off of everyone's favorite chip for single threaded workloads the core i5 7600K and $40 off the 7700K Which will be just $300, the reason these deals are so juicy is that Kaby Lake even though it's still under a year old is no longer current gen For the AMD fans Ryzen is on sale But at a smaller discount since they're already quite a bit less to begin with you can get 10 bucks off of two of our top picks the Ryzen 5 1600 and the Ryzen 7 1700X Now the prices in this video are subject to change as we get closer to Black Friday but we've been guaranteed that they won't be any higher than we say here so I Kind of hope they change but no matter Which of those chips you choose the corsair H100IV2 240 millimeter all-in-one liquid cooler will keep it nice and cool, and it's on for just 85 bucks This is a great cooler for the price, but just bear in mind that the AM4 socket mounts for Ryzen Are sold separately from Corsairs website Speaking of sockets you can pair your Kaby Lake processor with an Asus Prime Z270-Plus motherboard for a hundred and twenty bucks Meanwhile AMD folks can look forward to spending even less this Asus B350M board supports overclocking and is just $69 my favorite amount of money *winks* Now it might seem counterintuitive But we're recommending different RAM kits for Ryzen and Intel either kit should work in your build if you go the other way just Potentially not at their advertised speeds The Intel tuned kit is 16 gigs of RGB Corsair Vengeance RAM available for one eighty nine ninety nine and then Representing maybe the best deal of the day is the ryzen tuned 16 gig kit of G skills flair x4 one seventy nine ninety nine When it comes to graphics you may have heard that an AMD GPU works better with an AMD processor But that is actually a big fat, myth so from here on out no matter what parts you've chosen so far your build will be compatible with the rest of the stuff in the Guide for the green gamers the Asus Strix GTX 1070 at 429$ and if your blood flows red you can get a Gigabyte RX Vega 56 at 409.99$ or 389.99$ if you can be arsed to do the mail-in rebate Like RAM, NAND flash is currently going through a global shortage and supply so 10 bucks off a 500 gig Samsung 850 Evo internal SSD is about the best we can do for you the good news is if you're the type to You know take your time and savor the moment you can get a slower 4 terabyte hard drive from Seagate for $25 off for your power supply and EVGA supernova 850 G2 is a great option.

You can get a similarly spec G-Sync monitor from Acer for about a hundred and fifty bucks more Putting it all together then our Intel builds are hovering it just around the $2,000 mark for everything while the AMD builds are 1650 and 1750 but these price differences aren't so large once we ditched the poor frills and just look at the tower Overall the rise in five build is the most heavily discounted and looks like a killer Value and the best part is you can order everything here online in your underwear with zero risk of being killer-ed by a stampede of crazed shoppers So thanks for watching guys if you dislike this video you can hit that button But you liked it hit like get subscribed consider checking out where to buy the stuff. We featured at the link below and Hey while you're down there? I don't know buy a shirt or whatever join our forum 
good now confirm start dot txt I'm wondering can my hi again oh oh wow I meant uh hey at the height of the chair look at a wedge show how's it going we have a bunch of great news this week Twitter made money that's weird I don't think that's ever happened before no no I don't believe it has the home pod steams your furniture permanently AMD is apparently potentially sending out free processors we'll have to get to that later well Google removes the ability to view images now requires you to save them to your account and um I think we've called that enough news stay tuned to watch the rest into a roll [Music] I am so hungry like I need that sappy Turkey today [Music] yeah that's my solution yeah but that's having turkey PS the Sorachi you know what whatever screw Colton and it is really good yeah that's fine but it's not okay when everything on a ten-point scale starts at nine you still you know yeah but there's tens but there's tens Colton see Colton he's not at you know he's not a ten thinker you know he's more of a more of a nine thing as long as you passed the post yeah alright so we have got a lot of great news for you guys why don't we get right off with Twitter made money so this might not sound too crazy but if you've been following Twitter at all they have never been profitable Twitter turns a profit for the first time in 12 years and just like so many others look at this like look at it they've lost as much as five hundred million dollars in a single quarter oh man like what do they do I'm like regularly a hundred to two hundred million they made a hundred million dollars like they are clearly still many many years in the hole but like 91 million dollars profit on seven hundred and thirty two million revenue and there's so many social kind of tech companies like this that just make nothing and burn for so long I don't know like snapchat is actually at the point now where it's like old and people don't really want to use it anymore cuz it like feels old Wow and I don't I still don't think they're really making money so like yeah they didn't really make enough it's it says here the profit was modest 91 million on a seven hundred and thirty two million in revenues so the profit was 91 million yeah revenue was 732 their shares soared as much as thirty percent which is the most since November 7th 2013 did they really go public that long ago it's been a while what see this is what this is why I don't invest in stocks because I don't understand it it's it's it's basically if you're okay now to be clear there are situations where I kind of look at it and go okay how that sort of makes sense like there are companies that pay out a dividend on their profits to their shareholders so if you do the math and you go okay well this is blue chip enough and stable enough that I think that they are a blue chip terminology blue chip yeah blue chip stock is like a predictable one that basically rises and falls as the market in general does I think you're bad at stock I'm like a tier below okay so so if you look at an you go okay this blue chip stock pays out dividends that sort of X rayed and overall we're tracking this and the account economic outlook is why and whatever can't buy any right then you could kind of go and and in in eight years I'll have made back what I spent on my stock in just dividends so like if there's some kind of math that you can do where you kind of go okay yeah sure maybe that sort of makes sense to be clear it's still gambling cuz it can all still yeah totally be destroying a company could vanish yeah but this whole betting on companies that don't make money that one really confuses me like I've always the way that I've always believed in running a business is is small is fine big is good big is better but profitable is essential I believe in sustainability everyone who gets hired at Linus Media Group should know that even if I fail in my efforts to go around and get on my knees and do whatever it is that I need to do from my knees be it like this or like whatever else VC capitalists they need to know that even if my efforts to raise money from people who just you know don't know what to spend it on fail they will still have a job yeah I believe in that I like not being VC based it's kind of cool sort of is but in a different way like in a quite different yeah so the way it works is I'm the VC yeah which is I think that's different yeah and like I'm directly involved in the company yes it's not it's not like it's inside investment that sounds like a bad thing that what it's called it's probably not called that cuz that sounds like sounds sketchy it sounds something like something illegal but it's specifically the point is this whole pure speculation on I'm gonna buy this stock because like someone else is gonna look at it and go wow I should have bought that stock and they're gonna jump in they're gonna buy it for more and then I'm gonna sell it like that has always been scary to me for the same reasons that cryptocurrency is scary yeah or putting motors or mortgaging my house and putting it all on black is scary like all of those things are scary to me and so so so I just want to make sure that even though we're getting kind of amped because Twitter made money which I have never seen an ad on Twitter so I have well okay no they're not has their promotion I don't see ads so promotion I actually just like I have like a learning disability like I can't or like a visual impairment we talked about that yeah yeah like I can't see them where are they they're kind of hard to see because they're okay let's let's all let's all go on a journey to Twitter together let's go to the home okay so I think you can pay to get here I'm like wide trends I could be wrong but sometimes you'll see something that has like like here this doesn't have many tweets yeah exactly so there's ones with like huge amounts of thousands watch something on Netflix so is this sponsored but it's not disclosed I have no idea okay I think you can pay to get there I don't necessarily know that any ones that are there right now did I could also be completely wrong so you can advertise with Twitter it's not real clear what you get for your money from looking at my homepage detectives homepage anyway chocolate okay so why don't we go to I don't know no I won't know where the ads are I don't know I want to know where to spend money to buy these suppose it adds I don't think you Missy any notifications I think you only see them in home and moments okay no this is for our network okay okay so like so this is what I'm trying to figure out here it's like uh you know so I think it's really cool that Twitter made money I can't figure out how why they made money because I can't figure out why anybody's buying advertising on in lots their revenue is huge yeah it's like seven hundred million dollars revenue yeah it's not I mean to be clear like that's nothing compared to a giant like Google or Facebook but I'm sure twitch chat is tearing me apart here they go turn off adblock I don't have a block yeah neither of us have a block that's not it for sure like you know what no I want to make sure that like that the air is clear where would adblock be if I had it up here the only extension you have is last past yeah but the only extension that requires an icon but I'm pretty sure I block like where it where where would I show my work what shows my extensions would it show up as an app I think it's under more tools and then yeah more tools than extensions so more tools are tools extensions tangents here we go I actually don't really use browser extensions as you guys can plainly see okay you have a fair amount but most of them are not enabled you can see from the check mark checkmark box so there you go there's mics there's every extension I have ever like tried for five minutes there you go yeah so no ad blocker is not the issue I just maybe maybe part of it is that I don't see them and I don't click on them so maybe they just stop bothering yeah okay cuz I'm on mine and I decided that I was just gonna sit here and just constantly scroll through home until I got to one yeah and I haven't I've seen them before though I have scene sponsored tweets they definitely exist I don't use whole a VPN I think I I think I grabbed it like years ago for I know what I used it for we did a sponsored spot for Hulu and I had needed to get some screen capture of Hulu and I just needed to go on like their website so I think that's why I grabbed just like some because that was prior to our tunnel bear sponsorship I don't think I had even heard of tunnel there at the time yeah so uh so yeah so that's why I had a couple of randoms like that that's from like four years ago an actually insane amount of scrolling and I have seen zero ads I've scrolled through a lot of stuff over to saying yeah so yeah like I just I I don't I don't get it so so back to so their total advertising revenue was only up one percent year-over-year because maybe there's a lot of people out there who can't find me ads on Twitter or maybe you know what you know what it's mid q1 oh no one's buying yeah maybe just maybe they actually are just like dude don't have any ads deserve yeah maybe it yeah I mean just so you guys know like there's a there's a very there's a very cyclical nature to online advertising spending and we've been doing it long enough yeah that you know we're very familiar with the the ABS and the flows so in in quarter one of any given year since lioness Media Group has become a thing we we've been running around with our hair on fire trying to figure out how we're gonna survive for the next year because we do our annual employee reviews we try to get them finished in December and during that time everyone gets sort of the feedback on how things went this year for the company how things went for them and a lot of the time people get raises so and that's also the time of year that we do all of our budgeting for the following year we'll go okay we need to set aside this much money to hire this person and this much for that person and whatever else and then every q1 like we're not surprised because we know it's coming okay I'll show that in a minute we're not surprised cuz like we know it's coming but we're always kind of surprised by the severity because the calendar flips over figuratively who uses paper calendars it's ridiculous but the calendar flips over and like all of our sponsors are just like yeah we don't have any budget right now and and Adsense goes like this and we're just like oh how are we gonna survive we're paying people more than we used to but we're making less than we used to this is not a good image there's there goes that bingo pieces so the point is this happened this happens every year and so it actually shouldn't surprise me that much if Twitter doesn't have a lot of advertising inventory to pump out to the people who are least likely to click on it people like me with that said here we had someone to write this Intuit chat know is a tweet to both of us - both of us - both of us know like they tweeted this screenshot to both of us oh so one thing to note here is someone brought this up in the chat as well I don't know if I want to like promote this too much what is this I have no idea don't go to it there you go yeah this looks like pretty scummy it does like I've never heard of it it might be fine but like investment advertising on Twitter that compares itself to crypto is like yeah we provide even better returns than crypto like what does that even mean it sounds like it sounds like the worst thing I would in particular not go there how about that will give them negative promotion but yeah like apparently it's more popular than the mobile app which might be part of the reason why we're not seeing it so January so there's less of them or it's not January but q1 so there's less of them and we're not mobile app so there's less of them got both of those actually does make okay so there you go Twitter made money but that doesn't mean that I would necessarily recommend going and you know investing your life savings because revenue is only up 1% as I said before and 2017 as a whole was down 6% from 2016 yeah which I don't know what that means if your advertising revenue is up 1% oh maybe they have other sources of revenue like data cell data I have no idea I assume so I totally assume so actually have a lot of it yeah we got to be careful you know because we don't want to get caught up in a slander libel dis bargeman thing so we don't know there we don't know and mostly that would end logical that they would we mostly don't give too two poops and half of a rat's rear end about sort of Twitter's financials yeah so someone just tweeted me this which was they tagged me in a sponsored post that they saw in their feed that doesn't show me that it's sponsored because of how Twitter works you just make a normal tweet and then you promote that normal tweet and it will be promoted to individual people but if other people see it it's just a normal tweet so you can't actually tell like there's no there's no hashtag add or anything because it's coming from the actual home company so that's kind of interesting actually I just found out why my hard drive mining test machine wasn't booting after the power outage what boot drive got nuked so like it's not the hugest deal but I need to put a new OS on it no no all the paw files are still there so you can just read oh yeah the plot files are still there it's just it's a pain in the butt because it has like 25 drives in it and so I just need to go through and tediously read all the plots and like get it all signed in luckily the plot file names should have your non-skin sir yeah it was a pain and no yeah no it does like it's fine it's just like I mean I plotted all of them on separate machines already anyway okay yeah it's just it's the actual rig that runs it and it's just it's a pain in the butt because I had a really really hard time finding a driver that worked for the LSI controller cards anymore cuz the problem is that LSI got acquired by whoever who then got acquired by someone else so finding drivers for the old LSI staff even if there is a current product that's the same thing as it's just kind of like a pain in the butt and I figured it out like a few months ago so I'm just gonna have to do it from scratch we like half an hour so it's just like not the end of the world you know speaking of 1800 burst coins worth a total of like 26 dollars are safe so far by the way guys the results for mining adventure sidequest hard drive mining not great if you have to actually buy a hard drive for it not recommended yeah not so much yeah anyway sorry what were you saying speaking of not the end of the world but not recommended have you been watching the Olympics at all no okay so I haven't seen anything there's a few different people talking about how different coverage has been going and one thing that I do have to give a show for is CBC has been great Roxette Olympic Canadian Broadcasting Company in collaboration but sure sure they're not a company oh that makes sense it's been awesome watching their stuff has been really great they stream all of it which is pretty sick it's been interesting though watching Twitter because I started like someone that someone mentioned that NBC sucked for some reason and I was well I never see who's been great I heard NBC he's been like cutting off but like middle of events forever like search for certain events and then other events like I think it was ice dance or figure skating or something they're doing like picture and picture to make sure we like see the reaction cam like some of them they're trying like really hard to cover really well and then others they just like don't give a crap okay so anyway with CBC apparently because a lot of people been tweeting about it Cutler yeah yeah but see you see if you have been tweeting about this if you run adblock the stream just keeps going when the ads are supposed to be running so the announcers think that the ads are running and they keep talking really and it's been pretty bad but like there's constantly through the CBC there's like none of this shall be reproduced or like CBC will come after you basically is constantly broadcasted so there's not a lot of clips of it but there's like man I don't want to effing commentate the next game bla bla bla bla what if they're gonna you know uh send any to our hotels like bad stuff stuff that should not be on the air no way so you're not supposed to copy it you're not supposed to record it and but if someone did Wow that'll be golden you know I'm not even convinced that any scandal matters anymore yeah I mean you've got a well it made me salty because I was so happy with how the CBC's coverage was working their web streaming was working great you could watch vod's you could watch live coverage their commendation was going really well the the timing of ads was very sensible everything was super awesome everyone else was complaining I was like yes this is great and then coz like we don't we don't really get political on the show anymore but I it's probably worth at least mentioning that right now the president of the frickin United States has a porn star and an ex play mate both of which have given very credible accounts of affairs that he had with them and it's as simple as no it's all a lie never happened and it's like barely even news yep and now with deep fakes and all this other kind of stuff and I'm sure they'll come up with like a deep fake equivalent for audio that'll be a bad combination so yeah like whatever the commentator said the best advice I can give them Fenny one from the CBC Suisse or something yeah no no no you don't even have to ignore it just be like nope take news yeah okay anymore like I I'm at the point now where I'm kind of looking at it going but why do I even stress out about this stuff anymore yeah like I should find something like scandalous to do and then just see see how quickly it goes away gain gain temporary attention yeah just helpful yeah and then it'll just disappear do you have any idea how healthy tampon gait was for the the overall momentum of the channel was it because I guess the bunch people came to watch it to see the context and stuff and a bunch of them subscribed and that's where like youtube saw that video saw it had great traction and promoted the heck out of the next few I found it really really interesting when everyone that hated on X youtuber not even bring his name up because that's my whole point just tweeted out his name and links to the videos that they are upset about and we're like I can't believe this is happening and I'm like you're just growing his channel like if you're just saying like I'm upset this is bad you're not actually deconstructing the person so people don't actually really care and they just want to see what's going on and then they're like okay let's move on so you're actually just helping them yep I mean your anger what are cheers cheers that's the money we have a top cheer buy squad tune I think that's what's a thousand change think $10 really I think I could be wrong why would anybody give us $10 I think I'm good yeah I think a hundred is $1 and on that note brought to you by fresh blogs the simple cloud-based

news topic so far so we should probably get a move on let's uh let's do that so - the screen the original article hears from the verge it was posted on the forum by good bites okay good bites okay love one to ten Microsoft how about enjoyable merchants huh okay is he Pro Microsoft or anti everything else or some combination of the two I was just going to say why not both right oh so he posted this on the forum home pods are apparently staining wooden tables with a white ring it seems to have something to do with the rubber bottom and some kind of a chemical reaction that takes place would and to be clear apparently so not not rapper Sonos does to Apple has confirmed the issue stating that this is great the marks can improve over several days after the speaker is removed from the wood surface also known as get oh yeah the company also recommended that users try cleaning the surface with the manufacturer's suggested oiling method if the white rings don't fail there is apparently already an accessory so pad and quill comm is selling and this not only surely was a leather box this surely was a leather coaster they already had oh my Wow go away surely was something they already had that they are just calling leather surface protector for home pod and those absolutely just a coaster or something 20 bucks you can get a leather surface protector for the home pod but surely this is not going to be the last solution we got a note in the in the notes from James here wouldn't Apple have known about this why didn't they warn consumers you know I can see this being the kind of thing that Apple might not have noticed I'm okay I would probably see I would give them the benefit of doubt there as well and I'm kind of king of like no don't do it but yeah in this case I honestly would but their response how fast was their response was within a day or two so they might have right right so you're saying anything that they wouldn't if they didn't take three to five days to validate it or wait no right the fact that they think it might fade in three to five days yeah and they didn't have three to five days to think so I would normally give a member doubt but I think they played their cards pretty clearly here they must have already known because they apples king of just like but I don't know so if they do totally nothing it Robin they're like three to five days this is it bla bla bla bla bla maybe get on our last one last furniture if it doesn't fade out in three to five days use this specific oiling method like I don't know I I think they knew I would give them benefit the doubt except yeah I think they basically told us that they knew hmm all right well at any rate if they didn't respond I would say oh yeah I don't they know I don't think any of my smart speakers are sitting on you know what no I do have one I have the Sonos play three that's sitting on it's sitting on the UM so I have and it says Sonos does it too so I have a wardrobe that has two drawers in the bottom and then it just has like an open slot where you can put like you know belts or ties or something lit and I have a I have a plate that I don't have any I don't have any ties and I only have one belt so I have a so does play three in there so I should check after check and see if I've gained this wasn't posted to the forum apparently James found it over on our Technica AMD is sending out free processors to solve firmware flashing catch-22 apparently so AMD will help you out if your new motherboard needs a new bios to work with your new cpu now these kinds of issues have come up before so this really surprises me that they would be doing this so one of AMD's selling points compared that's weird over the last little while has been forwards and backwards compatibility of their CPUs and their motherboard and chips at platforms and for for most intents and purposes when we're talking aim to m2 plus m3 what's their name three plus can't remember for most intents and purposes this hasn't really mattered much because there wasn't really a significant upgrade to make like anyone who went from an 1100 te what was that - bin - uh - a piledriver I think I can't I can't remember all the code names anyway anyone who went from there their high performance six core to their high performance eight core actually lost performance in a lot of situations so there wasn't really a compelling reason to want to cross-contaminate your your platform but and the other thing too is that they were comparing their self themselves to - Intel whose notorious for going okay yeah a chipset has a two-year life span that's it so one of the big pitches with a m4 was like hey you're getting you know notice every a m4 board has has a graphics output on it you're gonna be able to take AMD up coming as n based APU so CPU and GPU combination chips with integrated graphics are gonna be able to plug them into these boards and go now in this case there is a compelling reason why you might actually want to do that and aside from upgrading cuz you wouldn't you wouldn't upgrade to one of the new I'm not hate calling them ap use but one of the new CPUs with integrated graphics you wouldn't really upgrade to them but there might be boards out there that have been sitting on a shelf for the last three months and someone just goes and like buys it and buys a a new CPU with integrated graphics that doesn't work and might be in a situation where they can't flash their BIOS without an older-style CPU so basically what they're doing apparently is we have kit yeah to flash your firmware so you actually get a free CPU a dual-core a6 9500 you're supposed to send it back but you don't have to send the heatsink back what what the whole thing is just super weird I'm like do you have to sign some agreement to get it no because if not I suspect the majority of people just won't sign it but here's what I want to know hey Susan's had this figured out for like five years why does everybody else not have CPU lists motherboard BIOS flashing sorted out at this point yeah why is it still hard to flash a BIOS is it patented that's a great question I have no idea yeah I don't know either but like okay this laptop razors BIOS flashing method is super simple you download an exe and you run it and it updates your system firmware updates our BIOS and you reboot like how if you can't get into Windows though that's been around for a while but that sounds more complicated to me yeah well the system is booted up the only thing that would make sense to me is it's got a it's gotta be a patent thing because I really because yeah it it doesn't seem like it should be that hard right pull the file off the thing you do that without an OS because you know why like I don't know if you remember but back in the day there was a few games that had little mini games starting though during loading screens and that hasn't been a thing for a long time it's cuz stupid patent troll was just like huh no it wasn't a stupid trolls like Atari or something yeah but then they never did anything with it Kaymer quickly I want to see who did it yeah I'm looking it up already um it's about to expire apparently Namco Bandai sorry yeah okay but it's like one of those like ancient irrelevant like the self Patterson yeah it's really awesome yeah it's great and you're just not allowing anyone to do it really no I commented on that when I was doing that video with and that should not be patentable by the way oh my god so I I noticed that when I was doing the video with my son on the K know that it has their flappy their stupid flappy bird clone oh dear on the loading screen yeah yeah and I was like wow this is great why doesn't everybody do this and then the comments just full of people being like yeah because they can't idiot thank you commenters I really appreciate you and your comments owner Kano got in trouble for that I miss Jim Carrey like yes he done lately Oh other than just like being bizarre on social media and on camera and stuff yeah oh there's a movie it's on camera uh he's he's I don't want to get into it just because I say something wrong but he's yeah I don't want to get too far into it I see it nothing like yeah nothing too crazy or something yes this is part of the reason why I don't want to get too into it there's there's been some oh there's been a civil suit against and something to do with that interesting this is part of the problem the fact that this is happening at all apparently is like extremely mentally straining which makes sense yeah so there's been some pretty intense bouts of nihilism stuff it's a very sad situation depending on whether or not it's true and all this kind of stuff and I don't know and bubble butt but yeah it's been a little a little complicated for a little while and I feel like it's gonna be an extremely polarizing thing hi interesting okay then um moving on to other tech news all right then oh excuse me all righty then oh um are you allowed to say that like if you can patent or like trademark lets get ready to rhumble in the way that he said it can you do like other catchphrases I assume something wearing a savage jerky shirt I am or such a sellout I was so excited when I heard we had more it's my first food for the day so like thank you for feeding me sponsor I appreciate it also clothing me we're doing good we're doing good you put a roof over my head and we're done actually sort of do can I help you you know you can't have more you were already here you need the whole bag already wait the whole bag well that's what you get for sharing yeah what did we learn sharing is losing things okay so Google to tweak Image Search to help protect photographer copyrights so it used to be that it was as simple as this yeah images may be subject to copyright which was Google's way basically right well because they don't know because they don't know and because they don't care so they have removed the view image button that was next to it that would directly linked to the high-res photo and they're gonna make that copyright notice more prominent for users so let's see this middle click or right click and open the new tab so this change is a result of a partnership between Google and the stock photo agency Getty Images which has been lodging anti-competitive complaints against Google for making high-resolution stock photos easily downloadable through Google images so they're saying this is a benefit to all image owners globally we expect it to have a positive impact on traffic to our site less than 24 hours later oh this is fun there are already browser extensions for Chrome and Firefox that bring the buttons back however these extensions probably won't last long especially on Chrome the change won't stop people from using copyrighted images but it does add a little bit more inconvenience unless you use James's meth which guy is the right-click on the image and select open image and new tab doesn't seem propel that's James's method here's what I want to know if there's any programmers out there watching that are sort of looking for a weekend project that would make my life a little bit better what I want to know is and maybe this exists I just haven't been able to find it so its copyright checker or something no I'm an important thing yeah no I don't know I wanted to look for something important here's ten important things to simplify your life copy link address oh why did that work what when does that not work no it usually has Google's crap attached to it oh the pictures look at a picture look at a picture oh is it only pictures I think it's pictures what wow there's no important pictures okay um and like if you copy that if you copied the search know that I'm not talking about it talking about when you just like right click so yeah okay this junk yeah okay can someone make an extension that removes all this like is that possible because if you if you just mouse over it oh no it is it is the stupid yeah okay still how it must not leak is to open this search with that thing extended if I remember correctly okay and there's another issue in you can maybe make something that copies the click-through link like what's the thing that makes it like impossible to copy paste things into hangouts I can't remember exactly what it is but you know that issue where if you try to paste if you try to just link someone to something in hangouts you can't send them an exact URL it it hang out suffice it so there's like a couple things like that that are really frustrating how about just stripping all that stuff out with an extension I would download the crap out of that extension so you'd be among the like very small handful of extensions apparently there is a grease monkey or tampermonkey script for that I just haven't been able to find it link cleaner and Firefox apparently but I don't want a Firefox thing because hey Quantum's yeah quantum was really unstable the last time I tried no I don't think so okay as far as I can tell right now based on like a machine by machine basis not even person my person just my machine either quantum is super unstable or Croma super unstable just won't get just one of them and it's on like a machine by machine basis most of the machines that I have of course I just get randomly assigned out this happens every show I've no idea right on most machines that I have it's it's Chrome but there's I've definitely heard reports from people that they like can't use Chrome because it just crashes all the time which I've basically never seen or heard of that but they use quantum and it runs perfectly fine all the time on both my main machines quantum just crashed and like full system lock because of quantum constantly so I don't know I'm not sure I would love to use Firefox again but when it like significantly negatively impacts my work productivity then I just I can't all right there's some confusion around in videos code games the original article is from Digital Trends apparently Nvidia may reveal dedicated Turing crypto mining cryptocurrency mining cards in March what I find that very hard to believe and this is even this is a little confusing given rumors about ampere which is supposedly locked and loaded and ready to replace and videos current gaming based cards on the Pascal architecture so right now it's pretty unclear what the crap is going on over there and they're pretty good about keeping these things private so yeah I think everyone's initial thought was that Volta was gonna come to everything but this may be the generation that Nvidia not only so it was only recently even that they started doing a different die even for the data center parts but this may be the generation where we get a completely different architecture for the data center parts very interesting this is pretty huge way mo gets okay for first driverless ride-hailing service Wow alphabets way mo so that that Google parent company got a permit in late January from the Arizona Department of Transportation to operate as a transportation network company this allows way Mo's fleet of driverless chrysler pacifica minivans to pick up and drop off paying riders in Arizona through a smartphone app or website that will compete with uber and lyft so Google alphabet that group kind of is directly competing with uber and lyft now Wow the service will initially have thousands of cars prices could be competitive given those there's no driver to pay and so last year they started a free early rider program in the Arizona Capitol where hundreds of people used a lame-o app to Hale and use cars within a hundred square mile radius in November they began testing vehicles and parts of the city without a driver at the wheel I kind of suspect that in Fast business a lot yeah well I and another interesting thing here is my brain went to okay so it's got to be cheaper cuz no driver then I was like okay but they cycle through the vehicles really fast because it's a lot of wear on them to drive literally all day but then they can almost definitely just move the driverless tech from vehicle the route vehicle so they'll have to swap out like engines and vans and stuff yeah they can probably just move over a lot if not all of the automated driving tech so that's interesting that could be way cheaper Google could come in and just be like this is the better option I mean you don't have to worry about when you're in Las Vegas and you're going to Las Vegas Convention Center your driver ends up being like super racist and super sexist that was incredible you heard about that I did hear about that so I'm then um hold on a second hey max are you over there cool can I tell about your awful cabbie or do you want to tell people about your awful cabbie okay okay so so basically max is in this okay and the driver starts going off about here we go women drivers right Asian drivers Canadians I mean Italians there wasn't there one more French Canadians Asians Canadians women Italians wasn't young people young young women especially 25 year olds explicitly managed managed I think there was more to racist sexist or otherwise prejudiced comments about five things all of which max is either is somewhere from fifty to a hundred percent all in the span of what n to fifteen minute drive look at what yeah it wasn't even and not only started like halfway through like he was working through he was on a mission and the best thing about this sort of um depending on your perspective like if you appreciate the ironic use of the word best the best thing about it is that it was even pointed out that Max was oh yeah young female Asian Canadian half Italian yeah Wow and like clearly no one in the car was down with the conversation frosty universe says sounds like he comments on YouTube videos yeah sounds about right but yeah one of the terrifying things is if they start doing these ride-sharing apps they'll gather obscene amount of data of like how driving works on automated driving and stuff so if this becomes a thing it's gonna massively advance all the rest of it grow exponentially yeah yeah and like the transport industry is huge the United people that work in the transport industry is huge and there's certain parts of transport industry that'll hold for a little while longer oh yeah well you'll still need to be maintained yeah yeah and like certain specific thing like very high like black car and limo might still have a person because being served by a person like having someone come out and open your door and all I can stuff might be nice so people that are like super ballin might still pay for that and very specialized transport stuff I'm sure will still be covered but a to be driving someone says it's not hate speech if you hate everyone well there's actually a couple of other pretty ridiculous comments here first of all max is a stupid Nate who names a girl max names Maxine I expect better from the twitch chat and no I don't never mind mom have you recall someone Bob yeah their full name is very likely not Bob yeah it's bobert all right and so moving on to what we've got on Flo playing this week yeah I think we're gonna do someone watching named Bob Byrd I'm sorry bubbles down the show pretty quick here cuz I think I'm pretty much done all right what do we got over there um ooh we've got the home pod versus the Google home max I watched the very end of this gold uh yes the very end is definitely gold we've got the job posting that I think is actually up on YouTube now so we're hiring again I'm in snowboarding and the guy that got me my equipment was like I want to apply i applied in the past i didn't make it is for the writers catchment thing oh yeah he's like but i'm here i want to apply again i'm like dude we're hiring soon yeah there it is yeah uh this is a good video you guys are gonna like it our review sample cpu's cherry-picked  viewers say Epis one retail chip engineer example which one performs better and we did both Intel and Andy have you talked about like the history of this though yep okay Oh like in the video we did because it's happened I don't know what the results of this are I haven't seen it but liquid metal laptop cooling 20 degrees cooler that's really cool no lies what the crap is floating-point performance everyone talks about it a lot of people I'm not gonna say most people you know what most people have no idea what it is written to programming at the same time panic attack under 100 mostly gaming there's actually some really cool stuff this is a credit card sized game console it's literally in your in your wallet that's cool um else we got here alright that's most of it oh yeah Oh 120 Hertz PC gaming on a TV still isn't up so that'll go up pretty soon and I think that pretty much wraps it up alright so we will see you again next week same bat-time same bat-channel oh boy now to consume more vaping yep [Music] so many people think bingo yeah all right please man when we don't have like big technical streams in when we 
so when Royal Caribbean reached out asking to sponsor a piece on the technology they're building into their cruise liners my initial reaction was like what am I gonna say about navigation systems then I looked at the list of high-tech ship features that they were going to be showing off hydrogen fuel cell power systems facial recognition and Mark Asian VR dessert bar wait what and then I promptly boarded a plane for New York [Music] okay so some of the text they covered in the keynote did actually end up being ship stuff like how they're using augmented reality to overlay navigation information during adverse weather conditions and how by using computer modeling to change the hull shape they were able to reduce drag through the water by about 5 percent improving the ship's fuel economy and reducing its environmental impact then they moved into the open source platform that Royal Caribbean is contributing to that's designed for much faster innovation in the industry as a whole now on the surface this future app that's part of it has the ability to see and book cruises view a map of the ship and book excursions and activities which is pretty standard hey we've got an app fair but if you dig a little deeper you honor them incredible functionality a digital concierge will understand and answer common questions guests to guests shipwide messaging is built-in so you can avoid incurring SMS roaming charges and to help coordinate meetups and scheduling shipwide multi deck location tracking makes it simple to see like where the kids are hanging out or if the reason that you can't find each other is that you're actually at the same end of the ship but on different decks and then comes the really next-level stuff Royal Caribbean will be using machine learning to look at factors like your past preferences demographics your travel companions and your schedule to recommend activities during time slots when you're available so if you're dining with the inlaws it might suggest a nice red wine pairing rather than a vodka soda and the central component of this more open ecosystem is the bring your own device concept so no more clunky NFC bracelets just install the app snap a selfie scan your luggage when you embark and you walk on board the facial recognition cameras will authenticate you based on the picture that you just took which brings us to the deck of the ship complete with clouds that actually ended up looking more like giant sheep suspended from wires but uh a +4 effort you guys and where we get to the real reason that I would be willing to allow an app to know where I am on the ship at all times now they're still evaluating different technologies for how to do it most reliably but the demo that they did tonight here allowed me to just fire up the app click a drink monitor the real-time status like what then about a minute later someone shows up hands me the drink and takes off if that is not the future of pampering I don't know what is and augmented reality was another big talking point here as I mentioned before it's already in use for navigation but it's also got some more entertaining uses so guests waiting to embark can play augmented reality games and on the deck you'll actually be able to point your phone at these kinds of picture frames and they'll give you an x-ray vision like experience into the real time inner workings of the ship with live views available of places like the galley where the food's being prepared the bridge the engine room and more now not everything they demoed here necessarily has a firm rollout time but there were some other really cool concept level things with virtual dining as the standout for me using HTC vibes with front-facing cameras for hand presence they had us try three different food morsels in front of us that were also being tracked by the cameras so the VR dining experience would actually know what you're eating and then adjust the visuals to match now obviously it's pretty first gen right now but I can imagine that as VR headsets get lighter and less clunky taking a bite of ice cream for instance and watching snow begin to fall or biting into something spicy and being transported to a scorching desert would be pretty cool obviously I wouldn't eat three meals a day like that but as an experience it was utterly unique and everyone walking out thought it was a ton of fun next we wrote the automated shuttle so cool this was actually my first time in a fully driverless vehicle and headed into the future stateroom showcase so rooms like this will be rolling out over the next year as you walk in the room welcomes you opening the curtains and setting the mood with some lights even displaying a message on screen if you're let's say celebrating a special occasion with your cruise and then everything in here including the air conditioning can be controlled via the built-in touch controls through your phone from anywhere on the ship or good night in the case of certain functions like scene lighting with your voice a standout feature for me was the support though for both chromecast and Apple TV because I am exactly the kind of person who would want to bring my own content with me on a trip that's fantastic the stateroom concept room took mood lighting one step further with displays built into or projected onto the ceiling and the floor allowing you to go to sleep to the sights and sounds of a clear starry sky or a tropical storm if that suits your fancy although we don't have an ETA for those to be rolled out after that we rode the shuttle one more time arriving at the hydrogen fuel cell power unit from Ballard that it turns out was actually using the 150 kilogram hydrogen storage trailer in the parking lot to run many of the demos we saw today including the Robo screens and the immersion tunnel so the box on top here is about one-third fuel cell stack along with some accompanying components like the safety mechanism and fuel delivery system and a humidifier that actually recirculates some of the waste moisture to keep the whole unit operating at an optimal humidity level then down below we get a filtered air intake a compressor that's actually an automotive supercharger that's been modified by the manufacturer for peak reliability the cooling system which captures the heat from the exothermic fuel cell reaction and would normally use seawater in this heat changer to dissipate it along with a waste reservoir that ends up collecting pure water that on a ship then could be added to the drinking water supply saving energy for the high powered desalination units that cruise ships normally rely on entirely so thanks to Royal Caribbean for bringing us out to New York to cover this cool event and thanks to

so when it comes to computers there's your performance your size and your quietness and the general rule is you can pick two so you can have a really powerful small PC that sounds like a quadcopter under load or you can have a powerful silent thing that takes up your entire desk that is until today Compu lab claims to have hit the trifecta and this is the air top a small and powerful and completely silent gaming grade machine this video is brought to you by Mack Weldon Mack Weldon believes in smart design premium fabrics and simple shopping use offer code tectus and get 20% off your next order at the link below [Music] compared to other passive computers that we've seen in the past the Compu lab err top is tiny but that doesn't mean that it's lacking in features it's actually got more i/o than some full-size desktops that we've looked at including a total of seven display outputs and three serial ports if you're into that and it doesn't mean that it's light fully loaded the err top is close to 14 pounds and there's a good reason for that covering both sides of the machine are these thick heatsink fins that are somehow supposed to dissipate all of the heat that's created by the impressive internals like seriously inside this thing there is a workstation option with pro grade stuff but our G model sports an Intel Core i7 7700 and NVIDIA GTX 1060 32 gigs of ram and a total of 3 terabytes of solid-state storage but it has no fans how does it stay cool I don't know but it does after 2 hours of full synthetic load our processor only reached 70 degrees Celsius with our GPU reaching a warm but totally acceptable 80 degrees and the casing didn't get too hot to touch either and this is cool if you ever concerned about how toasty things are getting there's a handy-dandy display on the front of the computer that can show you your CPU temps your CPU clock speed and a bunch of other useful stuff although it should be noted that the GPU temp sensor does not seem to be very accurate and there are some other imperfections as well our CPU did not turbo very hard or for very long staying at around 3.3 gigahertz for the majority of our tests which raise the question is this going to hurt its performance in games well because games typically don't utilize all four course the way that a stress test would it actually managed to stay around 4.1 gigahertz throughout our testing and only reached about 45 degrees running 3dmark times now it did still lose to our open-air bench that had the same specs but it was only just by a little bit like we can see right here our GPU clock is at over 1800 megahertz even though we're running passive cooling okay so at this point in the video we could just say it's magic neat huh but that is not the LTTE way so we've got our workspace ready and our tools out preparing for a complicated teardown process to find out just how this thing really it's bad easy okay so then with the panel open there were a few things that we noticed in here number one is that the inside is separated into two thermal zones so the right cooling plate makes contact with the CPU which is on the opposite side of the motherboard and also through this thermal pad that's revealed under the drive cage handles cooling for the up to oh and by the way that's the second thing we notice for the up to seven drives that you can put in this thing a single PCIe X 2 m dot 2 2 PCIe x4 M 2 s and up to 4 2 and a half inch SATA drives then while you're in there you can throw in a Wi-Fi card here a SIM card here another SIM card here a microSD a mini PCIe card and up to 64 gigs of standard-size memory Wow it's got a lot of expansion leading us to the last thing we noticed the GTX 1060 graphics card other than having non-standard mounting holes that appear to have been drilled through the PCB and a resaw turned 6 pin power connector that is now 4 pins is just an off-the-shelf EVGA card meaning that theoretically you could upgrade it in the future if you found a physically compatible board or you could actually just remove the side panel with the GPU attached and replace it with a next-gen wall something that they plan on selling as an upgrade any since we're looking at the video card let's finally get to how this cooling system works this massive hunk of copper makes contact with the GPU and has a large heat pipe underneath it this heat pipe is on top of another heat pipe that spreads across two more heat pipes which go over almost the whole area of the side panel allowing the entire thing to efficiently dissipate heat once hot these square channels cause natural convection moving the heat energy away from the computer so once all is said and done each side is capable of dissipating about a hundred watts for a total of 200 it's well thought out and well executed and the way it's built makes it feel more like a a piece of equipment and less like a computer but of course with great engineering comes great cost and the air top is no exception with our config coming in at an eye-watering 3700 u.s. dollars now if you can deal with a bit less storage and memory the gtx 1060 model can be had for as little as 2,500 which given the low volume and highly customized nature of this product seems reasonably fair so then if you're looking for a gaming machine that can deliver a solid v are capable experience or a powerhouse workstation that is small enough to carry in a shoulder bag and is completely silent the compy lab our top looks like a great choice then again if all of that sounds pretty good but you still want more than currently in the works is the inferno a similar passively cooled gaming system this time with a 7700 K and a freaking GTX 1080 although before that goes into production they're gonna be gauging interest with Kickstarter which is probably a good idea given the presumably very small audience with that kind of exact requirements and the money for it but you

nice it's the window Ryan so everyone who's playing banjo bingo out there space you're welcome we didn't give it home last week yeah I know we were on time last weekend I got the least amount of like success screenshots sent to my Twitter last week any other week because I think people are used to getting that free spot terrible um so yeah we've had a really interesting week can we do floatplane news can we tell people what's gonna happen next week I want it to just happen it's actually I forgot to ask you in our little meeting I wanted to ask you how we were gonna deal with it in terms of communication so is this how you want it I want two people to know you want a pre now I want to tell the people tell the people but what if it doesn't work then they're gonna know that we told them what our plan was and that our plan ultimately fell through which will be a huge surprise to only a very small percentage of them okay that's very well we plan on launching the what is going on here I don't know I just no one's supposed to touch this set between Friday you did I didn't replace some monitor I spent a while be like what is wrong with the Saturday I didn't replace the monitor okay I just took the monitor I did not actually put a new one there literally no actually that was actually not true right but what you corrected me with was worse anyways next week sometime on Wednesday let's say definitely by Thursday although time zones so who knows but sometime on Wednesday for sure so if you check too early it might not be there but whatever sometimes do it I just liked watching you freak out uh we're launching the Alpha of the floatplane website meaning you'll be able to sign up for an account directly through that website you'll be able to pay for it with credit card that's new you won't be able to pay for it with PayPal which is hilarious if you want you to PayPal you have to go back it do the four that will be fixed brain trees being really good people in case anyone from Braintree is watching we need to stay on their good side yeah um so right now just credit card and you'll be able to watch videos there you'll be able to comment won't be able to reply to people a little get rekt that'll come but yeah this will be the first time that you'll be able to do everything on the new website you won't need form integration you can just go there pay for a subscription watch there all that kind of stuff so to everyone out there who said that floatplane was never gonna launch because Luke's an ID MN and also it's a bad idea so that you know compounded the issue in their minds and also that the way that we recruited developers was really dumb making a video and then publishing it on a tech channel super dumb so in response to everyone who ever said anything about that I got this for you and demonetised this is why we need floatplane yeah uh oh let's roll the intro yeah [Music] we should replace my part instead of like clenching in the thing that should be like flying and then like something goes wrong and then I'm able to land on the water you know yeah floatplane the site where middle fingers are totally allowed yeah it's completely because they're totally okay then yeah nobody nobody's gonna mind all right so technically yeah oh oh oh okay so this is interesting do we want to jump right into the Intel discrete GPU we can or considering we're talking about flow plating right now we can just talk about what's on full plane right now it's up to you oh we need that later up to you sir I wasn't listening because I was checking my notes I have I have some notes from dr. Contras my favorite writer over at a non tech yeah about this topic so I'm just gonna jump into it I didn't hear what you said and I'm sorry it's cool hosted by 2004 thanks um are you gonna do quit done the original article hears from tech power up intel unveils discrete GPU prototype development yeah so it wasn't that long ago that AMD made a high profile hire Roger koduri AMD's former head of Radeon technologies group but clearly so there's a there's a bunch of stuff here so there's like there's like this got like a block diagram which is really interesting there's what looks like sort of a mock-up of what a die shop might look like like there's a bunch of what looks like very internal information and a lot of people are extrapolating a bunch of information about the suppose it 14 nanometer dedicated GPU and so dr. cutter is actually proactively because ian do you really not you know believe in our fact-checking makes point where we would you know dig through all these diagrams and figure out the misinterpretation that other sites you know might have accidentally made here do you really not believe that we're capable of that I appreciate it because you know thank you for covering our butts because we were not capable of that he proactively reached out because he was sure that we were going to talk about this and I'm just gonna read it I'm not gonna read it because he put it better than I could have it's almost like he's a professional writer or something just wanted to poke about the Intel discrete GPU hullaballoo that's been going around this week that might end up in Rancho Everywhere is quoting it as a discrete GPU prototype but that is because of a slight miss reading of the Japanese article source okay leave it to dr. coutras to figure to pick out the slight miss reading of the Japanese article while it uses Intel graphics the chip is actually a test design for a better dynamic voltage frequency system implementation applicable to a wide range of chips view GPU and FPGA it was done in a GPU core because it was an easy design on 14 nanometer to start with the Japanese article from which the translation comes when Auto translated does state that it's a discrete GPU prototype but the author of who's very very well respected and knowledgeable go to San clarifies this point in the second paragraph by seeing it was only a vehicle for was actually being announced and tested and the fact that it was built on the GPU was inconsequential okay so basically no in the well I don't know has it been two months since Roger got higher didn't tell no in the last however many weeks it's been he has not built a GPU yeah necessarily yeah you might have I don't know he's kind of amazing but um he has not and this is like some power and clock management stuff that might end up in that GPU but might not but probably would but might not it sounds like Raja and whatever team he has is probably just playing so so yeah there you go this is yeah like it like it says test vehicle not a future product it sounds like they're just playing around so let's go through our notes with all of that in mind let's go through the notes that we had based on other tech press is reporting the first 14 nanometer dedicated GPU prototype is a two chip solution the first contains the GPU itself in the system agent the second is an FPGA that interfaces with the system bus it's 1.5 billion transistors so in videos GP 102 is built on 16 nanometer and has 12 billion but but keep in mind none of this really matters yes because yeah and following media speculation about the slides until I stated that they presented a research paper exploring new circuit techniques optimized for power management and actually you know what kudos to James he had it right he had all the clarifications in here it is a test vehicle only not a future product us much ado hold involved you guys can see James's notes credit to James good job James good job James good job James you'll you'll you know whether you like it or not you'll have to work here another day because you're not allowed to leave actually wait no no James I have not added James to my soul collection yet that's that's my internal joke as soon as people buy a house and get a mortgage then I kind of cackle and I go like see Brenda Brendan's listening yeah that's right Brandon you know what's up you guys know what I don't own yet there's many reasons why but yeah but I would like to to be correct yeah yeah so ha ha ha Brandon says he hates me and just make in case the microphone didn't pick it up we're just getting that out that gives you my soul if I wasn't an American have you been to Brandon's place yet yes super nice it is actually releasing hey did you notice the amount of like random little storage Abbi things I think have unique it's probably less than it feels like it probably feel like a lot to you cuz I know your place has like none closet yeah don't don't give me that none it has a closet it has a closet it has a closet that also has the central vac and oh no that doesn't care you can't put anything in there I'm talking about under the stairs yeah I'm talking about under the stairs is that where the central vac is oh yeah yeah there's technically closet door yeah so yeah so compared to Luke's place yeah but I think Brandon's gonna run out of storage but what I like about it is that Brandon how much can I talk about your place okay cool um so unlike other town houses what's really cool about it is it's a little bit wider so it doesn't feel yeah as much like living on a ship or like yeah like in a sliver yeah yeah yeah like it feels more like like like the rooms feel more square instead of like every room had to be kind of like like put in front of the other room and like kind of made it like a me a row of them and and it even has it has side by side parking yep which is sick for a town house it was it was weird when I went in it when I went to go park there that if you want to park in the driveway you don't fit but then there is also side by side parking and like a really nice garage and he's right next to the visitor parking which is super cool it's literally right there sense and there's more coming in apparently there's like six more visitor spots coming in soon so yeah it's it's it's pretty nice it's it's pretty dope there's I like it a lot there's at least three different places that you could put a BBQ and you'd be out there barbecuing and you'd feel pretty good about it so you know that's an important thing that that is an important metric is it not someone randomly posted in here lioness fact of the day Linus was born in western Pennsylvania before moving to Canada at the age of five sure let's go with that um nice so so I don't remember where I was going with this but Brandon's house is sweet and I got to see it did we get there I don't know and that's the beauty of this show the bane of this show oh no you're talking about James and capturing his soul oh yeah I haven't captured his soul yet yeah but I have captured quite a few souls now I'm feeling pretty good about it it's like you you guys you guys can't leave me think about it like a mortgage it is it's like it's like basically getting married it's it's like I think it's like potentially more hard yeah I think it's actually more difficult to get out of than a marriage if you isn't that crazy now if we think about sort of the traditional values of of marriage even that applicable anymore which well no no I just mean but no look if we go back to back to the whole till death do us part let's focus on that part like if we call that sort of the the tradition of of marriage wow it's really eroded a lot oh yeah point where like 50% fail or something I I don't I don't know what it is but like we take a mortgage a car lease like I think it's it's pretty hard to break a car lease isn't it like you can't just be like yeah you know um Northshore Auto Group and I have irreconcilable differences about 40 to 50 percent of married couples in the United States divorce to be fair that what is also in that percentage is people that have been divorced more than once right so it's not like yeah it's not so it could be one person who's done it four times right they all four of those goes in but it is technically four different like so like I was looking at some gun ownership statistics in the United States I think they have more than one gun per person but I forget what they call the mega owners yeah super owners yeah they have like a hundred yes and it's like some very small percentage or something like that so like mega divorces yeah my I don't think I'm gonna have more than a hundred but like yeah more than a hundred divorces would be that would be in a cult Guinness would get that would legitimately be difficult to pull off could you do it could you do it with unwitting women oh god you convinced the worst reality TV show yeah actually the worst one such a plague on society that would be really difficult to be able to cobble watching so if you and I went okay we go we go into it's gonna be near to 200 we go to a new city every year okay and the idea is to get married and divorced as many times as possible in that year and they're gonna have to pull but remember you you so there's nothing would prevent you if you're a devious enough bastard nothing would prevent you from rolling multiple multiple marriages at once yeah well I don't think you can legally be married to two people at the same time No so so you would have to like timegate you would have to manage it really carefully well cuz you you'd had a minimum you have to do two a year oh yeah oh yeah because the timespan that you'd actually be effectively able to do this yeah yeah at minimum at minimum lion-like theoretically you're gonna have to pull more than that yeah I'd watch this show I would I'd feel like a terrible Purcell anybody i watch no exactly yeah yeah I'm saying it now because it doesn't exist but like playboy wars that's a suggestion from my AV guy oh man Wow and you should have okay you can have two different shows going on at the same time because you should have the marriage wars of the guys trying to do it and you should have the girls trying to do it yeah guys versus girls you know what we'd be at such a disadvantage I think so I I have but who knows like maybe not because it might be harder to convince a guy to marry you oh and then there's like the bisexual in a gay aspect right right oh man we're like you might be able to spend more because of how that community works and like whatever else okay so just it's like not that it matters but both Luke and I are straight yeah um answer me this if it meant that in a spirit of winning the condition you know maybe how can positive ask oh it it depends on see if we could I know you do almost anything almost anything yeah especially if it's against you looks like any well no but if you knew that I was higher numbers and you were like right beside me if we're at like 90 and we're both at like 90 if I've gone this whole competition and it just needs that much more to win like I'd consider it alright so I'm already that much giant jerk I'm trying to not swear so this yeah oh yeah you're a terrible person terrible person already um what's one more bead that is against your thing yeah I don't know yeah you're already horrible yeah so like does it matter if you're destroying women or men at that point that's what I mean yeah and like it's another lie so this is not a good show no you know I don't know what the network is that does all the reality shows but if there's any execs watching don't do it please don't do this you know the crazy thing about it though is is it really any worse than something like The Bachelor having actors on it yeah well cuz okay if there has ever at any point been any one who participated in that show that wasn't purely an actor who actually like believed in it cuz you know when they're gonna do the red stuff okay so there was the one TV show and I believe it was the UK someone could correct me on this where they had a Talent Search show that was fake have you heard about that no and they particularly picked people that were terrible and kept pushing them through and then I don't think they televised any of it or something and then the very last episode they televised and had a live studio audience and they basically told them on stage like you're horrible and it was super awkward it was it was it's I don't remember the name of the show but you can watch the last episode on YouTube and it has a giant dislike bar because everyone's like wow this is rough for like on stage in front of an entire yeah that was called America an American superstar okay so it was an American show oh wow that's yeah it was it was rough in front of a whole audience and they play like her singing like it's it comes down to between a guy and a girl and the girl wins and they play like a whole montage of her singing and it's oh it's not good and then they're like yeah so we picked you because you are the worst person in this category and then like yeah we're still gonna give you the studio deal but like come on also we're gonna give you a bunch of money it's really rough and like even watching that it was like kind of soul destroying it's really it's really rough Wow okay yeah Wow okay uh let's go ahead and make you some tech news cuz like I'm just feeling kind of dirty right now WB superstar yeah I think that's it let it sit WB superstar yes this is it The WB's superstar USA yeah oh man okay 40% of users like to this show like it's it's not oh all right the winner reveals here we go let's see oh oh that's a shame okay so here we go for some reason I can't find which retailer it's listed on the Tom's Hardware article doesn't say but this was originally posted by TX underscore to underscore step on the forum Texas two-step ah or transmitter two-step um the coffee lake platform is finally being expanded up until now you've been limited to what the 8700 K the 8600 K and the 8400 all high performance six core parts wait I 586 oh here we go so there are three new parts that are coming and I 580 600 like an on K and oh is there an 8700 already there might be there's an i-5 8500 so an even lower end is this gonna be a six core part and then an i3 8300 apparently was already an i3 350k you know what I haven't actually paid that close attention to it I haven't been able to think of a very compelling reason to buy coffee lake if you aren't going for an eighty six hundred K or at least an 80 400 or up because like I don't know if the 80 350 K already existed because unless you were getting six cores on the mainstream platform you might as well just go for kb lake because the boards are cheaper if you're not getting an unlocked chip you do not need to get AZ 370 board what can I do for you I just I just AJ AJ just posted in the floatplane work chat saying that's why I don't move you won't get my soul if you if you buy a house and go back one I hate you a little bit - that still means I own your soul so good okay so these are meant to be paired with the upcoming budget oriented H 370 and B 360 boards Pro Vantage is apparently the retailer also lists it down clocked T versions of all of these processors for bulk purchase so neat in other news this was originally posted over on digi x auo to begin shipping 8k TV panels in the first half of this year you care no I thought you don't yeah you said it in such an excited like okay TV panel then I was like I don't think it's like okay you know pickin a so here's why you might care about an 8k panel and did it okay you sit here reason number one you sit very close reason number two you really like stereoscopic 3d shut up and you want your stereoscopic 3d to be at 4k because every other line would be effectively actually it would be a little little more because it would be double the resolution of 4k know half the resolute of it would be double the pixel count half the resolution sorry okay reason number the third that's a pretty creative number two I'm interested you really like um high-performance display scalar technology and you want high-risk shot up high refresh rate 4k displays okay so those scalars will have to be developed and built for these 8k TVs and eventually be able to wrinkle down reason number the fourth trying really hard here um you uh you you want pixel densities to keep climbing for mobile displays actually it's pretty different technology for you I don't think I want to complain about while I have a moment here and we're talking about panels yeah is I've been holding off I don't know if you remember like a year and a half ago when I was trying to buy a swift really great hold on yeah hold that thought people are talking about the Olympics like an 8k so funny because most of the feeds of the Olympics look like they're not even 720 yeah yeah yeah the CBC feeds are pretty good but yeah I think they're probably about seven twenty but they're pretty good the yeah I wanted to buy Swift like a year and a half ago issue the new monitor my monitors right now we'll just black screen for one two three seconds at a time yeah yeah randomly okay cuz they're dying yeah I've had them for quite a while it's okay yeah you've had them since like the NCIX tech tips days yeah okay yeah they're doing it okay yeah yeah it's it's a little early I think but like it's early in the they lasted a long time range so it's fine but yeah I've needed a new monitor for a while because they're black screening on me like that pretty and I'll be the worst thing is like if I'm playing counter-strike and the screen goes black and then I get flash bang and you're dead well it's yeah cuz so screen goes black and I'm like crap I need to like hide and wait for the one two three seconds that my screen is black and then I come back in and someone's flash back to me so I'm like first of all pure black to extreme white now I'm just like oh goodness still can't see ya just need to wait it's it's terrible so anyways I've been waiting for that a sous monitor that I saw it see not this year but your previously the 144 Hertz 4k it has every buzzword you could ever want it still not out I would be shocked if it hasn't landed in the next couple months oh.just that's I'm not gonna say what I know but I'll say that I would be shocked okay reason number five okay everyone is making me say it pornography like three pixels to the width of every pubic hair nobody is asking for this nobody you know I think you're asking for this you're not asking for that at a certain point it's better to leave it up to the imagination to it like just a little bit okay and speaking of imagination I can imagine that it's gonna be tough for a Colton to assign sponsors ever

hungry right now Savage tricked the box of jerky is so heavy I can't lift it I thought it'd just rip again I'm gonna have to pace myself on the maple buffalo bacon I had an entire pack last week during the show and after writing you were munch on it after oh I was munching the heck out of that after the show what do you want this week I'm down just want the traditional sure I'm gonna do the cracked pepper and sea salt that actually sounds pretty good but I'll go something else okay sounds good just don't touch my maple buffalo bacon and we're good no it's fine you know what traditional oh there we go Oh in the new package Lulu new package for there's no perfect so savage jerky mmm their goal was to create a snack made with the best ingredients without nitrates or preservatives that wasn't bad for you but that was full of flavor and spice I'm like drooling right now like actually really excited not drooling salivating but it hasn't come out of my mouth so it's not drool yet I guess we've got 13 different flavors of jerky some of our personal favorites are the maple buffalo meat bacon the Moho the I like the cracked pepper and sea salt I don't think you're as big a fan of this one but Luke loves the traditional I'm not as into the traditional you get depends kind of like what what mode am in and then if you have a fire hall that lives like in your mouth then and you're into the like really spicy stuff they've got all kinds of flavors for you everything from Carolina Reapers to ghost peppers to like truly spicy friggin jerky and they don't just have jerky they do a spice rub they've got barbecue sauce hot sauce I haven't tried their hot sauce I should actually try it I I love hot sauce they've never seen pesto sauce yeah fishy give us give us that hook there Carolina Reaper hot sauce uses one of the hottest peppers in the world so go check it out at Jeanne dot us apparently Savage turkey calm yeah just go to savage turkey calm andrew's offer code LTT there we go easy all right so what else what else we want to talk about today oh yeah it's kind of interesting hopefully um can we do this one first no fight yeah I just want to forget ah this was originally posted by monkey biz Oh nine eighty five on the forum the original article here is from BBC com are we gonna ignore the no let's just use the name cuz I mean that's right here yeah Kylie Jenner is apparently so over snapchat and their shares tumble single handedly with evidently a single tweet okay well 1.3 billion dollars was wiped off of snap stock market value after she tweeted that she is no longer using yeah yeah go ahead you go first I'm gonna add a couple one it jumps right before the fall and it also looks like a somewhat natural pattern fall and there's bigger dips here that's not even the main one but what's interesting about it is just that it happens instantly oh sure yeah also there's been a lot of doubt sewn around snapchat for a while now and you can see they're trending down they're super trending down like to be clear guys this is only the last five days and like all of this concatenated into one date like that's sorry that's almost a straight line to yeah and like Marquez recently had I think you released a whole video about like leaving snapchat or not liking snapchat or something yeah let's see can I talk about problem number two actually okay so problem number two is like why do people care that much what this okay you know what no I get it okay I cared about Marquez is a prominent influencer isn't using a social platform your snapchat 1.7 million views that's from two weeks ago weeks ago no I know but I'm saying there's been a lot of doubts own okay whatever you might think or not think about Keeping Up with the Kardashians or whatever you can't argue that they've been successful at exploiting social media so if they are like not if they've so over snapchat then that does actually seem relevant from a shareholder perspective problem number the last for me is why did anyone ever give a crap about snapchat I don't get it this is now I've disliked it the entire time this is now two platforms that I have just not really gotten and I've had a lot of people putting pressure on me because I'm supposed to be in the social media space these are two platforms now vine and snapchat but I've just like not really gotten that have ultimately ended up disappearing and I haven't had to participate in them yeah I bought into Twitter Facebook and Instagram not like I don't own chairs I mean like I was like YouTube obviously as well but like those are the ones that I kind of went yeah okay I'll invest the time to bother to develop these things and like learn how they work and stuff yeah um those two didn't get it as far as I could tell snapchats entire value was trendiness and it means that as soon as you're not trendy where's your value yeah and somebody that someone in the twitch chat said nudes and like even then that doesn't really make any sense you just send nudes by email like I don't understand what's the special value well yeah well part of the idea was that it would disappear but since forever everyone's known that you can just screenshot a record course and I do not realize that yeah really I think people didn't but that's volatile and now if you screenshot a record it tells the person so now it like sends them a message saying that you screenshot it so now it's just like kind of awkward I think I don't know you're preaching to the choir a little bit I've never liked snapchat to any degree the only reason why I have it right now is my brother sends me random things every once in a while because he prefers snapchat okay and that's about it huh how else am I gonna send my nudes says elusive soul any other that you can literally even send them through Instagram direct message okay okay we've got a perfect segue into your flow plain stuff citizen something citizen I am something something does flow plain work in the UK yeah that thing you told me today oh yeah pull up what's on there and you go ahead and talk about that cuz that's pretty cool we have a viewer I didn't even know you read that message I thought you did we have a viewer from Antarctica and it works Wow you had a payment problem which is unsurprising but but it works which is great favorite problem has been solved yeah so we can see we can see a map of wherever he just told me but yeah okay you can see that too it's really cool because the audience is shockingly global it's a very distributed yeah which is cool and scary cuz we have to solve it what do we got here oh there's some good stuff in here who needs more CPU cores this is finally going up Wow so this is kind of an explainer of core i7 versus cry 9 as you can tell it isn't sponsored um liquid metal in a phone is this the first I believe ok yeah yeah yeah so the follow up the follow up to liquid metal in a laptop it's actually shocking I was gonna say this might even be more interesting for a lot of people yeah the one year airflow experiment the stunning conclusion is apparently missing a proper thumbnail so I'll go hit someone after the show but that's up it's done it's ready wow that's a lot of views yeah um wow there's a lot of discussion too but um buying selling and safely storing Bitcoin mining adventure part 4 is up so we go through some of the wallet options some of the exchange options just kind of help the whole twitch chat is flipping out that we finally are releasing the air finally happening it's on to a plane now yep you can go watch it right now Compu loud isn't a brand that most people will probably have heard of but this product is very cool it is a passively cooled small form-factor gaming machine with a GTX 10 60 or 70 I think it's a 10 60 maybe 10 70 I'll remember it's really good though um oh no that went up on that went up on YouTube that mapping you think we're probably YouTube's range now I think we're probably yeah yeah there might be maybe something left oh I don't know if handy tak under 100 mostly gaming went up on YouTube maybe you did it oh yeah oh yeah 120 hertz pc gaming on a TV still hasn't youtube so um the reason for that is that when we're scheduling it's a lot easier to push something by a week then it is to push something by a day and so for whatever reason we have a simultaneous release that we have to do on a day when something scheduled it usually gets bumped like the same day the following week and i think it's happened about 1/2 way it'll come yeah it'll come alright what else we got today yeah Wow apparently snap CEO was paid six hundred and thirty seven million last year thought to be the third highest annual package ever received by a company CEO so this is in spite of them being under pressure for Instagram like taking all their key features and users complaining about the redesign brilliant as much as we can as fast as possible I know right personally pull it all out personally yeah yeah um Samsung speaking of which the SAS auction was a lot of fun yeah do you want to talk about it are we gonna leave it in the video so there's actually gonna be two of you okay I don't know if people even knew that what's happening yeah you should so NCIX had their bankruptcy auction on Wednesday and Thursday of this week so I had gone in intending to make one video but honestly it would be like a service yeah okay or that we would have to cut too much or it would be too long and it's two different days even and it is what makes sense it is across two days I had also intended for it to be like really structured here's some stuff we found here's some stuff we bought here's how much we paid SIA and what it really turned into was more like me and Eddie digging around the warehouse and like finding relics like I found a computer that I built that's what yeah in the warehouse yeah do you remember the one with the flames YES on it yeah that still has the original build that I did in it like eight years ago and it was just like sitting in a pile in the warehouse I really wanted to go just for that kind of reason like I wanted to go back to the original filming room and stuff mm-hmm but like I just I didn't have the time it was it was pretty it was pretty fun it was sentimental yeah you know there was some funny stuff I'll get my sentimentality out of the video there there was some kind of sad stuff like I come across like the box of sort of her stuff to work with everyday like her gloves and like you know personal effects not personal effects company effects but that like her box of like stuff that she needed by her scanning station for like someone who's really nice and that worked there a long time and worked hard and was as far as I could tell a very nice good person and just doesn't have a job anymore because of mismanagement yeah so there was like some sad stuff um there's some random stuff at one point ed and I leave the auction and we go play squash did you his film that yeah I've never tried squash before which of course is a perfectly legitimate reason to be playing squash definitely when you're supposed to be at work yeah video totally um so no one at flow plate is allowed to absorb that mentality hooray all right yeah you're moving forward so anyway it ends up being two vlogs a vlog for day one of like digging through everything cuz that was when they had the viewing time when you were allowed to go in and like pick through all the different auction Lots yeah and then part two where we attend the actual auction I tried you know what no I'm not gonna talk about it oh yeah we should partly talk about alt X that's pretty cool that's oh yeah LTX is happening right um yeah so where we actually go to the auction we you know do auction things we leave the auction we run into Julia at all what's that cafe called it starts with a Z I think he is yeah we run into Juliet Xia's who talked about like the stuff that people are buying probably being broken you know she's doing now yeah she said I makes computer shop yeah yeah she's like back on YouTube so yeah there you go yeah so she was very she wasn't tacky about it when when she well sometimes people will go on camera and would be like hi yeah you guys might remember me from NCIX tech tips I'm with Mike's computer shop now go see Mike's computer shop no she was very good about it so that's that's why Julia gets the shoutout for being at Mike's computer shop on the one show right now yeah yep yeah good good good for him good for him you know what did you wanna talk about alright LTX so yes we know we know LTX Expo is redundant yeah but like you guys go find a 7 character dot-com domain I challenge you that's right that's what I thought there's good there's gonna be a lot of responses yeah we'll just find like I'll be pretty dumb yeah so we got a bunch of information here um I don't know if we have any partners yet so that's probably not probably empty yep well hey course there's in cool also though this is last year all my partners I told me really needs to put that on another page but yeah that's really terrible or just not anywhere yeah just probably shouldn't be there or like it should be smaller or something yeah it's freaking huge um yeah that probably doesn't make a ton of sense but yeah we got you know partners we got a map map and schedules nope oh that's coming soon too there's a really helpful website so it's good that it's subject to change because if it wasn't gonna change it was just coming soon forever then that would be bad yeah okay hold on a second so here's an event map coming soon but you can download it nope nope that just takes you back so it was built on Squarespace but it was built by monkeys so it goes to show you Squarespace beautiful website but you actually still do have to like it still looks good yeah it looks good and it's fast gallery oh so here's ago so a lot of people thought that LTX was just like small or lame or whatever and it was a little small it was a little lame but it was actually a lot of fun uh-huh we had an absolute blast last year so here's a bunch of the stuff from from last year a bunch of the stuff that people could do this year not Schilling legitimately one of my favorite conventions in years this one is gonna be a lot more emphasis on the like the one piece of feedback we got from people was that they could come in for two hours they could kind of do everything so the idea this year is it's a one-day event and we want to make it so that it's basically impossible to do everything hmm cool so every booth needs to have enough to see or do that you can't do everything and one of the other things that this was an external feedback but one of the other things that we thought that we needed to improve was there there was a lot of stuff to do at LTX to the point where it would actually take you all day if you were to try every carnival game and yeah and and participate in everything but there wasn't much of an incentive so I think a lot of people ended up kind of like crowding into a corner and like chatting with each other or whatever else sorry oh yeah we could figure that out anyway um so a lot of people ended up kind of not doing everything and then we ended up giving away a ton of like prizes randomly at the end in a raffle so this time cool there's gonna be like mondo prizes for like going on the bungee run or for throwing cases as far as you can or whatever else the case may be and I think I'm gonna do like the Explorers pass this is a new hand in the Explorers past for a ticket for the raffle and the Explorers passing us to get stamped at all the different booths once you complete the activity oh that's interesting yeah that's a good idea - I've been to a lot of I was actually about to say one of the things that we should probably do is also enter people just for participating in lots of stuff so yeah that would be great that would be a lot of fun I like the combination of like if you get past a certain threshold like if you beat like 90% of people at this thing or whatever and at the beginning the day maybe it's easier yeah Colton was not in Colton's Intuit cool so it's good yeah we're gonna have a lot of fun so go to Lt axe Expo com to get very few details but you can get tickets though can't you I think you can get tickets right now because I heard the like big tickets already sold out really yeah I think so oh wow someone tweeted me saying that they're like they wanted it and now they're sad or something I don't know I sold that gang okay so in a nutshell we can't really tell you much about it but unlike last year where we were pretty tepid on the land show about sorry how much fun it would be it's gonna be fun this is really really fun this is a tag line okay we can't tell you much about it but it'll be fun trust us yeah you've got a much bigger venue this time we're gonna as someone who's gone to add a minimum one text slash gaming convention every single year for like 14 years or something yeah yeah it feels a little bit more like some of the older ones did where there was more stuff to do if you go to pax these days they're still really cool but they're mostly like a spectator sport kind of situation where you're mostly just like looking at things there isn't a lot of activity there's a lot to look at it takes like two hours to wait through a line to play a game that kind of stuff what I really liked about the last LTX and seems like it's gonna be a thing at this one and you even mentioned like there has to be enough stuff for people to do you didn't say see you said do it's it's fun because there's so many activities like I don't know if we're bringing it back but last year there was like hardline water tube bending and like all this really cool I think we're gonna have a deal is your CPU station see like that's friggin cool so we're hoping to partner with the local retailers so the idea is that you could bring your CPU and we'd have the tools on hand and someone to help you or or if you don't have one then we'll have a board and a test bench handy so you can like buy a new one and we'll have hopefully a retail partner so you can just buy it on the spot test it make sure it works because you'll void your warranty instantly yeah and then you could deal it it and take it home and use it that's pretty sick actually yeah so like we've got we've got ideas damn that's pretty cool there's some pretty good ideas we could this might get expensive oh well we could have some and people could buy it to use but we could have like a free geek CPUs for people just to like do it with probably you know nummy we've got some really good ideas with three geek um so you've seen be like boxes and boxes like the pallets of stripped motherboard PCBs right yeah do you know about this no okay so one of the ideas that we pitched to or at least are going to pitch to free geek at some point is motherboard house of cards and then over the course of the day whoever builds the tallest ya card house out of motherboard P stripped mother word PCBs wins a motherboard I don't know like we'll figure something out cool but yeah just like cool so it would be kind of like you know at like science world when there's just like it's not a booty that's just like a bunch of blocks to put together or whatever oh so you guys kind of walk up there's a little sign explaining what to do and you just go for it and there's just a boxes of motherboard PCBs and you just you build it you just call a free geek person over and go like look how tall it is and they they write it yeah well great yeah that's cool I like it yeah so that's the that's the kind of stuff that that we want to do at it cool umm what else do we have for topics today what I really liked last year too was with a lot of those kind of things you'd run into random attendees that would become like like temporary single-serving friends for the show because they met doing whatever activity yeah because they ended up being paired up for whatever reason or they ended up just being next to each other and talking and whatever I thought that was really cool that's a good idea Colton we should have some activities where people are forced to participate like as a team with other people there so that we like make people mingle because that's what you need at Tech events you have to force people to talk to each other and get each other geez okay more topics yeah I don't know this is all apparently apollo' is gonna refresh the air pods ray um that yeah okay so I got it I go to Google home mini and my idea was a lot of times when I'm working I'll like think of something I need to remember later and it's actually like kind of annoying to do the couple steps to get into my phone or whatever and my phone isn't very great at responding to ok Google yeah I didn't even though it's on it's just not I don't know why so I got a Google on me and now when I talk to the Google home mini 50% of the time my phone does it too so this is like the issue that I have with them so there's a few things that are just kind of broken on Android and just sort of in general I guess here's one that really bugs me when I swipe away notification when I clear all on my phone do you have do you ever have it happen where your phone will just be like buzzing for the next 10 seconds because it will like Italy notify almost like an email notifications yeah it'll be like 9 just a 7 as it goes through them and it's just well might also refined them so once you're fully cleared out it'll be like oh you have you have a few throw a watch into the mix that's really annoying um that's not great there was another really stupid like just dumb stuff why is it that Google in their infinite wisdom added marques read to their SMS app which is super freakin handy by the way like when you drag it when you when you just pull down the notification yeah I can reply or mark as read why isn't that not in Gmail why is that not in hangouts why is that not in literally anything else yeah because and this is really frustrating on iOS on iOS there's no way to mark a text messages on read so if you're like me and you use read and unread only way to track what you haven't haven't dealt with yet yeah why is this so hard I don't get it another thing with the Google home Mini is I made it play a song just good one to see how the speakers were and then I was like it's really loud by default and like the speaker isn't very great so I was like I kept on telling it like I'm gonna stop doing proper commands but essentially turn the volume down yeah it it inaudibly went down okay turn the volume down okay turn the volume down okay turn the volume down I just kept doing it it was like not noticeably going down so then I was like turn the volume down a lot and then it went to a completely inaudible level of volume and there's no like there's no volume physical slider or anything so I can't it's just voice commands I can't do it through my phone it's so I'm just like so it's blaringly ridiculously loud or off is like my too but but not off because it took me about 15 minutes to recognize like this weird buzzing sound that I could barely hear was like nicly music coming from the little bikes maybe just need better music loser maybe if your music was like happy you wouldn't mind if I don't know what it was playing at that point you heard me because it just random through google play music and with someone some random song I had no idea what it was people say do it by percentage set the volume to whatever okay not 25% all right but then that even takes trial and error because I don't know what percentage of that they're helping us they're helping us okay that's that's decent though that's not that yeah it should be it should go down a reasonable amount if you tell it to turn the ball I think tis jester nailed it here or loop could just not be an idiot nice thank you guys oh that's so appreciate that yeah yep yeah Luke was Luke was wrong Luke was wrong 2018 don't bring that website back the statement is cool the website is not cool yeah yeah um all right so I guess that's pretty much it yeah everything else yeah some pirates did pirate stuff yep with Microsoft's uwp protection you know Samsung unveiled a big SSD but that is physically small just lots of capacity hooray utorrent there's a vulnerability that's bad that's surprising lordy there's more augmented reality stuff out of Google so call me in two years yep Tesla is doing a wall charger but now for your office which is like okay okay um apparently it'll be free but you stuff to pay for electricity what okay also Asus is launching premium GTX 1050 and 1050 TI graphics cards with a hundred and forty four hour of burning quality control and longer warranties aimed at LAN cafes okay from my experience when it comes to like cheap products it's usually it usually makes far more sense to just like buy a new one when it bricks because by then the new one will probably be better than the old one but whatever so we'll see you again next week same bat-time same bat-channel by LAN cafe is still thing in some places very much so yeah I definitely still a thing but like I don't see why they would buy a more expensive card for it new website live with Mediacom let's do [Music] did someone already think it [Music] you're already there that's Paulette right would that be terrible misspelling Luke wasn't even oh it's available it's available Luke was an idiot calm fantastic Luke will be wrong 2019 calm and 
The pixel buds come with a charging case, features exclusive to pixel phones, and they're priced at $159 making them pretty much the Android equivalent to Apple's air pods But are these even close to as good? and can they deliver on their promise of offering magical Real-time translation, just like they did in the scripted onstage demo. I think kind of blue would suit you alright We will see Massdrop's best-selling Sennheiser HD 6xx headphones are available again for only 200 US dollars, so check them out at the link in the video description First things first the pixel buds are not truly Wireless But unlike some other neck buds like the j-bird freedoms There's no battery bump or inline control Everything is contained within the earbuds themselves So why then does this cable exist at all? Well, it's actually integral to the buds design starting with the fit the loop formed at the cables end actually goes inside-ish your ear and then can be adjusted for a nice snug fit and to keep them in In practice, it causes a little bit more faffing about to put them in the cable slips but it works surprisingly well to hold them in place and being able to hang them around your neck, it could be argued is a convenient way to keep track of them and and besides, if you prefer truly Wireless pixel buds you can just DIY it any way by cutting the... I'm just kidding not only would cutting off the cable void your warranty You'd also be totally screwed because the cable does conduct audio signals not to mention power The buds 5 hour,  120 milliamp hour battery is completely contained within the left Bud and is not split between the two earphones like with Apple's air pods To charge the battery you will need the included charging case. It is not as small or convinient Or premium feeling as the air pods case. I have some doubts about its long-term durability, and the lip around the edge is pretty stupid Okay, I actually you know what I don't like it very much but the process of putting the buds in is about as good as it could be considering that there's a cable to deal with and it includes a magic pairing mechanism similar to apples provided that you're running Android nougat and That you have a little bit of luck But let's just take them back out and use them compared to the air pods Which only have one gesture which can be remapped depending on your preference per Bud to pause? skip track or summon Siri Google's offers less flexibility at this time, but it does support more gestures Thanks to a capacitive surface That is built into the right bud so you can actually tap to play and pause You can double tap to have notifications read to you You can swipe to adjust volume and you can hold it to summon the Google assistant, which by the way is awesome on the pixel buds the instant you touch the button no latency or even an Acknowledgment tone you can just start talking. What's the price of Bitcoin? Ordering it to play songs, get directions or even send text messages something that isn't supported on the Google home Yet Sorry, I can't send text yet. Oh and one more thing how about that real-time translation? Now two months ago Dennis And I tried out a different product with that same promise and the results were how do we put this tactfully? totally broke dick Okay, so now I'm actually not very certain if it's working properly So let's see if Google can do any better today you're not Dennis Can you get Dennis ok so you ready to try again You kill me hello, it is very nice to meet you oh Yeah audience, ooh Wow it went through a lot of different iterations there. Why is it that whenever we try to do one of these scenarios we end up dating Okay So alright thanks Dennis There are some good things here umm. I don't speak This is based on Google Translate rather than whatever that broken thing we were using before was so the translations are actually pretty good but a couple of issues first of all this functionality with the pixel buds only works with the pixel or pixel 2 series of phones and What was the point of that What was the difference between using pixel buds and just using Google Translate So, okay, let's move on to the one more fairly important thing that we have to discuss here How do the pixel buds sound? actually Not bad compared to the air pods. They have a wider soundstage and are more full-bodied Definitely less tinny meaning. I would say they sound better than the air pods overall With that said despite all of our comparisons between the two here the buds aren't Really competing with the air pods anyway even though they can totally work with an iPhone including Siri integration What they're competing with is all the other? Bluetooth headphones that an Android user might buy in the post headphone jack era and as long as your device supports the features that you want to use with them and you don't mind the relatively cumbersome in our experience pairing and Easier insertion process, I think they are a pretty good choice You know what else is a good choice Crunchyroll the site created by anime fans for anime fans offering the most current episodes of new shows Straight from Japan like Knights and magic and my hero academia season 2 all the content on their site is professionally Subtitled and our link gives you a free trial of their premium service completely ad free and if you enjoy the many benefits of premium like 1080p streaming getting new episodes of shows straight from Japan within an hour of their premiere and Being able to stream anywhere anytime from a variety of devices like your phone tablet Or game console you can continue your premium membership to crunchyroll for just 695 a month so go to crunchyroll.com slash Linus and sign up today, so Thanks for watching guys if this video sucked You know what to do?

back at CES 2017 we got our first look at the Corsair concepts late a theoretical spiritual successor to the big bold and beautiful 900 D fast forward to today and we somehow got one of the only two prototypes in existence here in the lab what are we gonna do with it well how about a bowls to the wall 18 core workstation whoa the producers are telling me that it will also have a second rig in it for gaming this is madness but you know what isn't madness tunnel bear tunnel bear makes it easy to privately and securely browse a more open Internet to try toddle bear for free go to total Vericom slash LTTE [Music] to give you an idea of how big this case is the box that it came in is big enough for me to comfortably fit inside and hey when you're this big there's a lot to talk about so let's jump right into an overview of the slate anyway it features nearly 360 degree tempered glass coverage safe for the angular top brushed aluminum accents both of the side panels rocked strong hinges with magnetic catches and they open like suicide doors from what I'm assuming is extra style points now most hinge side panels actually do open this way but there's something extra special feeling about these ones maybe thanks to their sheer girth and weight each air intake comes with what are likely the largest slide-in air filters of any case ever though I guess that comes with the territory then moving on to the inside there's mounting for a whole heck of a lot of hardware and since we have a lot more to cover in this video we're gonna do this in lightning round fashion here in no particular order the slate has mounting for two motherboards five GPUs eight SSDs five hard drives thirteen fans to quadruple 120-millimeter radiators a triple 140 millimeter radiators two power supplies and probably a dog or three and believe it or not we're planning to make use of all of that space with full custom hardline water cooling first some planning though yes we plan let's talk about our parts list and do a dry fit to ensure a that everything is working and B that it will actually all go in there so the final system is gonna be kind of a mullet business that's like content creation 3d rendering etc in the front and then party that's gaming in the back the ultimate best of both worlds within a single tower though like a mullet it clearly won't be for everyone let's start with the content creation rig in typical ltte fashion it's the best of the best Intel's flagship 18 core 79 80 XE might not be a great value for like Adobe Premiere but it does allow for the virtualization of four quad core systems with two cores left over to run the hypervisor and for 3d rendering and blender it absolutely slays in the same spirit of overkill how about for quad rows with a serious amount of motherboard to accommodate them all Asus Rampage 6 Xtreme was up to the task with all the PCI Express slots that we or pretty much anyone could ever need triple m dot two slots for some rated 480 gig nvme goodness 10 gig networking and lots and lots of RGB actually our plans are set to white for the color scheme we have planned so haha take that 2017 to feed those 18 cores with sweet sweet bits and bytes of course they're somehow managed to get us a hundred and twenty eight gigs of their vengeance RGB it's not entirely possible that we are single-handedly causing the continuation of the global DRAM shortage so sorry about that and then as for a GPU choosing one was a bit of a challenge a challenge in the sense that convincing Alex to let us disassemble the 16k gaming machine that he's been using as a SolidWorks workstation since then was a challenge not in the sense that we actually had a ton of cuadros lying around to choose from so these four p5 thousands they don't really match our color scheme but they conveniently support eqi's Universal 1080 waterblock so that is going to be fixed by the next video each GPU here has a cool 16 gigs of vram and 2560 CUDA cores for our power supply we went with a corsair ax 1500 i it's one of the only units on the market that can handle everything in this system then we added some sexy white gray and blue cables from cable mod onto our ITX gaming rig this one is a whole other ballgame instead of focusing on quantity like sake cores or GPUs it's all about quality now the core i7 7700 K isn't it technically Intel's top consumer CPU right now but with a little bit of overclocking we aren't really making any compromises here because like we're still talking about 22 processing cores in a single box the GPU was an easy choice here we went for the NVIDIA GTX 1080 Ti which should handle gaming all the way up to 4k resolution with relative ease and then we actually managed to get two more 16 gig dims of Corsairs vengence RGB ddr4 bringing our case total to a whopping 160 gigabytes of RAM all that fits neatly into a Suzy 270 I which shares a similar monochrome aesthetic with our rampage board and of course has even more RGB which again we're probably not going to use and then this rig has to slum it with a single 480 gig MP 500 nvme SSD for the OS and any important programs or games finally it gets powered by Corsairs SF 600 power supply which also gets the same cable mod treatment to stay consistent with the rest of the build while we're around the back here let's talk storage each one of our systems will get its own triple 480 gig SATA SSD raid 5 array for super fast but not as fast as nvme storage then for mass storage the main workstation system has an additional 312 terabyte Seagate iron wolf pro drives that could actually be set up as an as for both rigs with virtualization actually it could probably serve the rest of the house too if you're into that sort of thing even with though all this incredibly opie hardware the slate still looks almost empty so hopefully water cooling components and lighting will fill it up a little bit more in part 2 but before we get to that we want to show you guys some baseline air-cooled numbers for our rig as expected we're looking at pretty good temperatures on the main system with nocked who has NHD 15 on a 79 and then unsurprising GPU thermals for cards that are installed this close together our gaming system was a completely different story though since we could only fit a Noctua l9 I in the space available temperatures on our 7700 K were basically pegged at a hundred degrees even with the absurd 30 to 50% throttling we encountered definitely no thanks to the massive airflow restrictions in the form of the four Quadros and the 1080 TI hopefully though we'll be able to do a little bit better than both of them with a couple of d5 pumps and some thick radiators but again you'll have to stay tuned for part two for that speaking of part two have you ever had one of your devices and it's in two parts and you want to put them back together wow that was painful I fix it has got the tools for you not to mention the guides I fix it is all about helping people repair and upgrade their devices and their iconic black and blue pro tech tool kit is now only 5995 it's got their 64 bit driver kit a wide

both Xen and Vega at this point are pretty old news by computer industry standards but there are a couple of things that make this combination product more interesting than you might expect number one is the incredible value proposition for budget gaming and number two is the unexpectedly high performance of these entry-level CPUs once you add a discrete graphics card today's video was brought to you by tunnel bayer tunnel bear thinks the internet is better when everyone can openly access the same content so Tritonal bear for free at tunnel bear comm /l TT [Music] let's begin by jumping right into gaming performance on rise and G's integrated graphics where unsurprisingly its Vega GPU stomped all over Intel's best efforts to build a competitive on chip graphics processor then fell short of even a gtx 1050 TI putting it pretty far down the pecking order compared to discrete graphics cards so we tested at 1080p medium details but based on our results it's more likely that you would opt for 720p high or 1080p low though to be clear we are not complaining about this budget gamers would have given their left nut for 720p high 12 years ago when AMD first began work on the combination cpu GPU paradigm moving on to productivity we get very similar results to the same clocked older generation Rison chips with the new g series actually pulling off some better results in tests like multi-threaded Cinebench and v rays cpu benchmark and then leaving intel's onboard graphics standing on the starting line in the GPU version now we also saw similar or better scores compared to old Rison in asus reel bench ignoring the OpenCL result since they obviously favor discrete graphics cards and blender CPU test continues the trend with team blue getting smashed and the GPU test once again showing us that 8 and 12 C s respectively aren't ideal for heavy lifting so what have we got here then we've got a couple of really nice upgrades the 2200 G obsoletes basically the entire existing rise in three lineup and remember you can just plug this into any existing Rison compatible motherboard with at most a BIOS update and the 2400 G ends up being a toss-up with the more expensive 1600 X so what you get is onboard graphics and in some cases better performance due to the 4 + 0 see xdesign and second-generation precision boost but what you give up is some level three cache and a couple of course for heavy multi-threaded workloads now these are budget products so AMD costed down the IHS to a traditional thermal paste this time around though that shouldn't be a big deal at this package power and Verizon runs pretty cool anyway and while we've never had great results with Rison overclocking today's chips were particularly unimpressive both of them managed only 3.8 5 gigahertz on all cores which is more than the precision boost frequency of the 2200 g but actually less than the 2400 g to be clear that's on all cores so it's still a net gain for some workloads and the 2400 g managed it at a lower voltage but we just need to make sure that you're going into your purchase here with realistic expectations for a single Benjamin and change thermals were a little higher than usual for Rison thanks to the higher default voltages and probably the lesser thermal compound but power consumption was basically spot-on only a few watts different than the same clock to OG rise in CPUs our Intel chips it should be noted managed lower idle drop alright so let's talk upgrade path now a lot of people go out and buy a CPU like this with integrated graphics with the intention of only using those temporarily so what is gaming like once you throw in a dedicated graphics card actually fine so we ran our rise in CPUs with a 1050 Ti in the earlier testing and then re ran our G Series with it as well and we got similar if slightly lower results across the board so it looks then like AMD's decision to split the PCI Express Lanes between the integrated Vega core and the PCIe 16x slot giving only eight lanes for each didn't actually hurt them too badly so at 99 and 169 respectively the Rison 320 200 G and rise in 5 2400 G are both better values than their predecessors and integrated Vega graphics with some help from native support for higher speed 29 33 dual channel D our 4 memory gives them much better performance and maybe even more importantly compatibility in GPU intensive tasks than anything that Intel can muster so Intel who opted not to seed us the price competitive processors saying we'd have to go buy them if we wanted to compare gee

I think I was like one of the sleepiest interests we've had you know welcome to the night time pot I haven't even gotten that much done this week like here let me let me have a look we use we use Trello now which is actually pretty cool I actually really like it so we use Trello to track all of our tasks and and everything Trello is pretty cool and so this week I actually only got like five five videos shot of which I scripted none of them so like on paper I got not a whole lot done this week but big meetings I had to have a lot of meetings and there is something about meetings that just makes you just just hate yourself at the end of the day and then hate yourself some more at the end of the week and then just when you're done hating yourself you hate your life and yeah meeting sock so you never know like okay did we did we cover enough stuff and then if you do cover a new stuff the new question is did we cover too many things in waste time yeah so I mean yeah I got everything that I needed to to end like honestly the stuff that we did this week was pretty cool so we finally covered the porsche design laptop the evie tablet that surface competitor that's like a few hundred dollars cheaper okay and great build quality great specs comes with the keyboard cover and a stylus so we got a resent of thing that doesn't happen anymore Dell sent us over what has to be the most badass projector that I've yet seen oh and you're into protectors HDR it's the laser it's 5,000 lumens Wow and it's 4500 bucks which is a lot of money go buy a hundred inch HD r 4k TV yeah they get quite expensive yes once you get up there in five thousand lumens like obviously it's not gonna work in a bright room with the Sun coming in the way that a TV might yeah but in a dim room but with the blinds up the Sun was probably gonna set in about half an hour it was super usable like very usable even with some of the lights on in the room so I was super if you live up here it'll just always work great yeah we don't have Sun anymore well not this time of year yeah and then John did a smart Christmas lights roundup okay I heard about this yes how was that John was like super into this he was like hey so I think honestly I don't think he's bringing any of that stuff back I don't I think he's just keeping it because I think his ulterior motive is that he's just into decoration in a way that I don't think most of the other people here really are yeah yep and and he's into like celebrating festivities yeah yeah like his tree was up it was badass when I went over there and the festive spirit yeah so so I think he just had an ulterior motive that was he wanted cool smart Christmas lights and he figured hey I know that was part of it if I make a video about this then I'll just keep them yeah so we made that video how is it though like how was it um most of them are terrible as you yeah so he didn't get a lot of great lights out of it but he did get a couple of those Philips I look at you goes which he really likes yeah I was gonna ask Philips make a set because there's stuff seems to be pretty good yeah so Philips was the only one that had an app that wasn't total ass but it's not like proper Christmas lights I'm assuming no no it's just Philips hue but like green and red which is the thing that Philips you does yes last one was we're doing our test build on air cooling in the Corsair concept slate the largest case of that not ever but certainly the largest yeah happening the certainly the largest case from a a mainstream case manufacturer like mountain mods has done stuff like an ascension duality is gonna be bigger how big is it compared to that huge fan tax case ah you know what I don't know the fan tax ones Malinda case labs has definitely done something bigger the TX 10 v or something like ginormous like dual ATX yeah yeah like just redonkulous you know from it like a normal case manufacturer like your Corsair your thermal take your an tack all those guys this is the biggest that I've seen it's like curved tempered glass I'm like wow like I know like I know with with cases like this it's not about selling a whole bunch of them yeah I wonder how many they really think they're going to sell and I don't mean really in like a derogatory way like I wonder like when they're like okay let's make this case like forecasting you have to get forecasting by like what is the number i desided care probably not I like I wondered yeah I actually don't think they care it's just to show up I think this one is just okay you can't tool a case for less than a half a million dollars yeah I'll tell you that much this one was a lot more than that yeah and hurts tempered alone I'm sure is like not fun they're not gonna sell a ton of them because if I had to guess and I'd be completely guessing have no information if I had to guess I'd say the Coursera concept slate is probably gonna cost five hundred to six hundred and fifty US dollars so like this is not this is not gonna put my hand up to guess and was like five okay yeah so I think we're on the same page there and I was thinking that or higher so that that works I'm just gonna alright guys so we're here in the Corsair suite where they have I would love to say of the GTX a lot more times I think it's like three eight times the internal I know on earth would you do right down here at the bottom and they've even got a bunch of hardline and hopefully hopefully will do a great job like is it just like a crazy build or is there like a specific point it's like the screaming the powerful one is the work station okay so for poor quadros yeah um 128 gigs of ram 18 core processor Oh like basically the finest the absolute best okay and then the gaming machine is a capable gaming machine that's like hiding in there so it's a 7700 K with a 1080 Ti okay and 32 gigs of ram so while your thing is rendering on your multiple Quadros you can still game it absolute felicity yeah you can get one of us so Wendell over at level one Tex is he seeing his kvms I believe they're actually available on the store right now but he's got two different models and they're DisplayPort kvms so we've actually got one of them in I've been waiting icing yeah so he's making yeah this product that already existed but he basically made firmware for it that isn't trash that's cool so right up until now a DisplayPort KVM has been pretty hard to come by especially one that isn't total yeah okay that that asterisk on the end is super important so it's DisplayPort 1.2 it passes through free sync as far as I know and he's even gotten it working passing through G sync the tallboy model is five hundred and fifty dollars but it is a dual monitor KVM okay so you would actually be able to run this in fact that's what we should probably do Jake in the in the showcase like show off video for this one is we should have two monitors and then you can actually switch between your two systems like that and it does audio oh yeah it's like totally badass it's USB 3 it's like it's like crazy crazy amazing that's the okay so so the table model is the dual monitor one yeah that's the main D and then the four there's the quad poor single monitor one so you can switch between four different systems that one's like 330 bucks or something like yes you've got you're looking at 396 for the single monitor so that much okay and 664 okay so I have had the pricing totally wrong so yeah man that's US dollars by the way oh I mean they look sick yeah and you know for for a high plug count KVM that's actually not unreasonable there's something there's some that you can get at quite a bit cheaper but not not anywhere close to that feature sense yeah I mean you can spend you can spend that kind of money on VGA KVM still depending on the features yeah so people are asking for a link I'll drop one in chat yeah all right thanks all right why don't we how do we roll the intro crap well we have good topics trust me [Music] [Music] [Music] well--there's hey if you're logged into twitch is there an easy way to get me an authentication thing because otherwise I have to go on to the thing and I have to do the whole thing oh all right yeah yeah okay that's fine um all right well if I whispered in head gestures while we're live on stream yeah how's it going SAP what do you what is for what that for this yeah you don't need that I don't need that no well how do I do it are you sure I'm pretty sure are you are you not logged in no try to log in this is a new laptop okay turtle again I already did what what oh wait okay hold on I got this okay cool okay you know what we'll get back to you on that actually we won't at all so don't worry about it okay so the iMac Pro this was originally posted by red round 2 I'm posting the link in the twitch chat now the original article is from 9 to 5 Mac and apparently it's going to feature an a-10 fusion processor inside so oh wow that's weird what is that oh hold on oh that was close I mean it would have just shown me my topic so I'm actually working on my reel oh yeah it does good cool I'm working on my review of the new blade stealth this is the quad core model okay so I'm super loose doped on this thing so far actually wow you didn't just include it in your other blade review no wow wow what just milking videos what are you talking about you're drunk way to go you're drunk they're both blades you should include in the same video I shouldn't have to watch two different videos with blades and you know what I can't be milking it because it's obviously gonna get demonetized does the word blade in it so wait did that happen no well ok yes but not got it back okay that was like six years ago back when I did an unboxing of the original razor blade I had some I had some keywords in the description about razors switchblade interface which at the time I said I didn't think made a ton of sense and it got it got blunt cans so fast you remember that thing right with the displays behind the programmable buttons yeah it was just so expensive and nobody cared it was pretty bad it also was buggy yeah anyway so it got demonetized and I had to appeal it I filmed that video yeah that makes sense yeah yep yeah I was a long time ago I remember and neither of okay so the iMac Pro to feature a 10 fusion coprocessor processor possibly for always-on hey Siri you know okay so I've got a couple things to say here number one is that I was super confused when I read the headline for this and I was like oh an a-10 fusion coprocessor that's like oh that's weird why would it why would they put an APU in there yeah that's exactly what I thought too because I was Andy has their lineup of a 1080p use and then fusion was what AMD was calling what they were gonna call their cpu GPU hybrid products that just ended up being ap use but there was really nothing hybrid about them they were just you know CPUs with onboard graphics anyway Fusion was the branding that they were gonna use for that house like oh yeah a confusion and because I don't follow Apple as closely as I follow PC stuff like yes you know a 11 Bionic a 10 fusion I'm sure that lots of Apple people would have gone to makes complete sense oh and a 10 fusion like the you know iPhone 7 but I didn't and I'm dumb and you can all have a nice little laugh at me and anyway so point number one is I got confused haha and point number two is that I think this is great yeah I mean sure it's gonna handle smaller more different tasks like hosting hey Siri always on so you would just be able to say hey Siri to your computer yeah which would be cool I guess if you do that first there's so many mics in our houses now it's kind of ridiculous but you know whatever not in mind that you're already being monitored by Wow oh yeah I mean phone yes yeah phone yes yeah hey Siri now yeah well you probably have one on you no I do not have an iPhone on me right now you usually do that I usually do it was a good good as a SmartWatch yes yeah I don't know if it has a mic but a lot of them do actually and you swapped it quite often it's true a lot of mics this is a pro track it's actually kind of cool we did like a sponsored spot for it but I'm not being paid to wear it right now I like it it's it's got two screens so this is a dumb screen oh is it in overtime okay yeah remember when these first came out and we were both talking about how this is how they would have to do it yeah yeah it's so cool guys it lasts for like another month and a half yeah yeah yeah and it's just a watch and like honest tons of saying I get so many notifications that it's impractical to manage them from my wrist anyway so I've but I got back in the habit of wearing a watch well yes I'm like I'm wearing a watch now and that's cool because like I don't know if it is charged sweet because notifications on your wrist it's not charged whatever yeah like I can tell someone's calling me when I leave my phone it's not a useless thing strapped to your wrist right which is cool but anyway I'm glad they're doing this either way because this has been a thing that has confused me for a number of years why is it that there is anything that this can do that my laptop in my desktop can't that's so stupid yeah so I mean to add to that list why does my laptop not have GPS it would be great for and I know they can tell where your laptop yeah great tech quickie coming on how they know where your laptop is that pretty well it can do that really well which is swell but that won't necessarily help with like I'll find my laptop feature for example right as it is those all refer are refer those all rely on the same Wi-Fi positioning that your Google Maps would for example but this coprocessors isn't gonna give you no I'm just I'm just adding to my list of things that every device should just support and for some reason they write but every device isn't gonna have a sim card ok well ok there's another great question why the actual hell does every device not have somewhere that I can pop a SIM card yeah it probably should especially because and it should be more standard for phone companies to just like I don't know charge you five bucks for the sim but not charge you anything on top of that monthly right the monthly fees shouldn't go up you should pay for the hardware cuz you have to ship it or whatever but I just don't get it yeah how is this how is this not obvious yeah you know would be really sick if I could have a sim in my laptop my phone my switch yeah like everything and I just pulls from my one pool of available I have like other stuff on my list I can't I can't remember for the life of me right now what yeah I'm you know ok biometrics took forever and are still taking forever on laptops and desktops whereas they've been standard on mobile devices for about three years now yeah like Windows hello is the thing yeah but that's very soon and not stand not standard at all yeah so yeah there's just like there's a bunch of stuff like that but I just look at but why why can phones do this and for some reason we aren't building this functionality and tell their devices drives me crazy the LG Graham gen 3 that just rolled in ok and it's got this jank tastic fingerprint scanner on the top left of the trackpad that is not touch sensitive so you can just like run over it and like your touchpad doesn't work there and I'm sitting here going like we've had we've had touch we've had touch ID slash fingerprint scanners built into everything from side buttons to back buttons to front buttons to to fricking oh why they don't even cost much you look at the you look at the tear downs for these phones okay and it to be clear I don't think it's as simple as if the bomb cost for a phone like the iPhone 10 is rumored to be went through three hundred and thirty dollars three hundred forty three seventy whatever it is it's somewhere in the 250 to 350 range something like that and to be clear I'm not saying oh well then it should be $4.99 because unlike some people I do understand that there's a lot of costs associated with bringing a product to market including like really including the long term support of said product something that Apple does generally pretty well and like literally zero dollar inclusion cost for all of the operating system and software yes okay so you know I'm also not saying they're not making enough money like they're clearly really making a lot of money but my point is that when you look at these tear downs the kinds of parts that I'm complaining about I'm not even asking necessarily for a for a cellular radio to be built into the device I'm asking why the actual crap we didn't have a standard created five to eight years ago where every motherboard just has a spot where you can plug it in why don't we have a couple like we're talking little tiny copper wires for antennas to have a way to add this functionality very easily be built into the screen and it does exist it's just something that's really not very common and another actually used to be more common another example is something like it did to back when like Express cards were um and clearly it went away because there wasn't a ton of demand for it but cell phone plans used to be exorbitantly expensive yeah and and to be able to have something like data was like like yeah it was it was almost non-existent and someone in the chat has actually brought up I lost the comment now I'm sorry but they said family plan sim grouping I've heard that it's way more common in the States and it's starting to definitely be a thing in Canada but that's still not like a default thing no and and to be and like if you include the plans even if they exist and you can get them for businesses as well the plans even if they exist don't have device support so it's like I can't just pop a sim in my blade stealth which I should be able to yeah so my point then is that on a thousand dollar device or a fourteen hundred dollar device I think this one's a 512 gig and this is about a $1600 device I think they could have absorbed a slot for a SIM card I think they could have absorbed a fingerprint scanner that isn't trash and that sits under a touch-sensitive surface like a trackpad and you know what I think they probably also could have absorbed you look at how much the camera sensors cost for even a rear camera honest on a cell phone yeah it is a trivial amount why is every webcam not as good as like the one plus five T's rear camera why and what's the excuse latch our cameras are actually like disgustingly bad and laptop mics oh they could be a lot better man so yeah I guess that's it I'm I was mad now I've got it out of my system I'll get mad about it again at some point but I'm over it for now yeah what else do we have for topics today okay yeah why don't we do this before the sponsors oh boy Intel finds critical holes is a secret brutal management engine so this was posted by cubes the gamer on the forum I'm gonna pull up the original article from the register and I think Luke's probably better qualified to go through well this is some this is some pretty ridiculous stuff why this is a big deal it's a fairly self-explanatory uh there's there's firmware level vlog bugs that allow logged in administrators or some other people you can access it over the network which is extremely scary yeah logged in administrators and high privileged processes so programs doesn't have to be a user to run code beneath the operating system to spy on or meddle with the computer completely outside of other users or admins now that's not the only scary part because it's going on to the processor you can access things that are in memory so you can like screw with other programs and you can take things from other programs so meanwhile hold on can I jump in and ask a question oh you're gonna ask a dumb question okay now typically something like a password in a perfect world in a perfectly coded websites and or piece of soft it has to be moved around but at some points in time would stay encrypted theoretically end-to-end but in practice there is sometimes while it's being moved around where it might not be encrypted for a jump she's got it it should be encrypted the whole time so if something has access to memory it can grab stuff that would otherwise be possible I think so and what could be really bad about that is you could change something right so while the program is running you could change something that's in memory crashing it in a really special way or like altering something then right so it's an exploit that opens up to the potential for many other exploits yeah I have obviously never screwed with something like this before but it's it's pretty brutal here we go to do their direct quote the flaws could allow an attacker to impersonate the MESP S or T XE mechanisms that's referring to management engines service platform services or a trusted execution engine which is a great name right now thereby invalidating local security features like what you're just talking about load and execute arbitrary code outside of the visibility of the user and the operating system this is where some of the special concepts like from your antivirus get owned so you can crash affected systems extremely easily this way brutal the things affected are six generations seventh generation and eighth generation Intel Core processors so long Intel Xeon e3 1200 v5 and v6 processors Intel Xeon scalable processors Intel Xeon w processors Intel Atom C 3002 be 900 series processors Apollo Lake Intel Pentium cell on N and seller on J series and risin seven no I'm just kidding it's all Intel oh boy the holes can also be exploited by network administrators this was the part that I really didn't like the rest of them are pretty brutal the fact that there can be an attack vector it's all that I mean it's all brutal what we're talking like we're talking like AIDS birthday cake like does it really matter what's nice you take the problem that I have with this is it's it's it's quite easy to social engineer your way onto someone's Wi-Fi right it's it's like it's it's been proved so many times that in so many different situations you can get onto someone's Wi-Fi pretty easily whether you overhear someone asking for a password or if you just oh man I really need to do whatever it oftentimes people will let you on the Wi-Fi and then getting up to administrator access usually not the hardest thing once you're already on the network anyways exploited by network administrator's or people masquerading as admins like I just said to remotely infect machines with spyware and invisible rootkits oh god Wow it's not it's not good it's really bad okay yeah honestly for the link I'll drop the link yeah so far so far I don't think intel has a plan it's a firmware level thing so at the best-case scenario the best-case scenario is they might be able to patch this via a BIOS update which is a terrible solution because I understand this too this is fun not every BIOS update updates Emme yeah okay and in fact I ran into an issue a little while back where I forget what exactly the problem was I oh man there's this thing with I think it's a soos not a soos it's it's what I think it was with z170 boards I think it's generation can't remember exactly anyway the point is that you have to do like some kind of CPU juggling in order to first flash so you have to go back to like an old CPU to flash the enemy I think you actually have to do something in OS then you have to pop that and you have to put in a new one you have to flash the BIOS with that then you have to like put in the old but like it's some stupid juggling act like I wish I could remember but I wasted like three hours of my time a while back do you remember 87 to 97 is that right is the 80 79 no it's all of them ASIS just has it documented so you know what to do um anyway the point is I believe the issue there was that Emme couldn't be updated while you had the one CPU but it could for the other the point is best-case scenario they can update this with a BIOS flash but that relies on a number of things it relies on the manufacturer of the actual motherboard to do something with okay relies on Intel to provide a fix it relies on the manufacturer to do something with that fix it relies on the manufacturer to communicate to the end-user that they need to apply that fix it relies on the end-user being able to run a BIOS update to be able to run a BIOS up that's that's like the worst I mean we're talking stuff going back to 6th gen I mean there's there's stuff I mean especially when you start getting into like om systems like Dells and HP's there are systems that are not that simple to run a BIOS update on like when you consider that the average user is intimidated by pressing delete and being presented with all these scary options so someone in the chat sorry so I'm gonna the chat brought up like processes can edit memory for other processes yeah I know that's already a thing but this is undetectable by the operating system which is like the reason why it's about permission and and and it like it's it's that's a whole nother level and you can screw with things without being caught and a lot of things are going to be caught by windows okay so I'm not done yet it relies on the end user to be arsed to go and deal with it because for someone who doesn't know how to update a BIOS there's probably let's say conservatively an hour of their life that they have to set aside to learn about this issue figure out how to do it and actually do it there's gonna be I mean there's good okay okay I know that it's that it's unlikely but any machines that you know experience a power loss during this update well they're gonna be bricked they're gonna need to be replaced so there's gonna be a service cost associated with this like this is terrible I'd love to hear Wendell talk about this and we brought Wendell up on this stream I just thought about him that would be cool so this this to me seems really bad mainly because you're going below OS level so you can do essentially whatever the hell you want that's the scary thing for me you can screw with other programs you can make it look like other programs are doing the thing that you're doing that's the stuff that's freaking me out but I really wonder what someone like Wendell thinks yeah at the business side of thing going things going this will not get fixed yeah like that that is the truth yeah there will be many many millions of pcs out there that will be affected by this forever pretty much how often people update their boss in like the people that are watching this yeah like the people that are at this family I have a Saturday night Saturday night calendar reminder I got some wine and some cheese and up Dima BIOS like it's I don't know it was like three different ones and then I switched I mean after that it's not common there I would almost bet that probably above eighty percent of other warts never received one random statistic that I just pulled out of my butt but it's yeah it's probably pretty high all right so in other news if your computer is doomed but at least your cum you want somewhere to put your but that's comfortable then there's always need for C whoo need for seat USA sells quality ergonomic computer office and PC gaming chairs to the US and Canada and they now offer embroidery check that out line is set Linus tech toots Luke at floatplane Media you're gonna need a new one custom embroidery on many Mac's anomic chair models in the pro gaming office office comfort and XL series sections so the embroiderer is in-house so the turnaround time is just a couple days and they've got a preview tool on their website that allows you to type in a name and get a preview image logo embroidery can be requested through email it's support it need for seat usa.com and honestly these guys are awesome we've been working with them a long time and I've had my butt sitting on one of their chairs for over three years now yeah a long time and it is exactly like the day I started they do I will I will definitely give them that they have quite the durability yeah the the foam that they use is like I forget what they call it it's like a cold something cold molded foam and whatever the point is that it doesn't it doesn't just sink in and then sink in more and then eventually like my Costco chair that I threw away eventually you're just sitting on to great supply would yeah that's my current situation at home so for Black Friday they're offering seventy-five bucks off the purchase of any max anomic chair with code Turkey 75 all caps valid until November 29 so go check that out oh you know what let's do let's do G fuel first okay I'm going for the no-look pass you ready yep oh did I was I gonna hit myself is that a good throw yeah yep okay why are you freaking out maybe I was they were all like curvy they all ended like right here what are you scared I felt like I felt like I kind of went too far up and it was gonna come right down and hit me on the head anyway G fuel is the sugar free powdered energy drink makes currently available in 18 flavors created by gamma labs with the goal being to create an alternative to sugar loaded canned energy drinks so mission accomplished because there's no sugar and it does come in a can right yeah no I mean if that's the mission that make sense anyway of how it works is you choose your fuel so you select your drink mix you get delivery and it's fast they ship it to you you add water do you mix it into a glass or shaker cup filled with 16 ounces of water and enjoy boom it comes in tubs boxes containing single serve packs or the single serve packs themselves there are there are actually a lot of people here at the office that as far as I can tell if they stopped eating food altogether would still have enough energy to get through the day because they drink so much G fuel talking about you Jonah yeah Jon Coulton yeah a cult and drink so much G fuel it said still I am pretty sure ed still drinks I'm pretty sure yeah but the thing with Ed is I'm pretty sure he would drink anything that gives him a rush yeah G feel it's just that I don't think he's that bitchy it's like turpentine faster so sure for Black Friday they're featuring a buy one tub get one free sale it's valid till November 26th so you've only got a couple of days go check it out at G fuel dot-com all right bringing us to our last we're really looking at here bringing us to our last sponsor of the day and there's headphones in here Wow free nice ones thanks Brandon that's is that the trick Brandon just lose mouthing down on the savage jerky before the show even though he knows he's not supposed to and I think as penance alright that's the best way to get things from - to take something else that he hasn't anymore I'm I'm listening out today and I'm just going for my favorite okay I'm going for the maple Buffalo be right so savage jerky the goal was to create a snack that was full of flavor and spice that wasn't bad for you they've got 13 different flavors of jerky and personal favorites include the maple buffalo bacon the what's that green one I really like the Moho stuff this stuff is like what's the classic the traditional the traditional is really good and then if you're into mouth melting not just jerky they've also got barbecue sauces but they make Jerky's out of like ghost peppers Carolina Reaper peppers they have some pretty to do the ghost pepper one hey yeah first you can't enjoy the Moho after the go exactly yeah so I'm gonna go home first and then I'm gonna do ghost pepper tell you what after I've had some maple buffalo bacon I'll do ghost pepper to solidarity okay all right yeah anyway offer code bf 2017 to save 20% on their products all this weekend and all orders placed using that code you'll get a free cozy as well I was calling a koozie before because I didn't actually know what it was it's one of those things that goes on your drink that keeps it from keeps it warm or cold as it were insulating sleeve so I don't think it's in the dog but yeah the chat is talking about oh I'll use a light term of aggravated because we're not talking about net neutrality yeah ah okay I don't see it in the dog no I'll start in there um honestly the reason that it's not in there and the reason that we haven't made a video is that we already made a video we've already talked about it before alum [Music] I mean the the cynic in me is kind of looking at everybody jumping on this bandwagon going like like are you just out for views like why do you only care now when it's trendy maybe I'm wrong maybe I'm wrong maybe it's not like that but I just posted a video on the twitch chat it's more than trendy right now it's like coming up again well I know that I know that the debate is sort of on right now but here's the problem so we already did that video that I posted two years ago it's quite good news and there's nothing that we didn't already say net neutrality is good you should care if you don't understand that for whatever reason then I'm sorry we can't yeah basically if we we can't do this because we're in Canada and it's not an issue up here because you know but if you're in the States you should be contacting local representatives there's what's the website fight for the net or something I see sorry this wasn't a prepped topic thanks for the net battle for the Netcom funny because it's battlenet I'll drop it in the chat there's a contact them button which I'm pretty sure if you put in like your your information it like helps you reach out to congressman congressman and represent eight representatives and Congress women in Congress whatever they identify as yes we didn't assume anything yep sorry yeah we're treading on a sensitive topic right now so let's make sure we're yeah yeah let's make sure nobody nobody melts but this website is a good resource for a ton of different stuff if you're looking for more information on it reddit is so over this we've got some people upset because I basically said anyone who doesn't understand that it's good needs to get themselves re-evaluated I think there are better ways to fix the internet than through regulation that's nice but the problem is that this regulation exists to fix other regulation so unless you want to actually deregulate which nobody's calling for oh really unless you want to actually deregulate then nothing can be done and if you were to actually fully deregulate everything it would create a whole host of other problems as well because one of the only reasons that smaller ISPs and smaller telcos can exist is the fact that this copper that was in Canada I believe it was so he okay here in BC I'm more familiar with our local stuff you'll have to forgive me but this is one of the reasons we don't talk about it too much yeah would have been BC tailed back in the day yeah and they were the ones who owned all the copper because they were the ones who existed before the friggin internet and only certain people are allowed to put down copper because you're using government land to put the copper down I mean the last thing that you want is like I've been to developing countries where the telephone poles are literally just covered in every random wire and people like I saw people you know they're not wearing safety vests they don't have a truck with a logo on it they're just like up there like running stuff yeah that's actually a problem too that's a huge problem you have to regulate this stuff there is no removing all the regulation and the regulation that is net neutrality exists to counter the other regulation that has to exist that creates unfair advantages for certain companies that's all there is to it there is no debate the only debate is who's getting paid say you go so there's people in chat that are like you clearly haven't a clue what gee pies and tensions are Brit Brit know we know what's going on we're on your side stop it like honestly we are on your side because it actually does matter like even though we're Canadian and this doesn't theoretically affect us it's super does guys because so much of our infrastructure and the world's for that matter is reliant on what the regulations are for the Internet in the United States not to mention that the Canadian government has a long and proud history of just kind of King sell that what's going on and kind of going okay that looks alright apparently that won't happen at least with our current guy yeah but you know there's always who knows who gets elected next yeah and stuff so there you go you're Canadian I'm out anyway so there that's all I had to say on it do you have anything like okay one of my big things a lot of people bring up the idea of like internet fast leads and like when you go to battle for the Netcom there's like a fake oh loading icon at the top and stuff that's not the only problem in countries where this isn't a thing where they don't have net neutrality set up there's there's been some screenshots going around of flight I don't remember which country it was but the second you try to open a browser it redirects you to a page and it's essentially a micro transaction store for being able to access websites and you get like a certain amount of data or a certain amount of time on a certain website and you have to buy it with like coins that you have for that website it's it's beautifully garbage and the issue that comes up with this is like I had to scroll down the list for a while to find facebook Messenger because there's so many websites that people use these days that are super mainstream and including games and all these other kind of things that you don't realize that some of the things that you use might fall down below other stuff and someone says tunnel bear yeah that's great except that VPN traffic works because the ISP lets everything through there know that it's VPN traffic they just have to let it through if it's now on a whitelist system they'll just block all of that so get on or slow it down or slow it down yeah in some situations though you can block it yeah they'll go oh you're encrypted I don't like it yeah I don't know whatever it is I don't care I don't know what the Americans specific version if they'll be able to block websites but like there was an issue up here and I don't know what actually happened with it but tell us a local is B tell us decided to block the website I can't support you guys anymore if you support pie we're not what can we say that sounded like are you not in favor of net neutrality I know it's legal in a lot of places but hold off on the reefer for a moment they're like look I don't know where that came from unless you're super stoned there's there's issues with small business right now we are in like Amazon's North America I know Facebook is huge I know Apple is huge I know all these other companies are huge we are in Amazon's North America and Amazon is gobbling up small business there's a lot of small business that still exists on the web whether that's brick-and-mortar that do a lot of work through the web or advertised through the web or have a website where people can see all their stuff whatever all of that is going to get less traffic if it's slow and crappy or if you have to pay to access it than other things this was extremely damaged small business yeah there you apparently I'm faking it I don't know what I'm faking it's not an orgasm though if I was faking that you'd know it would be really convincing all right let's move on to the next topic shall we do you not know that well no you'd know that I was doing something right yeah even though something was going on ah the original article here there's there's I don't I don't like the obscene pitchfork hanging I like I don't understand at all how anyone thought that we were defending what are you doing I fight with reason guys come on um yeah well when you don't have it you can't reach for whatever weapons in the arse again I'm happy that you happen to be fighting for the same side that I'm on but like come on easy easy easy brain a little bit okay okay last thing I'll mention is that some people were pointing out that those Portugal screenshots were a little bit misrepresentative of what was going on Andrew but actually changes nothing yeah about any of this and I'm not super surprised because the only answer is treating the internet like a utility yeah that's the only one okay phone lines are great so BGR teases a potential Galaxy X a bendable phone Wow also one thing that I want to say on that topic yeah man if if Portugal screenshot thing is fake don't share it fake news stuff is not gonna help your argument yeah it doesn't help anybody it hurts your argument you're gonna get caught you're gonna look like an idiot anyways moving forward so the galaxy X looks nothing like the iPhone X so that's cool um well we have here in terms of leaks we know that it's supposed to be bendable you've been trying to work on this for years now bendable displays have been considered kind of like a sort of a holy brewery futuristic technology yeah bendable battery that like yeah but it's the bendable display we've seen that like weird conferences you've seen people doing it for a while the bendable battery dress that's that's very interesting for me so support page went up on Samsung's website for an SMG 888 and 0 no information on what it is but that model number has been associated with galaxy X many times in the past it already received various certifications from regulators Wow including the Wi-Fi Alliance and Bluetooth SIG so the rumor is that the device will be so complicated to manufacture that it might see a limited launched before Samsung is able to produce it on mass so this is something Samsung's done before just doing a limited release in South Korea for example and then figuring out when if ever to roll it out to the rest of the world at a later date I personally think that this is gonna be a really interesting device because for the first time in I don't know the last okay you'll have to forgive me if I've missed a bunch in between because there was there have been big chunks of time when I haven't really paid much attention to mobile phones but the last time that I remember a phone that was really sold based on being a fashion statement aside from Apple because Apple does position their phone that way but they do it subtly like they have they try to sell you FaceTime or that you're gonna be do a pic kickflips or whatever and your friends are gonna record you in slow mode it's can be like awesome like they it's more of a like a lifestyle brand whereas the last phone that I remember that was really about how cool it looks and how cool you're gonna look when you use it was the Motorola RAZR yeah yeah that's that phone was absolutely about that that was what it was all about don't think anyone actually cared about any other part of it no so it was a pain to use it was like actually two things I never had one yeah so I never had one either but like I touched one I was like yeah this is super dumb um so this since then would be maybe if not the first the best example I've seen because I don't think this thing is gonna be powerful I don't think it's gonna be powerful and I think it's gonna have to not be powerful because they're gonna have to make compromises on things like battery life I don't think the display is necessarily gonna be the highest resolution because this brand new manufacturing technology we're talking about so I think this is going to be the phone that is pure fashion statement and it's going to finally happen where phones have gotten powerful enough for most people that you'll be able to produce something with very mainstream specs and that's what I think this will have that is just cool and that's kind of that's actually quite exciting so I was talking to someone about this he was literally last night about how phones have gone to the point where like they're all pretty much the same there isn't really a lot going on like like the the craziest thing that happened was Apple released like a really weird phone and like they like turned the camera thing which was a fashion thing related to razor like you're talking about earlier or the the was it called that really thin phone the Motorola RAZR Motorola ready yeah okay let's just making sure that I didn't pull that name in um but but but like it's it's it's mostly a fashion phone with like weird face recognition stuff and that's not that surprising and Samsung going in a similar location is is actually with the same name which is hilarious is it's probably good because in terms of internals there's not a lot going on they all the same freaking processor they're all running the same freaking stuff it's become boring the battle for the inside of the phone mm-hmm yeah it's um I've reviewed a lot of phones in the last couple of months and they've all been pretty similar yeah so so doing something interesting with the body of the phone is out cool that's awesome that's like exactly what they should have moved into next you know it's not awesome this segue into something that's not awesome posted by dr. McIntosh on the forum the original article is from qz comm so that could have been a good segue except I mean did you just intentionally trashed it google admits that they'd been collecting Android users locations even when location services are disabled oops what upsy daisy's so they've said that they didn't use the location data they collected using this service they never used or stored it and the company is now taking steps to end the practice this is a quote by the end of November Android phones will no longer send cell tower location data to Google at least as part of this particular service which consumers cannot disable so what was going on for a while is even if you disabled location services didn't use apps and didn't have a SIM card Android phones would be gathering your location data based on cell towers and transmitting it back to Google notices since the beginning of 2017 so basically at this point like we're gonna continue talking about this but at this point from from the topic that we haven't talked about yet which is the Oberer topic where they like leaked an obscene amount of user data didn't report it for like a year and paid hackers to cover it up to nearly as bad as that are you sure well okay if we believe Google's story about this then it's not nearly as bad as that because what they're saying is in January this year and and it's only been this year and they're saying that's only been an entire year they're saying that we looked into using cell ID codes as an additional signal to further improve the speed and performance of message delivery we never incorporated into the network sync system so the data was immediately discarded okay so like I don't know if I trust that but sure so yeah the idea was they were using the addresses of multiple towers to triangulate a phone's location something that they basically what I was saying is if you want any form of privacy just don't use electronic devices and don't know anyone who uses electronic devices yeah or that are connected to anything yeah if they're not connected to anything you're good yeah so why don't we get into the uber thing yeah oh my god this is actually kind of trash uber paid hackers to delete stolen data on fifty-seven million people I mean at least they at least they paid the ransom um this was posted by blue chinchilla eating Doritos on the forum and the original article here is from Bloomberg what garbage whoa is it just me or has did uber not position themselves as like the good guy New Age company that was gonna like be like guys like all the taxis that into the garbage can and then threw gasoline on top of it and then threw like TNT on top of it and then threw all that into a furnace and were just like yeah that's basically what so there's a lot of people really excited about being able to tip through her I'm not and you want to know why because I thought the entire point of this I thought the entire point of uber was that we were doing away with the things that were wrong with the cab industry and that's that you never know how much to pay cabbies are jerks if you are if you don't tip them really well I've legitimately had my bags thrown on the ground because I didn't tip enough and I thought that they were supposed to pay the drivers adequately such that that wasn't going to be an issue anymore and see I didn't think the idea was that they were gonna like nickel and dime the drivers to the point where then they go oh you know what actually the boatloads of money that we're making oh you know what we're not gonna give those seat to the driver could you top them up actually you you the passenger like yeah yeah why don't you top them up let's go let's do it the way the cabbies did it are you kidding me and it drives me kinda nuts because I really liked that as well I like not having to deal with that but I would have rather paid more natively and not had to tip me too because now I'm in this weird situation where I know that they're not getting we don't have over here so I literally only ran into this once since the tip update came out yeah it's not cheaper anymore at all no and you still have to tend you have to tip and like legitimately feel like a jerk if you don't tip yeah because they're not getting paid enough which is just like a thing uber drivers are not paid very well so what can you just charge me more so I don't have to do that oh I tipping is actually done I hate tipping you know I want everyone to make the right amount of money and I want to pay you more for things I don't want to not tip it's the same with the thing with loot boxes like this is a not great opinion I wish games costed more really super unpopular opinion tell me more I'm shy had popcorn at this yeah yeah like everyone in the chat is currently loading firearms attack sure yeah you're right sometimes haven't gone up in a long time mm-hmm yeah I think ass nest game was about 50 bucks it's they've been pretty similarly priced for a long time and that was 20 Wow and there's arguments for the other side like you don't even sell freakin physical games anymore so it should probably cost less yeah but there's a lot of risk involved with making a game yeah it's also more expensive to make a game it's also way more expensive way more to make a game these days indie Studios are taking huge risk on games and then are not expected to charge more than like $20 for a game yeah because a lot of any games are like 15 25 bucks I would and to compensate these things and you can all say whatever the heck you want you can tell me I'm wrong you can help me no digital distribution is cheaper you tell me no there's more gamers now you tell me no homme there's there's more mainstream gamers now meaning that a lot more games to be purchased in general yeah sure say whatever you want they're compensating for the fact that they're not increasing the price of the game with boxes and other weird crappy things like cosmetic purchasing now with certain games in my opinion to make sense sure Liga Legends is free you can buy skins that's great sounds good how have fun League of Legends and games like that that are free games that sell some skins I don't really care about that with something like destiny - in destiny - I paid full price for the game mm-hmm I have to pay for every freaking little damn DLC thing that they want to release for every single little boss in Peach Luke that they want to keep going and there's the bright engrams store where you buy randomized loot boxes that give you cosmetic items back in the day you would play the game to get the freaking cosmetic items and it actually dilutes from the game this is something that I don't like we called it questing yeah in most games that has something like that you would go on a quest in WoW you would get the new cool item you could wear it around town it sounds good what this actually hurts is it literally makes it so that there isn't as much to do in the game right because like killing the butcher a bunch of none of the butchers about example because he always drops the cleaver but yeah whatever someone else who drops a special drop like once every 20 times you want to go there and you want to do it with your friends you want to get your friends on to go play it because you want that item now you can just buy it that literally takes content out of the game essentially because you're not going to do it as much because you don't care because you could just spend $2 to buy it and that $2 is probably worth your time so you might actually do that cosmetic items and loot boxes are cancerous literally they are eating away at games and breaking them down and diluting them and making them worse current games are worse systems if you've ever bought one you're the problem yeah there you go loot boxes are essentially tipping I don't like tipping I don't like loot boxes I would rather pay more and buy the whole damn thing and be able to experience the whole game okay I want to push harder I want to get all my friends on I want to fight and push that boss in freaking what is it called the raid whatever in destiny too I did it once - twice one we're already done what what we cleared it like the first time I tried it that's ridiculous what happened to that there's no like effort that I said go into games anymore not all games I know but a lot of them cuphead great game but then there's no I don't really care about doing it again there's no like special ship that I can get from there there's no special Sparrow that I can get from there can I pick something sure okay one of the problems and I understand you're all gonna hate me it's okay they don't actually oh one of the problems that DLC songs or that some kind of ongoing payment system solves is the server uptime and the feast or famine nature of being a game developer we're not every game can be counter-strike know I'd still be selling literally twenty years yeah after it first comes out and that is a huge issue something very unpopular that I'd probably be better off just not saying it all so yeah what happened was I accidentally bumped the Machine which seems to be causing it to blue screen right now for some reason so it probably just needs a like take apart reseed everything put it back together anyway so I was hanging around with the monolith guys yeah a couple weeks ago yeah and what was interesting about this was that I was hanging around in a game studio for a game that for our game studio that just released the game like a two-year effort game just launched and there were still lots of people still employed still with jobs okay now hold on a second now you can think about this from the perspective of the the individual like the the worker okay the the artist or the programmer or whatever the case may be obviously people prefer to have a steady flow of income and predictable employment with benefits etc etc etc and you could kind of go well you know what they knew what they were signing up for in the game industry baby baby baby too bad for them okay step back for a second that may all be true but what about the company one of the biggest challenges as a company is attracting talent attracting and retaining good talent if you want to have a chance in a highly competitive industry like the games industry and you can see why this evolution is happening you need to be able to offer employment packages to people that might include free lunches or super fancy $1,200 chairs or whatever perks it is that elsewhere in the industry companies are offering or you are gonna end up with no staff the inability to make any game let alone a good one and you are going to go out of business so effectively what's happening is whether you agree or not whether you like it or not the fact that this business model works is turning anyone who doesn't adopt it into dinosaurs and the problem is not the workers if they have the option and if you say that you wouldn't you're either a liar or you're a unicorn okay if they have the option to take a job that will continue and gives them lots of benefits and that they can rely on getting up in the morning and going to like you know think about someone like a composer you know monolith has a dedicated composer who does the music for all their games so what do they really stag a man it's just like so yeah I guess you better go find some other music to compose if he has the option to take the job that's SIA or the jobs man so wait continues because he still do he's composing music for cutscenes and DLCs and all that kind of stuff but I don't think anyone's upset with that know what people are upset about is is the fact that this this culture of microtransactions exists and that it's that is making it so that okay so you're saying they should just charge more for the game in the first place but that still wouldn't solve the problem the feast or famine problem because no business is gonna forecast going okay we're gonna charge 130 dollars for our game and then we're just going to keep everyone on staff and make no money for that and we'll just pay out of out of our coffers for like the year until we're like getting close to the next release and then it's crunch time and everyone will just kind of work that whole time like that's not viable I think you could have because I think DLC being planned for because this is something that seems to trigger people is DLC being planned for before the release and it's planned for before the release because that's the way that you avoid feast or famine and that's you provide a steady job and so some people scream about that yeah oh my god you're releasing the game you already have a release date for DLC that's crazy buh-buh-bah yeah I don't think of that is hurting thing I don't I'm not a huge fan of course I would like every single thing in existence to be in the game when I buy it right away sure whatever but I don't think that is ultimately that terrible what I would prefer they did was have a steady schedule of releases so I actually like the concept of what Destiny's released idea is which is that DLCs over time I bought destiny 2 with the amount of stuff that I've done within destiny 2 I am happy with my initial purchase of destiny - I would like more please sir I will buy your next DLC raid and I will fight osiris that sounds good that sounds like a good transaction thank you very much I knew that was coming I'm happy to pay for it I'm happy with my initial purchase I'm sure I will be happy with the Osiris DLC I am pissed off about the bright engrams that's a separate thing entirely and I wish that I had more to do in the game because of which the bright engrams weren't there I would have been happier to pay more for the DLC that's coming up and I would have been happy to pay more for the initial game if the bright and grams were not in the game all the content and items that are in the brighter games were in the game and there was mechanical processes to get those things right so I'm totally okay with DLC I loved the idea one of my favorite things ever was the battle chess for Warcraft 3 where you get the game in the expansion and if you went at the beginning and you bought the base game and then Frozen Throne comes out and you're like oh my god it's good that was awesome it doesn't make as much sense anymore because while I love that model and I would prefer that model it doesn't make as much sense anymore it's a very difficult thing to pull off something to that I think we're all forgetting is how pissed off we were about that model back when it first showed up with broodwar I wasn't okay a lot of people a lot of people were a lot of people were pissed off that all of a sudden they had a copy of a game Starcraft that wasn't compatible with in multiplayer with all their friends okay that's that's pretty poo but a lot of a lot of studios have fixed that you can have the newer the multiplayer is on its own layer and then single players on is only I I do agree with that but there's been trash at every stage and we've been mad every time yeah I think this is a new tier of trash in my opinion probably I think I'm getting old loot well yeah that's true and I've thought about that too though but this is the first time that it's reduced the content that there is in a game right okay that is directly there is actionable reasons why these cosmetic items because there's there's no way you're gonna look at a game like destiny - that is extremely about what your character looks like and go there really isn't that many cosmetic options when you make destiny - you would have made that game with a lot of cosmetic quests and weird things maybe an option for this thing that's kind of tedious and annoying and most people aren't gonna do it but then this one dude is gonna go know what this is gonna be my thing I'm gonna have the watermelon colored armor that requires you to kill these one dudes a whole bunch for whatever reason and no one else is going to do it never want to look at me and think that I'm cool because I did it that's content that's being able to show up when you're in your buddies fireteam and he goes oh wow cool you got that thing you got the hand of Ragnar O's you kill drag so many times that you got the hand of Regnerus that's amazing that's super it does no damage but it looks cool not directly lining up but like there's there's there's there's no no I know my point is just like sometimes you go and you get a unique item just for the sake of having it not because it's yeah yeah like like the idea of transmog so I was talking about this the other day the idea of transmog drives me crazy to transmog is the idea of being able to take an item and make it look like another okay that in my opinion dilutes the idea of the original item yeah and makes it easier for people to digest the idea of just paying money to look cool instead of playing the game to look cool I think transmog is like the gateway drug of just paying money for something to look cool because you can just make things look like whatever you want and the game becomes less about actually working and getting the cool things yeah I don't know so there's there's there's situations in games like destiny too and lots of other games where you can look at something like the raid or look at something like another piece of content and go there should be more here there should be another objective there should be a side thing there should be whatever so that I can get this other item that should be in this game and probably is just hidden behind a paid box and it sucks when that objective that goal that mission that quest that whatever is no longer in the game because someone probably thought about it it might have even been there on a certain build of the game and then someone else went hey that's a cosmetic item we can probably get away with putting that in the loot box that makes me sad Elon Musk wanna bet yeah our original article from ARS technica he said he would finish the world's largest battery installation in a hundred days or it was free it has 100 mega watts capacity a world record and they finished it on time 100 sorry 100 and 100 mega watt 129 mega watt hour battery installations a huge capacity and huge power delivery capability and it's the largest mega watt rating for any grid connected battery installation in the world and one of the snarky asides in the article is that this may be the first time that Elon Musk has ever delivered anything let alone early so you have to make him bet that's that's the hope he figured out because apparently musk said it would have cost Tesla 50 million dollars or more if the company failed to meet the deadline so I guess he was like alright sure let's do it that's what cool oh my gosh Pokemon go Creator raises two hundred million dollars ahead of a Harry Potter game launch you're gonna play it DOS I don't even like don't even pretend to to be like oh those silly people who are gonna play a Harry Potter game shut up I to be fair I did drop off of Pokemon go pretty quick yeah but that's not what I said I said you're gonna play this the biggest thing that annoys me about ya Niantic neon tech whatever everyone cone is that everything seems so half-assed like I used to play yeah what was it called ingress yeah yeah I used to play ingress a lot back when like not that many people played ingress I even played ingress win the game hadn't released in South Korea and I played Harry Potter there's only people playing it or traveling Potter was cool you're like an Etzel and I go hipster that's sad excellent I had control of like most of Seoul it was it was pretty freakin cool but I remember even playing that game I was like wow this is really you know I'm really just clicking the button and tapping it a bunch and nothing else really happens it's it's all super randomized there's really not a lot of substance to this game really cool concept oh so I'm going to keep trying hopefully they update it and hopefully it's cool and then Pokemon go came out it was like wow they really just skimmed the previous game there's really not a lot going people apparently don't believe we're live because the time on the computer is wrong Oh that's the right time wait what yeah they're just drunk a lot of people don't understand that Canada is really big it's dry yeah I got a question all the time what time is it in Canada I'm just like oh man that's not a thing cuz you know what you know what not making matters we should we should just do it we should have a Canada times Google is not helping okay because if you Google what time is it in can my god you actually see this is the problem Canada is they really do think they are the only Canada yeah um so just like I'm surprised it's not Toronto though but yeah they're just what time is it so that's our capital that's what time it is in our capital in not our capital it is literally three hours earlier yeah and then if you go further east it gets literally an hour and a half later yes that's right we have four and a half times and that is without some island in the middle of the Pacific America yeah we don't even need that to have four-and-a-half time zones okay yeah I'm gonna have in the States for I think I'm not in time no I think Eastern is as Eastern as it goes yeah Pacific to Eastern alright cuz we have what they have this here called does Alaska reach out into another one I'm not sure it might yeah oh there's anyone count Alaska I do free shipping on something it's lower 48 I mean they only count the lower 48 so why am I expected to keep which is I I know people from Alaska that are great people I know people from Alaska that are gonna heal me when classic Wow comes out so I have to be nice to them lordy alright so thanks guys for watching and we'll see you again next week same bat-time same bat-channel what are we gonna do about this we're gonna slice them together here somehow oh dear oscar has its own time zone I still don't count it I do know Alaska should be part of Canada I agree we screwed that up free back [Music] Black Friday [Music] 
The first thing i realized, about the Nvidia "Star wars Titan" graphics cards, is that they paired the jedi order with the galactic empire Which is just.. Tchh *inhales* *exhales* You know what though, It's fine. I mean full points for effort at least, and honestly I barely even care anyway Okay, thank you all for joining me um, i understand that Nvidia probably, had the best of intentions But *stutters* there's one fundamental problem here and that is that Senator palpatine darth sidious whatever the **** you want to call *******, These two entities Never actually oppose each other directly! Which led me to my second realization, We had to make a video that Showcased these bad boys So this my friends, is the "Mystic space warrior knowledge cube build" Intro* The twenty liter moss pack features a built-in charging station cable management Pass-throughs and it's been recently updated to include a few little improvements like better straps and a larger laptop pocket, Check it out at The link below Now with a warehouse full of computer cases you would think that after spending hours searching We could find something with the *inaudible* And space-age energy that we were looking for. So we set out to do something that, we.. Surprisingly, never done before here at LTT design and build our very own case From the ground up. So setting out to design this thing we only had a few rough guidelines in place we wanted it to look really cool, and Alex has been itching to play with our new Fabool laser co2 laser cutter from Smart DIY. So our design team immediately came up with Some wild and crazy ideas for complex Polyhedrons and ornate acrylic paneling that would fit our overall theme After all when it comes to imagination the sky is the limit right? No. Actually the limit is something called International copyright law, which is why our.. Decorative inscriptions are in klingon not aurebesh So after much internal debate and M A N Y failed attempts, Here's how, our final design ended up coming together or at least, we Wish it was that easy, we constructed our case from the bottom up Which meant putting together a wooden frame now wood isn't exactly.. A First-choice material when it comes to computer cases but, we aren't quite ready, to try our hands at fabricating a Metal frame....  Yet..... so we attached wooden pillars to a small sheet of mdf then We made holes for inserts for motherboard standoffs and a much larger hole for the gpu Next, we needed a starter hole for the GPU I/O, then to get a nice clean cut, we picked up a brand new Handsaw... That totally ended up sucking... So the hole looks super ragged. But since it's on the bottom of the case No one will ever see it provided of course that there was nobody standing around with a camera filming the whole thing The motherboard standoffs Went in a lot more smoothly and we elevated them on these big screws so we would have somewhere to tuck our cables After putting on the motherboard and Rog Strix Z 370 IMini itx board We added our CPU, An intel core i7 8700 k-6 core processor pretty much the best of the best for gaming right now and 16 gigs of DDR4 ram Then for cooling our first choice was a BeQuiet! Dark Rock Pro 3 tower cooler.. But Unfortunately even with low profile ram We were unable to successfully mount the tower so it looks like it's knocked to the rescue Now the centerpiece of this build is our StarWars Titan XP graphics card, So we opted to give it a Full frontal mount Which is not nearly as dirty as it sounds it just, means that, we used a PCI-E Extension to mount it in a vertical position front and center right here Now, let's see how it might look with some paneling Well ****..... Luckily a hasty modification can rectify that problem... Now we're not going to leave the frame showing exposed wood.. So we also need to give the whole thing a quick coat of paint, Then, Once we've got all the hardware loaded into our MK2 Frame, We can get to the most important part of any kickass case build Adding the RGB... With all the strips in place it's time to close it up But first let's get a nice good look at just how awesome that setup is looking.... As mentioned earlier, we used our faboo laser cutter to create our non-infringing designs and aside from a few minor hiccups that process was relatively painless So after another finishing touch and some decorative molding around the outside yeahhhhh now, we're looking good Once it was built though, we had to put it through the paces... I mean... You have a good idea based on the hardware you put in of how Something like this is gonna perform but, what's the point of owning a rowboat if you never ride it Does one write a rowboat? (Confused Linus) Not really the point.. Anyway, The thermals aren't quite as good as We might expect from an NH-D15, So it is a little toasty in there but our core i7 8700 case still managed to turbo to 4 gigahertz on all six cores with temps in the mid 70s and And gaming wise, This thing is a beast.. churning through even the latest Triple-A titles as you Would expect a Titan XP to do.... And remember, This is all in a case that was really not made with thermals in mind So in the end we love the results but We feel like in the future we've still got a lot of work to do for as the klingon proverb teaches Load up la *inaudible* linus... chill please linus XD -_- TunnelBear is the simple VPN app that makes it easy to browse privately and enjoy a more open internet....
