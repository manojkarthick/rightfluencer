what's going on guys today get here a welcome face today to a video that took so long to try and organize you have no idea what you see below my chin right there is 115 liquid Davidians yes we're about to go on the hide and no I did not play a long amount of time to amok these trust me was thinking about doing it myself I was like this is gonna take months and weeks and years the the amount of time I've been playing zombies at least to unlock a mouth but right now I'm not even playing on my main account so I'm only level 6 this is at my British character man England and we're gonna be open 160 now I'm prepared for what we're about to do we just opened a hundred fifty liquid video bottles so you know keep doing three but we're just going to take a long time to do but we're gonna try and see how many we can get this is where we're currently standing with the mega gobblegum so if we go over to mega I have one max mo one fire sale and one question mark don't really have anything else so we're gonna try and see how many polka holux we can get out of 115 and a lot of people might be saying like oh my god what a waste of money why would you do that I'll tell us right now as a Content create the ability to buy the gobble gums is awesome really really awesome kind of does suck that you have to buy them in a sense it would just be nice customizable option to do but it's a micro transaction that I'm more than worth happy to do and I don't know so we go down and straight into this place gem so are you ready to do 115 liquid davidians and see how many purple holidays we can get out of this this is gonna take an extremely long time but our first full and invitation liquidation I don't even know what that is oh it's like a random thing pop shots now we're just going to keep it going we're just gonna I'm just gonna keep my finger spamming this for you guys because otherwise it will take a long last time alright - Phoenix ups not good not happy with that but there is one ultimatum I wanna try and pull from this I will try and get a Boca holic with a double x - so I can get two per college in one we got an on the house which is pretty good so I'm okay with that that site that's the best one we're after unquenchable polka holic or let's do the one i map on the house unquenchable ya wrapped at one of them three so we've always had one of them so far so that is good so yeah it would be nice to go to trade these with people like if the person was on your friends list if you could send them one of them that would be pretty damn cool but I don't think you're going to juice at any time super keep going and see what we can get no a nuclear deal with a cash back and I'm feeling lucky not feeling lucky right now because I'm getting pretty much scalp this is 115 liquid Davidians and we gain Scouts only cod but I've got twelve thousand four hundred points that I spent Jose I think ed twenty thousand so I spent seven thousand five hundred Cod points to buy 115 so yeah what a point sighs it was poor I just don't it's like cool a video to do what double wait I got a double wait really I got two double reward so does that mean oh my god that okay see what happened there this we got double reward on a double on me what even was that so we can we just go back what do they even what I even just get um well it was it which was it is the weapon right okay now I kind of said that were there okay so it turns the weapon in your hands I packed 112 them for 60 seconds so we just got a shit ton of that we got four in one Paul there cuz we got two times double ups now we get to tangible and we get per coholic oh my god for perco holics will just be absolutely incredible so let's keep it going and pray and get your height trained in the walls down below if you guys fail to do this and you're awesome just cuz I feel like it guys alright I would use to leave your Twitter name down in the comments I what I'm going to do is I'm gonna hook one of you guys up with either PSN or Xbox what our whatever system you're on a cone okay so you can go ahead and like have a good chance of doing this so if I ever do these salt ones I'll make sure I get back to you guys we got an unquenchable that is pretty good for we're like we're down to 91 left and we still don't have a perk alike so leave your Twitter name down below in the comments make sure you leave a like rate or subscribe and I'll be giving away some PSN Xbox or steam codes if you guys to be able to download get some Cod points and give this to go yourself so it's like the gambling addiction of csgo is returned but with Call of Duty so we get a double reward if I'm feeling look it good imitation here so this should be just that's just crap we don't want that we don't want any of them I just say I don't want any of them put them random perks you like way you can unfeeling will keep them I'm actually gonna do a game play and playing with them and see how it goes we got an unquenchable which is pretty good I'm okay with that I like that answer you got really excited extra so as a per coholic and if I don't get a per coholic from 115 like vats I'm gonna be pretty pissed off by Oh only salt is hell we got an actual liquid divinium Wow 115 we get one and return that's it thanks for that cheers Trey appreciate us we're gonna keep it going down to 83 down to 83 already alright okay what again get the cash box really Reese spin cycle you get to rip in the box is that it is that it I'm not gonna lie I don't feel overly too impressed with my outcome so far the two doubles that we had though they were pretty sweet unquenchable we're still okay with this actually real I can quench looks if you get put unquenchable might be the best one why you might ask say this because if you get toka holic it gives you all of them right so you can start your game pretty easily says your word points that's going for you might not want to have dead char you might not want to have mule-kick so right now I'm thinking unquenchable is probably the best one for us to forget well the phone call it just badasses fun factor automate so we want to try and at least get one of them down to 74 still haven't had one this is making me feel super confident about ever purchasing these ever again just stay in track if you want to send me a bill in confidence I'd be okay with that to read spin cycles and in a thermal enhancement okay with this we're I think wait yeah we're nearly we're getting close to halfway close to halfway guys and I have yet yet y'all to get after Kahala nails it there we go boys that is this we got it on our six that was actually our 69 one right there we've got our first turki holic garrett is one per coholic three unquenchable our one on the house we've got a killing time which is pretty good as you can see that I've named my other look at my my my pax I haven't organized any of these because it's my you know my bridge can't do pointless but I organized this is the ball a set so the comet being the most expensive best one unquenchable on the house in all of which I think are the best and in killing time and cash back so it's pretty damn good we're non line or what might even say that's absolutely terrible alright so your I kind of want to purchase one I want to sugar I should have timed it so we had a sixty nine liquid Covidien I'd say what I'm going to do it no way I'm not they cut up all right let me buy three my black white students just watch it it's mathematical I'm tryna do so then we're going to waste too so let's see what to gives us so then we'll have sixty nine left we don't have quite output pull it out we've got unquenchable perfect safe statistical but now watch this so I'm gonna pull just one so I'm gonna cry if we get perk ahoy but this is my 16 hour quick video I'm gonna click it and we're gonna see what I won and always 69 is gonna be no power Boosh yes nice okay pretty good so we've got a power boost which puts us over and got the unquenchable if that would have happened we would have miss out any unquenchable so okay the 16-ounce was quite disappointing but we still got some oh good keep giving them I was just about safe keep giving them or quench balls it's the best I can get well this is this is really good for honestly comte grits a lot of people like oh I hate that it's microtransactions you can only look for the videos three in like 20 minutes wait am i getting it for pop shops yes what that is really good for pop shop is really good because if you didn't know I saw a video from all the youtubers and they said that you can kill the Mogwai in one night one knife just by running up to it hitting it with pop shops if you just run around with pop shops all time you get like three main ways of time or for mailers of time each rack up so could actually a win-win for us right there I'm okay with that amount that we just pulled and unfortunately I do have a second account here now in the UK to play - I'm gonna get to level 35 max out all guns and I'm not going to prestige so sort of thought it's just what I got to do once I'm in the UK we got a perk AHA like there we go to third colleagues we are just we are kind of just over halfway now so over halfway to pick Pollock's I want to by the end of this at least up five per comics you know I'm saying on five I want to be rolling in it I don't need an extra liquid divinium because we kind of have them with it now as it stands we can just keep mine if you don't know I do see us go unboxing videos where I go ahead and be like ah screw it we're gonna do some csgo boxing and I ended up spending a shitload of real-life money on that I've spent probably about $5,000 on csgo and boxing so I'm probably gonna spend about $5,000 on purpose I'm not even it's gonna be a thing what guess keep what we got what we got we got pop shops oh I'm okay with I'm happy with pop shops really I'm okay with that kind of like it I think it's perfect all's good in the hood with that but there's something that I completely didn't think about just just from seeing it spin let's cook let's go to customize real quick all right so obviously got shit on anyone's justice but next time you technically damaged art know if it's longer hits you they sound fire okay that's kind of okay but not okay the reason why I like pop charts which we have seven of great success really happy with that is that if this is on being front of you actually that's five activations what the shit seven times five times about thirty-five I've thirty-five melee hits basically effectively in case like if I'm real upset stairs or down the hallway and I can't have no armor just knife the zombie and be like oh shit knife in bounce the fuck out there and we're good to go it's a basically get I call it a get-out-of-jail-free card let's dive back into the factory and pray for more thorough holux come on No it gave us to liquid avidians did you guys not get the memo that I don't need to shit I literally have a limited as it stands right I'm actually really happy try outright heartless cuz I even said in a livestream I would pay for liquid Davidians so I can just spin it do the sauce Sheila I love this but the ruler of it you can go away and earn this legit burn it yourself don't ever have to buy it ever thought but someone like me as a content creator approachable yeah on the house yes I actually like on the house cuz I want to do a challenge where I only do on the house and I'm not you know picking you before perks and we do on top of it that map's no doubt yeah but coholic that's what I'm talking about three Furka Holdings but with the on the house I want to hit it get it out the bike like yeah swag swag swag spawn it in then what I want to do is you know just get all four don't want to go over it just four and then see what four I can get can be sleight of hand it could be you know let's go widows wine me doubles up and you never get juvenile but and we just see how far we go so she pretty cool but I'm nearing my tits oh hey look at that on the house thank you how's it take it I'm gonna gear up for the new map pack when that map rocks man I got like 100 per coholic I'm talking about I'm feeling it this just allows us to do more fun challenges more fun challenges which costs money to be able to do the twin challenges again you could do it yourself both triac I am okay with this decision you guys might not like it but I'm good and the reason why I asked you guys to put your Twitter name down below on the house whip whip I'll take that reason why I asked you guys to put your - it ain't down below is because I use that to do giveaways and stuff if I find something sorry if I do a giveaway on my ate there's just Twitter I go to their Twitter and I just the M the so you better follow me on Twitter links down below make sure you follow me and I'm gonna hook you guys up fight style all right fight stuff what else we got we got two times so we're gonna get two buns out and two after tastes this actually also helps us fur you know like the do the challenge is run by a I'm doing the medic so you know the medic I can pick up my teammates with the perps and just pick up all the teammates revive across the map pretty good we can keep it going hot shocks and wall power and who's keeping score not exactly the greatest pop shocks is good but the other two like double points I don't know I hoped react does continue to create you want to B's because as of right now they're a little bit you know they're a little bit meth there's a lot of them that are a bit they're like you can activate some becomes or what is it your gun fires the special ammo for 60 seconds it's like no it should make it always fire the amyloid right should make it really really fun so if you do get like the gobbles on this like yeah just grab it so we'll just see how it goes but let's keep going we're down to 17 gobbles about 17 fucking what that we've all from right now we've got another pop shot we've got a double rewards so we got even more pop shops give us some to pop shops will take them that's pretty sweet but I really want to get that ultimate one guys I want to get those I want to get one burger holic with two double ups and just be rock'n'roll before polka Hallows oh the dream no we don't need that I know I sound really like negative to one in free liquid divinium but we just don't need it I guess we'll take it us fine but we're down to our last three spins unless we get any more we've got another board Oh killing time is actually the like one of the rarest ones it's not that effective to me because I don't use it for at least we got a lot more so if you like a high round run it could come in handy to get us out with some sticky situations killjoy Imperial and Huntsman and burned out still my feeling the boys still not feeling it this should make it one day where you can write make nine just like like a hundred but understand right so after this spin they only do it to unquenchable I like that oh we got that so I'm gonna do right now because we're only going to do a one open absolutely fall let's leap let's do a three and then we'll we stuck with one individual one spin and we got Bob jocks killjoy and dead some new pillow in there well I only came up with three per colics at all kinda sucks for actually kind of sucks but I think $30 is it about fuck not yeah for about $40 that's spent on the actual liquid Davidians I got through fur bollocks out of it we'll have to assess whether or not it was a able to worthwhile trip but this is gonna be our last but not least C to the PlayStation 3 for PlayStation 4 black up 3 ps4 controller alright so are you ready this could be our last liquid to video model our 150 what are we gonna gain 3 2 1 please do not falter coholic on the edge that I'm gonna miss I got power boost so give me hero material enhancement and it gave it a liquid Davidian interesting but not that good wait that means we get one more so that wasn't our last one you guys ready if you are ready leave a hot like ready get some height going if we can hit whoa it's your wife we can hit 150 thousand like raisins but open 150,000 I mean oh gosh take a long time 115 bats that'd be sick so you ready three two one let's do it what are you gonna give me come on give it up give it a swag give it a swag get a swag yo we lost our unquenchable you shit Flickr and I get a double points that's so great yay oh yeah I always wanted one of them right I was going to are gobble gums I want to customize I'm gonna see what we got across a hall wow we actually got quite a lot everything Vladdy care alright so obviously we don't get any classics for ten after tastes ten burn out i don't use any of these pretty much ever ten nukes which will come in handy for being a medic kit ten of the interior enhancements see what I mean is like to activation last 60 seconds it should just be like hey even if your gun isn't packed if that should be changed even if your gun is a pack punch it fires you know special ammo and then you go buy otherwise basically effective like pack punch it it's nice they just screw it you know I mean all right moving on I'm feeling looking 15 I'm feeling what he spawns in two rounded power-ups that is gonna be fun to use your playthrough and I'm gonna call it that I'm feeling lucky challenge it should be pretty good got six fire sales we've got five carpenters Caramella the Phoenix will provide all teammates teammates cavallo the third we're gonna be using that for the medic kit so I need to get that rock and rollers we got pop shot twelve of them times five six sixty no bad rats no sixty I'm right 5 10 50 25 yes yes yes chomp that is 60 pop shot melee individual knives that we can have so keeping really really useful for shadows of even some lucky pods seeing how that pans out 7 respawn cycles I don't think I've ever use that one once I don't think it up getting to use it anytime soon 8 unquenchable 's god damnit it Dora domine Oh ex plays when you buy a textbook great stuff all of that six double points whatever five máximos kind of good only one activation though you could say it would be a bit too powerful if you know save get back a hundred of them you can buy one each round it's just like okay one activation that seems kind of out there killjoys spawns an insta-kill I don't understand why that's a rare beggar that should be like putting the category we like fighting my assailant carpenter like if the double points how is that mega as well I don't know actually it is a mega that's fine yeah how is that a mega that should be a rare mega Ram ogre mega mega rare make that okay whatever so we got six of them for six core guys we got four on the house perms so we don't all that could be it's obviously random he's fine it's a pretty bottle you grab it and yet chat again expert only four of them so I went to have just enough to be able to do the charge so as a Content career it'd take me forever you know like if I were to go and get that amount of work with the B's wife or putting a play playing okay back here and I only ended up without one on the house or not at all but like no I can't do this really cool challenge idea that I want to do so now it's been the opportunity to do that so like I said I want to have four of them see what four books I can get and just have some fun with it so can't wait to get that challenge recorded so that we come up with sweets inside maybe five War Powers actually kind of like this one may be tempted just a baby be tempted to give that one a go as a challenge sooner I'm not on its back punch has to be by doing it this method and just see what round we could get two three ultra rare ultra rare mega pudding el potro beggars also be cruising close to 20 seconds if they're shot they will be annihilated when the time is up Charlie cool you know so basically just activate it shoot them they're all gonna die you get to run off you come back in or despawn I guess that's okay I don't understand why it's an ultra rare mega it should kind of be like further away just submit them and then the main man of the event the perk or colleague ultra rare mega gives you all the perks laughs so I'm obviously gonna do this a shitload more like opening these look the Davidians up until when the new map drops the Iron Giant no the ant dragon when that drops I'm swaggin for the focused on when that drops angry ready with so many polka holic so if there is a new perk in the game I could literally just go you know use a gobble game machinery style game you gonna shoot until like within like you know the first couple rounds until I get an all-around mega and it'll give you a way of the Reaper keys so you don't need to go up to find it but guys I hope you enjoyed this if did make sure you would like rate and subscribe hopefully we'll be doing this again soon it should be some good fun if you guys do either shit like I said if I'm gonna end up spending a shitload of my money I'd opening these pumps and stuff like that and getting these per colleagues I would be able to give you guys the chance and opportunity to do it as well so like said leave your Twitter feed on Twitter and make one follow me I'll put my to it down below so

ladies a general welcome you faces back to another csgo unboxing what the hell a winter offensive key an operation Vanguard case key and a revolver case key I decided to go for 10 sexual looking keys and the next set of keys that I'm going to be doing by the way is going to be a three choice selection from you guys so leave a comment the most requested Keys I'm gonna be opening ten of each so yeah leave comments down below I want to see your three comment keys and yeah welcome back to a case opening where we're just gonna get it straight into this today because I am feeling the Christmas spirit off the wintery joy which means you're gonna get I really wanted em for us Mike and I were just good at trends this day without even fuck around asking questions are doing shit and we're starting with a 5 7 k Camry and honestly I have no idea when the last time we actually even opened a winter offensive key was I don't even know if we have note on this channel I had an awkward line and buck to myself I know I've had one of these just for the safety cabinet but I don't remember I have actually done this myself but I recognize they could go low go low a our Sun star book what did we get ourselves a nod today guys because I'm feeling it Santa Claus is out there riding in the sky dropping off knives to keep keep waving he's dropping off knives to kids that probably pretty violent but it's right you know he's safely delivering golden special rare items to people and I tell you right now I am gonna be one of them and it doesn't matter that it's a g3 sg-1 Turkey because we're gonna mix up we're not just gonna open you know just the winner cases back to back we'll mix it up with some Vanguard cases and even though this is one of the most ugliest cases of all time it does consist of take a Griffin that is delicious it consists of a wasteland rebel which actually in fact renew is quite an expensive skin but also we don't care we just want a knife oh I got to show you guys this take a look at this pump boy shut up I get this weapon net and it's fact renew sending your lives look at this people actually spend seven or nine someone's some of these called Spidey's he named them I don't if you're going to send them in a name of this everything is called the Spidey's which looks pretty fucking awesome book books crimson web sent me in this don't do cases kids which is a true fact you shouldn't do it which is fucking dope then we got one of these a forest d that good knife and we got a book by Safari Meshal T fine gentlemen or women out in the world thank you very much but that's crazy it was like me calling your bluff if you're actually going to do it or not but to those of you actually selling in I appreciate that a lot the night collection will grow and we will collect the most awesome that fraction you've ever seen on in two words we're gonna keep it going we're gonna try and mix up the in-between of weapons we select we have no techniques we have no reason to have techniques on one techniques because we know either way we're gonna get a knife we got the ricochet that means we have to open another straight away of that cases ricochet basically means bounces back when we give it another go for stattrak p2000 ah gotta go with minimal where it's factory new okay they really need to go back to the drawing board with this and say listen this is the board this is the people who make the gun stick them together and realize that that is not a factually looking good I will just for the sake of it see how much that gun is worth now working with these cases had come down in price like 60 pence acute okey a case a keister akisto a team restore but it's come down in price but that gun is you actually boxed on 50 so that's pretty good but we should keep going alright I'm gonna open some well oh I started out to the start it is that me we're not gonna get it that's the first time honest to God that I've seen in that a knife for for so clear I can't believe that just happened the excitement in my veins just flown up to open winter offensive now I don't care my I'm an extra bottle I'm already off some of just my past no wait what wait that is supposed to be that where's what the fuck went wrong with these guns Oh feel tested are you taking the piss on a baton I don't even know where ever time comes not one of them think it's spinning flicking the aerbook we just got trolled so hard the gold literally started and when jr. weaved itself goodbye and fucked up to a different direction actually father what has happen there I don't even care all I want to do is open these winter offensive keys I love seeing that red Assam off because that Assam off is one of my all-time favorite skins and again we get visited in the room Sam stormed as a trawl but we saw that is the clearest I've ever seen a knife if you know I feel like I need to take a minute to just a bottle my sunglasses play it cool and open got and I'm star an operation manga no bother oh god damn it a red went past this is a that's a really nice urban five seven but fire elemental Alberta common engine M&amp;Ms or elements will web past I'm trying to see if I've got anything my room back can hold on for look will hold my bike key a key is kind of a knife you use it to open packages when you're really angry oh you don't have any of the way stop feeling tap my Mike we're gonna see a knife again I can be fucking troll I don't even get one how much you take that is that's factually that is better than anything to me I'll be good that is not fight renew its feel to as as the chart just completely broken this apparently is factoring canoe you take it a piss this is clearly oh now it's a background that makes sense that makes sense it did actually say it was field testing might have been that one and that that's field tested as well I'm sure that pops-up seniors field-testing I was like there's no fucking way that's wrong with these guns oh that has to be physically impossible possibly but we're mixing up I don't think I ever want to just stick to one of every case I want to mix it up like five these five of these five of these just to give us a bit of selection and difference because I feel like that's the best way for us to obtain getting the one and only : kidnapped I'll take Reds but what what the fuck just happened there um should try again I didn't even click infantry just gave me an item is that no fuck you and threw it at me yeah I'll take the tec-9 a bunch I'll take the sky joining our rig what the hell just awesome and I think like I think the alien illuminati is hacking into our systems again so you can all go fuck yourselves or my dad's just messing my internet cable like there was recording a video go fuck you but we've got how many with offensive Kesey Cutler I'm not that many so we'll open some vanguards we're gonna just keep we're gonna keep them keep the juices flowing a randomly combination shit I don't know what the hands are about but we got a highwayman don't even know what that looks like yeah this is actually kinda nice it looks like a piratey sort of weapon feel tested I'm okay without got you know good good combination of purples so far we started with a Griffin which was field tested which looks not that bad it's just a it's a boring good it's not colorful you're not saying it's not it's not like that it's not it's not no it isn't it's not a fade or something amber fade it's not a fade r8 revolver even though I already have one of them I couldn't be asking boxing it so I just bought it so I went against every principle oh whoa are you gonna fracture you as well fuck yeah even having a laugh you can't be fucking serious Oh fucking bus yeah shit we almost got like $400 a whaler instead we got trolled so I'm gonna go again we'll go throw of a bad guy it's just like the most troll case opening I've ever done I saw a knife go past I got I saw Reds go past this is what this was worse than then it just randomly doesn't even let the case spin it just randomly gives me something so are we gonna see something nope pick two pings go past and I guess that's that tracks car you're not a fucking bubble squeak right let's open the Vanguard and let's skip it oh I'd rather regret doing I mean I immediately regret this decision and go let this one spit I'm gonna mess with the forces of nature but force is offered to nature although I throw the kinder and everything just so it sounds like catnip to buy it by the way if you don't know what I do with these csgo unboxing videos is the highest rated skin so in this case TV going to do this this this on this I think I'm probably gonna kill wedge this the Griffin leave your steam profile name down below not your nickname your actual name so I can get in touch with you and send you that skin I'll name it something send it off to your beautiful faces and if it takes forever to send here it's just because it does this a week is like a 10-day trade ban on it something or is it buds pretend days it's like eight day trade binary all right so if I can send it to you I can so leave a like rate and subscribe and comment down below of your cut every name but let's continue if three revolver cases we have three operation bank card cases and we have three winter offensive cases no Bonacci that was the thing alright so oh wait we got four I think I just have a spare case but we definitely up three keys well let's keep it smoothly going and let's see if we can see another can it go past nope fuck you I don't even want to try and pull with it as a root Sunstone I'd rather I'd rather die that's your Giroud sandstorm wander my inventory come on can you give you a ricochet now it gives me an Imperial but this is not the Imperial mattress not Star Wars alright I'll actually go for another ban guard I think we did not have three weeks left but we're not even gonna ask you out not even this is Christmas time goddamnit gaben is Christmas time I'm trying to give the viewers good skins yes they could go and click the link in the description to go and enter to win the dragon law csgo lot alright if you actually click the link in the top of description it'll take you to a giveaway to be able to enter to win a dragon war for free it's a $1700 gun and it could be used to win for Christmas so yeah thank me later but until then don't thank me thank Gaiman and give me some luck for getting a knife which is going to not happen for that gun is red that is actually a gorgeous-looking going factoring you oh my can we just appreciate that that is a good-looking gun see that's a good-looking gun this is not a group is this pact renew again right so this is the difference between faction in let me let me school you right here with members I look like school that is factory new no marks no nothing we go on over to this bitch it looks like someone got two guns fisted them together threw them on the floor drove over them and then it opit like what is this there's no way this is part of the pod it's clearly ripped to shreds I don't understand that it must just be the design of the gun because I can't see how that is factory-new is that fight rate faction new factory new field-tested factory new I I literally can't even does this a fax on field-tested that looks a bit more than field-tested but either way to continue going i don't just don't understand why gaben decides on things like this so red go buy it we'll take the Glock we'll take the Glock no we won't take a step Chuck mag-7 instead yeah which is actually really nice factory new fields fields assets that might be my favorite I'd be my favorite one actually got the mag the mag 17 which is pretty good down sexy may I'm becoming like a connoisseur of quality of the items and which is the best looking so if I could continue being concert yes I'll take it up lunch love that gun I bought is quite high rate we got in the purples so I might end up giving what if it's factually I'm giving away oh it's what okay you know I just said I was like a connoisseur I take that back how did that come out battle-scarred alright okay yeah I'm going back to school to try and learn my my things wait we went down to three keys we've only got three days left oh shit that up and quick right let's open one of these little first case middle key and the hope for an it I really thinking of doing a case opening like vanilla case opening no editing like every day of Christmas and magma I don't know well I haven't seen this before that is absolutely deal oh there because it's battle scar I've never seen it before but I have no idea that existed that is a really really nice gun it's like a Matt's got like a marble fade to it kind of like it actually I like it I like it or not right now what do we do we do we go back doing the old school trick meenie miney mo castigating a little when it's done what is comes with hi the last team to kiss and we saw a gold in a winter case we didn't see anything good there and we didn't get the sky it's the ugliest thing why did he makes cars green it doesn't make sense for out of all this we go we actually got nothing good or any these factory-new know no place the peach the p2000 it's not that's not even the best good so I've got to decide Oh actually I tell you can do it this song wait oh wait the Solway hymen is the highest of the Purple's yeah it's the highwayman the highway how you made matter we've got a look at the case of Jay it's actually yeah yeah well sure the case there you go so it goes boom the highwayman is actually the highest rated skin so you guys are gonna be winning this so if you want that leave that comment down below I know it's not exactly the most enticing the skin I'll name it something something good as you could have the chance of winning it but we got our last key last key guys you ready this is the one and only for a win it offensive now I never look I never look so I'm going to put on a pair of sunglasses so you don't over I'm looking and I'm joking I never look we're gonna go with a blast key with a last case we saw a gold at the start I will happily take a NASA moth or the Kraken Shaun off I took an art read but I'm actually really like that I also like the Guardian and I actually really like the rising school I think I'm gonna do next video we're gonna just do this so it's like it's like 60p a cage which is quite expensive issues like six people I think we're going to do just this case next time but listen gentlemen let's spin this last case wish me luck gave it a heart that will open up heaven he's not dead though so gaben out in that armchair spinning his money and bitches give me a key I mean a knife but I'm not looking I won't work to prove you're not looking this close okay wasn't anything are you fucking serious I got a root and of course it is field-tested so yeah best unboxing video ever so for their purposes this is called the sawn-off highwayman alright I came up with the original idea of the highway Maine yay blaze it so yeah that's what I just decided so whoever wants to win this it's all yours I guess you could say it's a special item because I came up with it and I'm giving it you but other than that it's not exactly a red it's nothing special it's nothing epic but you want to win it like said we've seen profile name down the road which you would like to subscribe and I guess it's opener taken so guys thank you very much for watching this case of boxing cannot believe we got so true with that fucking goal like beyond upset about that if we could have got that out of it stoked but nonetheless thank you for watching I'll see you guys next time and goodbye you Hey

I'm just gonna say fuck it and join them let's just hope they don't find a fucking shotgun oh shit where'd you say toshiaki I can that was a terrible idea this is like deja vu all over again look at the amount of people landing in this area you know what screw that those guys can have houses I'm gonna become a camper all right all I need is a pistol or an ak-47 I don't know why I'm just on the hype of getting the pistols in this game and going for it so fuck is going on all right I can see this geezer think he's done in this igloo in there we go that's how he's gone you let him loot and then you fuck him in the boot come on uh pretty sure I can hear more people so I'm not exactly - whoa who's just been shot over in like it all bands sad the front of his house waiting for people to

God I checked this house whoa I could be nasty for kills oh yeah yeah I am liking this game hand it all over what the hell is going on in this neighborhood man we've had four kills boys it's just a dream game I've got armor for days good amount of ammo that's actually available I reckon this guy's upstairs in his house there's one is he shooing up I ninja'd that kill then I'm gonna go ahead and show that you know he gets a smile see now this guy doesn't know where I am I don't think so wherever he is I think he's feeling a little bit pinned down by me at the same time he could be completely raided up oh shit whoa whoa other areas there he is there's our boy I don't know waste to my channel all right we've let him know we're here have to go have some fun where's May okay fucking roll I

second shot did Lando's like ah okay now that's the end of everything well we got it we got it right do you want to switch out save this for the hunting rifle hell yeah we do this guy seems like the kind of guy who has traps this guy seems like the kind of guy who has traps not a fan of this guy you know sneaking up on me like that okay okay we stay in a hundred percent pop this game I get what's going down if I get to five are pretty much dead so let's see how this pans out wait is that the sound of a drop I see anyone that takes care of that thank you and then that for that okay this entire town hasn't been searched I'm throwing that out there right new not been searched not in the slightest so I'll tell you what let's go and gather it okay that's no not the direction I was hoping you place bookshop oh wait someone has actually been here father is missing okay game over a few muffin it let's see if it good okay we get away with this this I don't know how much that slurp juice heals it seems kind of soupy but I just don't take that instead okay that was a that was a bit too much emmalin for one guy you know to kill one guy on zone that really was you know what move this tree this route route might I sweat Bruce just getting away this is talk even when in my position but I don't even get kind of a place stop around here sucks I start you in the tree land but I can see you're

careful for that guy I need you to bounce off the tree my stop wasn't him you hit me yo if he gets distracted and there's gunfire I might be able to survive 4 plate I wasn't even for place I was 700 K so this may come across a bit strange now because up until now you've not had to seen a victory in this gameplay video but what I'm gonna try and do is something a little bit different what you guys have been watching is you see all these little splits here is we're gonna cut out the moments where I might not even talking I'm just like collecting materials I'm just like you're making my way from A to B well my popular demand a lot of people in say Tom can you just post a for gameplay from the moment you jump in to the moment here end and I'm like you know what I'll do a vote on a dinner bow on Twitter and out of 21,000 people 56% of people wanted the full damn thing thrown in which to me at a personal preference is a bit like oh no I don't wanna watch someone run for 30 seconds straight I'm not speak because they're just walking around wondering and stuff like that I don't know light as the gameplay commentator you kind of fill them gaps of quietness with like commentate and so fuck what I decided to do here is let you guys enjoy half the video where it's all trimmed together and then what you're about to see is a four-game point so at the end of this video once you've watched if you leave a comment down below if you want to see a full video or you want to see clip like in the future I really appreciate that cuz I'm trying to find like the fair balance of what people enjoy the most of the show but nonetheless prepare yourself for the victory royale this is the gameplay you're about to watch there's some quiet moments in it for me apparently some of you guys want to see that so nonetheless enjoy the video this is about to be a nightmare this is actually about to be a nightmare I'm gonna dive out as fast as I can landing the new town of lucky landing alright just sound like a Town Plaza Park toast height Hills yeah lucky landing doesn't really sound like a place I'm just go for it I'm like in I'm in the mode the mode the mood to just like be surrounded by players and just go ham groaning there's gonna be absolutely shit tons of people London here like absolute shits on this and that's exactly what alone right now I just want a chaos fight so let's let's hope for the best alright how many people are gonna launder this bill with it nobody okay we got some armor nice white dude no one else jump out did everyone go tell it or something stop fuck is this guy shoot me from oh he's up there alright he's being shot by someone else okay well I already lost a load of alt shit not exactly the greatest cameras a bitch yeah was a bitch I haven't think that was the guy to shoot me actually he smells he gonna move over because I killed that guy and even up to Bill let's go we up is it worth checking the building I was in is there gonna be a lot loot in here I'm not actually check these buildings ever before that's like my first time really aligned around here first time oh nice I was definitely expected a lot more players lined around here that is for sure like I killed one he was shooting at someone else that's toll of three no-one else just showing showing them soldier okay it seems a bit odd to me but fine thank you let you go yet sucker Oh someone's building away from it I'll actually start building towards me I just melt lead that gotta help me not dead I'm gonna say I just melt lead I got how was he not dead right now he's two sides now I'm still a guy in hey by the way he's come in handy right where's this guy he's got to die he's gonna die he's been alive for too long a pair oh he's been alive for too long a pair right he was shooting you he was shooting you he was shooting you don't for this dead quick even better John wicks Alan's pistol right now who was shooting me oh shit there's a lot of loot down there is he someone is it someone over here like who's taking shots at me I really don't know I really really don't know who's taking Chozen I think I heard you seek it up with me boy you don't think I heard you get out here scared here let's go to a shop now they got that down there though there's a lot of loot drops in this area a lot of loot seen on there no he's still this other guy down in this town I don't think he left that building I really don't I got remember that I dropped all that stuff over there like a lot of stuff over there by all those minis down at the bottom this Hill how can we should go get him I still think there someone in this building I really do like if these meters are gone that guys took him there's someone still around here I'm like telling you for fact I've got no materials whatsoever Oh mah GAD is not good not good that's good that good five kills from my first drop in lucky London not bad not bad you know one such this swagga like account yes no that's a good sign it's definitely a good sign unless there's actually still someone just over here and they're just waiting for me to fucking mess o up so you can drop me like it's out god damn hope not I really hope not actually thanks oh this is probably out gay probably got people can make some really strap a bloody building lightest what is this anything any nope all right where is the last remaining souls run around in this town I refuse to accept there's no one else here I refuse to accept it I refuse to accept that some walls of some sort would actually probably help around here if I see someone come running out of that building there I have a heart attack like I heard them I didn't see them leave I didn't hear them weave they could have just absolutely bounced out there for sure but like to suspect man I'm convinced is someone still there I'm convinced but we've got an assault rifle shai pistol health armor okay get it better you know wait whatever oh it's going dark time great great great great where are you my buddies where are you my friends my AR wants to say hello to your face hello to your face I don't think that entire back buildings been searched because we rushed in there pretty good damn quick I don't think anyone else that what about the chance to search anything but to be fair we are all rightly geared so maybe we should just spend this time to go collecting some loot because we need it we need their materials brah are you joking is that another 50% health ow ow a lot of the materials to build up to that Wow nicely fair nicely found nicely found I don't really sitting up in like this actually stop someone from being out to pull off like a perfect headshot yeah if you're doing this like you're healing like does your head shut hit hit box move if it does that amazing I would assume it does it make sense for it to do mate next time I might just land on this bridge there's a bloody shotgun here there's a chest there's all sorts this is this is the place to be I'm telling you right now this is this is it this is it okay I didn't mean to pick up any of that so awkward thank you i rad it's already sit under the bridge anything to the bridge anis no no we had five kills and they just go like deadly silent mmm I don't like it I don't like it I don't like it at all 15 remaining where could they be as a small little snack from 117 meters that's nasty I don't even hear that shot it's also no clue without guys I do see them and stares up there that is pretty central to the circle so there could actually be someone around that could be there could be someone round their circles moving in hello factory I've got a little bit of swag here not a lot just a little bit it's been some there's been some shootouts going down here in the middle of town okay let's keep moving let's get into the circle let's get into it tell you whether he shot me from over here yes he did nice right so he killed him yeah I wonder if he saw me I think you did mind him PG Underground is he really gonna leave that where did he go what the fuck this guy just vanished like legit unless he's in that case which he might be he vanished that's good all misplace I could see him going terrible shooting on evil till we managed to chop it down nice guy damn that guy's got a lot of loot holy shit alright we haven't got longer don't be smart again alright so I'm gonna switch that out for this we're gonna switch out that for this and then everything else we're taking Wow I really you know what probably should have taken we are on the back end of this so we might be alright we may be okay Oh minigun don't want it yeah ya think one of the back end of the circle so I'm a bit might be alright pushing him me my accuracy was terrible on that guy but when I'm 80 I serve someone dead cos I'm terrible like I really happen that's just a that's a personal problem alright we see you know I'm moving up we're gonna get sniped from a distance can i oh I was gonna say can I cross a without taking damage probably not and I didn't really write seven remaining six kills in the bag alright where y'all at suckers where y'all at alright in the blazing let's get up on this hill a little bit see if we can find anyone I like this little bit of cover a little bit of cover got an RPG no okay hot PG in a bank and what else pushing it from behind us it doesn't seem like it let's see anyone down there odd up here hello my friend what are you I'm behind those trees doesn't seem like it either yup yep someone's building up there let's try and take his own staircase I know this

Strauss he's going to this foggy island just north of Germany sorry what did you say sorry sorry what was up what would he what are you just saying he's gone to this foggy island just north of Germany oh my god sledgehammer why don't worry it might not be bad fuck gosh no triac told them to do this as a troll no no is this actually is this a real video is this actually oncology's yeah um be me I'm being meand from my own meme that I was the guy who created the fog rolling in meme don't mean me we wanted to play with this idea of what happens when fog rolls in you can't see them until they're no no it's like trongs it's like trying to go all over again no the ripsaw my favorite weapon in the game okay it is a combination buzz okay gun and it handles zombies up close we've gotten experimental ways okay that sounds awesome big gameplay here and we've created a new zombie oh no please don't be faster please no beef a strategic now one of the scariest creations that I've ever seen okay that's all we see we see a new good and find out this fog Komachi we can't wait for you get your hands on the resistance okay this zombie mode the doc is sure the Carrington bonus map all right where's that where's the sneak preview a bit more zombies we don't have any okay so let's recap I like the idea of it being on a shore totally cool but do we really he's gone to this foggy island just see we really need fog rolling guys like come on we learned from transit it's a terrible idea we get it helps load up the map and like you know to make the game not likey and all this sauce to put real do we need more fog like literally look out this window right now well this way I'm gonna switch look out that window the fog is literally literally rolling in we know what happens when the fog rolls in let me just go ahead and show you the fog rolling in black ops 2 zombies orgies gameplay trailer parody this first is what happens sake why why can we just leave the fog alone alright but for real for a second I'm stoked to see what the new zombie map is my only problem right now is when I'm actually playing the original map but I couldn't even tell you what it's called right now like that's how memorable it is to me but like when kino der toten came out i could replay it and replay it and replay it every play it every play of some reason it just thought this something that just made it amazing and I just absolutely loved it but like with this zombies don't get me wrong it's their first attempt at the world war 2 it'll just get better with time we hope bought their start in their next step with far groaning it's one of the number one things a zombie plays we actually hate and they were just throwing it straight and our faces is the first ever DLC pack but you know what I guess I guess that's what it is I guess that that's how it is and there's nothing we could do about it so we have to be positive and go you know what it might be amazing the fog might not be that bad by the way can't just show you what's playing in the background right now I'm not too sure what's going on is this JC's dad no one likes the fog rolling in the meme is too strong why are they meaningless like I said let's not be too quick to judge I'm looking forward to DLC coming out who knows how good it's gonna be my potato it might be amazing I just like them to make it more fun to play with other people because it's right now I've got no reason to want to jump online and play it I'd rather play pub gee I'd rather play fart now I'd even rather play old school runescape which shout-out to my my crafting levels level 52 us harder but I'm hoping they'll get their shit together they'll get it going and who knows the fog rolling in might not be too bad so let me know leave a like rating if you're excited for the new map leave a dislike if you're not a fan of fog rolling in but more importantly if you love the tasty memes and you love the fog roll and then make sure you smack that like right in and I guess I'll finally make more zombie videos when a the map comes out oops by the way if you're still here and you're like Tommy you never post videos I actually do daily vlogging on YouTube calm forward-slash life if Tommy if you click the link in description you can see every daily vlog of me from the past two and a half years subscribe okay bye

to the kills with the VPN so we can get like fast mags all that sort of stuff and said that that's one part of action but we're gonna stay up here until we just die I'm really know about bothered about getting to a high round or anything like that all I'm doing is prepping to be able to get to a high round ready tink just take him out I got preserve this ammo as much as possible because again I don't have that much and it runs out like crazy but even when the insta-kill runs off so no epic names thank you very much for subscribing walkabout look at that I was like a - spray I was like a for Gingka rinkie look at that it's just so good well let's be honest yes I am on round 12 but it's just so good I'm just gonna keep it in the mystery box until we get monkeys I've probably hit this box now as 70 plus times and not once have I had the the monkeys I've once once once gone ahead and got the Wonder Wharf but nothing else since then I know it's sad times but ladies a general way where you are treat you take them out I know is there Oh chill bro try do some sniffing some sniffling because I got double tap it's just like a one-hit kill up until like maybe 2007 I don't like round 21 boobs to hit to be kill it could be even less than that but it's just greatness look at it greatness awaits PlayStation I don't want that locus the look is actually really good sniper rifle when you get it for free on shadows of evil whoa we just got a quad one two three four yeah we can get Quadra this bad boy nice that is that that is how you be efficient with your that's how you be efficient with your weaponry out there lays and gents line them up take them out we don't want that either wait I was only one one guy will take him allies oh we got rapid fire it for it the more attachments we get for it the better I don't review you actually get a crapload more xp for getting headshots bought you're gonna try for them headshots you know we're gonna we're gonna try to keep going let's keep going we shouldn't actually hit the box until we're out of ammo with anything because then we could just swap swap to and continue surviving off there get out round 14 still going and I was looking good and was looking not so good but don't forget we will get dog rounds in between it so we're just going to keep going we're just gonna keep going so oh speaking of which we're now gonna get max ammo so I'm just using this as an excuse to be out spam spam Miami 265 kills 100 hundred 25 headshots damn that's it in same ratio since a ratio take that I'm pretty sure that was it black ops 2 where they released the option to be able to do headshots only mode don't know why they fell that was a good thing there we go boy wait we'll throw them Atari go fetch and I'll put this one here is a backup I should actually fill this up with a line of them just in case you get a bit too close Wow best grenades ever I mean best best best claymores ever 10 outta 10 would recommend oh we should be using this so do you need to get kills with it can visit actual classes headshots on a dog 130 130 Gators now somewhere ammo we continue on going this is the plan we're gonna keep going we're gonna keep going it does look like I've got an aim on the side of my gun I could kill it sideways but it's actually the fast mag attachment if you didn't know in zombies you can customize your guns so like the laser sight the scope I think I'm well forgot I've got quick-draw on this thing or grip or something like that I've got oh no I don't know what it is it's the one that make like like stock yeah I got stock so see how fat like look how fast I'm walk normally look I'm fast you walk faster with this you can actually out walk sombody's at this pace with the stock it's really fucking good this bad boy I don't think I've got the stock for this I've got I've got rapid foot you could have like four attachments I've got the scope I've got rapid fire and I got quick quick draw mags a lot of different stuff what card Prince gave me thank you much subscribing I'm gonna stick with this sticking with this gun then while we stick with it the bear come on guys come on up I'm trying to be like woah woah getting a kind of got carried away by thinking we've killed that guy but maybe we should stop aiming at the head that got a bit hairy like a bit a hairy armpit there it's obviously we shot his head in you just kept fucking ruining ours well bitch remember like why don't you buy crunch - I'm just like I just don't really need to now this this should definitely take them out no no bullying heads always and 15 pretty smooth this used to be the ultimate place to hold off when you playing with your friends one of you one of you would stand for like you to all get LMGs and Reagan's and one of you would stand here like one of you would crowd won't stand behind you and you take it in like team turns of like to stood here to stood here just to take it in terms of firing and then when you went down all the zombies got too close that was just everything it was all mine shouldn't fucking self and that was like get the hell out of here your door just opened in your house Tom and that's the what the fuck the chats about no door still pretty much closed everyone's tell me that my house is haunted still thanks and I want to hear yesterday from the play bar me Rachel 5 - Colin Colin up some new boobs kinda northern subs in the chat up lads she just she's got no chill oh ok I actually did somewhat useful hot pants everything you very much she's grabbing a welcome you face hey Tom would you ever work for track I would love to work for track I wouldn't make me no sense me to work me because obviously like just as a job thing we've got other things going on in a life pot I would love to work for triac totally it'd be awesome we just got to keep these kills going guys I'm kind of tempted to bounce out of it just just the ones like safer gets around 20 then I packed punch that'd be quite nice and just see how see what round we could last last up to just up in Oh was that the what did that even say real March was that the reef up I'm not quite sure we unlock something either way I wasn't maximal there so we don't actually have to leave yeah just like that got a maximal we're staying up here even longer so he's done before the round skips I've never even looked at these before trip mine okay now should give me an extra two oh what the fuck okay didn't know that was a thing I thought you could stack them up I guess they stop this now to stop it from glitching out used to be a thing just got world's first dummies Easter Egg and shadows Oh someone's done the Easter Egg oh my god I can't wait to see what it is no spoilers don't tell me I wanna watch it for my first app for myself at first time alright come on zombies it just seems like aiming that what hipfiring just seems more effective cuz then light when you like this just seems like it'd be too accurate where's the spray is kind of useful in this round 17 and we'll just just I'm just stood here trigger firing just like just like that we came through burn item rekt yep think how it kicked it back buckas how do you survive it up I thought with the grounders time take that I care it killed me it's just beautiful which is the beauty beauty of annihilation does it on get that Easter Egg reference okay going straight over your heads you fools and then Oh still alive it's okay it's okay there we go last one let's go for noscope Wow that 30,000 points round 18 400 kills two hundred ten headshots Rikyu minute fifty fifty so far holy disappeared of course let's put these here you should probably put me in is like far corner to be honest let's put one put one there I'll screw or just do that I'm sure I'm sure they'll get triggered by zombies I'm sure of it I'm sure I'm not confident yeah I'll show you guys another restraining to me as well oh my god the points we're gonna get now is ridiculous hey we're at the point now where a dog's ass bottom max I'm up Oh what the hell someone that triggered him I think the dogs that might want make messes up so now we got to be a fisherman if you look up there's the plane from mob of the dead cool at least a few faces we have got a hundred rounds to get this wave done but we've got we got a bullet for every four zombies just like that so are as long as we're getting collaterals and we're even in bare 40,000 points dammit without going without leaving this place I wonder how many points we can get up to be just the two buildings alone if we go 200,000 up a pretty sick I'm reducing to get that till the end you know and we get it x-ray hunch points yeah 41,000 points can you play the song like four spots through in the same place actually this the kind of glitch for me but I can't leave people want me to leave I'm like no man I'm staying here Oh dog around as well so there's a max ammo that means we're staying here even longer so I'll have more more animal for the VPN wait the NP yeah vnp that's good what the fuck it went sideways I'm not expecting you to do anything but just in case the cool rekt didn't do anything and he came in and blew up my mines what dicks I still wish there was an easter egg like where you could where you could throw them and it would actually attract the dogs like semtex something thought it was a toy one hit kill on the dogs for this move we keep it actually you know what we're still keeping it pretty 50/50 even though these are totally not headshots that's it last one sounds like one yeah call me little one heyyo two hundred so that's gonna be so that's 2400 flights boys were fired for a butcher's obvious it's gonna take a lot to kill him I don't know mine we might get like 60,000 points before we go down I looked pretty nice and we've still got this to bail through them you can pretty much spam fighters as well so it's pretty effective it's pretty effective and Griffin thank you very much that if you could create any zombies map what would it be probably Kino to tell them it's still my favorite favorite Bruce Langella that you're subscribing and ki coke cows okay 13:10 subscribing that to sub highbrow down a row tink still want to hit Cal just where to test I'm not fuck these we're gonna stop that is where we have to start holding down fire and the reason why I'm getting closer now is because um this tech you know obviously cuz it takes longer to reload it allows me to step backwards while something loading right whereas if I'm stood all the way at the back and they manage to get close to me it's like all shit gonna lose not held gone to hell all ship docked all shit broken loose the stains are just all over the place today alright this is nearly out see there we go got new scope Oh battery is getting low got a nuke doesn't matter Hey look at that beat just being as efficient as possible trying to go for them triples come on come on come on what if we can turn this into a trip already wow that shows that if you shoot for the legs it is really not efficient at all there we go 50,000 points God a doesn't die so we've got a hundred and so it's brought my cable nope we have 108 bullets to keep keep us going around round 21 we could hit the box and swap it out for something that's behind us but I kind of want to keep this going 530 kills 200 secretary headshots still honestly still pretty much 50/50 and hopefully might be I was going to say hopefully get max ammo so now we can keep it pretty reckless without mo but we don't get too cocky that's perfect I'm not even I'm not gonna get cocky I'm just gonna reload but now this is a one-hit kill so it's just guaranteed kills for the for the caring overkill account on the VPN I do wish it showed like a progress bar like see how I'm max level there which shows my max rank all right bottom I think order that's the max rank for a zombies you can prestige but I don't like the work of the prestigious and this is where this gun comes in handy friends to kill we can throw grenade that just helps us out a little bit it'd be pretty dope if you could customize the camera of the grenades that'll be nice I'd like that DoubleTap come into player and crazy last one ass one round twenty to twenty one twenty two still going authorities just right in the corner with it right on top of each of because like when you're panicking you get to hear that's when all hell breaks loose I put it here but I think it might trigger them as back as possible the better whoa it'll totally disappeared so again we've got forty that kick we can keep that for an insta-kill and then we got the Drakon with 120 rounds if we manage to stay up here to around three really highly doubt it cuz we'll run out of ammo and she'll just break break loose and I'll go on pack a punch let's see then how is there see just kills it's crazy Oh I had shuts down that's what we gotta watch out by the headshots not read effect autumn just missing the head show by like an inch well almost around 60 that's from 60 almost at sixty thousand finds that was a triple headshot all right just just over under 500 rounds a lot of zombies there lot of them spawned in that dog threw me off and had to crouch to kill it is that the bullet didn't kill them it shot it shot the bullet shot the dog didn't kill him cuz he shot them in the legs 600 for every 300 nice dude this is just a hedge oh my gosh we got maximal as well this is beautiful I feel like I'm almost cheating you know when you see like people uploading videos and aim bolts or something I feel like I'm just gonna invite I wonder how affected they would be like stick them both on the wall I want yeah one they were they just ended like no save me so we're back round 23 with 65,000 points it's the one-shot kill it's no longer what the fuck it's no longer a one shot one shot buddy kill what's round 23 no of course it's nothing that's what all right yeah we got to be you have to be really deadly accurate without that around this time so it's one-shot headshot which is great not too short what round is a one-shot headshot up til but if I just stay aimed here then we're pretty much gonna get if we're getting two kills around like without if we kill 2 zombies with each bullet then with a full gun we can kill like 200 tons around we could count but we're not we're nowhere at the fight I mean 200 zombies around nowhere near we're around 23 that's what we need to watch out for house because I know it's what that was it is because I look down at the pines now I may be at the heads this is good this is what what's probably gonna wind up getting killed Amy the heads of this thing but I'm trying to get my kills off with this Plus this get as ridiculous my pines nearly at the end that's one nice there you go nice extra 40 points oof so she got seven nine thousand six Andrew maybe Katherine still go yeah so he's 39 thousand 62 Jesus Christ I'm never gonna get Maximo so even though we were halfway through we're still gonna cry oh my god 7030 yeah we're still keeping it fifty fifty seven 3400 noise mostly mostly actually is just over uh I don't think that's just over I think you should just them do okay yes you're finally got killed it still want hit killing the dogs like I said if it gets around 30 we're gonna go back punching then just see how long we can hold off for paper it will get your primary is just fuckin ridiculous Oh so to get out but only mode I mean non pled moved I love the word that which it just got stuck with that it just got stuck with pleb only my laptop webs loose I don't know who that what I pretty confident it was someone he was like nah man like okay we're not going out if we're not messing with the club's today by the way it's two o'clock in the morning that's why I'm kind of like messing up all my words 24/7 last one yep pink all right there we go so around 24 I'm 24 more ammo around 25 in oh how nice affecting them we have to kind of like put it there because the whatever is that spawning down there it's triggering it and you using this now he's probably gonna be pointless forever for indefinitely it's just going to be is probably just gonna have to be this will say let the plugs be loose plebbit itis if someone subscriber the name private actors I'd be impressed killer blast thanks are subscribe dude again I really want try to get some kill to this that actually helps skips us around I'd like to hit 200,000 lines thanks for wasting my thing this is a nine because the zombie could come out that window a zombie could still be climbing out the window then um and run through with a new card and we would have just been screwed because we want to be I'll see him I'm really tired right now but up non-stop just plain zombies it's not you're gonna risk him sneak okay fucking his over dad's another Doge on the way but it wasn't a one-shot headshotting God then fast mags is so fast I have sleight of hand obviously which makes it quick but then I have fast mags as well this where this comes in spike this is why we get this what I'm gonna save this ammo for probably just keep going for headshots as well and throw it down here that'll get some with grenades proton there will be climbing through the downstairs and over there will respond see wow that killed a bunch ended around oh my gosh 126 I really did not feel like we went through that round at all I'm 26 I see these D spawned again there we go let's keep her going was the Doge oh shit still one shy headshot nice go another maximal I think from the zombies themselves and Wow really sure I really should not waste my more time to just feel like I'm cheating I like just just stay in and just crouch together zombie get it done nice just that is the nicest sound in zombie zombies ever like not the box being opened not the Raygun firing that headshot sound ah satisfying and I just in my pants I'm 26 boys we are kind of running low on ammo but like I said we've not had a max ammo well that there's me saying out like my most favorite sounding zombies in it didn't make anything good making a glitch one of its cuz that the sounds being used too much the crazy game didn't think someone to get so many headshots in real around 27 bought look what the problem is now we've only got 50 rounds left we've got 50 runs with that which 50 rounds we can turn into killing 100 zombies I still don't think we're at the point I kill 100 zones around right eight eight seven eight remember that number I don't get we still got this as well that might be the round where we use that but we didn't get any nukes that round there that we didn't get any in circles as he says and what we're not going to do is we're not going to throw any grenades this time why because if we're not if we're not allowed to leave this point then we might actually kill zombie down there which drops something at the counter you could have done it last round I couldn't hear anything before if we're not allowed to leave up there then we don't want to risk something spawning 107 kills go I just realized I've been down yet now I've set that problem to go down right now whatever it's totally fine so it's fine oh my gosh good points hope shit Wow then they actually saved our lives than their grenades nope it's not what we want there it is we got it we got the Maximus Oni holiness yeah want to get that as soon as possible see we've hooked up there we've washed down a few I'm a few more rounds we couldn't get why is that the reason why we lost out on a few rounds that we could have kept then is because I fired through the if you have a max mag and then you get max ml then you get full ammo capacity of the gun we give possible Oh 100 K the panic that's close I don't know why we were fucking around with that gun should have done that see we've wasted a lot of time on there hundred thousand points there my name is pleb thanks subscriber and welcome would 100,000 points nine hundred and sixty seven kills six hundred headshots now we know we've got way over fifty fifty way over fifty fifty headshot how is that possible what over fifty fifty I don't know it seems like it's gone up I thought if it was beyond big below fifty fifty you could have caught up somehow I have does it cap does it not classed as a killer just passes the headshots dead not to throw these here oh how do I even do that we knew that was gonna trigger him hmm be there when he sees this yeah last one call me you call me fetch yep all right we're back up to full ammo with everything the throw he's done it and then we need an extra two of them so if they do end up book we could make more round 29 so at around 29 like I said around third it will get to like the last zombie will go on pack a punch and then manage reset five kills holy shit we did we might not even make it to the round some of might happen but we'll try and last around 30 around 30 we'll pack a punch this gun and I was packed as when she's gone we'll compare and stay up Aryan but so much I'll see what we'll do then no I'm not too sure of this emoji doubles I think you also like 140 it's got one it's got 120 now I think goes to one for a this one though this doubles I'm pretty sure you're right does it go to a 60 mega Roxy sure but I don't think it's gonna be one shot headshot it is push Elsa oh that was it my son Duke as well I'm going to kill a few mole oh shit we got like somebody we got myself an attorney client kill everyone that we picked up a box and if we would have kept killed him from a distance then we would be on my channel like after killing him that's whatever this was week I should have waited a bit more for that nuke like because we killed quite a bunch and then they would have spawn back in and it would have didn't it into the next segment really need to be really need to not wait for them to get close because it makes his waist it makes his waist ammo when we've got a spam fire so I mean when I miss don't take my time I get really knock here luckily every single shot that guys that kill did sound like a spam fireball it was just go through that there's a lot of them that dive through the window that's gonna be triple o get we want to try and say once at the end we might have to kill it I don't even know if I've activate all the teleporters what might start happening is the stronger they get as I shoot off their heads they might actually start running with our heads and that's gonna fuck us over 118,000 points we just passed one month out on four month five points right we're going let's go this is probably Nia's gonna get us killed this is probably the end of it boys it is open we'll just have to see how this goes I'm gonna pack finish the sniper first because that'll be definitely one hit kill it is a zombie stop now I'm just gonna make you back let's go let's run I just fuckin get the hell out of it so we've got the Impaler with 400 well 408 in the in the back and a stockpile and fought in the mag and then we got the book yeah I was right cuz 260 I should really kill them there but I don't be really nice alright so now we're sticking up here till round for every week a package again which we won't get anything out like punch it again I'm pretty sure this can get this gun can get and we can't shoot for it you might be the same I love to see if he does body shots yep that's a yes you know cuz obviously we need that that'll just slow down the zombies which is pretty good I'll do oh my god the recoil on this thing 14 hell oh trying to still be official mammal so I mean getting distracted we don't need these things just bonuses oh but I wish the shitload of our Mullen use that as a point to reload 11 World War moment one kills 704 headshots how is the headshots catch it what what it's not doing but it seems like the headshots is catching up with the guys down kills impossibility cific possibility we run around 30 Jesus just from sitting up here like this the thing is if we get if we get to around 35 we'll pack a punch again that's the rule I'm gonna say if it gets around 35 it gets packed punch again which gives our weapons the chance of getting ability on them which could in turn give us fuck oh shit boys oh shit why to do that we were doing absolutely fine you're doing absolutely flawlessly fine honest I fucking around with this we're not let's go buy perks you have to stay good stay the problem is that we're done double tap anymore which means we're not gonna do one shot head shows okay right now we are not allowed to leave the staircase god damn it god damn we should've done that I don't know why we did it it was like I actually thought that would do a bit more damage at the round we were at and it just didn't it just fucking might fall potato mode so when I stuck with we're pretty much just relying on this mmm again we don't have sleight of hands so without sleight of hand we're now doing half the damage but we got a packed punch gun so fingers crossed yep all right reloaded reloaded my knife one with the no head comes crow and eyes were foes I'm really gonna have to be like I'm really not gonna I'm really gonna have to no Holbach with ammo why not because when they get closer gonna fuck us up so shit damn if we get to round 40 I'm allowed to buy perks but it's not fucking happening now 35 or let's pack flinch I'm making up a rule in my head round round for a realized by perks again but will not have enough ammo and we will definitely know in a fucking time like it's not gonna happen I've got a really good run on my hands but I'm just like now we good this is this is literal we have to watch out for the see that was a headless zombie I didn't see kind of like felt what might be inside exactly shit we're going down now 31 that was a really really good challenge though I didn't think it was gonna go as except successful as it did but it actually just did really well we got 1230 kills with 708 headshots I don't realize my ammo was so low bought either way for me to just to start recording this is a fun little challenge turned into a really epic challenge so nonetheless I hope you guys enjoyed that if you did make sure you leave a like rate and subscribe for more videos and tutorials and shit I've got a lot of like and more in-depth zombie tutorials coming out a lot of people been asking for it and yeah hopefully you'll enjoy it so except click that subscribe button and I'll see you guys soon from a next video good time 
oh yeah look at this professional background look at this professional light look at this professional camera ladies and gentlemen I'm finally back I'm here I'm making a video on the channel and if you're wondering like Tom why the hell you bark while you're making videos the simple answer is because I felt like it now there's no like any ordinary bag of sweets but trees or whatever the hell you think it might be but it's not it's Japanese candy I was recently just off in Japan I went out there with the reason guys kicking it back for like nine days of troubling it was amazing out of translator we were Pinewood wreaking we were climbing we're mountain biking I even went to like a suicide Christ I was pretty goddamn creepy and once we're there I always see these videos of trying Japanese candy and they just like literally went outside the supermarket and bought it like in the local village or like in Walmart as a bar and I was like I'm in it I'm in Japan what I'll just buy some real Japanese candy so today I have quite a wide selection of Japanese candy this ranges from what looks like squid - cheese - candy - sour stuff - mini pancakes I'm gonna try it all probably gonna throw up so that's gonna be a 1 if you guys right now for we're just gonna go for it and see how this hand pan pans pan pans out now first things first I need to just throw this out here I'm not really good at trying food in the first place I'll try anything once like whilst I was out in Japan I tried I tried cow which everyone's tried I tried squid which everyone's tried and then I went ahead and tried horse I tried horse and I also tried bear and it was not nice who did not like your talk first of all my tasty treat thing is gonna be this little character which I forgot I probably should have showed you guys first before I tore a part so I I don't know what this is we're gonna go for it and it's in a metal foil wrapper wait is it bub uncle um it doesn't really honor it it does have quite a bit funny book now that's not bad but I do think this is bubble gum day one really  right oh my god this is difficult Carter I'm gonna chew gum was like this like chewing gum like extras just to make us - yeah but bogan I don't know okay that's the best we're gonna get swiftly moving on we're going straight to a poop looking emoji not too sure what to expect from this girl on the bat it looks absolutely pitch back back back know what I mean oh oh oh no oh no that didn't come out in one piece oh that's all unit it smells like coca-cola balls yeah that looks so tasty Japanese food for the win okay oh no yo yeah big up the poop emoji that just just take like a coca-cola bottle this one is gonna require some weirdness it's like a beer even though the instructions it looks like a beer I have a glass of water here for drinking then I actually have a glass here if I throw it up in if in case I need to do it so instead I'm gonna pour this into this and then add the water so go wrong let's drop let's go for it let's go let's go for a smell test oh that doesn't smell good that doesn't smell good what is that what even is that it's a banana bit is this bit is this banana bit the packet is going in oh yeah this looks this looks so healthy this looks this looks perfect this looks like exactly what I want in my life for now I've got like water but some reason it's kind of like oh no oh no we bout to settle for a minute yeah he's frothing look at the top of its got like a full-on thick soft to it like a bit yes yes okay I'm gonna go for smell not too bad whilst my bae is brewing I feel like it's necessary to have some pancakes with this little happy dude next to it just cheering his life on so gonna try some pancakes right now it looks less like chocolate now look at it and he's - aww Oh mmm yeah I think isn't I think it I think it's a chef drops I think it's maple syrup thing it's a thick maple syrup oh my gosh no Jo that is like ten times bad that American real pancakes that they cook for you whoa my beans ready oh look at that it went from beetle weird and like rafi to looking like an actual beer I've really got to do this I just had some ones sold I had a really nice little happy bunkie and now I've got to try this beer I forgot sale I mean claim I throw bad decisions are about to be made but let's go for it you ready initial smell doesn't smell like anything taste it's a bit zingy on the throw book oh it's actually quite nice but it just tastes like tastes like lime or I saw a thing there's a it doesn't really taste my beer it doesn't really taste bad it's actually okay may I'm having more water to that I have so much some other stuff it's pretty good look at it it just refreshes itself me it's a never-ending drink I think this is like a pepperoni or pepper army whatever you want to call it what every good in Japan is kind of difficult to get into probably because it'll never go out a day if you don't break the air seal all right I mean all I've been oh look at that Oh in that tasty treat right Oh chef drops on the floor oh right well this is gonna be a tasty treat covered in what is probably a cat hair cuz now I have two cats poor smells like pepper army tastes it it tastes like pepperoni Oh pepper army with a really hard skin I'm actually not sure if I've left a wrapper on here because I listen topic is I don't know if you can hear that boy there's no it really isn't but I'm not exactly a fan don't my immediate under sip of my beer that says well for some reason looks like some dude trying to eat some happy noodles remove the top pour a bit out in my hand doesn't smell like anything just smells like a an empty pockets a chef noodles can you even see that yeah this camera's don't you see everything and barbecue mmm oh my god that's amazing that's like cheese and onion flavor s crisps but in a dry noodle fashion yo i'ma find that really nice this just turned out pretty well I feel like I've been eating too many nice things right now so I'm gonna throw myself in the deep end with this I got I'm not sure what it is I just picked it up I think it might be a skin strip of squid again we're here to try everything it works so pros on No oh oh it's slimy I don't like this anymore okay what does it actually smell like I don't know like a vinegar hey it doesn't taste like ebony it tastes kind of sweet what are you ready for this huh don't test I'm gonna go nah it takes like a vinegary piece of paper I'll pass on that yeah I'm not keen on that and the fact that I've got another one similar to that does not make me excited next stop this jumble thing which I believe is kinda like if you're from America it's kind of known as a cheeto and if you're from the UK that's known as like a wats tip it's a bigger to say the least and if I'm gathering what this looks like flavor-wise I don't know I want to say like a yogurt or a milkshake or summer but sniff test oh it smells sweet I don't know all right do you know I just want to say this is gonna be like a rice krispies treat you ready [Music] pretty blonde you know what going up the picture I don't know what I'm supposed to drink milk with it yeah okay you know what we don't do things properly over there I've got my bus of milk I got my weird rice krispies straw let's try this dirty mm-hmm that's a fast Ronnie works like a charm all right with a bit of milk I don't know it's it's got a purpose as a straw you know it's bitter I think it might be a breakfast bar I still got a lot to go so I'm gonna leave that one for the wife when she gets home stop mini bottle new I don't know if you can actually see that right there boy I glad I didn't get a large bowl of this because it looks at it from get honest it looks like a small carton of drugs I don't even know if this is edible ball I'm gonna pop the lid off there is no a bully honey like sniff though then there's flavor to it it just looks like like a powdered substance just gonna go for it oh whoa that's nice it's just like a sugary really sweet flavor it just dissolves within knock a millisecond yeah this one looks like an industrial medication pallet of candy so I don't know but this is just gonna be like hot candy or whatever or again I actually I act I actually accidentally bought drugs or something but I think I think if I can just buy chocolate coating honey what's that the hot it is just tastes like M&amp;Ms no actual you know what does it taste like smize and I'm gonna start the beat in my comments right now M&amp;Ms or Smarties let your war begin down below oh I thought you liked chocolate cigarettes that you had as a kid but they seem to be the entire like there's no chocolate - it's just like chalk oh it's not that do not want to describe as if I say ultraviolets is that actually a sweet or unsweet LaFollette sweethearts does that all that chocolate cigarettes this is not what was that vert eyes this is screw you around candy sticks oh boy this now is going to be a nice beautiful industrial made piece of cheese which again looks like it's got a wrapper stuck to it but oh wait I think it did actually have a wrapper stuck to it it did Oh Oh God I think I got a wrapper on that piece of meat a small square piece of cheese all the way from Japan mmm did you hear that crunch don't don't cheese is supposed to be crunchy but that sounded like a crunch not that much but it ain't got nothing on no cathedral cheese from England just saying this one looks a pretty obvious one what could it possibly be a coke bottle perhaps looks like the Congo smells like it smells like a really really good coca-cola bottle and tastes like Pepsi ah god that's dine another war down below Coke or Pepsi holy this is becoming the real debate of candy right now all right now we've got machito itchy itchy ichigo machito Ichigo don't worry is it Carlos the pancake how does your these kids get your attic oh no I don't want to look a lot I don't like looking at summer in it this sir any I think oh no no no oh this right weird example time do you know what this feels like and you ever just in your life fell like a fake boob like the thing that goes in the womans boob if you've ever felt with a limb in your life which you know everyone just comes across their entire life feels like that I think like it's like a boob implant look at it oh that's not nice what since up what is inside it oh I'm gonna go for it right here ready I can't even water I'm ready for this one I'm not excited smells like nothing link tastes like nothing I'm just going offered 3 to 100 it's red inside no that's not that bad that's not that bad that is not that bad you know I'm gonna show you in the rip it open Jerry actually tastes like if you eat in a hurry go oh God oh no it's sticky and when you eat a hairy bow and it's got you know you can get the eggs how about eggs it's kind of like one of them he send me mad you know all right intend oh don't you d monetize this video because I'm eating your candy ok but in some mario heads by the looks of things okay we go whoa right got you things there I'm sick we've got the lure the question marks square that's pretty cool let's go for that yeah no yeah yeah I didn't know wait he's edible it tastes like soap that truly tastes like a virus oh there we got the Mario heads which looks like coca-cola bomb no still tastes like soap and then we've got the the magic star oh boy there as well that's gonna keep yeah as I suspected tastes like soap so if you want to go to Japan you want some Mario candy probably wouldn't advise this because it tastes like a bar of soap okay that is not oh my god the aftertaste of them for some reason well I swallowed it was not nice in the slightest don't twisty Mario I do not attempt it to wash it down with some babe oh I don't trust not either ooh yeah I had to just through I was gonna try and drink that to swallow it down but no I don't think so all right I guess we got to continue put my next treat because I'm so because I'm so excited to be doing this it's going to be worth what looks like another one of these things but I don't know what kind of flavor so okay now this looks like the walk the big what's our talked about so what smells good you ready mmm it's a nice texture the flavor tastes like barbecue sort of spice or something like that not too bad for the rest of these three remain oh my god these are three things I've got remaining this stick which looks quite nice a very spicy thing and oh boy two more really wood strips that I can't wait to have her eye socket you know what we will actually get rid of one of these strips right this one looks like that looks like chicken breast skin and then this one looks like a fish skin so the chicken once sounds nice for so this one's already cracked apart it looks exactly like the last one but it's not where it's dry not bad does it brill know if yeah it's flexible don't you worry guys it's flexible oh oh no no no oh that smells like pure pure bad fish you ready same taste tastes like you can see the little hole there or something tastes like fish it's not that bad but it's very I can't chew it it's just stuck together like paper I don't really you supposed to eat this I'll lick it so I'm gonna go ahead and just leave it that she gets like a zero attend for me I'm not impressed now time to I guess shot it down with this pink liquid this is gonna go over and this is gonna be a bad decision I can tell okay okay no no okay all right all right Oh oh it's not liquid oh it's a goo oh it's like jelly yeah it's really hard jelly in a stick look at it oh these bits inside of all the bits in it it's just really hot jelly goddamn that's nasty all right second to last I think we might have another one of those walks it looking things oh no we don't this smells like spicy fish is it spicy finish oh no it says her habanero habanero it's a bloody hard arrow no no I know okay nobody votes in this if you if you didn't see what happened last time with me in spicy food but it go watch me it'll go should kill it tell it chappie wait um I mean I have no spice no bad number I don't know what it is Oh a little bit there's a little bit a little bit spice oh you buy oh you're buys there oh it's not bad but if I could tell you what it's like if you have a kid and you had fish fingers boys or just fish fingers it's like a fish finger flattened and dried out this is a spicy flatfish finger yeah okay this is one of the treats I was looking forward to the most it looks like a slice of chicken breast it was 15 yen which is like 15 cents which is like maybe ten peeling and I think I think if that math works out right pretty honestly looks like chicken skin oh oh yeah that smells good that smells really good but I can't exactly say it looks good so wrapper food you know yeah I think it tastes like teriyaki chicken it's just like pepper textures like paper but flavor mmm goddamn teriyaki chicken unlike a lick me taste me sample strip that is not edible in the slightest yeah yeah it doesn't leave quite a good after taste in your mouth fever yeah Cheers a way I threw up nasty so ladies and gentlemen that's gonna do for my trying Japanese candy for the first time I have seen people do other videos of it but I've just always been like whatever I don't really care and you'll see the final book because I went to Japan I was like god damn I'm so down to get some of this and bring it all the way back to UK so I'm really glad I did if I had to pick my favorite thing it would have to be I'm thinking my maple syrup pancakes no era I said they were and the little shot of sugar basically these two of my windows hands down the worst which might not seem it and is gonna be the Mario sweets because it left such a horrible aftertaste in my throat but it literally made me throw all into my drink so I'm sorry Mario but not today but nonetheless guys I hope you enjoyed this video if you did make sure to leave a like crane I might do something random like this again in the future again I'm not gonna make a very look every week try new candy just because that'd be a lot of trouble which sounds like a really good idea but nonetheless if you're new around it make sure to click that subscribe button I do actually do daily vlogging on YouTube comm /y photonic link will be down in the description for that and I'm also going to put together a playlist of all the words of when I was in Japan so if you want to see all 9 days of me trying bare horse random whatever's then you can go check it out I was a lot of drinking I want a pie in and a lot of fun so if you guys haven't seen that go check it out being on the water fun I did actually end up in a sex shop and yeah youtuber age-restricted that video so word to the wise you've been warned so thank you very much for watching I'll catch you guys when I make my next video and I will see you guys again soon which look and sarios 
okay right listen I know I look like a potato I am absolutely exhausted and the reason why I'm exhausted is because oh my goodness level 55 ready to prestige already took me exactly 11 hours on the dot I have been non-stop playing this game since he came out you guys know me I'm like a zombie I'm known in the community sort of thing but the replayability isn't too high for it whereas the multiplayer in this game is absolutely incredible I'm 100% in love with this game I think it's rare drop few guys right here a little bit I think is incredible I think it's so much fun it's fast paced it's epic I got a grenade of combat record and didn't load up that and why didn't do that that's gonna cut my record what the hell are you doing combat record okay for some reason he's put me in here and I'm not too sure why he's Mike it's like it's like it well um I think I think I've broke the game I'm I'm gonna say I think he might broke it let's try almost time combat record I think you're witnessing me breaking the game yep ladies gentlemen I've successfully broken this game shit okay I reset the game and I'm gonna try and see now if I can take a look at my combat record no this is the first time I've tried doing this and I think this game is absolutely done broken why is it broken I can't leave sledgehammer well what's he gonna get okay it's ear XP and paper well don't boat but bong hits right well I'm back now like four hours later it's been that long that I've got a bloody resupply drop so I'm gonna call this in probably shouldn't have even done this prestige first but look at that we've got a rare something wrong I've got a buzzsaw epic I actually don't know what good that's for I'm assuming that might be an LMG or something so I might actually take a quick stare at that but beforehand let's try and see if I can actually access my combat record yeah which I've been trying to do got because this is the the entire point of me doing this is so I could share with you guys why my skills and stuff I like like the best I could show you is I'm position 69 thousandth in the world so that's pretty good and I played 88 games I just don't seem to be able to show you guys like my stats or anything oh okay then show a random update of change of things I randomly got on Twitter and was like you know what everyone's treating sledgehammer being like oh this is bogey this is like you so I thought you know what I'm just gonna add to the chaos for them I'm sorry but I've not seen anyone complain about this book except me so I made a little video for him and I sent it them by a DM sitting below it's easy for us to share it with our developers if you text it to me so whoever runs the social media for sledgehammer asked me to text him so I did a text of the video and lo and behold he said thanks man on it new book lucky you so i lo and behold found a brand new book from sledgehammer games sorry about that didn't mean to do it for some people have been telling me that I can prestige any oh god I just realized I can't actually press anything and I can't leave so I actually have to close the game yeah what a bug okay so thank you to the power of Twitter some people told me that since though I can't actually do the whole so soldier whereas it does your combat record thing to prestige I can actually speak to this guy I've never actually as you didn't know he existed so very kind doing emote what kind of hello good game nice to meet you so apparently yeah I can prestige with this I actually didn't know I could even find this guy even do this in the slightest I literally just came across this because people on Twitter told me was here the number one class that I used by far is easily this one right here it's the Airborne Division because just let me throw this out here what airborne does you get an SMG suppressor absolutely amazing trust me it's like one of the best things ever to be hitting on a mini-map sprint for longer distances exactly what you want be like when you're trying to run as fast as possible in my domination Kill Confirmed and especially war which I've been playing quite a lot I'm over obstacles faster even more important and then increase speed sprint when you max out which is just like the ultimate like bonus you could get something so I've been using the air bar I love running good and this my way to go for it the type 100 is just a laser beam rifle let me show you real quick now look at this there is like only a little bit of recon this thing which is so easily controllable that it just tears the enemy apart I'm one off getting it the 75 headshot challenge so I'm actually happy about that but this is the perfect set to use I use the pistol as a secondary frag grenade not a semtex but like my grenades are just like roll around and like bounce off walls and stuff to get like a tactical play on people but I've reached maximum prestige with this weapon I prestige that I've got the ability to put my killed camera and my clan tag mobile or the kill cow how does that look well let me show you you see that that number on the bottom of my gun when I spin because if I stay still it looks blurry I can do this but you get you don't really inspect how many kills you've got all that well bought bit disappointed about that but hey what else can you do so let's jump back into the headquarters run all the way back around to this guy now okay show your true dedication to cause a prestige your front of all your friends I've got no friends in here with me but whatever prestige unlocked oh can I get one them rank resets and prestige 1 Rank 1 keep your progress prestige rewards your grant access to a special set prestige rewards and challenges perfect and I get a new cluster cluster prestige 1 enter prestige are you sure you want to enter yes I am ladies and gentlemen I have reset my prestige hopefully I'll now be able to actually look at my combat record which would be quite a nice ball I've got it done in 11 hours on the dot 11 hours on the dot I've completed my first prestige now that's quite a lot of bonus XP and stuff that I've unlocked there you know I think I might be able to do it faster if I just played war because I was playing things like free-for-all oh shit I didn't even know that was a thing right then alright ok wait What did he say I just unlocked I actually don't know what he said to me and I don't know why unlocks I got a bit but I got a bit uh bamboozled by but oh I can actually see my stats 1299 kills nine hundred of seven deaths kill death ratio 1.54 not that good score per minutes bit low at the moment I've been playing stupid game modes 212 headshots and to eleven thousand two minutes two minutes because I joined a free-for-all just like waiting to try and see if it patch the the game and make it so I can check up a combat record can I go down to my dusty now and check out my cover record I can oh my god there you go so there's my current stats absolutely stoked with that I don't know what that bet best snapshot 5k d13 kill streak 48 kills the that's my best game so far best weapon type 100 flamethrower used it in War Infantry Division set obviously airborne it's just fast it's lethal it's awesome and best mode I guess is war because I've just been unlocking the most XP from that so that is all the other summary of my game what I'm actually gonna do real quick oh wow team deathmatch 55,000 free-for-all way too high Kill Confirmed 5,000th capture flag I don't play that game so just ride 10,000 15,000 domination I don't want to talk about that game hardpoint don't even play that game 1v1 I don't even play that game wants war I'm six thousands in the world for war about 16 wins in war I want to say that's a pretty good damn good statistic I'm 75 thousand for the world so not too bad like I said I've been trying to play a bit more zombies but I'm just find it a little bit tedious at the moment until we discover like new little Easter eggs in it and stuff oh wait what Oh what the hell look at that little symbol above my head like showing that I've just prestiged don't know if it's always like that if people were in here but this is where you're supposed to like run around next to your friends and enjoy showing off but I can't exactly do that so yeah there you go I got a rice pledge up to finish off this video but I managed to break the game I'm proud of that well I'm not proud of that and I managed to get an epic and we'll see what else we get here another epic I got the Royal which is an XP weapon snap snap snap Lee Enfield alright Franco lock the Royal gives a 10% soldier XP bonus okay ball actually Stanford it how small is that sniper rifle me look how small that sniper is wow very sleek I like it right so we've unlocked ourselves a brand new sniper there's a pretty epic way to end this video so guys thank you very much fortunate if you have enjoyed it and you want to see some multiplayer games

these to try and get an off Dragomir we've never opened any of these before so no matter what we get all of it is going to be a win-win-win successful win so till next time I love you I'll leave you I'm good bye 
ladies you're working your faces to another modded GTA video where today we are playing us Frank the zombie that's just the nickname I get him gave him and to start this off we need to get ourselves a five-star Wanek level so we're going to do that in the best style possible now obviously we're going to need a vehicle okay so let's go to a vehicle spotting I'm going to need something let's say military to try and get you know just a bit of attention and a rhino tank will do just fine so let's go ahead and get ourselves as much police attention as possible what we're going to do is we've got to try and get 5 star wanted level then we're going to escape it using vehicle roulette now I will show you what vehicle roulette is right now but the chance down would look you know what actually I'll do it so what we're gonna do is vehicle roulette so whilst I'm driving around with a 5 star wanted level every minute or so I'm running we're gonna hit this button and it will spawn me into a completely random vehicle so we could get something good we could get something absolutely terrible well you know we could get a meth cooking lab for example so this is the way it's going to work so we actually need to get quickly back into a military one before we get this thing shot ups with Kingdom Come right so good so let's get our 5 star what chase shall we stole yeah now this is modern GTA like I said this is on PC this is non console front anyway wondering how I managed to do this and I'll put a link in the website I'll put a link a letter I'll put a link in the description to the website that I used it's just there like GTA 5 mods as to where it's like easy tutorials and how you guys can all do is if you've got this on PC I do not condone anyone modding it but I will leave it below just to give props where it is due and yeah we're just gonna have a bit of chaos because we could usually play online and just wait am I on fire oh shit need another one new new one over safe oh yeah I spawned in a new one in time right so we're close to five star white level now I probably could just raise my wanted level but I think it's just funny to cause absolute chaos like what's the point in you know just set it to fire sky you're going to cause all chaos and destruction and as you can see here I clearly cannot drive a tank now hopefully we'll be able to escape you never know we could actually just straight up complete this challenge instantly and if you guys like the idea this challenge then I can definitely do it again because it's going to be different for each vehicle we get each time so let's keep at this hopefully we get a vehicle that isn't gonna blow instantly from these choppers over here well yes go on all right well forced I want in the morning now I love messing about online and stuff like that and in single-player book you're very limited to like what you can actually do so like the whole margin ability is really really useful like if you know you do just want a five cell white little chase if you just want to get a tank like that these star things it's just really really helpful you'd have to drag one thing from the other side of the map and just any shenanigans can happen to you at all this just makes it a bit more bit more like I want to sit oh my gosh it makes it like a bit more controlled chaos I want to say and which is that oh my gosh talk about control chaos my tank oh there we go right run it we go baguette begin the chase right now what is going to be our first run the vehicle you ready three two one go shit alright so we didn't get to look at that time but I think we're going to try it again so let's see what I start a vehicle is gonna be let's do a stranded vehicle not bad not but that is not a bad spawn of vehicle start off with but let's give ourselves five stars and let's get this race Pat - or attempt to on the road bring it on motherfuckers we're gonna take you guys down so rather than it being a whole like can we try and escape them I think it should be a thing of how long can we last and yes that is a tank format I haven't responded before and rather than every minute we're gonna change our vehicles every oh shit when your new vehicle okay yeah this works I'll take it I'll take it I'll take it we've got this rid of the 30 seconds I was going to say will change our vehicles every 30 seconds so um not a bad escape vehicle for saying I drove off without my seatbelt on they're not going to complain but we're going to try get rid of this because we want to try to get back on land as fast as pop well that's blowing off when I try to get back at land as fast as possible and we're not allowed on the freeways we're not allowed to do that you're not allowed on so let's try it over here and not blow ourselves up so we'll change change vehicle and we got to try and learn to the ground and let's say wait in five four oh shit a ditch you soon what survived yes it will survive we got another sick vehicle so we've got 30 seconds of this I could probably scape them in this mind if I could escape living this in like 30 seconds not be sick let's do it it's do it this is nice and fast this is what wanted voice is what we wanted catch me if you can suckers catch me if you can Oh boys boys oh shit what if we do this in slow motion run the vehicle now um I don't think that's gonna work god damn it I spawned as a fucking a moveable tanker and then a goddamn plane no I'm not accepting this let the games begin I guess let's get ready for responding your next vehicle 30 second countdown oh man these things are based on love it 30-second countdown and that engines gorgeous until we have to change vehicles on the outs do it first person let's get a bit of attention first of all okay the hand one this is too goddamn fast all right get out of this I can't do first person anymore all right goodbye your mother fuckers let's get him anyone especially especially not smart girls all right I went to move my mouse button and accidentally click the porcine which is rockets god damnit so I went to start the fourth attempt and spawned in as a train and I don't think we're going anyway so let's try this one again well I can't see is lasting for too long sit is Dharma zombie doesn't help already poor I cannot see us lasting long at all we've got 30 seconds from now to survive on a bike before we get to switch out to the next vehicle this is probably going to be better than the next one we're gonna get anyway but this is gonna be our last and final attempt to see how long we can last three get on officers bring it on alright 15 more seconds of a swap out or swap a room mate three I'm still dumb I just drove like straight past them let's keep I'm getting shot all right ten nine come on of our breath I'm dead for God to say six five four three two one nickel yes I'll take this but apparently I've got a risk I published yet rags on mate military truck yeah I'll do a bit off-roading come on there boys you want to chase me we got to work we've got twenty nine seconds in this alright yeah yeah Kindle catch over you in a great outdoor old fuck in the great outdoors I know I am buying it you suck ass ain't gonna catch shit well why'd you make this thing's actually pretty fast is it's not an army is it pretty sure I think it might be like a and mate is it become a weather one things like I'm a weather whoa oh my gosh there's quite a lot behind me there's five cop cars and two helicopters so in five four three two one all right another off-road vehicle I wish we're heading in the right direction for this sort of vehicle that's doing all right vehicle you did us proud for we now need to go off-road and up this way can I manage it yes ah the game knew the game oh shit the game knew I was about to crash into a wall right we're good we're good I hope I served it I saved it I saved it boys saved it good all right leave me alone but folks get out of that helicopter okay I'll make this is dramatic a spot look at this this is beautiful most of my eight thing you're ever all right five four three two one run a vehicle oh really I got dumb extended tow truck will be good though there's a straight road no it's not straight road it's a fucking curvy ass road oh I got a pic I probably could have picked a longer vehicle for such a windy road but it would be okay the helicopter cars are struggling to get to us but the helicopters wait wait to take a detour take a detour we got this trust believing believe in Cindy oh shit of course I take the narrowest road possible I take the windiest then the narrowest it's just what I do ladies and gents it's just what I do any mate what the cop the cop cars are struggling to get on it so I guess what you're not right so in five four three two one I have no idea how to straighten my wheels but that was a wookie Irsay spacebar ship ship pull side - side middle Mouse boy let's bring up my phone shit maybe back to kill the cops whilst of a bid oh I can't aim down right let's wait let's just lower ourselves we'll lower ourselves because it's been about 20 or foot we're fucked for thought and just going to die out engines go die out right you ready run the vehicle in three two one now the skills the mud skills all this is perfect next time I'm going to do it like a proper timer so I hit there I have to hit the bottom right there and then and I can't just like make it like you know work for they'll shit oh shit no roll them it'll at least roll down always what you got it get over it get over it just okay we good rotate rotate rotate okay not doing a good job over road of course we're stuck alright we'll change the weapon in I've changed weapon vehicle five four three two one as epic as that escape was we have to restart the race because we got stuck into the bow every got completely messed up so let's increase I want it level to level 5 again let's get the show on the road and let's begin to cause some chaos so let's make sure that we've got some police officers on the way to find us we're gonna try and see if we can escape 30-second timer this is our last and final attempt ladies and gents bring it on we have to do like we have to play if I can if I could pull up a stopwatch on my phone I'm good I'm just going to start it and every 30 seconds I say I'm going to just swap the vehicle all right so we got enough copper tunnels please don't last like two seconds because we could have totally got away last time if I would have accidentally spawned in the ac-130 back so I'm not glitched into the map you'll be absolutely okay so 20 more seconds and we're on the erotic boys we're on it get out of it yeah this is my town my glitch spawning vehicle town I should probably point out more than anything alright time for the next vehicle right about now okay so after a lamppost just hit another back of the head of a skipper on a motorbike fuck yes okay I'm happy with this I might do this I could I can rock this bad boy all right we've got 20 more seconds to where to swap again yeah wait actually might escape them I'm going that damn fast wait I need to turn I need to turn over here and he'd sooner I don't you man I did not think I was gonna survive that I did not think I was gonna survive that a rule is that old shit luckily we're right on time to spawn the next vehicle oh okay this one's not moving so we will discard it to this one okay so we're in a a burger shop race car this is not bad and it seems pretty super top among a life wait well of course I would I'd be the one person to get a vehicle stuck in between a trainer and a fucking bourgeois meat this thing's got power this is a proper beasty car Jesus let's keep going I'm actually supposed to spoil my next vehicle wrap a fucking serious again this shit with that it doesn't move I rode this way I've got I've got the top time but we're going this way oh shit Oh like I just fell off I don't do it don't do it mate avid this stopwatch is a better is a better thing I could just flick it in between the timer go go go go or me I'm we've got five seconds left this is just chaos I'm gonna get like a pedal bike and that's gonna just be game over for us right next one another boat bike that's not bad we actually managed to get away quite fast last time all right we're good we're good nothing to worry about here folks nothing to worry about at all I've been getting shot off the bike that work a little bit the number one thing to worry about 15 seconds until next wat try and do some evasive manoeuvres right now yes it's a good idea now hitting the wall there's not I'm getting shot to shit by go change to the new vehicle right as we get outside this you ready look okay that will stop 2x final one all right what is it so what's the Sultan or sort and is a good car this is like the sports car out GTA 4 like the one that was everywhere well he was hit about a house but anyway you get the picture all right right over 15 seconds we're smoking it boys we smoking it oh that would have been an amazing no no no just get me to that get me to the other way I've got four seconds to get out this alleyway except the spawn in the next vehicle any second now actually protip don't try and spawn in a plane when driving round the corner in a goddamn fucking alleyway son of a bitch oh my gosh unfortunately I got my ass handed to me that I thought we might be I thought we might be able to get a clutch escape we survived for like three minutes though so that was pretty badass but we always seem to get messed up with an aeroplane if we can pull off the escape we did last time with the airplane and just fly straight up and escape then we'll be absolutely set but fortunately I keep driving down goddamn small alleyways but we're going to mix it up that's why we're not a lot on motorways otherwise it'd just be too easy mode and yeah I just thought it'd be something fun to do just mess around with some mods I'm going to download an absolute bunch more and just have a bit of fun with it and I was like I am and spider-man all that sauce to put a lot of them are still being worked on so when some new stuff comes out I'll definitely be playing on it and if you guys want to see me do like a live stream of just messing about with a by all these cheats and mods on the game then let me know in the comments below leave a like rate if you enjoyed this video and yeah it's pretty much gonna wrap everything up guys Thank You Everett watching I love you guys faces and I do 
[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] we [Music] what up guys are you all doing you might be like why if you like Sriman on day like today I have no idea I am literally stuck to my t-shirt in sweat hello if you're tuned into live stream over video right now my name is Tom also known as City K and I like streaming zombies at the moment because that is like my thing if the weather was not good I would have been streaming all day every day for the past like week since I got back from Paris but you know what it is what it is the oh my god you will not believe the message I just got off my sister so I can't read that out loud but nonetheless I am here thank you very much for tuning yes I did just post my daily vlog if you don't know I do gaming videos I also film every day of my life post it on the internet called life of Tom and yeah do daily vlogging and have done for like I think almost 20 months straight now which is damn bananas so why am i live-streaming I just I really want to play zombies like I really want to play zombies and was dying off the stream with let's say three spins of the actual gobblegum machine to see what we can get so if you are any guys make sure you smack that like bone like sure that makes you smack that like button like it share it and subscribe there you go that was scared of where I was going with this a little bit somewhat every one of the chats already already demanding I send nudes so we'll have to see how that goes but we're going to play keno to toe in first room and see what round we're going to get to you might be like yo bro Tom this seems like a silly idea what you're doing you'll find there you go that's three spins that's all we can do but I'm gonna show you what is going down in Chico town for us right now now if you watch my last stream I don't think it was just it was a day before I decided I was going to do a little bit of a kino der toten fun first room challenge because my gobble gums bro out of this world so we're gonna get rid of flavor hex but we got crate let me just work it out doing raindrops is one of the raindrops is one of the most amazing drops you can ever get it drops one of every powerup you know hit the box you can do this you can do everything it is beautifully amazing like you get perks from it you know see every time you use one these basically you get perk and its really really good what we are gonna do is mix things up a little bit and we're going to throw in because I'm trying to do some high round shit I'm going to slow in I was going to perk up but you're not going to do I'm gonna throw it on the house instead of that random gobble gum we're going to go for crate power because we want that bad boy because trust me we just want it we're gonna have raindrops obviously we're gonna power vacuum and then I'm thinking disorderly combat as well and the reason for that is because it gives you guns every 10 seconds at random we could put a round robin on but just seems like a bit of a ridiculous idea to put something like that on so if you guys are ready for me to attempt to do some stupid shit this is basically the title of my last stream but we're going to be doing to see in the space of an hour livestream where we can get to on kino der toten oh my gosh I'm so sorry uh my dad my dad my granddad just rang me so hopefully is okay but Henry laughs thank you very much the two-pound donation let's go tom bank holiday weekend breeze now if the weather's bad on Saturday I am supposed to be going out in the nighttime drinking with the homies but you know what if I can stick it out and hang out with you guys then I will do that gum tastes bad gobble gum tastes bad but guys I am I've got like I look like I got a Sun Tan the lighting in this room sucks because the Sun the Sun is so bright outside it's unreal I should really just up my blinds open and use natural light but it is what it is but thank you very much for all tuning in I do expect everyone to be out in the Sun enjoying it but if you're a gamer like me and yeah your urges on the inside are telling you to stay stay indoors oh do you know what we should have done I just thought about it we should have actually bought two different perks we should have actually gone for a different setup here only now what oh you never know it might get pushed it to us but it's a nice day guys so you got to understand I want to be able to stream stream shrinks room but I might be having a barbeque at my house so if you want to see what happens in the barbecue you know getting crazy loads of pies I would say naked people but my sister's going to be there so that that's kind of weird so we'll backtrack on that statement immediately but okay so one of the chat says Tom how much do you pretty damn moist all right you need a hair core I'm wearing a haircut but you know what we're not getting one today so thank you very much for for being my latest sponsor static I appreciate thank you all right that's power vacuum we don't want that all right so let's begin the reign of terror that is around us first of all we're gonna want to buy a quick revive you only get three of them if you don't have to play colleges on bees then you're a sausage roll but I will work you through it just a little bit all right so we don't really care about points we just care about getting to a high ass round the last time we did this I think what was it do we get to 32 doing this challenge I kind of did it on the back end of my wash stream it was like a circuit let's give it a go and it actually turned out to be really really awesome and you guys loved it so far screw it let's do it now if I was actually trying to get to a high round you would say pop alcoholic in it audio is terrible oh my gosh what's wrong with the audio whoa whoa whoa the sound fucked up let me check let me check let me check I asked round the last time we did this challenge

that thumbs up button I'd really appreciate it I'm reading my chat you're all typing like crazy mule kick oh and your mule kick Drakon thundergun truck on I actually don't want a third gun by the way guys if you're wondering why I don't I just didn't want to take it I'd rather have it so you know like say if I get trapped to the corner down on my ah then I can just switch a switch weapon and my Thunder guns right my hand like this no sorry for panic am i oh my god paddock over use monkey bombs don't need you just yet yes I should have done it so I had a what's it called the drops we should rip we should have got rid of disorderly combat yes I just wait to put on for fun you know I wanted to put it on for too long I think the Drakon might have actually been the best best decision you know for a secondary gun because it's like a one-shot kill there's a very smart way of doing this I've been rain drops yes actually you know you don't need rain drop she could've them the way we could've done this is per coholic so get all the perks then we could about it so it's fire sale crate power and power vacuum that would have been the GUP the way when it I think that I think that would have been the way I'm reading matchup shouts Kevin Thomas Reaper strike Oliver seal cash what up brother cash meows ah how bad dad Jamie please thank you very much to sponsor the stream I appreciate it Keaton further better said your zombie live streams are my favorite thing on YouTube I appreciate man well I just like I much prefer streaming then I do making videos so what I'd like to do is I'd like to do my daily vlogs and then somehow fit in and our live stream on YouTube like every day that'd be pretty sick people say like why not twitch but I'd rather do like pretty cool live streams on YouTube you know what I'm playing zombies or whatever is like a TV show cuz I my vlogs are like a TV show you know they go live at 6 o'clock but I could be like if the folks will have a 6 I could do something seven you know what like but for seasons okay I'm gonna do a season of Minecraft and I'm gonna do a season of a car do zombies you not soething bet you like a season of GTA I don't know how long a season lasts far but I just saying that boys shit wait filled donate $45 I saw it I said Nick we're watching you since you had a hundred subs you've helped me through some depression and watching my grandma oh no you come I got more neurons bro it fucking sucks man you saw it with me it's the most awful thing in the world thank you for making me laugh I hope you continue to do this for a while wait field you want our guidance thank you very much brother much love to your face I'm so sorry to about your going on it sucks I will get that's great pal we don't want create power that's useless to us if you're wondering why create powers useless to us it's because if you don't hit the box then the box doesn't move and these zombies when you kill them will not drop a you know a fire sale so kind of sucks so that's why we should have put the fire sale gobbled month what is your evil to just helped out but realistically what guns did we need not really anything what we should look the ultimate way to do this is you should do wall power crate power and let me explain why is because you can buy the gun up there and then you could put the repack punch on it so you buy it pack a punch then you could always have it so it has a you know electric dead wire a dead tap dead wire dead one so you can have it so it ever has dead wire on it or Thunder wall on it or you know somewhat of that and you can just keep buying them off the wall it's like probably smartest way to go about it let's get it up end of the round suck up oh no it's not I can hear one behind me wait how many natural it take two three four not a minute I'm thinking we've got a doges round coming up here I feel a little bit of waffles I'm feeling the afters hey Tom I always watch your vlogs and streams

should've gone down there no way we're a green right we just got hat off we deaf we'll just got hot off the game fucked is there sack littler all right what do we need to look at here shopping spree 5 fire sale alright let's try and have a look at a different way to do these gobble gums guys so on the house is good rain drops it is good I think we need to get rid of this I'm put on this there's a difficult there's a difficult conundrum I'm out here right if we take that off right if we get rid of that and put fire sale on and we got crate power so create power and fire sale can go hand-in-hand don't get around good but we also want it now if we right now we need to get rid of fire sale and we need to put on gun bar off the wall is pack a punched yeah because then that we could do that little pistol then we need to get rid of crate power even though it's good we need to get rid of create power and replace that with the repack punch gun in hand which is there so then that way I could buy that good off the wall have the Zap that's the way to do it we don't probably you know what we don't even need on the house so we could do create power still so should we still do great power I reckon we should I reckon we could still do great power get the fire sale gobblegum see I'm a I'm at a crossroads because if I can get fire self from that and it still I still run the risk of trying to get crate power in time all right right let's give this girl right let's open up a few of these first dummy you did get hit yeah I got here I saw my stuff get hit but no way like that no way enough to go down just right a Devon hurt said ha thanks man Josh right hates I'm the best what you doing won't you be this warm of how you coming up sometimes your best huge river and I hope you come to

furnace is not so bad it's actually a good setup this is the setup or we could we would be asking for you know I mean it's harder because we can buy we can buy this gun off the wall so we can kill the zombies with this you know as much as it takes there to be honest the thunder wall would have been a good decision because then it's like it is zombies in front of us we can get rid of him but then we've got this and look I can switch to it dead fast I just really didn't want three guns hey term widows wine yeah it could have been useful but the one thing I don't want your it probably would have been worth picking up the extra perk because now I've got these two perks if I would have picked it up stamina up would have been good and someone else living goods so we should really should have

streamers okay so before I get into this what do I need to do I add my dad harvest and Lord of trees because my dad is just basically a bum who lives in my house if you guys didn't know in the sims what I'm doing with this series is my name's Tom I've done YouTube for seven years five years of which I use play video games so this character right here is it's supposed to be me but I couldn't get the right haircut and it just kind of panned out the way it did alright so don't judge me it just it just came out like that alright so that's me as we can all tell as everyone remember Lee bullied me the entire last time is that I got fat and I had jiggly tits in game great best best viewers ever oh we also had an incident where this woman came into my house and she she stole a toy car from me I was like bitch so a killer there's also the other problem of where's a shit there i've got ta âlâ antonio read and then that we're trying to bang a ghost as well but actually also no death but i don't where death is on my my friends list fucking friends doesn't really like a video again so so yeah basically what what's been going on over here is i've got three kids and that's just the life of Tom

weird Calvino said Tom how's the cats and while treating you the wives to Sade I love it to pieces but do you know what the problem is joining all the problem is cats keep shitting on my bed so I reckon we need to spice things up we need to start we need to start stepping up what we're doing in this world because we want to building a house now what's that let me just save it real quick and go to my neighborhood because I got something to show you I've got some to show you how don't go to my neighborhood how do I do it this nope this marriage rocks I think maybe this just go to manage

however he shouldn't have been killed he should have been tortured for the rest of his fucking life but I do not want to focus on that for the rest of this dream not because I'm being rude or ignorant to the fact of what happened it's just that were positive vibes it I spoke about it on Twitter I don't exactly speak about it today so I hope you guys can respect to understand that alright so you might be able to recognize this right here I cut her whatever I wanted like how do I kind of visit this house I kind of want I'll just want to visit it back in Ben how do I visit it if you guys could

electrical engineering now the electrical engineering that we said we can we could do is just keep repairing things and fixing things because I don't really think you can get a job as like an engineer so you know that's a bit bit of an odd one my dad he was a builder in real life so he can just still do his own thing but after we do the other engineering when we want to go and do game design and programming so I think we might skip the electrical engineering things I can't really take it and once I get past the highest-ranked in this job category or I mixologist level 8 okay so I've got two more jobs to go when I get through this career we're gonna move into the tech guru one because that's kind of like programming game design I know you can do programming on the computer but again I'm still working my downs I know it's so weird but don't worry about it you know I'm a noob when it comes to it all how's everyone doing there where we are from are you gonna make this series more

high school and me and Lydia would have seen each other from this point four six years later so it's people being like ah honestly Lydia in the game I'd probably just make a really racist version of her not meaning to purposely do it but that would probably end up happening but Leigh Ellis thank you very much bro appreciate up and camera Mariah love from Island she's brilliant all right I'm bout

get better go on well keep it going look at you strain it's true we'll go we'll go up one level just to help him lose some weight and then we'll be fine oh sure got working 20 hours I won't forget that we'll be fine there's no place in this game yet can you believe this game came out in 2014 and they're still releasing updates for it it's like GT when did GTA come out GTA 5 does anyone know when that came out I'm not too sure if it's off man I was she shouted me again go I'll ass Yoshi could stick around she's helping me do it faster and we need to go home after this okay I'm energized after this for you to go home where's home where's home okay how do I go home Wow oh shit oh wait I can't work out why not I've got no energy okay okay let's let's step outside there's too much going on how do I time to go home are there okay everyone oh shit I need to go to bed quick yo Phillip Tom I like I like that you called Tom but I also think it's crazy whatever the name is you don't need with Queen er I don't know that means GTA came out in 2013 are you serious gta5 came out in 2013 and there's still after four years releasing updates for it how mad is that also some what was say within cases it's kind of true because like right in case is if you guys it knows where I was doing hydro depending was so much fun I was really getting to it I was all about it was fucking epic but then I found like honest to god like I created that that business that name everything because there was nothing else named it there was something called Inc case but the company hadn't done anything in like say two years three years or anything like that and after a week of me announcing the name of like the brand being encased this company came out of nowhere did a Kickstarter raised like a hundred 40 grand and then like you know unbox therapy did a video about and stuff like that and I fought like you know because mine was they did a digital screen for a phone where his man was phone cases I was like maybe you know people can tell the difference that it's not the same thing but no Klong behold everyone's like Tom Tom these these people stole your idea is the same thing is the same thing sounds like you know there's too much similarity with the name so I decided that I'm gonna rename it rebrand it I'm good cuz Inc case to me was like the coolest name ever it made so much sense and I'd like to just keep it but you know except like I don't like how much of a life start lifespan is that encased in case company gonna have compared to encased because I'll constantly be making phone cases for stuff whereas I don't know you know I don't know ma'am so I'm just I'm just little bit going that that ended up being the case so it sucks but I think I'll do a rebrand and then after the rebrand will get rockin rollin again and by then I'll file the phone cases and stuff today yeah I think I'm doing like 10 I think I'm doing in like 10 cases and then I'm gonna give a the first 10 away well I'm gonna keep the first like three like a bit last time and then make my own but I spoke to some people who do like proper hydro dip in and they gave me some like pretty cool advice and stuff I need to I basically need to go and find a factory to do inks I need a very sterile environment like with an extract to bringing out dust and stuff art because any piece of dust that lands on your phone case while you're doing it ruins the entire case so it's kind of share alright oh shit I'm gonna get new upgrade for a job I want to just build my house this is exactly what my dad's house lit is like at home so right now we're just mundane we're doing this great and so Scotland would you play testing me too I might try it on PC you know I just wasn't in does anyone here isn't only into

companies called something case because like phone case is just in general woods that's why it was so good that I came up with Inca who the fuck are you Judas right please don't be another teenager right serious pause the game why do all the teenagers just keep coming to my house Brandon the reason why I stream to YouTube sometimes is whenever you see me stream to YouTube it's cuz I streams on YouTube and then that video that stream I want it to turn into a video on my youtube channel when I stream on Twitch that's when I'm streaming for eight hours of summer like that or whatever and I stream it but then I don't really care about the outcome in the video I don't need it's got my youtube I don't need to stare at which I don't really care about it I just do like that so right back to

was like kind of my life and at the same time I'd started my youtube channel and I was like you know getting it all going and seeing that was all planning out and that's how things were then after I started taking off with my youtube channel I finished my first year electric engineering so I didn't do that I still have a job with McDonald's and I went and did game design and programming so it's like we kind of skip your let's go engineering part because I can't really do that in this game so I'm doing the game is that a program so you can see me doing like programming on my computer but the

out we're only good money because we're in a high you know a high-paid job right now so it's good but one one of these days I might do it off stream just cuz I'm tempted to because I really want to get the series moving along so I may actually skip to him being the top of his career so we can get like the chef one out the way so then we can leave the chef branch and then focus on the video games because then I can program the videos name the video games and stuff like that and we could start making royalties of it because that's what's that want to start doing this like this is the game for me he's going really really slow now I forgot how slow it was I figured with this stream we'd be done by now on to like the video game segment of my career but it's not caught up yet so unfortunately not just yet we'll have to work I think in between streams I might skip it a little bit forward don't worry you will not miss anything out if anything good does happen I'll record it and then I'll play it in the stream on a next to it but that's just kind of where we're at right now with that guys but I have we have to save this because I've been streaming for like two hours for your faces

ladies and gentlemen welcome your face is back to some more counter-strike unboxing videos where today you guys seem to either love or hate the editing so team love team hate decided in the comments because I personally love it you guys lock the editing we won't be including Robin but today we are continuing on with our operation breakout case keys why because we want the butterfly Mac this has now become a vendetta an information for us to hunt down the one beautiful knife which is known as the exceedingly rare but fine app now as you can see I don't usually have as many cases as you usually have but I wouldn't worry about it because I bet yeah basically my banker got canceled yeah I think the bank was like hey yeah it's issues spending nine thousand seven hundred and fifty eight dollars on csgo unboxings and I was like no and yeah now we're gonna get naps it's gonna be worth it so we're demonstrating this guy's and we are going to get a knife and the way this series works okay if you are new to this so I new to my channel anything like that I like to unbox these and basically we're doing this every single week this is becoming a weekly thing every Friday where we're going to upload a video was doing it I was doing it every three days just way too much my addiction is getting real and the buttons are crazy yes oh my god or cities on a boy titties olive bobbing deeper city nice mate yes so the way this works is I give away the highest rated skin I get so for example right now if you leave your steam profile name down below in the comments you get the chance to win this and for the record I actually have a Pinay TAS enough that looks like it got dragged through a dustbin okay so you guys can win this by simply leaving your steam name below and that is actually up for grabs but I'm not done yet call right now and I go and get the cyrex you guys will win the cyrix because the high-rate got basically the highest skin rank there you guys get it but if it's a knife I'm keeping it and go fuck yourself because I want the knife but wow what a way to start this a peanut it asked him off which basically looked factory-new if you don't mind me saying might be minimal wear but my lord adjust I want to look at that again just oh it's beautiful it's absolutely beautiful we are hey we don't even need to open a full 20 case I think I don't know how many cases I got but we don't need to it open like a crazy amount we'll take your car we'll take your car I'm a fan of the Kois well I'm Kelly I'm and I cannot bought I have no strong feelings one way or the other I'll take a car not bad so at least I get to keep a car out of this episode for we're gonna keep her going I keep bookkeeper Golan because what we want to do is give it all is to get a butterfly knife now I could get any of the knife in the name a killin Huntsman I get flip knives I'd get anything I got personally I don't want it don't want it don't need it don't like it my oh my

you know what today I woke up and thought let's do something stupid and that certain thing of stupidness is I'm putting my op Dragonball fat Renu on the way I'm gambling on csgo whoa I'm going for the jewelry no 50-50 chance of winning because of this reason right now okay I want it to go with the series on my channel of going from like a $10 bet to an insane bet winning a dragon law on camera and we never got it on camera for the record it's just I won it one day when I was winning lots of money and it was going great and we got loads of skins like oh how I got my Crum bit but I go dragon long now as much so of this dragon law and I want to keep it I don't think it's fair for my series of youtubing to have this without making a video gambling so I'm putting myself in a risky position right now and a 50/50 split on camera terrorists of gambling the dragon war because you guys didn't see me win it you're gonna see me gamble it now I really do not want to do this this is absolutely ridiculous and stupid I've probably only had this Dragonball for like two weeks if that but I'm gonna gamble it because I'm an idiot and you guys deserve to see me at least put it on the line and risk it there's a lot of people in the chat now wondering what the hell I'm gonna do and I'm gonna put this up on a whine and cry myself to sleep if I lose this now I love sniping I love y'all a lot people come play come play the game but actually I do I finally got my right back but anyway I'm a beast who deserves a dragon lord I hope so you guys ready for me to click accept and risk $1300 on the line and see and hope and pray if someone is gonna put in a dragon off for mine so Dragon Ball for Dragon Ball I don't know someone is you might just put in knives but for some stupid reason I am going in with my Dragon Ball I'm just doing it we're going for it book two right in the mistake and there it is there's no there's no going back now I actually feel somewhat sick I'm saying this right now I feel sick uh-huh oh my goodness Albert went in with three really ice knives no dragon more so what is gonna happen how we gonna lose our we're gonna win no I cry every time oh well unfortunately I lost the Dragon Lord the most stupid bet I've ever ever done it would have been nice to go in with dragon will versus dragon law I would have got a faction new Knight out of it that would have been absolutely sweet as chips and some other knives knives as well bought fortunately boys we and girls we ended up losing their riperoni pepperoni but at least now I can start my series of regaining the dragon law from now on we're getting a gambling series join where we're going from nothing to the deal or so care if you're out there I'm gonna try and take a deal or off you oh you're gonna take all my skins off me so I'm gonna now go throw myself out the window thank you very much for watching this oh yeah and now it plays that again just to tease me this is someone's thank you very much watching check out so yes co-op if you want to check it out and

throughout this entire segment entire gameplay that you watch it's gonna be monster cat new releases I've got to link them down in description so appreciate them for the tunes but yeah this is my new Island last time we have actually started off with a pretty uh pretty small island this time it's an island in the middle of nowhere but it's big so I guess there's a bonus from that I do like to actually be in a small island like last time it was just a volcano I actually I'm not sure whether I found the island last time or I made it I'm pretty sure I made it and then put the world into hardcore I don't even know how to do it's a hardcore dad should you into normal I don't know if I had to call series existed so I'm not too sure about that one but we are here we talked me a lava on

looked on YouTube firm Islands sought spawn seeds and these are the ones I found I could actually start on this island or maybe like go across to another smaller island like that size island or something because this isn't does this class is an island all right Kezia faces 2 months so bro does it classed as an island this or does it classes a fucking mountain range yeah oh by the way if

did not think we're gonna work out how to do it I don't know how it was gonna pan out at anything but nonetheless we months to do it that was super good fun the map is nice I hate the fog I always hate all the fog in any soccer game just because it's just it's frustrating they might if you get my ads in them like an element of like to me it's just disgusting I hate I'd rather do just got rid of it or let us do a custom match and toggle fog on and off but if that that affects the boss comin or not then fine whatever but like make it a custom match that we can mess around with and it gives us it gives everyone that happy medium don't if you want to play them up and they don't care about going on the leaderboard so you can play without fog that's all stuff but nonetheless I think the map it's really fun it's really easy to get used to the map and the layout of everything there's obviously so much more in depth with the Easter Egg and I know it's art being completed like mr. Rafa waffles and oblem guys a tweeting like full videos of like it being completed and how to do it and stuff so GG's to these homies for like the grind of that I don't particularly like doing the big Easter eggs and stuff I will try and do it at least once you guys saw in the last map I actually managed to do that and it was like Gigi's all-round managed to do it but yeah man it's it's too much hassle if you like getting to the same part that dying or just not knowing what you're doing trying to discover the rooster I'm trying to say he's just fucking awful but that's what I like to do I like to play them out or wait see how it planned out and it was super super fun I'm really happy I did that so guys thank you very much for tuning make sure we've like rate and subscribe and yeah I will definitely be playing that again and I'm looking forward to play me know what me no ever been talking say we're gonna play sand place together so we'll get that rock in a rolling so if you guys do when we join me in my adventure traveling and vlogging daily vlogging youtube-dot-com forward-slash life of Tom you guys can find me down linked in description like I said I'm going out snowmobiling notice if you want to go see what that goes like then yeah click that link and subscribe so much love I'm going and I'll see you guys later adios 
I know I know I don't I said I know but I don't know what's actually going on for some reason I've just been on the hype of absolutely loving Minecraft I think it's cuz I'm used to playing games at the moment which just consists of me spawning dies spawning dying spoiling dying and there being no investment of creativity into it whatsoever so this video is exactly what the title suggests it is episode four hundred of the my craft project kinda I probably didn't put the kinder in the title but it is a little bit of context Before we jump into this I was streaming on twitch.tv for I said you could have been streaming in like every single damn day like called you is Dom bees pop G minecraft Lonely Island 2.0 2.1 and 2.2 and 2.3 this is just getting and I decided to load up the video from a Nick wey who created the rap song for episode 400 which never got posted now if you're wondering why did it get posted what the hell when was the last episode of the micro project anyway who cares the answer to that is right here April 19th 2014 it was that long ago that I posted the final in-game episode of the micro project episode 399 that long ago that if you look in the background and currently still living at my dad's house and in the game I'm actually designing the current house I'm now living in inside Minecraft which I just think is like the most mind-boggling thing possible but it was the final in-game episode because I was just so bored of feed the beast I was so bored of just you know man and doing nothing looking new to explore it was just all too technical with the feed the beast the thing I loved about Minecraft if he just being simple and building and creative and it was just just beautiful it was almost like Maya Knight season one where everything was just fun and created for new and then it's easy to it just got a bit over complicated and technical and stuff like that and I didn't want to do it I just want to have fun mess around and not feel tied down to have to do something that I didn't want to do so for everyone asking oh my god dog was season 3 season 3 is probably never gonna happen I'll tell you that right now just I know it's sad it's probably ever kind of happen but what is gonna happen is a my night MMO more information coming soon well back up to the weight of it so you're posting episode 400 how is this what is going on now the video was always created by Nick wey it was there it was ready to rock and roll he posted it book I wanted to create an animation along with the music video so it was just the most epic perfect video at all but unfortunately I didn't expect what happened with the animation I hadn't animate a plan to actually create a music video for the actual rap and just like highlights throughout my channel over the years of the micro project and it was just gonna be absolutely beautiful from things like fire city to to pimp my Minecraft to the April Fool's of blow and everything looked just like an epic montage if you're all just happening and I thought it was gonna be absolutely perfect absolutely brilliant for the animators had to walk away because they were busy with other projects it was gonna take over a mug to do and it just became a thing of this is probably never gonna happen so what I decided to do over on twitch.tv for the syndicate we're a bit stream pretty much every day and live streaming the the whopping 2.0 2.1 2.1 2.2 seasons of Lonely Island and went ahead and live streamed the actual 400th episode but without the animation so this video you're about to watch right now is the official music audio but not video Fripp's afford route so it is 400 kinda I'm just gonna throw this out there real quick I'm very tempted to do a season four of the micro project like I really am if this video receives a ton of love and you guys leave some comments down below like your favorite moments just to bring but they're like the reminiscent of just pure epicness I don't even know if that's a word for also knowing that minecraft and Mo yang a finally releasing new content that was the whole reason I have to do feed the piece because it was the same thing but they're talking about bringing out new mobs there's a new Woodland mansion that I didn't even know about there's images vindicate as a focus and illusionist I am very tempted like I'm really enjoying minecraft at the moment and the fact that I'm doing Lonely Island hardcore it's stressing me out because I keep dying and I'm just not prepped enough I need to go back to the micro project where I should get good at minecraft again die bunch of times and then finally take on lonely Iowan as a 2.0 official which is actually two point three weeks I died each time before spoiler I'd give it a go so 100 episodes and then truly be able to be say I'm prepped for lowly island 2.0 kind of properly done the way it should be so if you guys want that let me know in the comments down below make sure you leave a like rating and without further ado enjoy the music video without the animation and if there's any animators out there if you're like getting in touch please tweet me if you want to work with me on a really awesome animation I've like the best highlights which I need highlights of you guys to say what we should put as the video portion of the episode 400 to recreate as a bonus video in the future please let me know please get in touch and let's make something epic happen so enjoy this this is what it was gonna be ready thank you for subscribing this is so weird looking at the world [Music] did

and I can read it there I'm still reading the chat so don't really for you to be able to talk or anything like that I can still see what everyone is saying I will be reading it throughout but a lot of time I will be concentrating on the zombies because as you guys have seen this when I go for something shiny like an insta-kill or something like that I go down so I don't exactly want to be going for those things even though I kind of want those things so it's a bit annoying because I want to concentrate but I want to read the chat so if you feel like I'm not reading the chat it's because I'm concentrate on zombies on zombies you literally have to just turn into a zombie and run around in circles the entire time and it drives you crazy but we'll just we'll just hit we'll see how it goes I'm going to start this challenge off attempting the first room challenge that's how I want to do this started off for the first room because I just feel like it's the most speedy and efficient way to do this and it should be good but it can be very stressful and there's a lot of stupid shit I can do if it gets to a point where I'm stressing out I need to get the hell out of it then I'll open a door and we'll just go from there so how we all feel about that lieutenant dang I know it's one of a double double reward er what we got full of the same one alright alright let's let's see how things

cookbook let me just claim my free ugh my boys there alright so what have we got oh my god oh that is exact oh this is amazing alright by the way you should always check these out every single day

but I've got ten of them in tall which is a pretty damn sweet alright I like that I like that a lot alright so now we're going to do these ones as well because power vacuum guys that power vacuum actually secures as four rounds I'll show you what this is this right there is kind of guarantee nose around around 100 all I have to do is get to light round 60 then use that and were there because I'm trying to do this as fast as possible right now I could do this with just the thundergun and a good on the stage and no gobble gums which is not the traditional way but I've already done that I've got no reason to do that like in the old-school way so we're going to try and do is using gobble gums and get there as fast as possible now I have to say that was a hell of a lot of donations that just came through so it's can be difficult to fucking read them so jakecooper wait I've got got 24 of those things done that is crazy but wait if you guys are impressed by anything let me just show you this right now gobble I have 41 perco holux right this I think this is what we want but right we need mmm this is where it's gonna get difficult cuz I should have planned this out beforehand but I'm just going for it but we said Jack Cooper thank you very much next time comes Devon Oh next time do your talk come to Devon I'd love to go to Devon Rob part thank you very much life of Thorpe

alright why is it streaming 7:20 because I tried streaming in 1080p a second go and it did not like it alright so this is where we're going we're going to start to start the first room challenge and we want to achieve that now I do realistically need wall power and then repack punch it I don't need a pack a punch gun from the box I don't need it it would be good but we don't need it so I think this is the perfect self now rain drops does indeed rain drops does indeed give you max ammo and perks so we're kinda wasted picking up the perks from that is kind of wasted simply because I won't per Kahala con cuz I've got that but the only useful thing from this is that it guarantees as a max ammo and a box here and the deaf machine and insta kill and stuff like that so it's good so it's kind of like a panic mode ah I need to get out here and survived so we just could have to see how things got I think this is a good set up because we want to read back a bunch whatever we get from the wall which is obviously we want the little machine gun and get dead wire on it so I think this is our setup guys so who's ready for room who's ready for a little bit of zombies I'm just gonna click this a little one more time just for good luck all right for good luck you know I'm gonna use this let's try and get my gobble gums down to one one five four you know a good look start you know what I'm saying okay it it's exam week for me and then I graduate gratulations kay you're gonna smash it you're gonna get all the best grades that you need I think you'll be set right it's one more 500 cowboy cow Mima by Rick showing outward to this room to see you back on zombies watch everyday my respected thank you very much what about round one more five you never know if we could get there it would be dope but right now we're just aiming for 100 power vacuum that's exactly what we want right now thank you very much Luis is pronounced ela o Allah that's an awesome come by talking about I'd love to thank you very much for that don't forget guys if you are in it I really appreciate it click that share button in a Lightbourne it means a lot thank you very much to everyone is a massive support in this room Elliott Collier turned 16 years today and I spent it watching your vlogs oh you should go out done something well thank you for watching anyway I don't who say thank you very much for sponsoring Isaac oh inside time keep the heavy bro and prodigy thank you very much alright last God welcome to open and we're going in for it oh you are saying I could put in round robin I could put on round robin and we'd skip through these rounds super quick but I don't think I want to there's the speed of round robin if you guys don't know what round robin is by the way let me show you and round robin say if i replaced if I replace raindrops right with round robin I have 23 of them that's 23 guaranteed skip rounds it's fast that's there's so many good setups you can do i do want to pack a punch gone now I'd rather have the repack a punch so we can get dead wire on it alright we're going for this ladies and gentlemen this can be my attempt at round 100 don't forget I could possibly go down I'm going to try and read the chat if I do read the chat great if I miss the chat please don't think I'm ignoring you or being rude I don't mean to I've just got a concentrate okay hey what's the stream of work shaking Shh Jakub keep it quiet hope you like the phone cases dude got it on right now absolutely love it I just need to put syndicate sticker on the back of it in which set rip my provision to fish quick question before you leave what top ten things that make you happy top ten things that make me happy family family adventure experience you know that start stuff make last you shot make most of it they go alright alright alright it's probably gonna be a very slow start per Kahala keys good for us just because I can't be asked getting to like round fifty then going down and submit you know and try to get on my perks back I'd rather then just hit the box and see what we get so hey Tom just graduated this past Saturday congratulations paladin Phoenix congratulations turn your face alright let's try and see how we can do this alright we can get per coholic off the start is that what it is oh nope so wall power alright we'll take it down because we can actually use this straightaway on this bad boy up here all right so if we buy this the rk5 let's make sure we're doing this all right look now the pocket punch good nope like why the tits is interest on this oh sweet I've got I've got I've got fast mags on this as well I'm the elos scope so this makes our life difficult alright you know what I'm going to do I know it started it a little bit late and I can always do is timer I'm actually gonna start a stopwatch to see how fast we can fly through this don't forget might go slow up we'll have to see alright this is the slowest first round ever though anyway so you know no stress no stress Oh or round two you didn't you guys didn't know it was that fast so fast did you get your stuff into peel box Liam I'm not too sure I have got letters boy if you've sent a box I haven't gotten to collecting boxes yeah video idea you've logged my junior martial arts class if you're gonna kick my ass I'm not sure how I feel about get my ass beat but we'll have to see Jack Quinn has a dead trim you know what I think Jack Quinn has a very amazing haircut so you just get back yourself I'm choking all right chuckling all right here we go alright so this kinda helps us a bit I'm joking it just helped us a lot having all the perks so now we've got double tap everything should go a little bit faster and a little bit smoother obviously double tap helps drop these zombies like one two three all right these guys are sparring in so slow I can make eye candy comprehend it so if we get rain drops we probably should have switched out raindrops for fire sale but we don't need to actually we actually don't need to alright what we do what is we do want raindrops though alright that's good I know you might be like why are you taking it why are you taking that now we don't need it just yet necessarily but I'm going to take it because the lower rounds we get nooks and stuff like that but what I do want to get we don't have great power but we want to try and pick three guns so let's try and pace this out right so we want to pick up double will get this this this alright then we'll go for this the new that that and that alright if you're wondering why I did that is because I could get maximum of all my monies what's that I'll have to perk down there but can get anyway right now we've got three guns that we get from the box ISO one we want to try and get the Thunder gun from here that's what we want we want the Thunder gun we want the Thunder gun with my ambush alright keep her going we definitely do not want the sniper rifle so let's try and get rid of it alright we don't want that either I'm on his box a box I still got this yeah we still got that I get rid of the let's get rid of the starting pistol all right we got an LMG up in here it's not exactly good but it's not exactly bad this can get us through the starting rounds so let's use up this ammo rather than getting the front of gun straight away because this can just look this will just speed me through the rounds so let's use these guns and the LMGs and stuff that I've got just to pick up these zombies will probably use this to light round 15 maybe and then we'll try and keep it in the box try and see if we can get some bear boys and then I think about round 50 we're going to start using the motor cob you know the four round put we'll see how that goes where's the latest vlog it goes up at 6:00 p.m. as you can tell it's not 6:00 p.m. yet so alright let's see what we've got so now we do have the Rex caliber we want to get this pack punched as soon as possible Vesper and the dingo okay okay alright let's see how this goes let's say glory to Victor well sup Marcus how you doing man what's it what's rob it good to see you again you're always up in here please pick me off these headshots like it's nothing the only good thing about having like these guns so far is just crits are such a fast rate at fire and just pick up the zombies so fast the start we done nope you guys last ones nope still more still mop anything but there is one particular is it one more zombie I can hear him Oh deafness sheet I'm assuming it's gonna be go jeez next this is quite a quite long round alright I swamp dumb still not the last what with yeah there is alright time to see some doges up in here alright don't forget every light five rounds we're gonna get dogs so I'm extremely dogs

from Australia hell yeah dynamic Dawson thank you very much much luck to Australians tomorrow geez down and out much love to you Isis good I might like I said I may actually go into Australia not confirmed probably and no what if I do end up coming it would be pretty doe just saying we should publish that using the dingo just cuz it's so fast Byron we could if we wanted to use that raindrops to try and get the Thunder gun in our pocket straight away but I'm gonna wait until we get to and probably gonna wait until we get to lie around 15 before I use the next raindrops because we do want to that we want to get south we want to get the pack a punch on this gun so we'll just have to see how things go alright thank you very much for sharing the stream don't forget guys if you do stray out this share out the stream means a lot so thank you alright maybe should keep that for up close and personal and and let's go for a let's go for some dingo kills you know I'm saying you know I'm saying and there is you stat youtube I do I hope it's going well via now we really oh wait what the help um I meant to start a stop a timer to see a stopwatch show but I ended up starting a five-minute timer instead so from round one to seven took us five minutes of five minutes in the bag do a vlog I'll do a bit of a vlog in a minute so you guys want to get hyped up for the blog everybody so hope all right we're starting it round seven only a shitload more rounds to go right wait is this gonna skip skip the round yet all right please skip the round and not just slow the round down you're not upset yeah skip the round so like how I said this my day just goes to nothing well this is what I'm doing all day starting front of this computer playing zombies because I wanna try gets around 100 currently on a whopping round 8 and about to get attacked but here's all the stream going hype - e hype and let's hope everything goes okay wish me luck it's Steve okay as far as I'm aware Steve is a chilling like a villain Deadshot it's just so satisfying to use them I usually it used to be my least favourite perk but then it's just like it's so good it's just so good you're not saying I'm saying all right come on right I think I said round 15 to try and get the thundergun but I'm actually gonna do it lower because I don't want to get to the high rounds and it gets a bit of a you know a situation with my earner I'd rather just have it in my back pocket I do love this LMG I don't think I've got wrap it I don't think I've got rapid-fire for it yet or anything like I don't think I have stopped for it or anything so that's not exactly it's not exactly good I don't forget at the high rounds I may run out if I do get to 100 I might run on stage and try and try goal for 100-plus there all right let's go Oh everyone in the chats now bringing the hide or that is some height right there look at that look at all that height god damn I'm assuming you saw someone say send nudes in the chat there please don't send nudes I appreciated them it the thought that counts plz please thank you very much for donate you might appreciate a lot yeah we don't actually get a lot not exactly these a lot of pints here but oh oh yes we are locking attachments for this yes I don't know how this go to lock chair I didn't even know I bloody had it I didn't even bloody I bloody had it I wonder if the double pipes classes as classes as double a you know weapon unlock as well that'd be pretty sick a bit cheeky that boy before it would be pretty though be all doping the boat massive shout-out to everyone who clicks that share button if you are new around here make a youtube channel click that subscribe button I'm gonna be streaming all day trying to get to at a in one hand out

I'm gonna go to 15 like I said round 15 like I said we have got if you're like why have you got a pack a punch pistol that is so that's so damn you so really dumb and we could have actually swapped crate power out but the reason for this is if I run out of ammo with this pistol I can just go up here buy some more you know I mean and because I'm going to be killing a lot of zombies in these early rounds I can just get as many points as I can early on all right and the reason why I'm using the LMGs just because I want to mark attachments for it I think I've almost got all the attachments for the vespa so I'm not really gaining much out of it because if I pause you can see I'm level 26 at wait am I yeah I'm level 26 when we get to 35 because we're gonna prestige and over the next viewer like a few days or weeks or whatever I'm gonna be streaming trying to get to a 10 prestige in zombies which will take a long time cuz double xp zone right now and it when that wears off man everything's just gonna go fucking slow you know that mega slow also by the way I once seen the film Kidal hood or adulthood if you have did you know they made a brother put a third one was I'm just gonna say what was not exactly a good film it gets like mmm must be reasonable here gets about a 1 out of 10 storyline kind of all over the place right Doge is way yeah alright let's try and see if I

rate of fire is so slow but ladies and gentlemen we got the Thunder good that's good right now what we want is Bullock boost purple not--that's power vacuum do I look like I wanted that little bit no I don't want that what we could do by the way is get another wall power and swatch switch this out for this even though I don't think I have any attachments for it so everybody give me some hype in the chat let's do this who dat sponsor there who dat who there how do could thank you very much for sponsoring I appreciate a lot thank you alright see this is now slow it's too slow I don't like how slow disease we're gonna start getting a little bit hectic now because this this good just does not kill them quick enough it's powerful don't you owe me a little bit but it's not like rapid-fire or fast mags estimate but when we get this or baby now it's good now it's that instant all right let's try and hit this and see if we can get the pack punch thing that I want bullet boost we got bullet boost that's what we want with fire now we want to try and get dead wire we get dead wire then we are we're pretty happy we're happy little campus I hope that that makes sense to people around the

Mitchell Sam I'm so sorry bro sorry I don't know at all you said if you're a zombie would you eat Steve the walls no jump oh I'm like oh my god imagine a zombie Steve now that now that would be pretty dope I am completely wasting ammo here but I just do not care it's so early rounds that I'm just like one shot head shining because you know this thing fires all growed up fast so I'm just I'm literally just wasting this now if I had turned on and this would actually be you okay come on out oh yeah one set they still house he shit kind of hate windows whines be honest I just need to be careful but zombies are coming behind me when I'm stood here a camera if they can I think I'm stood forward enough for them not to kill me hello good eyes you have dead zombies Oh jello rows are made oh is it alright let's go ahead and switch this all right where'd we get dead why Oh suck my dick my name's Rick hey how long you think it'll take to get to around 100 a shower wait let's think about

good alright so let's try a lot bit training go say that should have killed them I do I've gotta admit I do hate dead wire hate it it's so good it's so bad all these the thing is if I get panicked

pretty good setup the only thing I could have won it is like you know make all zombies stand still that could have been like a good switcheroo oh no I try to work out how can I lose this mp4 I could hit the box to try and get some of the switches faster like another pistol somewhere or I could hit the box to try get monkeys because I've got raindrops on huh well actually you know I could get wall power roofings Cobb wall power and then switch to that but I don't have attachments for that's my only problem hating it really really slows them down but throw that that I just slow although adapt zap zap I'm by the way I should not be going up the stairs ever I just don't like the fat I don't like the fact that when I switch I'm switching to a mp4 so I like getting kills 9 mad Weis we were to

going down actually helps it might be like that is bullshit if I've ever heard it but the reason why going down helps right now we probably want like a I custom she doesn't the reason why going down helps guys is because when I used to switch my weapon like this I used to switch from thundergun to something else to that alright but now instead what I've got is dead wired undergone dead wire thundergun which is what I won so when I panic in my air I could just quickly switch out right now that that craziness to start so not now I've got to do is try and train a little bit by getting rid of all these for God's sake I need stop running inside there all right this is such a backwards way of training here you did not train like this retard - darn it oh shit oh fuck Zack could still use this ammo okay for the record I don't have that special drop thing still on but I'm getting fucking shit or drugs do I need that maximum not necessarily what can I get it so extra bullets is better than nothing I should really other somewhat ready its round 15 was that using that wall power all the time oh shit I forgot in reload you surround me see I shouldn't even use that electric thing if I'm gonna do that and around 43 it scared of him all right we got one round in the chamber I should get rid of it the staff around Matt Clark yes I will be there if you're gonna shoot just hit me well

waste of ammo that's five like three shots up now that I didn't know I didn't mean to waste all right we are trying to get to round 50 and then keep using that power vacuum and then it's just be like

much for that but let's keep this going boys oh my god how the fuck did I just learned that shot like for real how did I learn that maybe I'm so excited but I'm real I'm really good I need to really check something real quickly might blow it what I need to check am actually recording game audio sometimes my recording software just like stops recording so I need to have a quick check so bear with me alright says it's recording if it says it's recording I believe it it must be telling me the truth why would it tell me nothing but the fault the whole truth nothing but that alright so we managed to get that kill did I drop anything good I'm not too sure what that is it man should be a shield looks like someone dead lined in the middle building where's he got there is there is there's no way we can make this happen are you kidding me nice three tree boy skis I am placing metal here for some reason sure all right good we actually got here I much like shot me in the fucking out Melissa might want to get enough supplies to be able to burn across this entire thing all right can I make it up to there I think so 10 yeah should be all right trying to keep my eyes peeled that would be where is he is in the water I'll get his shot come on nice nice the materials I didn't protect myself you need to protect my goddamn ass all right oh don't even check down on up oh oh all right see that guy nope this air could maybe try and pick up some head shots on this guy but I don't think it can I don't see anyone over there so the best thing to do here the best play would be to go up inside the house all right he'll hear this guy's gonna be aggressively pushing me now if I get up in the house another higher ground I feel like a bear got got their advantage no armor mmm that sucks oh I didn't use it are you kidding me oh my god I fucking nearly shit myself then oh my god I thought thank God I got that health off Jesus thank God I got that health off yours this guy got any health or anything no are you kidding me wow this getting I'm not shit all right that was fucking close I just kind of for a second have to like breathe and let go take your time John - John I think that's armor oh my god that is armor but I won't be able to get it no like for real I don't have the I don't have the normal health to be able to get over to it can we see what's there oh mike appendages this is so dumb i should be doing this i should be doing this at all what did i drop then tactical shotgun would polish your cycles shells right go oh fuck alright I'm gonna dive in there with this grab it get out I pop it do I want the shotgun back think am I gonna get the shotgun I've got there I got the bunny's use to be able to heal oh wait I got shotgun shit I swapped it for an SMG oh all right we go get it going we gotta get going I see you but I see you I see you up there feel like I'm being a bit too risky do I sneak up on that guy no I want to get I got keep me just enough that you guys have seen like I'm a I'm a far range fire me I can I can't handle the stress of someone being up close near me I think he's still there he's gonna peek oh my god you filthy fucking animal Tom you felt they fuck it out of Oh oh my god beautiful absolutely gonna be on the back end of the circle here though and the circle might move fast it might move too fast and too furious five left five kills come on 22 seconds all right you know what in this circumstance I'm going to take that for this and then let's go oh are you kidding me are you kidding me that took 50% health no way I'm fucked I'm so fucked bad is it did you just build a bar well we've made bad decisions boys thank you I think it might oh nice fucking hell what a spa guy beyond that tree guy up there I need to get going now we need to work our way around this left side mmm what's the play here I don't see him virtually to run straight into these hills I wonder if I can drop down well guess it just has a risk it oh I reckon he's still up there oh my god oh my god fuck that was such a close game god damn it ah car we wouldn't kill him I should have fired that grenade launcher so much sooner I'm actually just absolutely obliterated we had the plays in a previous game but we just couldn't secure that w man if I could have sniped that guy when he was up top I feel like we may have won that game because the guy who was shooting me when I was running rate was terrible but that guy just wrecked me from above so let's get into this and let's secure that W for you guys salty springs seems like a fit in place very salty after that Lost Boys well I thought I thought I had that in the bag here that would have been back-to-back wins and oh my god was I feeling it I was like let's go we can do this bring the hype bring the goddamn hype but unfortunately not but this guy's already landed way ahead of me that was ridiculous how fast he London alright where's this guy where is he I could hear you I can hear you make this pistol I love by the way nope nice oh my god that guy there's a guy behind me with a shotgun and then I got I got shot with a rifle from a distance damn it then we go again it is one thing I wish for tonight it is not have a time cycle I wish it was always a day time map well you can toggle do you want to play daytime nighttime you know I like that that's all thing I wish it had a selection process for you because I hate playing this game in the die I know it my son where but it's just a personal thing it makes me feel like depressed I'm like it's so boring I hate it but I know not everyone feels like that but I'd like to just always play this in the daytime because this map just looks beautiful absolutely beautiful but lasses gather gone let's get her going where do I want to lund mm-hmm looks like I might be the only person over at this house okay let's go I actually fucking nail getting in there then alright bogie bomb let's check indoors hello mother a little moment okay not much so far shy nice nice it's all rifle nice where is it where is this guy gum I'm gonna wait for this guy actually this guy's the guy want to fire it I can't tell feast on the reef though [Music] dancer me bitch right what was that the guy give me a sad tibi to do that let's get drinking this gud chug chug chug chug chug it chug it sugar all right okay so so far setup we're okay nice they shat on that guy's chips they had a few chips and a shot him do what take the sniper I don't think so I don't think so not feeling I'm not feeling a sniper I know we did well at the start of this this video but it's that sort this guy can come and say hello ollie once oh yeah brueski hello hello my friend just wait if ever there were you just wait if ever there old chap oh my god get going Oh shouting maybe this guy's just left yeah maybe this guy's just left cuz you realize you know what we need to get the fuck out of a shell my friend I agree with you it's not him I just fucking spotted him a fuckin half nice got his ass oh fuck is taking damage then what you got she got suckin what you got I'm taking it that's all I'm sayin oh hello do I need any of it maybe the shields might be a good idea over the sniper Thank You scope here we go the damage begins we're not too far away luckily this place not get searched you know when you're in the blue you just completely lose weight what Dad you see someone do that I'm not sure if I just saw someone up on that hill then or whether it was the bush moving I think might be the bush by the same when you're running through the blue I usually just like oh I'm never gonna see anyone I won't run defensively all high-band hills or walls or trees or anything I was keep fucking written in the fastest line possible oh my god well this is gonna be a struggle this is gonna be a serious struggle going to Maine I reload this I should have probably waited it was looting I could have fucking snuck up on him let's try it let's try and like go around him a little bit and then pop it pop it off I was just unfortunate for you maybe I'm lucky unlucky six kill yo no sniper kills at the start of this game though guys this video whoo holy Shi oh I should have probably full healed and taken something else of his dude think about that oh oh no I didn't think about that is that a little your front of me on the ground or is that just something glowing oh that shield that's not shield is it is this you the fuck just leaves a shield out there it's a trap it's a tarp all right I am I think when I get into this next circle I'm 100 sin he'll just go for the full heal let's go for it 11 left shit nice got his ass that's strafe walk boys I got way too much fucking show me right now mate we're going into this kid holy shit but you know sometimes that just doesn't make a difference sometimes you just come across a guy to the goddamn play and kick your ass I can hear the rocket I just can't see it first of all I need to work out who shot me wait wait what oh shit did I build how did he build up anyone else nope maybe take your shots at me no quick give me your goddamn shit you know what me I don't know what to tell them eating gonna know like for real I like it oh wait I think that I think that building over there just needs one rocket firing it for its claps he's still over there probably Oh blue over there I don't really need anything no doing kind of good reload it yep come on game I need to concentrate here I make it stupid fucking mistakes let's get back let's get back up to the high ground let's help this guy thinks a lot that was me oh my god it got him yes nice all right now that is coming in but I'm gonna try and heal real quick come on come on that was terrible I should have fucking killed that guy I should have totally killed that guy that was really bad plays by man all right it's probably a million and six things I could gather there but I just don't think I necessarily need it oh that was really bad shooting by me I know I know this looks pathetic and it is but I get the more chaos the more things it is for them to shoot like for real no he's not right so he's not in the car at base don't seem below me less for them to fucking fire-making I'm saying all right where you are in that hot no in the middle of there I have 15 rocket so I could just start going to town right at the circle is he in that hot is behind that tree I don't see anyone peak in anywhere oh they go down I'm so black it overwhelming with rockets well thought that rocky bag on that string in it I don't think you reading it way that boys nice alright on to you oh shit oh my god is he got is he gonna have a play the circle there unless he's gonna move up the top I think he's gonna have to get pushed out I think he's gonna have to get pushed out I think he's gonna have to get buff ice there we go oh oh yeah 11 kills boys that might be my highest kills in a video 11 killed an amazing sniper stop this is little better titty little Ellen titty guys make sure you smash that lightweight let's see how many weak yeah let's see if I can set a new record for Avenue I think the last one was 8000 let's see what we can hell this let's let's smash fucking 13,000 337 like that cuz that's how you get a victory out terrible amount of rockets gotta fight but I like it when you know

easier I did this on kino der toten where I had to run into and stuff like that you know I can there was no where there was no poker holux there was no mystery box drops or anything like I had to run

complete gaben above those saying you know what Tom you deserve that after receiving the shots let's go to quality but I like how the shot is still at the top over that I'm not too sure about how that stays but I'll Scotland we went from we went from this to this how the hell is this happening but we are seeing that we are seeing a trend we're seeing an upgrade of our items we started with a shaft then we got the USGS Kill Confirmed then we got a golden coil then we got a butterfly now I have canceled a collection so to complete the knife set we got a file should knife a butterfly mag and what is it bayonet yeah no I have no fucking idea what that is yeah bayonet we have bayonet so we're three into the collection we've got to keep going like I said this the road to collect all the knife so we now never have to open a breakup case ever again so by is absolutely I thinking again if you enjoyed the video guys make sure cook that subscribe button you see us go and box video every single Friday I love you all this was the best I thought someone was gonna fucking break through my door there I'll catch you guys next week adios later 
what's going on guys it's City kit here and ignore my friend who's telling us the story of zombies what we're gonna do today is a speedrun this is going to try and be when the fastest speed runs of starts a pack a punch as early as possible as fast as possible and by that I mean like for me speed running this map consists of getting in the game doing it as stupidly efficiently as possible and get a gun pack punched at the earliest round I did say that like twice packs back there but I have done this intro like probably bout four or five times now because because I am trying my best to do it the reason why you heard me like take a gasp and go quiet is because I really thought I just fucked up her firing that electricity off at the wall ball I think we might be good to go so right let's grab our pen because it's going to help us start the first ritual we have to ditch chases behind this so the quicker as we get upstairs and start this the better all right so we got enough points there we would have left the zombies but the reason why we're Djinn is because we really wait to go ahead and I get 500 punch two quick revive we don't intend on going down between now and actually starting this the first like you know sacrificial ritual sacrificial sacrificial I say sacrificial ritual here we do not intend on going down if we go down basically fucked it up and so there is no going down there is no room for error this is why I'm saying I've reset this a buncha times because I do not have the time nor the effort for an error right now so bullets will be fired in circumstances but these guys are a one hit kill now what's going on here doing the first ritual with the dudes pen and there are one-hit kill the zombies you don't need to shoot any of them you do have to kill any of them I have to do is hold off the amount of time to get the Gator and what you got to get when you have a very much good to go now we got to try and locate the fumigator sometimes it can be on the spawning bench but in this case it's here if you get a my taint let's fumigate sandvich right now whilst we're waiting for this last zombie to come on roll on in we're looking for some fumigations shit because yeah good from it then it's brilliant sometimes you don't in this case we get the fucking flying bastard face all right we got flying Buster face now this is slow nose down dramatically because this guy can take forever to spawning it can be pie in this shot it could be part way up there no we're going to mess about just to try and kill him and of course I miss every single shot there might even be more than one you die yeah there's more than one of course oh right excellent there we go all right 1,000 points that's good not too bad what that allows us to do is this a sleight of hand this way it's move on over to here on round one that's sorry not on on one round two I've actually done this room within a round one second before it was fucking epic and I actually ended up going down to our type of entry which is really sir otherwise it would have been one of the most efficient like like speedruns I've ever done I want this to be one of the most efficient tutorials you guys to be able to watch what to do and how to do it in which order to do it in I always recommend going for jug boy you know she can just happen and just go wrong basically so whatever all you do it in is whatever your name it came out and now it's all about being as you know white or it as possible as we almost fucking go down jesus titty-fucking Christ I was expecting him to go down in like one hit and he didn't can you tell how I I again went quite a lot but quite another knife there we go he didn't drop anything out of it we now just need now to point over 1,250 points which that kind of Fox is over that Fox's only spikes there but ya know insta-kill can it could be helpful but without to do next pocket no Kajol's 1,200 points bring it on now the box is right above us we ever have the this way we do rescue we can now hit the box which is grateful to hit the box it's all good in the hood we don't necessarily need it looks this round through it can help us being a bit more efficient if we feel like we're going to like risk it a bit too much here the box is good so I'm gonna make the executive decision right now of hitting that base drum box and here's a part sexy Kalin riddles yes what do we get alright you know what for what round we're on this is not actually too bad why it's a lot of ammo so that means a lot of points once we need them headshots morale headshots we get the better obviously we want to do this within the lowest amount of ground to lower the rounds the easy is going to be when we're playing the fucking flying demons bitches alright it's not this motherfuckers death all right there we go 1,300 points lord of emeralds be able to take care of anything that gets in our way also for fighting the Mogwai which are about to do soon as soon as you start your second ritual you basically fight the Mughlai you can come really super annoying all right it's completed let's go if we were just doing this with our pistol we would probably would massively regret it let's crank this don't want anything from me I'm just giving it just to get it done and let's get inside can we pick up our to pay yes we did thank God if I were to forget the worst thing is for getting an item that you cannot like unlocked as soon as you forget it it's just so frustrating alright so see how easy this is to kill these guys how this gun is ridiculously good for this segment but you don't even have to kill anything like I said all you have to do just take the time I outrun the zombies don't let them fucking kill ya and if you don't kill you you're good to go I don't kill these guys you start away from the screen it kills everything in the room just responds them in so you can get the points back afterwards I think think I might say that and there's a second gate room now we're gonna run outside you'll hear the Mogwai for if we run outside watch the mug wise behind us watch this bun we run all the way over to this van we can control where the modulite girls ready purple mist is going to teleport to there and boom just like that the microwave space was open it wasn't lit up because you're still teleporting right in that sequence pop promotion take him down oh yeah these speed efficiency tips I'm giving you guys all right now I'm just gonna shred a little bit cuz and you go there's another one down another head around 3,000 points which is good there's a zombie life but I'm using to kill it just because I don't know how many zombies there actually is left it could it be a hundred bone y'all see all right take him out pick this up reload nice so we're back with 350 points I've got this section of the area complete we could potentially if we want to hit the box again our gets light upon but I'm not going to I'm gonna save our points for now and I had to jog if you want to know where that was sleight of hand screen that means the sleight of hand if we run over there if that's read that music's job but in this case this is gonna be a jerk I'm pretty sure juggen sleight of hand are all like only wants that switch around kind of that makes no sense why I'm just saying I don't actually know no I think all three can be in a different random place at any given time alright so gonna hit this bye-bye I'm gonna hit this spit ball with a whip if you wonder where the fuck years are what the hell I'm doing don't worry so understandable this is a very like Maisie feeling map but once you get used to it you'll get used to it and this is like a full-on speed room right now I am NOT fucking around I'm trying to get through this all as beastmode as possible alright that's step complete but we're going to not try and forget this time which I've done every single time so far is this bar nice we got it these guys are gonna spawn in some homies real easy to kill not even a problem already dead I'm gonna make our way upstairs open the gate once we open this gate over here like so I'm going to crack this we don't even want any drama community since the kill this is Scott that was great that's good we got the badge we can now start with in round three our third ritual and we do there we go good round third ritual fucking beast milk this is really efficient a sofa like this might want to bust sucked on it I I have done a like two rituals within one round but I got the points and it's it's all about what drops should get what going to get from the box if you even hit the box you know that sort of shit so once we get this out the way we should be able to maybe get enough points towards getting jump we're gonna have to go and open up joke anyway so it's whatever all right let's get this gate worm this is almost done just that just that out would you look at that this is done nice did you drop anything don't exert all right gate 1 complete write some more zombies alive probably actually worth killin em soon as that way we know where they are there you go right phones ringing else tears come on we just need a few more hit magazine kills and we all groovy are such a good let's choose your punch right there no peeking yet whilst that's doing that we're going open up the area SRAM and there you go that's joke we got enough a jug run down here and open this up pretend to clean human um you can now head over there and go bye Jim I get a coach III look like I know what I'm doing just because I like within the few hours of this map me now I do I don't forget that this could completely change because I'm playing this before release so a set one single setting move like anything could change and then everything I've talked about like oh this goes here this does this could all just go tits up and go wrong I can't see them changing too much maybe just a few settings of tweak so that I am is not going to be able to pick up and I'm sort of shit Bob feels alright that's that out the way look like this guy's here wait please rounds out the way we can now move on towards the final part that for is pretty damn efficient and along the way yourself but we don't want anything from these it's just about getting them open and zombies actually pretty good for points it's just about getting them open because you can go from green to red to purple in that sequence you get like you know insta kill double points just the things along the way I kind of like really useful service we can't even progress anymore just simple because we don't the points a show on the road all right reason why bots no bogies or gobble gums yeah is just cuz I really don't need them hi blackout I don't need them as always to find the points alright pretty much to kill him we kill if you have 50 minute we're just joking I'm so pretty we are in pretty comfortable position yeah I should kill a guy actually that's tackle my 1800 I think I think we're good I'm gonna kill one more I know there's still some more alive and actually that's cool oh wait alright that's pretty cool I'm not gonna bother wasting you like wait for 20 seconds we've now got enough boast about to crack everything open the cheese George alright no we don't we need mm we need a bit more points maybe up now we're gonna place to open everything sweet alright let's open everything up 1,000 250 we should now be actually able to get this final ritual piece underway this is round fuckin for this is insane alright crack this rock that right smack that bitch alright fly it over here we're gonna go and open the next door by this this is my best rich like this is my best one so far if this fucks up for some reason I will be going because like this is stupidly efficient alright come on if I can do this I can do this well I think I might got that door open if I got that door open then we're fuckin beast mode boys like that was stupid oh my god I did this is what this is by far my most efficient so far thank you realize this belongs to a chance right Kelly's two dudes we good all right let's get on with completing the ritual we ain't waiting around for nothing guys we're getting this shit out of the way now we've got jokes like the funders in this area but what we're going to do is we can completely ritual once you've done that we're gonna get the ritual room open and then that's going to class as a slight almost as part one of the speedrun this part two is getting it applies to get back function honestly this is the the Mable bullshit maybe I should fucking concentrate on here maybe I should concentrate on what the fuck is going on right now like honestly getting the speedrun done is getting the fall like the Portland's opened up I would be okay with this but I want to get I want to get reinfected I want to get a gun pack a punch together say like oh yeah that makes sense for to open now you genuinely can go down in this red mist because you cannot see the zombies walking toward you through it but looking for a fucking POG there we go round that's over fucking sweetness wait for this to spawn in there's a nuke behind us which should get school in two points but I'm really not that bothered check this dude up here company's dick off I think the mod wires can spawn it but we're gonna sprint away from him have another mode to be able to kill him and it might give as a max mo I might've subject doesn't really matter whichever enough points to be able to crack open the upper section so let's do that real quick this is good it can open up towards sleight of hand and actually get in the fuses towards the shield as a fuse can pick that up we want more part for shield and I haven't actually I haven't actually completely getting the shield pass here oh shit the curious leech I I'm actually out of being able to do it so we've got to fucking kill this zombie alright we got we got to get this round done unless if I wanted to which I'm going to focus on which is going by round four to the ritual so let's focus on that round four to ritual I have I've got all the parts complete we should just now need to jump through this and the ritual room should take doesn't then whatever we have to kill a few of these but we can already get the room triggered and opened hey yo doors already open opening all right come on show me face all right we got to take out this motherfucker where is this gun was actually really dumb convenient there you go this room's already open let's sprint in here and get as many of them Oh working let's go say open my eyes open okay I guess this goes here the second face hi we still got to kill these dudes Chasen's alright we good so far right now we can sprint across we lack a boss shit-for-brains run skipped down we coulda got that done with in round 4 well fortunately rounded skip right this rush it's gonna get intense we willing to kill this guy I got you here because you need skill our new Katzenberg alright there we go Riga triggers new hopefully I just end the round which it most likely fucking could activate this ritual starts no don't be fucking down me not this close I just keep fuckin running hi going now now oh my god that points well as punch by round five boys come on one more five nice yes look at that somebody who please alright alright we need to apply it another fuck out these guys now if you're wondering why it's because we want we want enough lights about to pack a punch this pissed well we don't we need to pack punch the pistol we just need to be on spec punch oh fuck you kidding me are you fucking kidding me the Mogul i decides to pump a visit luckily is in his low farm so we can actually go ahead sprint over here and actually you have a gonna pucker says alright where are they there it is bitches nice would you look at that round five fucking punch Stein pistols ladies and gentlemen if you feel like that speedrun deserves a light grit and then please smash that the zombie community is amazing and I know so many people watch this video so if you want to be amazing and helped us get to 115,000 light rains it's a ridiculous number to ask for but I just want to say like if this could do it then that would be an absolutely fucking incredible ball right there is pack a punch in with a hundred and one kills absolutely flying through everything like ridiculous there's the shield that we could work on getting but I couldn't even right now think off the top of my head where the final part is to be able to tell you where to where we could do it but nonetheless we fucking speedrun the shit out of that do it by round five I'm stuck with that I hope you

pickaxe got all the way down to the perfect level you got this so welcome back baby it is me is this being posted to YouTube most likely I'll be in long successions and maybe not daily or anything like that but if you're watching this and it's on YouTube then years on YouTube be for some reason to change your mind don't put it on I don't put it on but you know what it's one of them we might youichi but i'm very oftenly like it will play load of games and then don't do anything on the footage and i'm like why like a play pub gee like fucking crazy I should do like highlight reels and just post them you know I'm trying to do like a real-life video every Saturday so like a fun real life like some I go firm or my sister small about or another youtuber like what I want to do is I want to collaborate with a minute I've been watching a ton of his videos at the moment and like I've always liked Simon just like concept-wise I I know as his favorite is about out of all the sidemen I could probably watch not the FIFA ones even though I have I actually sat there for a few days and watched some of these feet ones I could happily watch so many assignments videos and not get bored I really I really could but I'm really I'm really into his videos just like the way just content and stuff like that so it's like I it was live streaming at streaming on Instagram and he was like dude we should get together sometime and I'm like who to love soon so he's down to do a collaboration and so my so I'd love to do something with him so if we could think it was like I want to be like a fun challenge all the youtuber chances are all like been done before they're all the same typical shit I feel like me and Simon could come up with some fresh new like stuff I'd like that died out joint swaps like a fish that's done thank you every subscriber and worker put a new friendly look at me face no I couldn't do fee for mine it could train me and FIFA but I don't know if I want to you know

football vid all right this this isn't this isn't shots fired oh I'll go rinse it don't all go rinse opposed but bazinga missing don't go run into him now all right telling him that I said this but it isn't I think it's fair to say he's probably not the best at football out of the Seidman but if I was to do assignments a video with the side man I'd be worse than Vicks there and I'd be worse than him so it may be a compliment to him that there's someone worse than him but just as an FYI I don't play football the last time I kicked a real-life football was everyone's like shots fired that listen I've seen the crossbar challenges they do I've seen those videos fucking Harry's a little fucking wizard shoot him off he's fucking rooftops that's all I'm saying he's goddamn wizard I don't know he's capable of doing that some of the shit eaters you know what I'm so proud of him you know why just because that isn't you to be fucking awesome but he made a video with Ronaldo like I'm not even into football in the slightest and that guy went and made a video with Ronaldo what the fuck that must have been the coolest fucking thing in the world how sick is that oh no Nami now no districts no no no no now me I'm not I think the dish tracks are dead and me but good friends like Coolio but I'm just saying it's a compliment that if he's currently the worst football or out the side man if I made a video with him I'd be officially the worst who's ever played with him yeah it's a compliment with an insult yeah take that bet your bitch Ashoke no district please no districts not about that life not about that life everyone asked me why was I gonna get involved in all that Drive I was like I'm good at eight ninety ninety-one thank you very much a dog would still do my

the Jaguar listen just keep your eyes out December January period I had some talk to Jackie Oh we'll see how things go that's I'd say no more than that first one cheek Paul is a youtuber TRADD do his own thing man is hustle in it and he's doing it well but you know sometimes just says the wrong thing does the wrong thing it's so easy to do you know you could just get caught up in this YouTube scene but everyone nowadays wants to make everyone look like the enemy and when someone looks like the enemy and like if someone's got a target on the back everyone wants to meet them just like take everything out of like context and shot like that and just like belittle them to the ground so it does the stupid things but at the same time you know the world just wants to watch him burn when the world was to watch someone burn they will do everything in their power to you Ben I've seen it that like the fucking darkest side of the Internet man and let me tell you it fucking sucks but when you do somewhere for so long and then just see so much negativity it's like holy fucking shit how it could just switch so easily is a scary man like you don't want that trust me whistles thank you very much Scrabble board and cama cama can I can't say that name so sorry thank you very subscribe for two months in Rome I don't you know what's crazy like when I go into the schools and you like talks and stuff like that but I say to the kids I might do you guys watch and you know like they'll say that YouTube is like some side may I you know some of the youtubers and then it's a loving no I like look like look Logan and Jake and I'm like Logan Logan or Jake and even like the young kids are actually like I thought they'd all be like Jake Jake Jake Jake Jake I love him prefers brother Logan so do i if I had to pick if you had to pick like load anger or Jake Paula oh definitely Logan I really like I think you stay cool III don't all right I've been mined in this entire goddamn time to try and find a tunnel this is the this is like really annoying not find a tunnel yet will be on its way 21 all right this will find some items so this means I in armor either an arm remote yeah that's true trust me the worst thing about the anything you say will be taken out of like context anything you could say the most correct thing in the world and like someone could like join you to what this has been like deep on YouTube but you know is weird you can so easily be in the right so for example you remember company shots game is someone wrote white wall in pain on his car on his car that he paid for with his own money someone did that to his car bang out of order and then obviously I wouldn't made a video about if I was him I won't give him the attention that sort of shit but it did you know you could say to cover the cost of them their care and everything but like he defended himself being like you shouldn't fucking do it you're an absolutely no bird for doing any had every right to defend himself for people you know like you know to be able to fucking deal with that shit and everyone was saying well it's your fault for having such a nice car and stuff like that like what like what the hell is that about it's crazy people were saying he was in the wrong for people graffiti in on his car I can't believe it but it's again just the power of the internet being fucking idiots oh yeah yeah cap yeah it's just unreal like it's so stupid well I did what I shot out to YouTube that I absolutely love raka raka I think you're one of the most amazing YouTube channels out there if you've never heard of him I really recommend go and check subscribing to him they make daily vlogs and like just epic fucking editing videos like you know all that like video effects and shit well

police and got them arrested something you know for vandalism because I against someone's actual vandalism well you can damage the pain and all that sort of shit so it's vandalism my joke I don't ma'am you shouldn't fucking damage anyone's property ever period but these guys waiting outside got 50 but like 50 eggs and then when they're in the car rolled up to egg them they egged the car with like 50 fucking eggs it was brilliant and the guy shot himself so much when he tried to run off and get inside the car to escape it didn't manage to fit inside the car and just run off I wish they

not a personal insult to you it's an insult to your standard on Twitch I know it sounds random bought it just for some reason if you're not subscribed on Twitch throughout the entire community you are known as a pleb so when people say stuff light release the plebs don't think someone's personally attacking you like it's just it's a community thing you know and I don't advise you to go running around in the real world like oh hi Europe I'm not don't do that probably get you any friends but you are referred to its which is as a plug so the more you know some kid just goes running up to his

like a bit interesting if it does work out with this company to be able to shell it share the story about all I can I get in and then boom lights shooting I feel a bit bad for causing Tom's number triggering Ziggy's in what a man you did a good you may have done a good thing it's a razor phone better than the iPhone I guess it's like whether or not you like the I messaging I faced a monster flap but for an Android phone it's beautiful mate honestly I'm pretty sure that he is nicked it but the the razor phone is just gorgeous why honestly I've got 78 inch TV because it's a plasma no no I have a 78 inch 4k TV in my bedroom and rather than watching stranger things on that I decided to go ahead and watch it on the razor phone I don't dissemble mine process behind that either but I did and you know it was brilliant I have a 10 year warranty of my eyes sorry Tom I never do you're the fucking terminator case 1997 numbers I think of every subscriber oh boy oh dude it's Bobby's I blew this I'm sorry I miss you so now no shit humble brag what's the price dude I know a brag it's just thinking that people know I've got that but it's like the spec of why I chose to use the razor phone why I chose to use a razor phone over someone like that is just crazy sure thanks Trev okay bud I like making people wife is the best legend so he's nice to be that you know many people smile too many people go through this world man just be negative for just fucking hung up on drama all the time like me and live you'll have arguments to shit about the most petty thing in the world like the most petty thing in the world you know it's just natural it just happens it should be like you know I want to talk about its to talk about it but then the day this is a really pointless argument it's just stupid there's no but there's no reason for us to get upset about what it is or what you know the fact that was 10 minutes late summer I'm sorry I was late you know that sort of thing I get over shit really quick like really quick so people get hung up on things like my mom and my mom my granddad don't speak up people don't know this boy I love people say like oh what do you ever see your mom and your granite in the same room they've not spoke for about six years ever since my grandma died just because she's obviously it was in a bad spot and everything like that and he's a different person now but they just never got along life sadly I don't know like going all negative all the time but it's just one of those they just don't talk it's over that much it's just petty shit you know you should just fucking get over it and make ties like you know be friends with each other and all that sort of stuff but you know life's too short like I say make the most of it and I truly and try and live by that I do want to travel a bit more and stuff like that but it's like I fight like Jeff Lombardo like my good photographer friend he's off like travelling like fucking crazy and I won't be going doing all this travel with him I really do you know I've got the responsibility of having like cats and you know not just cats I've got like Lydia and family and Christmas and I'm a streaming schedule that I'm straight stick to and stuff like that so it kind of makes it a bit difficult because it's like I'm really enjoying life right now when I'm stupidly happy I'm really happy in life I don't really like Lydia's a massive part of why she meant I'm so happy like she makes me so happy like so so happy like you'll see like this is going through some pretty like negative shit at the moment just with a like we're at the doctors and I'm not gonna share it I'm like like Lydia told the story so I'm gonna let her speak for it tomorrow in the blog I will be looking at their people's designs in a minute by the way and you know it's just negative but like I'm positive so I keep it like vibes up sort of things like I like being around positive people like my mum and I know this sounds really mean my mum is actually a very negative person it kind of sucks but me my dad a very positive what he can get hung up about like the most patient like you know involving money off getting to pay someone it's like that you're just petty shit my mum also can do the same but like I'm a positive person I like to around myself with good people and then you know like the positive just carry it carries on you know like even throughout high school like this is where you know I definitely say it had a lot to do with like going from puberty dead late on in life and I know my below it makes no sense but you know at the whole Iban a thing my friends used to like banner and joking around all the time stuff and I my stunts and it was like why the fuck you just want to take the piss out of each other all the time like have you not got anything good to say don't fucking say it you know it like this how it always was looking me wrong you know eventually I was like all right just jokes and I never wasn't like stuck-up student person to not understand that it's just like all the times like God you know give it a goddamn break but anyway no I'm a positive person I like I vibe off positive people and you know I always have done that's why I love surround myself with like good people I really like it I really really like it it's good stuff lunar hits bob square patch why you

with that is that I really wanted to do it before it's like organizing the ops you guys to get together you know and which optic members we're gonna be difficulty up the time to do it it just became a logistical nightmare because at the time it was convenient for them because they were playing Minecraft so I could just jump on when they were playing and that's why that series was so but it wasn't

it's not stealing it kind of bought it but if you guys want to win a dragon law there's a link down the description to be able to enter to win one okay click it out check it out all's gonna be awesome thank you very much csgo what all for sponsoring this let's get into this so we're ghost out the first key with our last case because i feel like the first key to every success to the final answer that you find to complete life and it's gonna give us a rare special item called and again man-of-war I've never had one of them before so I am now arriving genius bought our first case doesn't matter okay do you want to know why it doesn't my guys yeah cause we're like whatever cherish I'm gonna rename it I'm gonna make it my own I'm gonna get my bitch because I now have a foot knife case-hardened no I didn't unbox it flip nights water no I didn't unbox it I actually want these both on csgo alot oh yeah and so I've had to successfully manage to get more knives through gambling my crap skins that I have actually spending money on opening cases it's not a very good it's not very good way for me to feel like gaben should take my money but we're gonna continue and like I said we're renaming this right now this right what are we gonna call this need a suggestion I'm gonna name this to get man of war something the perfect name for the first gun we've just pulled today the neg ever gonna get ever gonna give yep we're just gonna go with it's a pretty long gas name but we're gonna remember this and it would have been nicer if it was factory but would never never gonna give that gun away but you could probably tune in next week to where I will not have that good at moment rigs I probably gambled it away but well you continue on through this and we're gonna get another blue I have to tell you all that I did actually two days ago with Ricky this is Ricky who's currently staying at my house out in LA and we spent about $400 trying to get a nice dad and get a pair you fucking shit oh we didn't get anything apart from a hyper beast which if we have a look in my inventory it's there there you go I managed so let's just pretend we got that now soon as I got this two days ago whoa oh my god Oh oh my god if you guys were to win this I'm giving it away leave a comment down below leave your steam profile name and I'll give the highest get away what are the chances of me getting this this gun right now whoa so impressed with many well anyway we're gonna get into our fourth case fourth case first case let's go with it let's go to flow give us a red because the way this works like okay right just another sea of fucking Blues we've got tmartn kurds coming from the east sort of a bitch but is it factory yo it's minimal we're just like your hair I don't know what I'm saying right so we're gonna we're gonna we're just going to think about this for a second we've got four blues and we've got a souvenir case which is blue so maybe if we are lucky enough to pull nothing but 20 blues because we always do 20 cases in case and keys every episode all right if we pull all blues maybe just maybe we might get a dragon ball by opening up one case it might be the combination of keys and cases that we need now fist me a blue eye maybe if you asked for bad guns eventually you'll get a good gun without asking for it now that's three NER gaps in the space in this amount of time which isn't good so I'm going to go for the third key the third Kate no that was not third key with a third case third key third case lumini a confirmed do a three-way then you probably gonna get pregnant I know what another woman would I don't I don't it whoo yeah everyone's like wait is he actually doing a case opening where he only wants blues yeah I've never had 20 Blues in a row now tell me that's factor like a fuck how is that not that renewed all right we're gonna go on with the sixth case six okay I guess we'll do it over six and one 6 and 1 equals t1 which equals a blue I am I am a genius and a scholar I predict this shit I'm like you know what I want a blue it gives me a blue now I'm gonna predict I'm gonna predict this right now and if I get this right one of you has to buy them your knife all right get to trade you right now go put a trade link in description and you have to send me all your knives I'm gonna do it if this is factory-new you're sending me your knives is this hypno

start putting like spinnings to put the screen to make you guys give you your knives give me your knives but anyway let's keep going don't forget guys if you new around here the way this works is there are we are we get bring the negatives on we've walked them off the highest rated skin that I get for example if I pull up red then really one two for God forgives excuse me that was horrible

ladies and gentlemen welcome your faces to the giant where I haven't actually done just a straight-up standard gameplay recording for you guys to be able to enjoy I've done tons of live streams I've done tons of failed 50-round of pet Thames I've done two videos have been holding off on the cat walk but no today we're doing a game playing where we're gonna try and get more than five for Perks five perks we're gonna get more than four perks we're gonna get the annihilator easter egg gun and hopefully we're gonna get to round four or five 45 in translation that's four or five so if we get around four or five then we're succeeded now I don't know if this is going to be extremely loud for you guys faces I'm hoping it's not gonna be too loud like I said I've got my options audio turn down we're turning we're turning down for nothing but I'm in mining setup I'm in America we're here I'm gonna concentrate there's no livestream this time guys this is pure this is pure concentrate on killing the zombies so if I go quiet and I look like and earthing out it's because I am getting my head in the mother truckin zone so all I know is that if we start the easter-egg and we throw the monkeys to get extra perks and take teleporters we have to try and to be able to get six perks we have to take the teleporters a bunch of times before around 20 otherwise you'll lose out on the chance to be able to get any more perks so the dream set up lots for us is getting the four perks and then getting stamina and maybe Deadshot daiquiri we don't one mule kick we really do not need three bones you my black but it's useful I do not agree and this time I am turning my hatred towards the upgrade turned we're gonna try and go for blast furnace only because if you get turned it doesn't class as you kill in a zombie and just go towards your zombie kills which in the long run means literally thousands and tens of thousands of zombie kills that I potentially missed out on and XP and all that start stuff so we're gonna use blast furnace instead as an upgrade on a weapon and it actually kills the zombies so we're hopefully gonna get a shitload more zombie kills this game we're gonna try and what should we aim for should we imp like should we try it aim for 3000 zombie kills this game if that's if we gets around four or five or 45 you know there's a huge difference in points between and BOTS throughout this game we're going to try and do as well as we're going to try and repair a lot of windows because we're trying to get the challenges complete get as much XP as we can and basically the more more challenges I'm ranked six now written nearly ranked seven the more chance we get complete the fast we're going around caught the better we're all going to be shocked do I want the one to one that is some alas himself and don't forget guys if you watch this light right now and you're new around here that makes you click that like rain subscribe and uh stick around summer I'm really liking the zombies in this game definite like it I'm thinking we've got about January I think like xx sort of time region is when the next DLC is gonna be coming out I say twenty because I think that's just running average that comes out so that's where the new DLC comes out for this map so that's gonna give us one more map but I could really see myself for three months really playing this over and over because there's ranks in zombies and I want to get to the highest rank possible and just kick some zombie ass alright that's my aim that's my plan the mission gets the max on postage I'm maxing out every single weapon with attachments with camos with everything and it's always off and hopefully we're just gonna be smelted that that's our plan of action now that zombies taking forever we've got 1,300 points and I'm very very low on ammo in my pistol now whilst way for these zombies to come through I am going to go ahead and repair more windows goddammit I'm gonna be a carpenter welcome to a new video of zombies where all I'm gonna do is cap and do carpentry alright that's it cap and tree and get headshots my god I'm a god damn I'm beasts I got I got a backup job when I leaves it when when I quit zombies carpentry all right take out this motherfucker and wall wall wall wall we probably could well actually it's a one-shot headshot 22 kills 8 headshots and that's ratio so far I like it I would like to get in okay I was wondering can we go for like a chest shot can we go for a chest shot and then a knife so that we can get more points the headshots are nice but the knife kills give us more button how is he spawning in down there what are you doing alright to two knives hey listen I'm not about going down anytime soon this is not exactly going fast so I'm just gonna speed this off we got a nuke actually forget that last extra 400 points without killing any zombies or wasting any time for us nicely run for boxes over there I think that's in the lower back tree is it in a lower factory I think it is is it I don't know it could be I wasn't I wasn't paying attention as I'm saying alright why we were try and do is work our way to the bowie knife if you get the bowie knife that's 3,000 points in the bank alright so we got to pray for no instant kills in between how did you drill did you like that efficient use of ammo nice I like it I'm in the zone guys I'm in the zone bring it on zombies I need all your I need all your headshots so we need new thousand points to open up the stairs we activate the power so I need about six thousand fighters before can buy the bowling action if we could get that within this round I'm pretty killed by doubt can I get six thousand six thousand points with a zombie kills this round but if I could I'll myself be impressed all right I think we're already like pretty much 100 sent away free round damn it 4,000 points we could go for some headshots praise and then some more knives some Kenneth's having yo won wait what the hell how did he how did he just die in the background alright we've unlocked the KN for a getting xp for it so if you want to be smart we should use the KN amor a lot xp for that which is good again we'll go for some more kit cap and trim all right I'm really hoping that if I repair enough of these windows it's gonna pop up with in achievement say like you fixed X amount of windows here's an extra bonus mark points and then we're gonna get doges we've got the doujins now I wanna try to get headshots on the doges get headshots again just means multiply X is the box all the boxes back there what perks we got over here well there's quick revive see that's a headshot it's cranked our way towards where we need to go I need 1250 to be able to open this door and then go by the bowie knife which if we effectively get headshots on these dogs I think either way we'll be fine hopefully that was my headshot dammit hello nosy I so loud right that I'm being quiet all right and we got the bowing out so this is now 130 points actually close report vines wait did the round end no all right that's Joker we know we're quick revive this we're all good in the hood Doug fetch the rounded end where is he glitched are there yeah look it glitches up there we actually need to run towards him because we want the max ammo I have no idea why that happens gotta stop react lie down on the perks machines you get an extra hundred points oh I think we caused it to respawn I'm going to assume we did get it nice but it already get headshot nice and I think I should get sixty points for repairing these windows if I get sixty points for this for repairing this window we can buy quick garage set nice look at that efficiency at its best so we got an SMG we've got the bowie knife I should have actually no fat dog I don't know I didn't but you know you've got maximum what's the help cables acting like a snake very prepared in this round six we just need as many points as we can get because we need to get the monkeys from the box is it early on as possible if we can get the track on I'll take the drug on because it's a one-shot kill gun at the early rounds it's not max ammo yeah sure I really really should've just left that till the end boom good boy I'm just gonna light three shot them and go for the knife I'm gonna be careful these guys gonna just start flying through eventually hopefully we do not go down with these guys nice alright see they try sneaking behind you well fuckers dammit that's what we didn't want matter like why don't you an insta-kill it's good no it's not I don't want the insta-kill because we got the Bowie now if we want all our points to go towards like just being on the bone over here we go okay that sucks I will actually go and link through the teleport I'm gonna wait for this insta-kill to wear off why because then I can shoot a pistol at them get a few more bonus points are then knifing so it's just all about we're pointing out to itself why I will just being efficient we could do this as fast as we wanted to but we're just being as efficient as we can really alright link this bitch nice there's some shots into him that guy hasn't got any shots in some come so I'm gonna leave it I'm gonna run around keep rogue on 15 seconds left loads of time then air time we should really lie down from that perk machine I didn't think it was all the perk machines you could lie down in front of but I think it actually is cups it's like an extra weight it's an extra 80 points a kill so we shot him eight times shut him eight times nice we catch we probably shoot them a ten times get hundred points out of them but I kept the astral world in between zombies and I'm pretty sure this guy yeah we already cook we already shot him enough times nice so round seven Juggernog quick revive potentially you're by double tap next we don't need double touch so early on so we could go get a sleight of hand and I need to actually go and check what poke machines are fair I didn't quite check was it me or kick no your kit was down there what's this aha double tap yeah we'll get this all I need oh we can repair this there we go I'll go ahead and get double tap oh no I actually wait how slow do I know yeah that's slower I'll see if it actually speeds up knifing I have no reason to believe it does didn't seem like it did I really I really wouldn't know I actually are the answer to that all right we gotta be careful we don't do no crazy knife on just know you might be like why doesn't you like getting that it's just basically the boat it basically renders the Bowie knife useless because I could get I could be getting normal knife kills just with a normal knife now and it would be a one-hit kill the whole pie get the bonuses so I can get a kill and get 300 points again we should be waiting for insta kill to wear off and shooting them but because I got the DoubleTap now I'm trying to place it all right oh that's good this guy climbing through over there he's gonna take his sweet time to his shooting I don't eat guy flew through right last but not least hello listen you're an extra hundred thirty point second yet not last one okay try to get it where was he there Rosie I was there all right that was it oh so that's that right so slide hunt is over over the way let's go get sleight of hand as well just so we've played it safe for playing it safe and then we'll start in the Box actually let's open this let's hit the box once we're playing it risky risk risk way all right this is good this is one hit kill and I want to rank it up all right there we go let's keep it going let's connect this last one sorry the second one tactics I'm also going to do a tactic again of leaving that door closed I kind of leave in that one closed all right this is why I having a pistols Batman - you can kind of like you can do the animation quicker you can do the technique quicker where we get we've got repair we seriously do not need that oh but we want that double points for sure all right we're gonna loot these motherfuckers all around and we'll try and get that because if we can get a knife in spree with double points are the dream buyers the dream this way I might end up going down because I'm getting I'm getting giddy over a goddamn the dream the dream door boys way there I'm going via right let's kill a few thank you little man be careful - some of them might be spun and spun back in nice oh I got the hex coming for the bowtie nice nice oh yeah nice all right let's leave that we'll use that in the next round let's try and get that this will be extra 400 points man this is point glory it's like most efficient and then wait for the extra please not be dogs we don't want oh jeez so now gonna have a double points into the next round as well all right I left that as long as I killing zombies is Owen down thing I did was get the cap and so it slows down the round that's 800 points if we picked it up but I really don't know do it this is good for points all right that bomb is not worth as getting it it's all about the commits spies look 260 points are kill damn we get Oh insta kill again we don't really need that we got the Bowie knife alright that ran out that's all right we could we could get that we'll take it just to say we took it in case you get any tight situations once we go it's live and I'll still it last one hey she said maybe she put some sprays into him let's go I'm gonna say yeah nice 13,000 points at round nine it's pretty good we're point Orrico said we need to use the box as many times as possible as soon as round 10 we can start using this if I actually did want to point more efficiently I won't invite DoubleTap because of that it means basically you're taking less shots to kill zombies and you can just put more bullets into her you can just get more folks so I got hiccups alright let's go and connect this bad boy and then we should be good to pack a punch even though I don't need to pack a punch it was just good to go we cook oh if we actually start the flytrap Easter Egg earlier then we could get the Annihilator earlier on so shit that's what we going that we could do that I could back a bunch that sniper rifle but it wouldn't it wouldn't be overly a fashion efficient and because I pause for a little while we might not get there in time we're pushing this I get all the way around you could say why don't I go out to the side but I've kept the doors locked on purpose seven six five four three ah I just play me all right well we got what we got there we go what we got where we get we get guinea pig no it's a nuke I was at last guy hello hello hello so ha oh okay - no come on over I need to kill you I need to get the new look at that that point whoring at its best all right so we could pack a bunch this but again it's not a pot this smokes outside point Horrigan this is gonna be our gap up screw it why not yeah you know what this will be good because then we can shoot the things from a distance for the easily yeah he's secure okay I'm gonna hit this as well just so I say we've hit it gonna use this for points over yeah I was done swiftly yeah nobody again I I just prestige I don't look at me go say some I didn't really have that many good ones either yeah whatever all right let's activate the Easter Egg by shooting that panel there see it spin if you've never seen it before watch it looks blue so now we got a room round and find some Easter eggs you really should have kind of waited but anyway let's continue right so we're gonna go over here I wonder if we have to get the I was saying wonder if we have to wait now I see it just appeared see that's teddy bear there shoot it nice now I don't know if you have to shoot them with pack-a-punch weapons are just normal weapons but I'll show you where the next one is basically gonna go in here and there's one inside the back we map to jump shot let's try a normal weapon see the teddy bear in there just down there oh now the weapons do didn't know that let's go find the last one last ones inside the furnaces you'll have to find through it then you can go get the Annihilator it's basically it's not a one shot all rounds kill gun but it's still pretty good gun and then what we'll do is we'll take the teleport I don't know why I'm taking tomboy so I can get free poke see the monkey really that's just great tell-tell fuck let's hope some perks to spot him at buggery no perk Faisal really do not need this well okay we'll take it beggars can't be choosers I guess whilst we take out a bunch of these Oh fine I will definitely take that all right you know that was good the end of round either I can't wait to unlock that to be able to put a little scope on it quick fire sale no roof got to it in time we can we won't strip out the pistol and swap out this machine gun we'll take it just because we're out got making my mouth get my points worth of the help how the hell did they get through let's try and keep up them headshots round we're on round 12 round round 12 this is good nice I think we I am pretty sure oh we can go get the the special gun I told forgot we just did all that to go and get it and I forgot but we still needs to be pointing or in so we can hit the box oh you get them keys we want dem monkeys we ranked up yet go watch out they could jump behind me go stepped out the area if you do not leave this area oh shit the round one all right we're at nearly ranking if you step outside this area then the zombies can climb over that but if you don't they won't climb over that you should be safe alright let's go get the Annihilator so we shot them that we didn't we shot that panel we shot the three things you see this gun there hold X we got the Annihilator I'll show you nice right but we need to uh we need to go ahead now it's going to be pretty dumb to do this at this round we want to try at the monkeys so just hit the box see what we can get we've got an LMG it's not exactly the best sport hey it's something I wrecked the shower now I don't know if you can just get more Kooks by teleporting every single time but we'll see we got a hammer great stop Oh double hammer for the win shut this kitchen bowler look so we'll just it will keep running up hi mode here we go well guys chill chill all right we need like one zombie alive which we do have Hey but I've been put that window back nice I will not complain all right let's go up here you wanna see the pistol why cause it got double tap it fires two boys only uses up one though I really don't want that gun I got to take it home all artists oh wait the VPN BMP it's off a wall it's good we can use this bought this is even better we've now got the Drakon oh I didn't all idiot I haven't put my elos scope on it I'm going after so I've got the Drakon which is a one-hit kill oh yeah Manowar shucks really wanna go hit the box again look at this thing it's just a beast do they always just say I'm surely quiet for that window might imagine three of you having dragons take that choice of capitalist regime this has I was pretty dumb decision to go trying to hit the box there I think this is gonna be our last guy right good she laughs does that's good okay teleport again we still really need the monkeys we can pack it but we got this which we don't necessarily needs back punch can we go it's three injured 11 kills right so I've been doing fine front of this extra hundred points nice a cell port through this one voila we could actually hold a proper catwalk for a bit if you want it all right where's the box what's over there fire sale this is good really yeah let's go hit the fire sale hit a box as many times as possible who was it weird noise that was a goblin machines turn on I don't worries gonna come from behind me what'd we get no II don't know last that's disappeared I don't think I can make it I'm gonna try no I made it just in time right all the other boxes are moved we got the Pharaoh which sucks so why is the box like there wait the box is still there I don't know wait what no no it's fat it's inside the factory so now we're gonna use 12,000 points shredding it monkeys yay we got the wunderbar for dg2 we got the pistol still two boys I wish that would be one shot kill every round that's a gun um we could swap it out for this but again this is actually more effective than the regen the regen does Splash Damage which it can hurt us and we really do not want Matt come on come on come on keep on rollin all right oh we got what we got we got monkeys that's a that's an RPG we don't want that I can't believe I didn't put my attachments on the dragon yesterday I press the edge and you can press teach and keep a weapon with all its attachments all its everything so we would have speed mag to dive rapid-fire on this and just like an idiot I didn't put one but I like an e low scope but honestly it's just not it's not a bad of a good on its own without any attachments and man-of-war nope we gotta throw a monkey in here as well make it cry screams screams out loud Rob round 4311 kills nose go Hank open up I really don't want it to die I will take another teleport and see what we can get I really don't know if you have to take all the teleporters what's that all the haymaker Oh tempted to swap the haymaker out for this let me think about that the Wunderwaffe sucks the haymakers awesome the dragon's good yeah I did you swap it I prefer this gun Packer punched I prefer this gun pack a punch then I do the Wunderwaffe the bundle off for me is just too reliable damn it dogs right we're gonna spend all our points just teleport in this realm we probably have to do the monkey things to get but I have teleport before without doing it and got got a got a monkey really should have turn around and kill them it's gonna Serbian just wrecks them I set the box again we'll do it like a routine we'll run hit the box elbow nope Angie that's connote that's an obi-wan Kenobi obi-wan Kenobi ahahaha I know I'm hilarious oh the max ammo alright we're gonna give me we're gonna give it down 16 we gotta be quick I do what I do want more more than four books but we don't necessarily need it let's go see if we can get that Savage that max ammo that's my secondary let's go I would we were going to hit the box book because that max Anne was there we were in a rush now now I think we'll be good I'm just still it's costing me a thousand points to do this every time oh I got I got a thing for teleporting that many times ah my troubles I should totally get this and get 800 points but I could tell they're just shooting zombies and get Sheila more absentee I also need to watch out from jumping over we're totally gonna pack punch this gun I love it this is I think this is my favorite zombie good really spam firing up close swimmers jumped over them that's a note at the note that's nope hope I get one chance this round that's just about all right I'm gonna Shoom this three left and you're one of three about things were now all right we got 9k points we need to bunkies come on monkeys parade parade right ah hey these grenades were a gift for you crawl bitch okay no no he just yellow that and said no I don't know we'll talk but one more time I'm twice more what you mean hey that's exactly what I wanted that's exactly what I made a music all right so what we have to do now is we throw this on here - every teleport makes that weird noise I actually don't know if you have to teleport like so you got a green light there now they're all red you got a green light we could get out for pints book we want to try and keep the rounds going as much as possible let's go do the back one no nuke not today we don't want you all right round 16 three six three kills mmm-hmm we don't want turned I repeat we do not want to turn it as in as a upgrade we want a good one I almost tell for without doing it that way noise so again what we're going to get give me a perk dammit you ready two green lights tah-dah look super bitch another nuke all right I got run all the way round because I've kept the doors closed okay I just do that sometimes keep the door closed what is this going to do is it's going to reveal it basically hit activates the lasers on the big you know the big helmet or the head of the robot that you see the distance it basically fires a laser beam through that there we go I swear if patched acts it used to be difficult to get to all right now last but not least we are going to be out of monkeys but we shouldn't need him in this realm that knowledge is actually really nice that yeah I don't know why I like it

ladies and gentlemen the time for zombie killing is now welcome your face is back - what is this I mean nap during total what the hell is going on here basically I stream this game you're there right and we we were playing around we're having some fun I gave away but free swag I gave away summer I gave away one of these mice right here this call for mice I gave away some silica original t-shirts all that sort of it was awesome but once I was playing I admit something that I don't know what my highest round on this map is of all time I don't kino der toten we all know is round one one 560 and I actually got two but we always say one more five points cooler and then we know unlike other maps water hires runners but on this map natural open the first ever zombie map I don't know what my highest round is now we're playing on black ops this is a paradigm called Unknown Soldier zero for a play on PC and black ops one and I'm gonna try this round to get as high as I can I'm they're going to keep playing and keep playing and keep playing off-camera and try and get to the highest x run account but obviously I'll keep recording and when I get to beat this round then we're gonna see how far and what round we can get to before black ops 3 comes out now it's quite a while before backup 3 comes out and I don't see a better way of giving homage to College in zombies by playing the first ever map and trying to be the highest round of my own my own personal goal so I don't want my personal goal is and for this episode for this first attempt I won't try and say we get to at least round 50 because when I stream you the day I think I got to like maybe 15 to 20 somewhere around there and so I want to be that but then we're going to keep playing and we could try and beat that again so that that's that's the plan of action yes you guys ready for it right so wish me luck leave a like rating if you love college it's on base and we mmm where you going to show you that we are capable of doing certain things as I almost didn't know if that zombie but yeah that's pretty much it so there is not gonna be quite a lot of me looking at the camera I'm gonna be like concentrating my tits off over here for ya this is going to help you like harness my skills for a zombies ball and playing keyboard and mouse and when it comes out on PlayStation 4 first black ops 3 and I'm pretty much going to suck at it so we could actually know what let me think about this if the collector's edition comes with the giant and the first map is currently on the disk already then why don't I could possibly play all the when it all first comes out I could potentially play it all just on PC and then when the DLC comes out after switch to PlayStation I actually just play my playstation today for the first time because the black ops 3 beta came out so I was like right time to show these noobs how it's done and actually did rather well I'm not even kidding I am I be stood people right in the in the post of a fucking so let's get on with this but wait whoa whoa whoa whoa we're here to kill something watch me go down at round 2 rate if I go down at like any round I will be upset because I'll probably retake it be like alright I died around like - let's restart you have to do all the intro again all that scope these headshots but if there's one thing I need to improve on it's definitely my accuracy down oh wow do we hit something on there hello oh yeah there is there is family play on PC is just so beautiful to zombies it just feels just feels clean feels clean and peaceful so the technique we're gonna do is we're gonna yeah I think I think this is the right way doing it but what we do is I'm going to keep that door closed and we're going to make our way up top and across to the box and try and get the red one and the thundergun now don't forget there is this perk machine this beautiful lovely lacking perk machine that we could obtain and get our hands on there's nothing against the rules or saying that and a lot of people might be saying why not playing world at war and playing like the actual original version them up and trust me the game crashes too much it's bugs out so much amor that wallet I'd rather take the risk of playing black a coin instead so hopefully you guys will play with that and why don't you guys you guys do the challenge as well let's see what round we can get like the community what if not leave a comment below tell me what your highest round is that would probably command so yeah let's let's keep going I'd you really be flying through this like speed up killing these bastards but I'm trying to stay in this first room for as long as possible and then my sensitive I don't know why I killed all them without getting double points port I'm just an idiot so let's now waste a bunch of points I completely just wait to get them right aligned just just real light good ex stay back man if you kill me I grab an issue is that it sounds like he's oh it did sound like he was over there earlier sounds like this one is oh there is a come on nice quick double kill don't bite nice headshot change bites swag alright so got 4000 points and I'm still not going to leave this first room not doing it refusing I'm refusing to do it and you're this just getting me excited when I think about World War well while we out the the map development tool as I open a can of coke and in the new black ops they're talking about releasing mod support straightaway which if you ask me I think would be absolutely amazing that means custom zombies oh my god every custom zombies galore so excuse me I need a drink rate and this this totally looks advertised like I'm a super stud I got the canvas a superstar but I'm strapping in for the long run of this game this this could end up being like let's get end up being a 20-minute video we're gonna be in an hour video I'm not too sure to share now I'm not gonna get that I'm fine he says you trying to fire as I can flow the clutch about double points before I don't even know hey pull it up this is just beautiful I want a sniper rifle I could I could get the earth the l8 is it the LA tène I want what folks call a sniper rifle like that's one I'd rather have the PG yes telescope all right let me close to come on oh shit well we would have got 400 points for that bomb then and luckily there is more in points on zombies land coming for you nope nope nope nope yep did it I was last one well shit get in here I need all the pies I cannot do whoa fucking hell II got this well quick my team missing an arm shit run away she wasn't risk it was not risking it right so it's going to get a little bit aggressive now man I miss planes game before people this map before people was just intensely ridiculous that to say the least I will repair a little bit get them repairs on get them pairs on any okay now I've got to decide I got to decide whether or not I bail just yet or I keep going I think I'm gonna keep going what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna like this and I'm gonna buy my books it's like a panic button now they're all they can all spawn in there now which is kind of going to slow things down but it's okay okay just keep it up and be fine good got no sprinters yet let's take out this guy yogi Wow sonna shotguns so beautiful I just made together on the shooter event now we could get that and go for niss should go for the Knicks let's go for it that's all it connects only I will person windows as well just to help ourselves out so I know it's insta-kill but whatever playing it safe man we'll try get to a high round I don't I really don't know what high round clusters as for this guy I know some people have made a slight round 200 I'm pretty sure but they're just jesus' now a hit man for that no score well actually got a headshot then that's pretty sick 7 get it again yo D headshot watch nope what was I hope was I really hoping to get a headshot there I don't know now I do wait how much disguises six thousand four thousand you're right so I could get me or kick that way I can have regen Thunder gonna and something to get any points with an insta-kill so I think I probably got about it but not yet we need to don't get the better guns yet now things are about to start get a little bit crazy so what I'm gonna do is it video hit the box time 100 I'm sure that's about all right box we're gonna give me if you give me a knife thinking this is a csgo box video I'll kill you well what could have been bear just gonna say oh really crawler that is not bad this will give us quite a bit by now I'm gonna hit it to see what we can swap the shopping sniper my case for sure someone who killed three at these work what yeah these daily rounds it's when it go I should be your forehead show so I'm gonna get rid of this and pull out this one I said look at this it's like an insecure headshot I was wait how did you survive wait what why some of the bullets just straight going straight through their nets I can do panic then because I was realizing that Hathi sports were just like it was free color and that much that was missing their heads yeah dammit I wasted a nuke again mmm not good all right keep going that gonna be back with like a red gum please or a shotgun we'll take that understand what you alright we got a shitload of points on his way now I would hit the box again and just keep spamming it but I'm not gonna bother I'm just gonna keep this alright we're on round seven five seven how could you bounce okay okay bring it on bring it on tuck this way you had three again on so cuz where are you wet this gun fires faster I'm trying to sound more like when they when they're running down the stairs so I found tons of reload I wonder how close to the sea these stairs understand to make these zombies not run that way whoa maybe we should stay a little bit further away to give them time to burn around lately fucking windmill themselves round the edge the way I'm down to the bottom of stairs and they run a mile away from it's that we do stay where I expect you to go I mean I'll slow down a bit one country yep I'm all the windows I aim that any hard like the ones who walk around whoa it's at the ng min walk when I think they're all gonna be sprinting they're gonna be sprinting down that bus that they'll go around but I think if I do stand it over here that I might be able to like in first done here they're all gonna run and then I was said about there so I could shoot there and that way I can get those zombies that come through that window they're trying different techniques my what they're doing share this down 40 I should know the best strap walk she's been so long since I played I should try and get moon Ches so moon Ches what'd you get what'd you get what'd you get what'd you have a challenge Gary Gary yeah okay because this has got less Emma I should I should have done that because this is this fight is so much slower reloads is it faster might even be the same amount of time I'm pretty sure it's low Josh to tell me watch it right now because I've got the Raygun I'm actually gonna stand over here instead wish me luck all right kids in your club its glamour in town what the who says it's clobberin suppose the thing with Fantastic Four in it the new Fantastic Four film sucks oh man plus the iron size so yes look at all those chickens had a big attempt to stop on we good a wig Gucci Mane gossip Chuck chasing me stop chasing me I miss a mammal preserve reservation its finest right here I just got to make sure I keep that whip that window forward alright maybe that we don't survive all right let's make up way to layin around jest to tell me what your what you really do every watch you're out with your baby really whack can you hit the vault guarantee they despawn Thomas I'd actually rather so much take that from us then this just just this thing run so slow I like lost 500 500 mo mo okay guys then that just fires faster let's talk about next time if I can take the RPK I'll tell ya I really need to lock myself in it okay then ray from yourself well what oh shit fuck off I'm a grenade keep coming come in and come in come in son oh when he go I swear there's a guy around round then he's my farm I so need aa optos your head fuck fuck up alright you last one I got a feeling you know I don't know I just don't trust in me alright we're gonna swap this family's out for ya I can definitely hear one more mice that was you heads up that's that's fine you totally sounds like there's another one somewhere I knew it I know I wasn't going crazy I knew I heard him pressure there's another one as well Rudy Carlo wait I don't think so I think he's the last one now I knew I told you I heard someone else let's go let's go let's go this is perfect nice you load I think it might be slower reloading but overall I think it's bad it's just it's faster fire rate but I think he does less damage but the faster fire rate means I can get out I'm taking this this is RIT you can span the SH out of this and get out tricky situations add potentially key if I could have a selection of guns you know like with New York it but this obviously won't be a one hit kill forever but I'd like to have this the from the gun and Reagan oh shit yeah I got too cocky I got too cocky boarding up that window and failing the reload I failed the reload that many times on that shotgun and failed up the switch that I just knew his game over I don't even know why I ran towards them I knew they were climbing behind me I saw one go around the post so I won't go around the other side of focus and I was like yeah this is it if I potentially out of full ammo in that shotgun we probably would have been good my god really did that just happen well listen this video is staying at round 10 we got to round 10 and it sucks that we got to run 10 and yes everyone can beat that round for the next round we get to the next time I try this is going to be much much higher so I'm gonna return to do this that like we've set the bar for ourselves for this video series we've hit the bar it's not gonna be a long series it's gonna be like maybe three attempts which set the bar really low it's now time to to beat that really low bar I think someone without any eyes hands and hearing probably could've done better than that so yeah if you guys want to try and submit a video of you just get your highest round don't just upload your first one like I did and try a butch time try and see what the highest round you can get to is and above the video just like say this was a Syndicates nap during totin challenge just to see what your high-score round you can get to is so that's about everything I'm going to let these zombies kill me just because I'm pretty embarrassed about watch nothing there but anyway I love you guys takes me to awesome and until next time I will catch you guys then you sons of bitches oh that one at least I'll be able to beat that 
what's going on guys the city here I welcome your faces to something that's not called you zombies not csgo not see us going baktuns not see us go gambling but in fact me actually playing video games and really really fucking enjoying it guys this is overwatch if you haven't heard about the hype of it if you've not seen like the 300,000 people that I've got damn watching on twitch streaming it but this game is all the hype right now and I had no interest in it whatsoever until today obviously the game just came out I got offered to like go to the headquarters and check out the game early I got offered to like download the game right in Bay Area now for all those sort of things and I never did it just because I was like I probably just won't like the game sort of thing it's like whatever and I'm kind of glad that I didn't even try them earlier on just in case he kind of put me off the game or I wasn't interested in as much but now the full game came out and I'm playing on PC and I am hooked I am absolutely hooked on this game I've probably only played it for about an hour but all I want to do is continue playing and continue playing and continue playing as a reaper with medjool shotguns and just absolutely tear it up so the game put you're watching right now is we just playing a defensive role with shotguns please note that I'm saying defensive because I am defending but I'm also camping but we call it camping with style so I'm kind of doing the objective so you can't get mad but like I I'm hooked on this game and I'm making this video because it's a short clip of me getting like a 15 I think 16 kill streak which I thought was pretty neat I know some guys I've got like 32 kill streak so ever and just like ridiculous like crazy crazy combos and stuff but I'm gonna try and record all my clips to be playing put it together like you know cool what segments some recording pretty much every game and then sharing it with you guys and I kind of want to I want to do more videos in this game I don't I want to get like the grasps and thought of you guys if you want to see me post this then you know drop a like rating if you don't then click that dislike rain that's like what I'm you know using as the do you want to see don't you want to see I know a lot of people like want my NAT they want zombies you want this and one that but the reason why don't make them stop videos is because I'm just like not in the mood to make him I don't have the passion to want to make them if I felt like recording in Minecraft series I'd go ahead and do it if I were to record some zombies I'd go ahead and do it and you can say this is as repave as you know killing zombies it is repetitive as placing blocks in a Minecraft game but it's so good and fun to play right now and yeah it is all noobs and everyone's not as good and you could probably say I'm better than just the average noob who gets in the game and shoots people but I'm really really into this game and I just want to see if you guys like see more content guys I'm gonna be posting it nonetheless I've got that feel of I want to play video games and I want to record video games I don't want to stream video games back and it's with this game so I'll give her like rockin together with the team of youtubers like all using certain like the same classes like all shotgun sets this healer just would not die but anyway I'm I didn't end up wrecking them and like I'm really really hooked on this game and there's a lot I want to do with it and there's a lot of stream and I want to do with it as you guys know I do daily vlogs on my blogging channel syndicate central and I've been trying my best to do daily vlogs in that today was the first day that I missed the first vlog in 9 months I didn't miss it I had it but I just couldn't load it on tankers like the lag from the internet and everything was just slow and I was like getting really upset about it but like I'm absolutely hooked on this and I want to try and find more time throughout the day to stream it I'm gonna be going out to Chicago back over to the optic house in the next few days and hopefully I'll be able to set up out there maybe hexes set up and this is where I actually died 15 kill streak got it got the 16 but if I were to just kill this guy could have kept on going but unfortunately I managed to get rekt but gonna be going back out there I'm gonna make sure the game's downloaded down gonna be streaming it so if you guys are up some overwatch then make sure you've clicked the fall button on Twitch I'll put the link down description and make sure you subscribe to the vlog and shower I'll be talking about when I'm streaming and stuff for hope you guys did enjoy if you did make sure to leave a like brain subscribe if you want more of this gameplay leave the hype in the comments and I will catch you guys in my next video on this channel which will most likely be overwatch so thanks for watching guys I appreciate you understanding and taking the time to know about I just make videos because I want to make videos now and I hope that's cool with you guys because that's the way that that's the way it's gonna go from now on so much loves your faces and adios 
I can to go and we'll just have to continue on with everything I don't even know if the gameplay is gonna look good or like a potato because like I said I have not live-streamed this in donkey's years I've literally not streamed this in forever I'm not streamed on YouTube in so goddamn long and how long's god damn long that's the longest I'm at so I have to say about that which ain't dang I I do need to put out a or Instagram video say I'm streaming so if you guys want to be epic um I brought I broke it good to say and two seconds later I could pollute the broke it I just need to do a little Instagram video saying that I'm streaming whilst I'll let a let it pop out saying you know I'm rockin on a roll and I add to story how do I do a video I'm sorry do like laze and gentleman I'm live streaming right now on youtube if you want to come watch I'm streaming some ecology zombies the new DLC that they drop just go to youtube.com forward slash syndicate and you can check it out that's how I do it that's how I do my thing can we all see whoa I'm seeing a lot of people say hype so I'm hoping that's yes youtube.com / / syndicate all right there it is post on my story on snap which looks crispy brah sounds quiet though yeah I don't know how to make I don't know how to make my voice louder you might be like oh it's easy you just press this button I seriously don't know like you literally have to crank the volume because a little don't fucking know how to make it any louder like III would love to say I do but I've got a mix amp and Settings bought I don't know how to make the output of the audio any louder on say let me try I'm gonna try one thing just for you beautiful thought bollocks this is why I shouldn't trust you to do anything so I've already broke it I broke something that was not needed breaking but are y'all doing thank you very much for tuning in and streaming I appreciate that you guys are single-handedly like bombarding the shit however the chart wait this says you need to change this video resolution to the current resolution 1280 by 720 which is not supported they expect it like what you need to change the video resolution the current resolution is 1280 by 720 the expected resolution is 1920 by 1080 hmm do I need to I need to step it up guys Orion Jordan trying to give me a tweet Iranian let me know what it says hopefully we can get everything going yeah I will be obviously starting up in a second guys I'm just waiting for everyone to jump in the stream and then we're gonna be playing I don't know which to play first I really don't know which about to play first because I don't know what I can't play back while streaming because as we all know my name and that's a potato whoo I know that's literally like the story of my life my internet is a potato it's just it kind of does what it wants to do it's what I was good trying to do is this is this is my output was this oh wait maybe this is change it ah okay I'm hoping that might change my my Sainz oh no problem we say arise says yeah it's only said when you change the res and you'd be good all right I can actually reset it now guys it won't take me long to try and make it so is it's even more bought it could be a minute the hell the sponsor mean Oh camera rig you became a sponsor of Patrick already and became sponsor I don't get how YouTube works to be quite frank I just leave it to it alright I think I might be able to change a setting to make it go into 72 into 1080 which would look really good for your guys faces so if you guys would be awesome whilst waiting people to come in don't worry the stream will stay here if you want to refresh it you just pop up but all I have to do it's click the share button tweet out I'd really appreciate it in a shower some people who reach every tween so you like back I'm probably gonna break it even more but that's just the way it is ah I don't know it said it can handle when I stream in 1080p so fuck it I believe it I trust it I want to believe it but you know what again it's one of them if when you haven't streamed in so long it could just it just breaks it just completely fucking breaks yes I will sign quiet for out but you just have to Diddy with it I also need to know which map to play first I know I've got quite a selection wait if I do solo game oh my god which one do I play I saw a Jew kedo i feel i feel like i should do keynote Josh ku thank you very much should be in a sponsor again I don't really know what that means and then a TC 10-bit I don't know how the I don't want a sponsor means but I think is it like subscribing on Twitch or something I'm assuming maybe I'm assuming baby what up Thomas Duffy alright like okay did it is it is it is it is it lagging is it drop your friends as far as I'm seeing I'm not dropping any frames but I've got I've got my behind the scenes might arise to announce insert through sound man shit yeah I can't do anything to boost it in Salman Oh Jeff I don't know okay okay okay okay hip but for that recording properties levels everything's matte everything's maxed out I need to like watch this on my phone and we're still waiting for people to jump in guys so it's like don't stress your tits too much and we're trying I'm sure I love the one thing about YouTube and any chatted streaming in general is when something's lagging oh boy does everyone let you know that it's lagging it's like the one unuseful way to let people know that it's broken like a black egg holy fuck it's lagging panic mode alright right once I'm just going to start up a fuck it we'll just that nacked just to see what it looks like even though I'm not sure ending tonight Roget broke it mmm I will say someone says yay fixed oh wait I'm not even got my fucking thing open I'm not even though but I've not got the screen open all right Oh Ryan can you let me know if this is now in just seven twenty sixty and they're got the shits taking forever to load

I think my PlayStation rushed okay Wow best DLC pack ever I actually you know I actually never played that Shang Lin shuffle or was it space land raven the de in the dead woods or something i didn't even play that simple because yeah it's crashed sick mate most lip game ever fuck alone as fuck sit down all right wow this that was the most impressive large stream Tom's ever done in his life I don't trust me this always happens when I show him on like any platform whether it's Twitter its YouTube Oh Ryan says everything looks good man that sounds good everything looked good apart from them I'm oh my god guys imagine if I started streaming what is that oh I imagine if for some reason my DLC was like corrupted so I couldn't actually stream I got just went to see tomorrow's vlog dragon her I was so fucking upset when I came home I was fucking upset alright let's try this one again alright we do it should we play in order that the maps came out so that it be like she a fucking chino bean act you know that sort of thing is that the way we should do it I reckon yeah I know I'm quiet just turn it up trust me the only way you're gonna get anything any fucking audio out of me I've got this like super fancy microphone I just don't know how to fucking turn it up just I'm just saying I'm just being honest with you guys right solo so yeah let's stop this is the order it all come out in right yan act ver upped shi no numa kyoto and ascension nah yet shangri-la moon origins alright we'll give it we'll give them all of run-through is that a good idea let's just do it in a let's do it in single run throughs like that mmm fingers crossed it works I've got no loading image when it starts up ah there we go oh did it recreate this did they remaster this intro I can't seem doing that but alright guys if you are in here like I said I really appreciate if you share if you knew anyone back in the day you used to watch my zombie videos share it out with them this way all began I'm gonna be rusty as tits by the way I've not streamed or played zombies in forever so sorry about that I don't think I'm gonna play in a black ops 3 maps or anything large I don't care and apparently start see I don't really fully know the answer to everything but apparently you start with the old gone wait first couple run put per round is free this is bloody hell for a start what sensitivity I play the fuck is this seven I'm a I got too low that play I play cod remastered on are super low sensitivity oh my god I'm not being an idiot here but can you change your fov in zombies on console I don't think you can but I'm used to it being like super white I let's just stick into it wow wow just look at it alright this the wood thing for me alright when playing zombie is this really quiet if it's quiet then you all need to you know absolutely crank your volume up cuz it's like I said I've my volume is really low all right you just you'll just have to you'll just have to understand this and play with it okay I'm expecting these mamama moderators Marat Marat Dorados potato adders there we go all right so this is it but the thing right what I was saying is for me the remastered DLCs have always looked remastered in a sense because I've always played like a lot on PC so you know I know like the lighting effects and shit give different like the lighting effects and shit can flip Recor it just it just feels like I've already played it in my room and I'm looking forward to like playing it obviously Keaney what it made it look like an ascension sorry in a what's it called alright revelation may why am I even taking about ham on this map up light I won't get any curbs I like but what I do can feel confused by is why did he ever put Mule Kick on it like if this is the og of remastered maps why mule-kick it's good on sound yeah I know the bike slope or if trust me you'll save your breath if like literally someone has to type wait low-30s D okay you have to type several letters to type in low sound or muck what the fuck wait what's this tank always hit every in the old game I'm not trying to sound like an idiot there but I'm pretty sure it wasn't right I got brought

there's not a flamethrower or knocked you're not mean that just doesn't seem right at all wait wait let me tell you a story all right refurbed all right I hear 10 new subscribers on this gaming channel right a year ago like in July or June especially the hot shit off gun I get the shot I hit 10 million subscribers then right and everything was fine until YouTube decided to delete inactive subscribers like you know just accounts that never watched it are there with spam bots or whatever but I hit 10 million like two days later they decided right we're going to delete the unactive channels make sense if they're not actually viewers watching the content then what's the point in accounting system it makes complete sense so they did it and they took me from ten million subscribers to nine million like 800 or something diddly heed 150 numbers they do we eat 115 thousand subscribers from my channel so I went back under ten million and then like I could upload and gain subscribers and gain subscribers and gain subscribers but then that whole thing goes Auto every time I upload early subscribers happen and I was just like I don't fucking care anymore like so that's why I was just enjoying my vlogging cuz I was growing my vlogging channel there well there again subscribers but on this side of things fuck when I stream on this game channel so when I upload so it's just like

coholic I can be able to do it in too long maybe one know if a 24 hour stream is enough you're not saying I probably do some tests test runs to see you out more the best best way to go about doing

member if it's on a time I forgot about buys so you can double pack-a-punch billion if you would rewind ways to manage and if I'm if it's right inside it only costs 2500 to buy more ammo in the rounds when they're all running together this should be let's fuck oh wait I will cost 4000 for goods but right I am nothing but you look handsome nothing she's squishy little ballistic from two seconds away look still cooling down oh is that the new effective it cooling down okay not this song so one of the rainbow is by someone else alright I don't think they'll do that appreciate you doing Sam who shakes brother mad and using the Drakon as well in the early rounds blast furnace yeah adds a possibility this power because what I do is you know it'd be the best gobblegum for me to have double points maybe I belong actually actually know if I just save up the early rounds that would be sir and the reason why I'm saying is because I'm spending so many funds are there you go the article that shit'll need I just need to work out how you look at this gun because when I'm doing my one more fiber one I use this gun all the time the Theresa one it's still like a one-shot kill or whatever online the high round as far as well make sure don't get cocky if this and if that special guns in here as well that's another way to build man it's gonna be big right it's gonna be a slow grind Matt it I think I became a zombie when I was doing a woman five room a literally just happen on this new we would literally just have to play Spotify music inside town that might be at which job and then just live shooting the last light round on YouTube and again treat for overstream creepy fucking said who's the weasel yeah I'd love you to be like okay don't worry we're gonna send you were I don't

sofa Luigi's someone said favorite cute youtuber live-streaming mommy said not to hurt at all anymore it's great if it's not just that one most beautiful thing is it mark 3 in all the kernel collapse

dead why cancer more shock damage with the quickest recharge rate my cell it's got the film on a particular posture Daniel Lewis you are right I just need about nice calm oh fuck you pack punch of a gum forgot how's it Bo's tobacco inch bug on there and just completely fucking forgot all right there got it oh what the fuck yo they never used to spawn that quick give me one sec guys I've also I do

back they're usually like in a safer spot not stood there ready to fucking here yeah I've got to put I was gonna I need to put Steve away anyway so this worked out really good sorry it's past bedtime let me let me put this in the vlog I'm going to show you where Steve is if you watch tomorrow's vlog I'm here streaming some zombies I just went down on keynote at OU and we're at 110 million 2000 subscribers and like where the hell is Steve where is he gone looking he's hid under a plum in the corner of a room and you're still awake it's past your bedtimes with mom I'm gonna take to bed come

in bed then guys so it was convenient that I just gave me an excuse to lie actually go out do all right I feel a lot better if system actually had a rap you don't know his filthy fingers Implanon it will community da is dead way like the best way to go what's better dead wire blast furnace I can't be sure but I seems like I've become imbued rot your mind skirt god I wish I got one here then is this fucking pipe always here oh it's not pipe it's the dollar dollar bills are all right like nectar and toe it already played me play dearly today alright I'm a bucket truck die they change any of these real soil are they all the same maybe it's rude let's initiate it so how long does that bear stay on fire for not moving the box is it like first is it for like set Mart rounds of smut second in trend it GG are you worried well I'm check so what's the second trending this a lot not on my page mate I don't see any trending not really tried you lad look so zipper bus blast furnace and it's that it's that discussion with remote to see because blast furnace I think I think we stain like dead wire revive resets quicker I'd love to do this back with garlic alcoholic whoo man you had coupledom you know I know I had the bad guys I don't know what the bad gobblegum doesn't entail in toll I don't know it's full details on getting so close these apps but that that a few bullets that killed three people I'll show you like what I used to do Gavin for my tablet I just run them into here and I just spray lighted and now with croucher I'm crouched should on crouch and just check that window that's what I do i but now that I'm actually gonna kill them with dead wire whilst doing it it's not like you get looked you get so many I've got double punch yeah sure but I get so many fucking points crazy I get high round if I possible find one on gobble them and the fact that you come oh shit nice feel I love this good I'm actually so happy to put this on the wall here it could have been anything it would have been terrible this now you said I shall throw my claymores in that corner over there oh hey look an old guy Leon me off I accidentally once reloaded in this back corner and open the door if I if you over that know just for two of them you're done for you're just fuckin done for I appreciate what guys are nearly on 10 million 3000 subscribers that's mad three lowball fools oh wait one sec guys coral hit me Cora coral Caltex me dala dala beers yeah that nearly went wrong I don't know if I've got all the attachments on for this one either like obviously I need to put them on but I don't think I've got them already so on this is app this is legit all I want to do just stand here and fire and now that I get comedy it show that in bear I've been pleased you now I can spy on home or if this away is there as something to in my opinion you should be unfriending but or dude if YouTube banged it on training imagine how many viewers we would watch her in 10 million if you have is live I wasn't mad some of them know isn't here and I might be just completely wrong ah there you go was completely but no zombies we coming through that window was hauling for ages don't look it was good by the way I was stood on where else to do we still think it's blast furnace with blast furnace kill more but this was more of a this is quicker I do that I'd rather do the quicker then pick up I'd rather pick up one at a time then a full round at once that's what I'd rather do she looks at inevitable points dead and I didn't even use my full magazine and I've already got enough to buy more that's the continuous you want to be able to you want to be able to uh oh you're on live training all right no no I know I did want to use that I actually like the either all right so let's package the Drakon did I put you empty also gonna give me take so long okay dead wire oh I do I've doubled up either oh shit the shout hey and turned and really helped as well oh he says the more killing is on me yeah I probably need to take to see look you spawn any year old Wagga dairy shit keep that dog work wait is there ever a reason I don't think there's actually a reason for you to ever go down there guys because if you go downstairs down there if you keep that door closed there's only double tap there but if you've got palcohol it you never need to open that door there's no reason for you to ever open it so when you're actually holding out you can literally just keep me building this you start rap and then never have to worry about dog from outside you just have to defend this window and then out there but what a fucking noise it makes that's horrible voice I really don't like big salmon and not too sure when it's turned off Europe I think you'd run through here turn this halogen chilli from it I was using all the help hello traps when I was doing one possible answer I got so bored just running the stage so bored see I've got turnin finish it linked pad Oh 10 milli 3000 guys blast furnace is good for closed pores yeah can I have some fax me that strong yeah you're right he's gonna do absolutely why are you trivial 2003 at 10 o stuff so here now like I hit templates drivers a while back and the reason why I stream on YouTube is because I want my youtube video like eg wife's to definitive video strip because I'm on Twitter I trio Ustream and then like you streaming nowadays whereas on youtube I stream into the [Applause] okay hey you guys want to see an easter egg watch it right use the crane gun again no right everyone watch you see that little torii up there is a radio up there this was my Mac this is why I love zombies you know cuz like the more you spread all fucking crazy shit it's just cuz it was pure down-to-earth good fucking fun look it oh sweet it's got that little emblem on the bottom alright let's see how many pride I got 3,400 points now let's see how many points are for magazine can give me a dead shot dead shot here be so sick Deadshot be so fucking sick here because it's like you can see I'm aiming for like I'm tapping into em that like their heads their legs and ship zone but if you're aiming at the heads receiving so much ammo which means you're getting lipo so you don't just you don't wait there like I did you just Ally them all together this is not all of them but what you think you've got all of them then you come here and then just do that spray their heads all the electricity kills work as soon as possible there's the bottle crawls the guys you can fuck you up so if you've got widows wine as well that is a combination if you've got widows wine fuck you no script I've ever and I haven't picked up a double post which is good because I don't you hello so what was it for 3,800 or four thousand hundred please put your with live stream music on and I'll have to build like a new playlist I can play for stuff on YouTube so unite the copyright it's just one you just crazy alright let's run this guy over here cuz it's gonna kill him I know this is turn but I don't actually want it to be turned I'm pretty sure this is gonna kill this guy though so make it I want to try and change this lied to Tom you finally the team cut alive you don't drop any frames me might just be your internet that's this blast furnace weapons at mob of the dead reference because of ease I'm gonna get to round 1 1 5 again now I've already died on this room it's a dog's I think so but oh wait this come of the C's about me that is fucking awful that slowness that you get is well but I squared it if it isn't like that I think they would patch it I think if the community was like enough like army this is fucking shit get fix it I think I said boom boom boom alright I look really tired not she but happy well I don't have the greatest night's sleep about my own I'm not like gonna fall sir let's go alright so let's see the way I do this now is now that I've run out of ammo I'm not I wouldn't actually use this gun because this would be my Thunder gun even even though if I had me okay I just buy more reload and then and it's a reason why I crouched by the way is I have to kill I have to kill the crawlers difficult get too close to me that's driving away in a tight situation I'm just fucked mate and right what I show you in the next round is the most efficient way to this for this you just pick him up individually which isn't the best way at all like no way like us at every bullet has got the opportunity to go through four zombies so every ball that goes through zombie light should be get in relying on 40 points for a hitmarker rather then see I'm shooting that guy I'm getting jump up just 10 points minutes so I'm on 11550 alright ball 11550 I'm I would if I could get through this wrong with this which I'm a doubt and fix your favorites using this little sick person yeah don't like fury I should play infinite warfare things that I never said in this this is at this dream fuck that Kim no thanks am i right man I'd rather not I would actually be proud of myself for going all the way through that Warfare's lifetime and other dill seeds without playing it if they just managed to do something to make that really fun game and sure I'd have to try and got I'm actually got nothing against it it's just not hey what's up superior game superior gaming League yeah it's just not my thing right click no surge that that won't work mate my sentence won't buy that sorry I know what you're saying but now right so see I've got quite a few of them but not enough watch but it even works here in the middle of stage I didn't even need that many bullets to fire interested but I just got so many prizes just free spray now sir join up brother thanks ma'am someone said watching on Xbox so you just used to do timac and if you've got like someone said he's getting his 10 milli plaque that would be nice weird that's that's kind of interesting they kept that little weird vulgar pledge there get struck by the edge of it come and eat up how many fucking poems about 50,000 now so say like I'm really long ever I'd go alright bye somewhere I'm Oh reload see how that Crowell estate hit that's the shot I'll watch out for because that's where I'll die cuz that Corolla but there I'd be running around with my own I would immediately switch as soon as I got here I've switched my phone again there's no way you could do thick let me just wait a minute I'm just trying to think about something if you had it if you had it so you didn't open the power but the gobble gums are there and you bought that this gun off the wall right you bought this gun off the wall you pack a punch it and then you do it so it does the alchemist thing so it read packs a punch the gun in your hand and you and you keep doing it until you get dead wire or blast furnace then you could technically keep the curtains down and if the curtain stay down then the crawlers and then like alcoholics you've got you know you've got jobs you got all the perks you got sleight of hand so nothing's gonna come from this way nothing's gonna crawl down from the ceiling nothing's gonna crawl from in front of you so they only play zombies you're gonna come from I here not this not this angle if you stood here maybe just there illogically could hold off on the very back I wonder this is like zombies on steroids rip Tom's bomb tomorrow no uh actually I don't know how is it that's my pop I've been uh please there you should always when you play this map always have the link initiated always met level you don't like you should have it ready to teleport as you'll get the fuck out of it like routine what ended early rounds I wouldn't be doing this by the way if I was doing like an actual stream where I'm trying to get my 105 run I'd probably use this gun or pack a punched off until right round probably reason for that is I could just get I could get shot I could be like one drink a boys pack a punch it and then be ready to rock a bowl with everything else I'll be ready to rock a brawl and then that's I've just got fat fog of ammo for hitting that and then spin the box way around again that's under gun back life with the gobbled up with a gobble gum machine you could just keepin it together you get the bar shopping like the refinish it up but then I wonder if it means pay to win tonight well will you play to a lot problems as well they'll Canyon yeah my points are just going up though I really really want to end this like a catheter colic and then start a high round up for the sex at the same time I

Scott that'd be nice I reckon news courses they would have I'm gonna do a woman fight five runs soon yeah time you're so close to 10 million will you see that number below me it says we tell you for here on this website we never know hey how does it feel to play this map map remastered it feels that good to the point where I'm just gonna probably seen a little shell I'm not sure the max what I'm supposed to be able to Paris on like Saturday so it's looking to be a bit of time but you know now I'm not gonna try to get to one one five today guys because if I start that then that fuck you know if I start that that means that things like it could be three days I don't know actually the speed I reckon lot less actually three along with a realistic think with all the new add-ons but even dead wire how long maybe three day nah three dead two days two days Julie 3G three days yeah I know what Mike's quiet guys and we're trying to terrorize customer service me asking for a little bit of a

only other time you need to move up there you only ever time you need to open it back here for getting the wrong is if you've got a little time ago but I just don't think you need to do that anymore like the reason why you used to spin the box to get the Thunder is because you needed an ammo because you couldn't kill the zombies but now you've got this to be able to kill the zombies and drop still drop is this when the when the dead weight kills them we've got the chance of getting dropped each round yeah it might be slow to without is much slower but at the same time it's still quicker

look at this I'm pretty sure oh okay that I don't want but I'm pretty sure this is gone is oh is it a weakened you've got hitches of my little the marriage Juana's yeah this is a gun based on the matter ones yes look a push to push push hydroponic is absolutely blazing yeah we got some sweet stuff right there but go continue this traffic light sequence because we're going to get ourselves a knife or a hyper thief I'll take some Reds I've got a red in a long time have a van I've recently my open go back to when I actually got my fade away kids will be back buddy we've done a pretty good role with sort of look of getting hold of knives fruit cases or basically gambling on csgo law but just gonna have to see how it all pans out and continue our sequence of green yellow red that's how the traffic light works I have a driver's license that that is mathematically true and so far not too good three Blues in a row I did actually stream at CES like I've seen and I got I think it was 7 blues in a row so I would like to just get a break this curse by throwing in a random be sport case to the equation I don't want to wasn't in just esports cases one might do that next every I would have taken the stattrak violate they kind of look pretty okay didn't look fat your new but how would it take it and that oh my gosh I actually really like that I don't know why it's not blue it's not cool it's not getting to get really to it but I do like it and we're gonna start Michael it's gonna go red yellow green and we're gonna pray and hope I don't gonna start something new this year I'm gonna start something new after I take that yes I will M for evil day dire you Molly dummy Oh what is it what is it what is it what is the quality feel tested now as you guys usually know what I do is I take the highest rated gun and give it to you guys now I want to try and do that but it's a little bit complicated to go around like adding people it takes seven days the trade limit to look before I can send it to you guys on ten whatever is but what I want to do instead is giveaway and now all right I want to make this a thing where each one of these episodes every single week on a Friday the videos up by then I give away I can if to your guys faces because look we started together and we will end together I have enough knives here to be able to give one away okay I don't have 52 knives so I can maybe do that but I have enough knives here to be able to give to all your guys faces submit potentially maybe okay it's like five hundred thousand people who watch these videos bought we could give away naps so today in this video if you want to take part be able to win this guy's I got to do make sure you subscribe make sure leave a like crane and drop your steam profile name down in the

back cuz gaben wherever they are whatever I'm doing something good here alright so do whatever wanted you know just slide me on like 25 knives and won't that be great so let's continue to do this I'd think knives no this is not knives I I actually if we have ever look at my nads I do actually have a crazy amount of knives so it's like um what haven't I got which knife do I not yeah I have the book books I have a crumb bit I've split knife I have an air m9 bayonet I have a bayonet trying to work out if there's actually any knives I don't there might be styles of skins like causes Matt but I'm pretty sure I may have all could be very wrong in that equation no but let's just continue on opening these cases and just hoping for the best by the way if I seem a bit ruffle up the boy stings a little bit for us okay I really don't want that water about if it has a little bit rest because I just got back from Vegas always shags on the secret tunnel backstage in the razor booth but guess what I found on the other side of it oh my oh my was that one hell of an adventure being out there but we got to pray and hope praying her why don't even break the brain never works together why don't we

to like well ladies and gentlemen I guess that's just how this year is gonna start let's make a tally from now right this second the cost that we're gonna spend was put 2015 behind us this is 2016 start the tally we're up to 20 cases is that more than 20 I can do mother I know that's 20 cases that we just spend just base it on the price of the keys and that is a total of how much each we're doing this of British pounds on US dollars let's have a look that is one pound 65 @k so start the count we will restate when we get a knife but until next time guys that absolutely sucks we didn't win

so see the throw in the last bet that was $50 we're gonna step it up this is how I'm actually gonna do it so it's gonna go like a $50 bet if we win we do $100 bet if we win we doing $200 bet that sort of thing oh I got text I said terrorists are coward terrorists and she said oh shit oh shit oh shit counter so there we go we're going counter terrorists with $100 bet oh my goodness King Kong he's throwing in an acre of spell fataroo I don't think I've ever had one of them one like myself in a game like this so we got eight seconds to spin this am I gonna secure I'm not feeling too good about this better have to say I just not oh yes that's what I'm talking about we're stepping it up now to a 200 dollar bet because we've won that one oh that's what I'm talking about two nil in the scoring so far oh yeah that's what I'm talking about faction ooh Icarus fell we'll take it we'll take it and we'll move on to our next bet do this let's go back in with the same weapon we've done and that's going to be $200 I'm feeling it do I wait for it or do I just do it you want me to I'm gonna flip this map this this drinks map if we if this doesn't work and get the win I'm I'm always relying on Mystic Meg so we're gonna do is we're gonna flip this upside down this is count with terrorists this is terrorists okay right flip it and then we go boom actually can remember what I just said I think that's I think I just said that was color terrorists that's how quickly I just forgot why I said so we're going Cal a terrorist can we make this happen oh man I want to just go on a streak of winning and winning and winning for it's a 50/50 chance whether or not we're gonna take the W or take me else so believe in me boys believe in me oh we're currently the highest bet on the site yo we got to fight renew acree spells can we add that's collection make it three come on come on oh wait we did holy shit Ludacris failed oh my god were thrown into a $400 bet oh my gosh that's the way uh-huh uh-huh I like it uh-huh uh-huh look at that two new fat renu-it crystals in my account perfect it is time to step things up another notch we're going in oh my god how do I go off across Fell's do I go for it Chris fells for a $400 bag and should we do it now she hasn't text me back that's the same what we should do are not so count the terrorists terrorists I'm basically coin flipping a coin flip so are you ready in three two one foot in bar before and it landed landed on terrorists so this is gonna be a $400 that a lot lies this is a lot of a line this is everything we've got that up is that right is that like insane so this is all our profits so far on the line and we're about to lose for factual you ikura spell why am i saying negative things we're gonna win for fact renew Achra spells if someone has an extra for the bet against me that would be impressive Oh what the hell are these someone's thrown in stickers called howling Dawn's and they're worth $200 each I don't like stickers so does that mean I'm not gonna get them because I don't like them oh I don't know come on fixmestick KGB oh shit damn it it was too busy waiting for my McDonald's and winning stickers and after-sales right now that might be $400 lost but I just really do not like that sticker at all even though it does what kind of beast mode I just don't use stickers on guns I'll use them at all so I'm okay for losing that and when we come back know what I might do at $500 anyway cuz right now we've not lost anything we're not opening it in we're still breaking even I'm just gonna help it I could not help it because we lost that game I was like no we're going back in with a Redemption I'm feeling $400 is our lucky number and we've got our stattrak off we got a start right USPS yes s Kill Confirmed and we've got our Icarus Pell not actually because we don't trust that motherfucker's anymore a stattrak ak-47 so it's a $400 bottle alive and let's see who is gonna step up to the plate as I grab my barbecue sauce my chicken nugger and wait oh shit the guy who put up the two thousand dollar bet is going against me right now oh my god please let me get that huntsman fade factory-new please gaben I mean just a lot of guts please pick up makeup McGavin surprise motherfucker testicles now because we're actually $400 down I'm using the revive toaster to the side so this is going to be current

provide sponsored by quick revive triac I was just here waiting for a better just looking at my phone and all of a sudden a wild motherfucking tmartn is appearing to try and take my skins how very gay

times all right two knives versus three now I've got the money on I chronic Oh hold it there we go no jaw that means if we would have gone in on that there we would have fucking won testicles either way guys I'm feeling ridiculous I said a way to double up a double up a double up all the way to 800 then go back to the staff but for the Yolo sense of yoloing we're gonna double up with a $2,000 bear we start with this a reward but then we lost so we need a quick revive so we use revive and then we were good then we did that we went in for the double tap and we're great and now do we even go in with a sleight of hand I think we should go on to Saipan a sleight of hand to make the magic shit happen all over again so count litera root Cara terrorist terrorist it's give it a flip put all right just prove open counter-terror so all right let's make this happen let's make this half of what we're doing this is this is the biggest bet I've ever done a bakery wait is it I'm actually not too sure if this is the biggest bet it might just be the biggest bet I've ever done on CS the low holy shit oh man we put in the two thousand dollar bet we should have just got against this guy for 1,500 look at the knives he had oh my god that was a beautiful collection we should have just got in against that but either way we have got a $2,000 bet about to sneak its way in and I'm going to tweet your tea mine and call him out and see if he wants to try and sneak in and try and win his skins back boy no I'm okay with winning either way so let's tweet him all right okay I've just gotta do this $2,000 once it's done I've got like at $2,000 going on right now I've been calling I've been talking about you this entire video and I've been calling you Mystic Meg so no one knows who you are I've been like I called you my Mystic Meg like fortune teller oh we have a challenger and it's the guy who we lost to before I think this is the guy we lost even for adults all right hundred dollars to it but no way he's back again how much does this guy bet so this guy is about to throw down in Chinatown against us and hopefully oh my god he threw in he's the rim with a two really nice knives this could potentially be our final bout of the night can we make this happen make magic happen Mystic Meg said Counter Terrorist pretty simple I don't know what happened oh my god holy shit oh my god I once I fuckin one particular to the skins well what a night it's been I went against T Martin I lost big and I won absolutely gigantic Lee 36 new items and I'm gonna say this right now before you motherfucker start calling me out it does say that I don't have a rank because I just forgot to play the game in a while I'm lost my Bronco right I was actually good ranked I was happy with it but I've got 36 new items so let's take a look at what I've got we've got a stat track hyper piece that is pretty nice I'm going through the listing the Joker great is that oh that's the one we're renaming to T Minds because I fucking love that we got a flip knife you got stand break DeMarcus Damascus we got another huntsman that is absolutely beautiful as well we've got huntsman fade beautiful another crumpet Damascus steel link is it minimal wear let's take a look at it holy shit minimal wear minimal wear but they're worth like 800 dollars each look at this buff I we managed to manage to secure that is looking fucking sexy as anything I'm going to keep that as well and we got two of these up tmartn I am ok with this so let's go from quality acquired and see what we've got holy crap they're only these factory nude I don't think so I'll field test oh well one but neither way my inventory now is looking pretty damn right I got a full page of Reds how come founders the Reds girl goes on to the next page as well so either way that is fucking awesome I'd say thank you very much for csgo wanted for sponsoring this video if you guys want to apply the site play responsibly don't like set yourself a limit don't fucking gum your lives away but basically little bit down there go and try it out and if you do manage to win some like skins or anything like that let me know if I tweet me a picture of it and tag and csgo water with it and I will see you guys in my next video if someone could do the math of how much I'm actually up tonight that'd be great but either way we just won't do those it does so fuck yeah 
all right listen gentlemen I'm not addicted to opening cases but this video is a case opening on overwatch now before you go crazy being like Tom you just made a video talk about how you like the gameplay and you like the game and one of the reasons I've been playing the game a lot is so I can earn cases to open and just see what swagger can get out of it it wasn't till I it was stupid enough to realize that there's a shop button and when you click shop you can actually buy these cases I actually stolen straight away voila so I'm now doing this video I'll be opening 50 cases in this game I everyone seem like you fooled Tom why are you doing this you're addicted and I understand that I know that I'm sorry if they're I wish it wasn't an option because that I never do it but for the sake of them being available now I'm doing it I think the way this actually works anyway is if you earn like the coins in game or something you can pretty much buy everything by like did you go to the right here or gallery so for example the Reaper if I wanted a skin I think you can unlock it like I don't want this at a certain level or whether you just need enough light credits or thing over here but then you can you can get it like that look how amazing that is so it's weird that you can see everything and I'm pretty much we're gonna want oh my god this isn't it who's ringing app can't do that I'm streaming but oh my god so basically yeah I'm gonna base open a lot of these and try and get some of these super rare which are legendary skins for the Reaper so you can't get them free playing the game normally and you can also pay to open cases so we're gonna open 50 and we got why'd you do it that's a legendary learn you know I've actually got I don't even know what call the purple is but I got I got this I got a harmonious that's that's nice I'm not looking at these sprays I don't see the point in them but we got a legendary slap shot which i think is one of the worst characters in the game and then we got this guy world war war war war war war war wall sorry I'm getting a lot of messages right now but this is what we're doing we're opening 50 if you guys don't want to see this again come and say Tom you're an addict and you need some help but if you want to see it again be like Tom we're feeding your addiction get out it keep it going get the legendaries but I see this character is really cool I really like it but at the same time like I just don't think I'd ever I don't really use this character I tried it I'm trying to play more and more characters and I'm going to be doing the live scenes where I do an hour of this character on that character but I'm just not really just not I'm not feeling it what is this I got courtesy no oh so if I collect enough currency I could just buy the skin I want can you buy bitcoins and just buy the skin you want anyway I don't I see I don't know what that color is if someone can tell me what is that more coins that's 150 coins ooh well I get and we got we got this guy over here smoke it looks like a goddamn hipster whatever but we're gonna keep we're gonna keep you rolling and we're gonna get legendary everybody much I'm assuming right now everyone a twitch chat' Steve like Tom you're an addict you need help I'm not doing it I'm not an addict it's only what we'd like to do that just open that I didn't see wait don't just open a legendary Indian Manoa's cuz I look at my twitch chat wait a minute wait a minute go back here oh gallery Reaper smilk back skins wit Doug is it no what do did I just get a rare is that class as a rare I don't like it no is that what he actually looks like so that's what it looks like that's moss and then that's that looks kind of crap to be honest but will equip it cuz it's like I think is it a rare I'm looking at the color it and assuming that it might have been a rare I I don't know it could be it couldn't be I don't know the full rules and regulations of this book yeah we got a skin for the Reaper which is all I'm after right now all I care about is getting skins for the Reaper just go with it go with a flow and we're just gonna actually cool so look at this equipment wait Newt skin me do she got the booting she do man like the I can't leaders all that controversy about when this game came out that everyone was like oh no to sex sexual fools too sexy many too much and it's like a bit weird but whatever all right I got a belt buckle I got one then I got this woman and equip did she just do that did she just do the meme you know that woman that looks like she's look at my girls like yeah she doing that so is that something meme she's doing make she moves so me she's she the Royal me you like I feel like we're gonna get five legendaries okay like you get these sprays for like certain characters and you get this preview of her skin actually doesn't look too bad III played this character once but not really got too much into it I prefer the Reaper I think the Reapers like oh oh he gave us cash oh we got a duplicate so we get more so we don't keep the skin but we get coins that's nice and we got a white rabbit that's actually really cool I'm gonna clip that I like that one I again haven't used a character I've only use probably about 5 out of 15 legendary Chuck make whoo ha ha well that's amazing whoa I just played it as him as the first time today as well whoa there's so much going on there Casca on the shoulder stick that I was gonna say steering wheel on the arm it's got some belt buckles going on in these feet look at what our toes what out to where a child's going on that's pretty cool is it so oh it's oh I actually thought you had a shark head I was confused as to what's going on so does he ever met all like gas masks on and then it's got a push arc pail over his face the hype is real we got a legendary how many they're saving yet we got about two already I reckon you get back to the other three sure I don't really like that one so just gonna keep it one I like how you can open these faster to see it I think yes your long take too long open just like you can't really spam them I do like I do like this character but wait has he always got a bionic arm or is that a result with it I don't know it might do I you can tell much attention paid in this game so far all right really I've lost count already oh I like that shadow wait yeah Reaper yeah a reef is my favorite thing so far how many coins only 50 now if we can if we can get a thousand coins I could just buy the dispenser things he thinks it understands everything here kind of so we could really list it we could listen to the Vice preview things but you could just listen to them in the shops anyways oh what's got give it you more coins welcome let's listen to one damn that sounds dangerous what rocket jump that sounds dangerous doesn't sound Aegis not some of the voices didn't see I'm a kind of anonymous but there's a particularly the girl who runs around just screaming at it stuff I'm just that I don't like you I don't like it all a bit swayed oh we've got a voice for the Reaper let's listen how do I killed you somewhere before I like that we're keeping it there at the Reapers like the most badass character I'll understand why no one was one of place in the house that's awesome that is amazing that's an ammo I haven't actually played as a parent yet either I've worn it I believe but never quite got an answer that's super cool it's actually nice to see things for the first time because that everything I'm looking at now is like new to me and so you might you know I keep you up in case in csgo like you've seen all the screen control alright this one's actually look at the things well which is really cool so I kind of really like that okay well hello oh right listen to Quran shoot right there oh my god it's keep it go on give it all you missing legendary this is Oh what does this mildly face me oh it's in a moat it's a pretty piece pretty bad at the moment I'm not gonna lie I like that I like it but I want to let you know if I get enough I think I don't even care if I get a legendary until summer legendaries might not even to be the best you know I'm saying what is this a player icon I don't care about player icon I think that's the worst character in the game for looks like it's so cheesy that and the the woman who's made of ice that looks pretty cool whoa that is a dope a spray spray tag I like that well what does she say this is the girl I don't like keep calm and tracer on I'm like I'll get me out of there I never wanna hear that but I never hear when I hear that line yeah well equip that it looks pretty badass though it's actually pretty cool the detail that they've done with these skins are ridiculous this game can make so much come on I want Reaper eyes cheer did it Oh blood Reaper you know what it's not even that like rare or expensive as a skin but I like it I like how long I'm gonna keep boys these old soldiers never die and they don't fade away well they do but all right listen I am NOT one to judge old man I do your thing you do your thing probably go we got we got some cash cash cash money everything grows on trees Oh deeper gone okay nothing oh do I really want to listen to her again ever get that feeling of deja vu no don't I don't want to hear that again either hate when I see something playing as a character an enemy team so now I'm just gonna hear about oh we got some we got voice like listen give me a break that's actually kind of lackluster I was expecting more from you in but as expected more like a legendary no no no no whoa what is this Pharaoh I'm not cooking that looks badass I really like that mmm take it easy victory put that that's it that's it that that's the take it easy victory but kind of lackluster it yeah by the time I broke through 30 people's cases I would probably only been on ten cases on csgo all right oh I like that spread so quit that one sounds cool all right who's just pray for Oh Sonya Zenyatta I probably I'm butchering these names we'll try with its market we got some more cash money what does she sound like get down give me 20 of course the butch the butch woman would be Russian hi let's keep going I believe in alleged darling I just I just want skins for the Reaper what she's like stepping through my ballet said the spider to the fly that's a senior one dude damn the crate is much much fun making her all go to a bubble uh-huh we got butch we got the butch okay we got we got butch but that's dope fisticuffs I like that you got some more cash oh we got thousand we've got a thousand by the best skin we want we can buy the skin I think that we want from a wait a minute 45 I don't even know what that is but that looks like blocked Bastion to quit that Sebastian bastions a passings a little cool kid I like bastian bastian is a beast I didn't realize how much for the character I'm I just players back today got more cash money hot pink Jesus asked me tits cuz they laughing at me mate that she has got I cook she's got cushion for the pushing around that Jesus Christ no wonder it was outcry about I was it jet that dudes like a pose of a light posing like that something oh yes look sick I know it's not like an epic pose it's very just like standard but like I like that I like that a lot oh yeah lose so much uproar about like oh my god her butt why'd you do it come on Reaper but we go maybe we got a look at we got we got cash and then the three tiers that's Robert yo that is sick am i quitting that um I actually really like that uh is this the right I think this is the rarest skin you can get for her look with it not bad wait that's the helmet of a transformer that's the helmet of it that's a helmet of an eagle and I said not bad that's a pretty Dogon spree brew job dude so this cost me 31 British pounds to open these Oh yep I'm graph to do that I'm going to sneak behind people and just spray it on the wall then when you see I'm gonna kill them that's what I hope I'm gonna do but in reality we all know it's not gonna go really it's never gonna live it never does never will yeah yeah like like a bit of hot pink what is he doing that's his victory pose just thinking British I wouldn't check that motor Keifer go and get burgle and what is that not really played is that and the victory pose isn't that good oh is that where there stood there at the end I think I suppose that weather's perfect betcha Daddy Reaper you got cash money how much cash movie star 500 cash money god damn son I wait what that watermelon have it and the focus on watermelon are we getting legendaries four days I think we've had a soul about five legendary so far I'm okay with that let's keep it wrong we're almost ran out tastes like I just want my reaps oh we got another waiter I thought it's a duplicate I'm not the same bleached what was the oh my god I thought that was it maybe not if you get 2000 coins then we can like couscous or okay I prefer that that looks like more of a badass thing for the Reaper boy from keeping it got five bucks I've left five left I definitely think that there is without a doubt a legendary in there for us hopefully I'd have to be a certain level we're gonna do it as a reborn right death blossom I don't know like that one do you pick up okay okay okay three left we're going oh what'd I say what I say Reaper guys what the are you Mac oh oh this is with a shark I'm realizing I'm noticing the theme no I actually prefer the other one but because this is more colorful I like that one but we got another legendary then we got a what that's you what that is dope and in this one and that's killer bloody a shiny ass McGee I think we got that one for that right to left paragraph one more after this come on coming Wow a Reaper skin elder a Reaper daughter I think therefore I am Oh guess I don't know people right last creep let's keep her going today get one keeper

never have seen his face I think he looks like a potato right now uh mid now it looks pretty cool royal one of them desert yeah right oh my gosh I have to go for that I have to go for that that that is the pinnacle of what I would say I'd want to always look like that's kind of cool but it looks to me that is trippy as that's really cool but I don't know if I want to get our on my back you know you know I don't know if I want it I tell you I if I did buy one I'd probably buy it in black because then I will fully be the Reaper but I really where is he gone which one is it 101 no no that one

cool but not cool enough that one's kind of cool but then this one it's very evil mmm I don't know which one to go for hey I'm off that one that's badass it's just like my favorite character like I'm in love with this this is the sort of thing I'd cosplayers I've never felt played in my life but I would love to cosplay as that right victory pose have we done them oh these are the only ones so heroic taken aback wait do we buy this one oh that's the one we unlocked medicine oh that's um like that wait which one I forgot got that one yeah well I'm getting that one like us forgot look menacing I'm a badass but I'm a wait what the hell one sec I got getting million text messages all right wait I want to look up a character so there is my Reaper looks pretty damn sexual if you ask me but no I actually really enjoy Punjab and I really enjoyed and really enjoyed opening these I'm gonna play gameplay now I think I'm we do a full gameplay like commentary playing as this character and just see how things go hopefully if it's a good game then obviously I posted something but yeah if you guys want to do some more of these I like go through like all the intros and skins for everyone then I'll totally do that but I literally just found out today that it actually had this I didn't know that's why I was playing those games to try and get the cases to open I didn't even bother thinking about the shop thing I don't know why I don't even think about it but I'm actually really impressed with this so you guys like the video you wanna see more overwatch make sure the like button subscribe I'll see you guys in my next video which will definitely be a game play overwatch video so which lips your faces and goodbye 
so for this game I may have had the slowest start possible because I totally didn't realize that my game had loaded I not even got into game so this is being looted already and I can hear gunshots going off so I've got to hope that this guy leaves some sort of gun behind and that I can just dive in and take it alright that guys we win so if we could be super smart we could get to that of the trailer there at the end open it up and grab a gun before I sign these boxes nope no it's just light safe just play it safe just play it safe he can't see us we can't see him oh no we can't we can't see him you can't see yours we can't see him just play the quiet game as long as he doesn't run up this way we're good as long as you doesn't run up the tail we're good I'm assuming he's gonna be taking every single pistol at every single everything so I can't lose anything but if we can track him the entire way we're good I've got a backpack and a pistol and it took 20 shotguns or anything like that looks like he's going for the double loop he's going for everything okay okay this is like because this is player watching should all first listen to it okay we're observing the player oh these things always find a health pack and a backpack okay backpack alright well she's up here that he's going to take I don't see anything that helps track okay it's got inside Oh open here imma we're good we're good I don't know if you check the back of the castle gun right now he's doing it he's going side the other company has been in there but he's triple checking I don't see any guns

what's going on guys ticket here a welcome your faces to another snapchat Q&amp;A the one we did last week when absolutely amazingly you guys seem to love the idea about it we didn't get too many weird snapchats and this time we're gonna give it another go and hopefully get some pretty cool creative awesome snapchat questions from you guys so I gotta do is add me on snapchat send me a question and when I do this video on announce that I'm accepting your guys questions you might be in the video so let's get into it but before we get into this I will try and set a goal I want to try and see if we can get 50,000 like ratings on this video I think it could be done but you guys need to show me can we smash it can we reach it let's find out and let's get into some snapchats hey Tom I'll just wondering if you guys ever get bored of doing YouTube like you and other famous youtubers if you just want to stop sometimes they just want to break you know my famous we're not famous but yes it can get very repaired when you do the same thing over and over again it's a bit like my brain Yeltsin shit I was wondering what your video plans are for in the future I want to do a lot of day to live so I wanna travel the world to just do crazy absolute awesome shit but I am I you know it I kind of want to get my dad involved this is as well as it sounds like my dad's like you know 60 year old dude but I kind of just want to take him out of his comfort zone and make him do crazy awesome stuff so if you guys got some suggestions of what me my dad can do together leave it down in comments below and I'll check it out I just wrote this right out right guys when I say I do the snapchat Q&amp;A for videos you guys just send me messages I don't open any of them you're wasting your time videos only let's start man keep doing you okay I'll keep doing me you give you a new tits or us kiddies home will be a mining season for you because like no one really said enough enough not really heard anything so yeah there could definitely be a miner season 3 right now there's nothing planning for a day or when or how or what it could possibly be well we're actually working on instead is the my night MMO a massive server where we can play with you guys we can rank up get epic weapons and all sorts of cool stuff like that so stay tuned for that if we do analysis of my night season 3 just for my night and Twitter and you'll find out there but until then nothing's been confirmed what do you think your career will be after your talk with you you definitely going games out of programming that sort of stuff I'm currently doing with Ruby Dean we just released dead run right now which is available on Steam for you guys to get but during the process of that I just realized that this is such a good passion of mine absolutely that I want to continue it for the rest of my life so yeah I want to keep making games yo syndicate do you ever think you're gonna go for a big milestone like round one one five again and the news Blackhawk screws on this good question again I don't know if I'm ever gonna do it because when I did the first actual ever one one five slash one one six rounds on keynote so and it took me so damn long and the frustration of failing so many times to get up to that round was just like mine melting but if there is a good map where it's fun to play and you know like the game doesn't crash all the time then maybe just maybe it would be an awesome livestream is this milk I don't know it's it milk say your favorite color in Spanish look alright I said blue hey Tom I was just wondering if there's ever days where you don't want to do YouTube one where you just wish you could just stay in bed and not do anything but you feel obligated to because your fan based on those videos keep going absolutely you know why I'm like tamiya all the time is cuz I'm goddamn in bed just sat uh hung over from the night before yes syndicate I was just wondering um what are you most excited for for next season uh my night I want to see more ability control and just do what everyone if there is a season three I want to just be able to do what I want when I want there was way too many rules in season two there was to it like you get in trouble too much I just want to be able to be the team died night that I am and just wreck shit II love one to ten seven being the best how much do you love Tucker using fruits and vegetables as your app potato PS your hair was awesome I go excuse the hair scale the showers but my question is what's it like being Tom Syndicate the most interesting man in the world but the most interesting man in the world well actually it's pretty normal I actually like it I like being just a normal dude and I see too many youtubers that like you know people look up to in so far and they're just like douche bags and I just like being Tom a person and when you guys meet me events or anything like that you realize that I'm just straight-up a normal guy and that's how I like to keep things and that's how it will stay if the internet ceased to exist what would you do you know what if I could do a dream job I probably like a bartender in like a really exotic island you like white beaches god so Nancy and sounded everything like that I just get drunk and fucked my bitches all day I'm joking I'm joking up probably oh my god it's on my question for you is that did you ever think you would make as far as you have being a youtuber absolutely not I actually really didn't think I'd ever get here I started Butchie chance before I had this one and it just got kind of nowhere and then started to get somewhere and then I made this channel and it just absolutely blew up with ecology zombies and I was like oh my god I love it so yeah I just got really really looking at the fact that I hit a million subscribers now I'm close to 10 million subscribers the fact that I got a million views and they've got a billion views it's just mind-blowing so it's just a really overwhelming feeling to be honest thanks a question YouTube wasn't your job what would you be doing right now in your life good question I would actually probably be still doing games out of programming that's something that I've said before and if my YouTube didn't take off whilst I was at college studying the games and programming I probably would have just carried on doing it and hopefully be learning how to program I'm making my own actual games but instead now I'm working with a company that programs the games for ROS and I just get to come up with all the cool ideas for it so it's sweet how old are you well that was straight to the point I'm 22 sir no just no no yet how would you survive a real zombie apocalypse haha hopefully bid England where I've got my new house cuz I've got solar panels on the roof so I'd be able to power my house the rest of the life I've got a natural spring water at the bottom of my gallon so I've got watts by forever plus there's a farmer's fear not survive so he's got seeds and shit like that so go and borrow a lot of them and a two sheep make sheep bang and then I have like a pretty much a food supply so I think it was pretty set to be honest pink on my video I just want to know why you chose to do a horror game we said to do a horror game because we thought I'd be like a really fun thing for us to be able to do is like a first game it wasn't like a massive massive project that takes like a year two years to make instead it took us six months and it was something that was very doable but our audience I kind of already knew that we play like people and I play about five nights at Freddy's and scary slender games stuff like that and Adam plays like the hidden and other scary games so it was just a very natural game for us to be able to make and the next game we're gonna make is going to be another natural sort of game that would usually play anyway so wait and see what we bring out next but don't forget dead roms got a massive life ahead of it so like new maps characters knew all sorts of things so it's giving us now much mad you even listen to Drake are you cool dude no I'm not I'm a hot dude wait what oh no that sounds weird do more vlogs ok then I will fuck stop pressuring me listen to me you're taking a shine in someone's toilet left it I don't know how I feel about these set of questions but yeah I'm totally taking a pill not be able to flush it the feet was broken how could I get rid of it so just put a little toilet roll on em to end it wasn't me what's your motivation to upload you guys you guys are all my motivation it just makes you think of what would the audience love what do they know me for white whale what can I do to make it more fun every single time and that's pretty much what I do oh my gosh oh my god you fucking baby back the Benny t-shirt you fuck oh my god the creepies think of the world I guess you don't like chicken what are those if it at any concave never been it before what country would be Australia and Tokyo never been really want to go plus I also want to go to New York said sag or iPhone all of your channel watch you every single video put up and keep up what you doing oh thanks good night for sure though a lot and I'm gonna have to definitely say Samsung for the cameras and Apple for the user interface and stuff I think it's better yep that's you guys do you watch monsters ah no I don't watch MasterChef I don't actually watch that much TV I'm a youtube addict so I'll just stay on that whole time what would you do if you came home and your parents were American I came over my parents would be American up in that bitch get a picture baby burger for the record I would not call my mother a bitch could she beat the living shit out of me good I might I'm just kidding up America you ready no but what is your all-time favorite Pokemon syndicate I really want to know a side the one with the blade blade arms is green I just think he's an absolute fucking bad-ass hey and by the way thanks for the nipple mate appreciate that well if you don't know Kyle squeeze he got all his subscribers brought to him by his mum she felt sorry for him so she Baltimore so so really touchy subject we talked about it on legends of gaming book just just don't bring it up to him as my ball okay it gets upset how was your day pretty fucking good you see that no you don't see it well I'm sorry I can't show you anyway what what the fuck was that hey Tom where did you swim in high school when you were in swimming freestyle I was one of the fastest freestyle swimmers there ever is and ever was ripped a true racing gosu the cook where should you be in ten years in ten years I want to see myself just relaxing chilling out and then going into my office every now and again checking on my game to be developed that's pretty much what I want to do yeah okay yeah you lick the ice cream yeah you look I scream you're just so weird just weirdos all of you weirdos to go over you want to reach that you have all about struggle to nearly every single country in the world the fact that I've got so many of my favorite ones that haven't been to already like Australia Tokyo New York really upsets me but I find it difficult to take the time off at the moment I should just seize the moment and go well fortunately you can't just do that all the time even on sale ads to show you to make sure life's too short to make the most of it but not to fuck your life up okay make sure you never do something that will end up fucking your line books don't do that absolutely good sermon so to ask what is your favorite holiday destination or your dream on the big destination I have soared to Egypt when I was younger and I absolutely loved it the weather was amazing the food was incredible the sea was just absolutely outstanding so if I could go anywhere again I probably go to Egypt but if I was gonna go to somewhere new on holiday I'd probably say like you don't like one of those Caribbean islands white sands tiny island you don't like just that sort of thing I think that'd be pretty sweet why you oh yeah cars are just felt fabulous back in IJ blondes or brunettes blonde necks ah been the highlight of your life all my life he's been able to achieve success in something that I've always wanted to do the fact that I managed to become an actual youtuber and make a success from it living from it and create an audience from it we're just mind-blowing emember being at my dad's house when it was just being built I would show had nothing in the room just a mattress sat there uploading YouTube videos at like 3 o'clock in the morning to a channel like from 7 years ago and it just getting nowhere to save I I once was doing that to now doing this it's just absolutely credible one like you can grasp how awesome it feels video this is a full-time job there's a lot of people saying that the Call of Duty's are just the same thing over and over just reskin you believe that or do you think the Call of Duty's are actually a little bit different from each other I would say that the multiplayer is almost very much reskin just re pumped out but it's the campaign and story like when I go to the studios and see all these guys working on this campaign is epic sure it's like a movie that the crane so it's something completely different every single time but the core element of like an FPS shooter is they've got the thighs they've reached the top by four gameplay mechanics the way that your firing gun like the perk systems all that sort stuff there's only so much they can ever change it becomes difficult to be able to say how can they make it so much more new that people like rather than changing the original farmer or formula to what makes the perfect FAS you which called Yui basically is Thomas eat my bud oh no no to the eating of buttholes no oh wouldn't fight Ronda Rousey or for a new one dude Ronda Rousey would kick the shit out of five mayweather in a fight not a boxing match cuz she set herself and I agree that she would get outbox by him but if it was like in a straight up street fight Ronda Rousey would kill him fact why are you so cool why are you so clean oh it's beautiful I love it is in divine here in Dubai he's in Dubai you in Dubai exactly right where's that so well you didn't even tell me where you were are you bastard face I'm joking I love you nice place have a great holiday by the scene so you're looking on one your what what is your favorite drink besides little cuz I know I would have to go with another orange drink company Assad it's just so nice it's so refreshing and it just takes me back to my childhood time where he calls us from the umbrella I really want to know it was only a matter of time before someone asked this question and the answer is this Alice is not my neighbor Alice is in fact my genuine sister bought because when she walk in the back of my live streams and videos everything like oh my god who's that good-looking girl so I feel like oh it's my neighbor so I didn't have everyone saying ten out of ten would bang your sister trust me I grew up with a good-looking sister my entire life got used to comments like that you just take on the chin it doesn't literally bother me but it just made it easier to go oh that's my neighbor rather than say to is my sister so on the YouTube comments everyone used to just say oh your neighbors really good look it up like what like yeah that's a good compliment that sort of stuff so yeah there's the actual truth behind why neighbor alice is called Mary Alice to hide her identity as being my neighbor okay first the chicken or the egg the fucking chicken omelette came first mate we're dropping back YouTube videos and not being successful or be a game design and create and be more successful I think I really follow my dreams and B games that have a really successful just because I love to do that that's why I want to do when I first I'm doing YouTube or anything like that and even side doing Chris oh yeah I'll do that no don't ever do that again hey syndicate I was just wondering what your favorite call duty that's basically it oh there's like one of the kindest snap questions ever had everything's being fucking weird and you're just really nice so modern warfare 2 I love college at your folks I played it for so so long bought or fed to when you were going on that grind going for them loops and stuff like that that was my absolute favorite from Infinity Ward but if I had to pick one from Trey out I definitely have to go with black ops 1 for zombies is introduced with so many new features hello my hello if you here easy to give me a response I will be very happy thank you my boy no word there's your response have a great day what was your favorite video games playing when you're younger I'm gonna have to go with the Sims the Sims was absolutely amazing me my sister used to run home off the school bus get home as fast as we can just to play The Sims we'd get up like 4 hours earlier before we're supposed to wake up at like 9 o'clock and stay off from 5:00 just playing The Sims 4 Sims the Sims the Simpson since our lives revolved around it and I dad didn't like his playing it so we always just used to play the hell out of it so that's my answer how much Lego can you stick up your bomb hey Dad I got a question for you how much Lego can you fill us or what made you want to throw it YouTube my a lot of community and just do cool shit with it I know this is a stupid question but what country were you born in United Kingdom Snicket when are you gonna do mine crack again well I've got to show a video biker yet I'd like to do you HC with them guys we just have to try and organise it's super super fun when we last tried it and hopefully I'll try and pull out some nlg skills for you guys so maybe soon but why I don't know just more nipples great just great legend darre on a scale of one to ten how good your Australian accent oh I forgot day mate goat goat fucking day mates brought about a fucking one and a fucking warm beard about ten mate if I can go to go down to the fucking quarry find some diamonds and then fuck around a pussy that was not right not started I saw I just put a best ralien so bad if I could be reborn again at the Australian just name Xbox Pitt cheeky wee for me on Twitter too cheeky no but why no no but wise stop it would you rather jumping up orb lemon juice with paper cuts all over your body or put a toothpick on your toe and kick a dog jump into a pool of lemon juice definitely I've ripped up a toenail before and it was fucking excruciating if you could be any animal in the world what animal would you be I'd be a motherfucking unicorn I could fly a ship rainbows all sorts of stuff but if you actually want a real answer I'm probably gonna have to go with something along the lines of a bird or an eagle cuz then I could fly all around the world I could shit on people you know that sort of thing because if you're just like a fucking spider or some what you pay points on you it takes forever to get anyway so I'm glad to go like a big fucking bird you gonna see you finally get a knife in one of your case openings are you still gonna make videos about them or are you just gonna start hopefully if you guys want to keep doing it then I'll definitely keep doing it because there's always a chance for csgo to bring out new cases with new knives so it would be nice to try and collect one of every single knife and just keep rotating and try and see if we can make a collection but it's got to be pretty difficult to do so we'll just a fluency good using really pretty good to me I regret getting stung by a wasp when I was younger if you guys don't know how much analytic allergic to wasps and bees I went in to go and see the nest let's get my dad said that you should the door while the nest was and I was like no he said go back had should it went back and show it and when I went back to shoot I got stung on the head and it can't affected my life for the rest of my existence I've been stung a bunch times before and never got an allergic reaction and until that one stung me it kind of fucked me up so yeah would you ever do swagger giveaway but my don't got no swag way up but my dick in the swag right absolutely I definitely give away a flow deck if we can get ahold of a bunch of them then why not let's do a pretty cool light giveaway and did Chicopee awesome what advice can you give to new youtubers starting our good question consistency like you upload every single day or every other day at a set time because if you just upload whenever no one's going to know where you make your YouTube videos everyone should know that I upload every single day 6 p.m. UK time every single day like that and when I'm like that's my bot but people still give me shit because they know when to expect itself consistency is key it's sort of your huge fan and I try no losing that there's gonna be fog rolling in in black ops 2 if there is motherfucking fog rolling

get all the way out there then someone just go wrong alright thank you I literally should be saving my ammo sorry get this many folks are waffle but I'm trying to see how fast I can get to the rounds I'm convinced you should be able to do it so fast look at that not streaming in 60 oh yeah whoa wait a four I was eight if it's not streaming at 60fps I might actually Jenner three star oh I'm not streaming at 60fps war we what how the hell did that happen I wonder if I can mid interrupt a stream to change it to sixty probably not probably a terrible idea however how the hell of I managed this this is possibly we do median as fast as I can ingestion settings enable 60fps oh god I've had successfully saved as it now changed my stream key I'll sell me fresh let me check I don't know if all the sudden the stream starts going in 60fps then we're rockin and rollin if not I don't know i thanks for noticing that by the way I didn't know I wasn't in 60fps time we should be in 60fps damn it's no record no ma'am 30fps we'll just make it look really crowd quiets much bad weight not stripping a sixty Apple its quality looks so much better what never know what I hope you can still see it we'll see you hit 10 million see any and Delphis I appreciate really I used to be gave you thank you very much flush I'm flushing bath like you all the Six Flags worker yeah what's up bro how you doing yeah fishing shooting trying to get through this rounds as fast as possible oh wait actually doesn't really make a huge spot for doing what I want to do if the box is out in the corridor there's different ways you can go about techniques use maths and I why so if the box is outside to life I should really speed let's go stairs and open see done hey black guy thank you very much for sponsoring where's the box I'll see you in there I'm gonna run round and down wit although I'm using char there please be here please be here yes right boxes in here that's good that is a good actually well ah that's purple buttons Taruna point oh yes bomb right if we get the thundergun and monkeys were already set to go I don't really want that hmm if only this box I cook you know what let's try get the garlic I forget fur garlic we're so much more sad I hope this approves beneficial to our elbows all right a phosphor flies resistant peak for a warrior's mule-kick shadow ah whoa I need eyeliner it's watch over us all right so we don't have to worry about anything else just flying through boys mom keep these runs going I I just want to get the Thunder gone before it anymore on earth by how many points I got a point oh damn everyone's like bombarding like crazy nobody preciate that study thank you very much man Swift predator when will the one on five room be this is likely pre-gaming for a 1-1 five run this is me checking things out and seeing how it would go there we go this is me checking things out for what one one one one five run would be quality says 720 but it looks like 480 oh wait is the quality much worse Oh someone said to watch on what is chibi no sir a big ads here I don't why don't I like moon I did actually like it I just played it it's pretty good Oh creature I'm actually gonna keep the gargon term it might sound without actually keep it my beats are rockin uh-huh just beautiful in it just answer them that's a SMG Aubry the only thing I'm really worried about is having three guns because when you panic and switch to use under gun it's like oh shoot your wife on and then when you switch to it you're good what put what can I possibly want from the box right now I can't think of anything that pops I possibly want as a couple number we want the Thunder gun and assumes you got thunder gun and monkeys were set maybe fire sales were really good call a couple wish thank you very much on who the heck is up oh shit there you could say oh what's wrong with that I really don't open the back door just for a robot I can use like alright my beats are rockin Wow that makes so much it all Rousseau home away from a ball show me where it goes I just don't want it to either go there or there I think now we know it's gonna go there please don't please don't please don't please don't please don't please don't please don't please don't please don't they're calling it all in it all in it all in it oh there's no power on so you can't tell chip I think about that you say that many grenades and they didn't die what it's crazy it's odd see you play this map without your Slayer I put it with him watch actually locally you got fired afterward so it's worth it you did not get fired from your job get out of here Joseph well thank you very much we appreciate what was that song I played at the start to see Ronald Jenkins awesome makes a lot of music and what usually did so I'm thinking as I need like an SMG as my secondary school or oh the shotgun actually moving yeah if I could get the hit major by backup shotgun that'd be good the reason for that is because it fires fast and if I have it have fun the war one can it gives me the chance of black tie tubes in our favor or anything any spoons or anything oh there really isn't much that I need to be doing like if i crack this I don't want the Raygun I don't need ray guns we think I'm for you I could use it for Pines I could use this gun for pines there's a lot that's going through my head but trying to plan how I'm gonna do this need more arm strap I don't like I got like a few different straps from a head that one I got a few different shots in my head now I will turn them into red in

user book trying to hit the ball kids crate understand here keep regarding boys lose Oh victory I don't try to get as many files as possible - where is my ammunition damage fly to his round sorry

message I'm sorry Oh Robbie thanks brother babies are Chesebrough gave me the throne finishes round quickly No honey I'll finish the ready damn son all right we we actually wanna hit the ball from a ball match can't be has to open this door and I need to pack a punch don't get me wrong it's like if I turned on the power I'm thinking of some proper wear techniques guys some real techniques I'm looking forward to playing around these techniques as well you know don't get me wrong someone works on a fail but walking things to this finish so it reloads and well this girl kills faster no demons that gun fires fast but this one fires faster look at this shit like I'm shooting through the walls of zombies as trying to spot in however though I'm oh damn you have fastest dog round ever already

picking it up because it'll slow down the zombie spawn in it and I want to come fast time we destroyed but the kuda cute as a flashbang weapon and I could buy him off a while for this where's the kuda spawn is that the COO - that gasps - to them that could be a good shower dude Russia this sodas numbers always up too long Olivia this big fire so fast beautiful I don't even know if I've got a rapid fire on it as well bloody hell oh it's maddening Igoe by the way your mother Malcolm streamed it appreciates you check appreciate donation I I don't know how long I've been going for is her time all right now 15 I'm I'm purposely not wanting to move the bar because I think the box is in the middle and if I keep staying here killing them I can get the box to spawn it with the fire sales and if you sponsor with the file stays then I can get the thundergun I can then get the I drop to open the other doors I can keep the Thunder gun and monkeys that's what I want I water pack lunches and and this is really Deadshot daiquiri it's probably one of those perks for this new game for this run a lot of people will understand that because when you're not using it for looking at when you're not using Finnegan mo you want to be able to like on bread how many headshots it looks like I have an aimbot don't know I might lock on to the heads-up plus with our om like that's already built in the game I'm

initiating in case you need to get them back out of there the way I'm thinking to make you this faster is if I open that door and then just timed out the fire trap and you keep the fire truck I don't I don't need to use your trap shit just yet what do need to do is I need to get this on zap instead of Anor Thunder wolves good and all that well I don't want out this gun might not even make a difference I just prefer I prefer the duck still spawn and see how it's going much slower now that yeah the rounds getting the higher of the round it's getting much slower because I'm in a much bigger area look how many places are happen to spawn it's cuz I want this gun off the wall sure I think there's another place where I'd want to try and do this just for speed tomorrow running in the first room is a good idea but buying a gun off the wall isn't that room is a good call 32000 always show friend one chuckles how did you Therese good it weapon will be useful I wish them oh oh oh it's not a problem just yet but it will be so leave spawn locations ready I love knowing when you get when we use spin around she just did you get a Slugger he's got a box he's got a tell for action good not me

the Thunder gun then turned on an SMG a thermo-pile job is going for a round one more five runt now the warm unwrapped fireman will take it will take me ages like oh jeez there's just so many mechanics now that make this game like it you know it which what do you choose now you know no turn might actually end up being a really good decision but I think the electric puts that but that got old - you can have two turns same time I don't know about that hey Tom we love with vlogs Congrats on hit 1000 count - sir - the same time interesting I know that yo I wonder if I think it's a soldier so I'm thinking I'm getting excited for the amount of mechanics I'm thinking of there could be so many fun oh my god you get these to be turns sick i jus beast a crying on the wall I do turn did not need to get up nice timing I appreciate my run nice one him I got professional basically Joe Brandon Scott is I chuck high off the top of my head I can't think of any right cut again again habo I'm

156 you rock focus 9 look likes ready again that's 18 zombies dead like what not to do is take stems just 11 get killed well you are all destroyed and just keep spraying them I think I should put hipfire on this if I put better hipfire accuracy on this little laser it'll pay off there I think double tap on visitor five foul creature and then if you need ammo right there I don't even need to do the amount of spraying that I'm doing that's just like the longer rounds where it's like it gets slow this H is one would see that so that's a waste though when I when I use this when I spray it after the times ready I've trice if I shew them I always shoot want to tone it as a way just I like getting point I honest to god thought they're all fucking dead I thought it all dead I think we all did maximum ammunition I should really be using this quite an early rounds like get a full wave dear just for efficiency horace and big cheese Reese I appreciate my water source why does it feel so satisfying to watch someone shoot down zombies I don't know is it satisfying to watch someone around in circles killing zombies I don't know if it is or not spraying them means get this next round

out sing if the lighting is a riot my videos it's like throws off it's hard you should get a green screen I'd love to I can't do the microbe guys unfortunately sorry about that it's took at a low level I know it sucks I got try get terrorized until now it's got the same setup I oven it just mines potato this is the super slow way of doing it it's efficient but it was low you have to get the waves together and then kill more all of them in one blast with this even though once an hour rule will be purified by honor that looks like almost all of them finish launch our moon BAM the end of that guys oh why don't you get the Zeus cannon I don't really need it the Zeus cannon you only out you only ever need to pack a punch this gun realistically when you're an out of ammo and there's no point like a punch in it because then you need to hit the box again I'll get a max ammo just don't look good you then get then you get released and afterwards it doesn't do any extra damage what kind of tree your social memory on your disease because like some will fall over and stumble but most the time I'll just kill them all let's go say if you're watching Matt if anyone's watching Netflix I'm not watching master of none you really need to watch it so good this is how I used to do my round this was the one one fiver in a nutshell just stage dropping and all that hey thanks man I cannot pronounce your name by the way that is too many numbers in that shit alone that I shall continue what round you attempting me I don't know I don't know how long it's it well we're doing retirement it now to work out how long this would actually take me I did one round then and it took me four minutes on the dark it took me four minutes on the dog we're all it took me four minutes on the dot to get through one round which was around 30 a.m. I'm now trying it with a thundering technique which is that the more efficient way and there's like the smoothest way to remove it entire way or I don't think it's fastest strike was weak and I had a box I'll recorded this I could put on the turret but then what I'm going to do after this round is obviously as the rounds go up the longer the rounds get but it's kind of still the fairest test that rounds for install so what my next test is is to use the machine gun and the turret and always use the turret remove creep I want to try you on business all babies [Music] I'm not sure seems like creo launcher that's just a nickname I've got Fred site appreciate the donation but thank you [Music] [Music] come on guys get together now smile for camera if you remain in there that I didn't pick up so you've got take out into a way most people are talking about the ketchup - have you seen this this chaos that started I asked on Twitter do you put catch right chat answer this now if you've not got a YouTube account and you're not logged in a nut subs do it now just simply so you can answer this question all right if you pull out ketchup you put it in the fridge or a cupboard like what where'd you get your ketchup from right these four minutes 44 minutes 43 that talk alright so now I'm going to try it with this and I started it last time as I could hear that zombies coming [Music] in English exactly and I wouldn't do if running the stage is probably more efficient as well yes see I'm causing chaos by asking that question I'm going to get able to keep turning that turret on all the time can run through the monsters out at some Danny's by now thank you ma'am and I chose in our favor there is no victory only death stop the fuck fuck Irma and bounded by or boring shit I fucked up the speed of everything now I don't like that I need to oh shit I'll say guys I've got a fucking just quickly do this at the life of a thousand suns purify your souls you the disease around me sorry guys tell me I tell you guys night with me I put my ball in trash what I was saying anyway is I fucked up there because Cruz about when I got the max ammo it replenishes the spiderweb and it slows down as long as I get stuck in my path where I need to be which is not good um each other enough that we have to do this the next round as well test the speedy shit so cafeteria shit did it not let me I like the one running into these zombies and not even checking where the hell it will not stop until you are all destroyed just like in bigness or path beads I'm getting points and girls are in is it right there you go that was four minutes 18 without them without it with a fuck up down all right let's do this again you ready so I'm gonna start as soon as this is on me wait I can't wait here I don't wrote this this turret does but would he know the toll on you for her it would shoot your own through it would shoot I need to find out if I can

it I just shot it last second as well I'm trying I'm trying to just train like a professional like it and just see how it goes okay all right what we're gonna do is the reason why I want to train like a professional is I'm gonna pack a punch that it's good Chuck I need to connect hey cut gameplay channel fish ever ah he's a Walter makes beautiful light wait did I initiate will he call us sleep

helped us 11 and the streams nearly gone for quite a while or not this much this was like a prac this was like a training for one more five run I know what I want to do is just gonna take a lot of time a lot of fucking grueling okay let's see how long survived for now just I'm gonna try and training just random runes practice undercut strong run okay let's do this [Music] [Music] [Music] I don't know sir I do I really don't know what I was trying to do but there you go I got to run 50 there guys pretty stoked about that I'm glad I did it and we will be doing a one more five attempt the only times are really going to go down after practicing with that the only times I'm gonna go down is just like when I'm tired like when I'm tired that is going to mess me up so bad because when you sit when you put a low sensitivity can be a bit more smart with you directions and stuff but if my sensitivity is so high I flicked too far and accidentally walk into someone or the only other thing that's going to get me down and it is making me think about whether or whether or not I want to use a per coholic I do not need a per coholic it's good because like stand up and stuff up but I do not need it I just don't need it and and I feel that the downside of per coholic is having the widows wine because we don't wear those wine makes the zombies hit year then you get in your way then to slow down and then when you pick up a max ammo when you're doing your route you forget about it and the zombies are in your way so it's like do I really want to have widows wine or not so gonna have to give a think about that and when I'm doing my 105 Rumble got a few different techniques I'm liking the idea of and we'll just see how everything pans out book that was good fun this stream has gone on for quite a while now and so I'm gonna wrap this up before YouTube ends up ruining it something but good fun run it was actually started off as just too old just to walk through the fuss mugs for the gun and instead we actually went the toy way so we've got some polka holux ready to rock and roll if we do end up using it and I've got a blast dreaming guys so I'm gonna wrap up for now if you haven't done so already make sure you click that subscribe button you get notified when I make any new videos I do daily vlogging as well at life of Tom so if you want to tune out into that you can do and yeah the fact that we are on 16 thousand subscribers is pretty bonkers hour I am really really mind blown that that is even a possibility so honest to god thank you so much guys so yeah you can throw away the widow's grenades but honestly like sometimes when I'm training I accidentally pick up the max ammo and I didn't know I've got it and then it stops all of them so I'll let you know what I'm planning the woman 5 run like I announced a few days in advance sort of vlog and just see how that kind of pan you know so I think that's the best way to do it shadow appreciate a man and physics thank you very much dude and he tips on growing a youtube channel consistency post every now and again and on a schedule but I was good fun that was good for nearly midnight we got fifty run in the bags people want to see where that puts you on the leaderboards I was SEC barracks is it barracks zombies leaderboards maps keynote at oh and that puts me one thousand four hundred and seventy second in the world with three thousand three hundred and seven kills so yeah they go yeah well I should put that in a blog real quick yep did I do it or is it can tow to tow him my sec yeah ah no you have it I just finished playing keno - what the fuck of a phone battery died well guess I'm not vlogging yeah honestly I was gonna vlog them but I guess fucking can't open a liquid Davidians yeah I can do that for you guys see what I get before I wrap things up I I am very tired I'll have to admit that for free I didn't get much sleep last night and I've been bowling all day wait until you see tomorrow's vlog guys tomorrow's vlog is really lit lit lit lit lit like super fucking lit on the house is good I like that I think I'm gonna get rid of that shopping thing I'm gonna change up my perks as well I get rid of shopping thing make it so it's like I can get perks out the the box is more important and things that kind of like stop the zombies chasing after me is important you know I get them to stand still that's pretty good and you could say fire sales are really good like them ones they're not to not to bother about that ones and maybe more gobble gums that like they go under on the house that's good and another gobble gum although I like the non gobble gums that could run out because if I run out a gobble gums on a run that could really really soak so I do have actually a g7x for vlogging but I just don't like to use it alright well there we go guys I hope you did enjoy it and it was a lot of fun we got Steve in here and it's really nice to just be kind of active

because I didn't get hardly any seeds off the island these seeds are finding a bone I found a bone in the water pulled it out grew the grouper bone meal and then continued like that's how that's how I got this many seeds it this this season the season series so far has been erm it's been a struggle alright it's been a struggle to settle these I don't even know if I caught something I did it's British struggle like it you're too high so low it's been a it's been seriously too long so said didn't even give a reason why I won't be seasons written all right reason why I'm not doing season sorry one it takes up way too much time every single day to dedicate to it because if it's a daily stream so if I miss one episode of a Maya Knight season or like an episode like if you guys saw season one I was like pretty much there for like three quarters of it season two I was only there for like a quarter of the actual entire series I know it sucks but I got shit to do I do daily vlogging now if you don't know I film every single day in my life and have them two and a half years over on youtube.com forward slash life of Tommy if you haven't seen it link in the description go check it out but I do daily vlogging so I get invites to places and there are like hey George come here don't do that I don't want to be able to go yeah fuck it why not and just say yes to every opportunity I can do to travel as much as possible but if I was doing my night I couldn't do it like sometimes I actually missed I actually missed like birthday parties and stuff like that from people because I had to stream like I had to stream on that day like if I didn't stream I would miss I wouldn't miss like a massive portion of the story I'd be so far behind it just got to a point where it just wasn't enjoyable anymore the mods didn't like it all that sort of stuff like mods in game not much on Twitter somewhere it just got to a point where I was like that's too much like it's it it stepped away from the jump on a server randomly play minecraft do cool shit build cool build penises in my night build random a shit and burn down trees he just got a bit too serious a bit like that so the fire I was just like I don't know I don't want to do this I just want to go back to like you know keeping it old school and that's why I just felt like doing this I've been playing a lot of college it he's zombies and multiplayer at the moment to the point where I was like I really need some time just to kick it and just play play Minecraft I just really want to play minecraft I know it sounds random but I did oh shit what up okay wait wait wait serious conversation right now turning up my headset yo okay so let me let me be let me be very honest with you guys right now all right so

furthest furthest hardcore series that I did where we had the subtrees and everything about it was like perfect the furthest I got was open to a point where I was like fully armored out I think I may have had like a diamond sword or diamond axe Marta I know overwhelming as hell but I'd got that far and I was confident as hell and I attacked an Enderman and the Enderman wrecked me like I stream this series for like six hours well it wasn't exactly series but I streamed it for like six easily six six plus hours this one a hardcore island and it ended up getting wrecked by an Enderman so I'm

shufflers member for and bud i I don't want to be here but don't worry about no this is just called you zombies it's fine but let's take a look at it what went on is that the ESRB rating board was like you know what there's a dlc come in or everyone's like separate game come in we need to give it a rating and it basically said that new dlc is coming in and it's called black ops zombies called usually black ops three it called called you it black ops 3 zombie chronicles holy fucking shit well there's people like that that Cabiria bought as the internet goes it got deleted and everyone was like oh that must have been fake however it was a CAD and lo and behold one step closer to finding out what the fuck is going on until boom call duty black ops 3 zombie Chronicles confirmed by ESRB rating was 100 and fish fishing what 100% confirmed and then all of a sudden it comes out that DLC pack 5 is coming out the John I'm stealing your image for a second oh shit look at that official image look at it we are actually having all these eight maps come back in DLC 5 now as to when the day is when they drop I don't know as to what the Easter eggs are going to be I don't know am i ok with these maps origins yes moon suck a fart hey shangri-la suck took a little bigger far hey keno de toen you are my love and my wonder and I think we may have to do another 115 is that's 160 but we'll have to do another one one five run ascension I absolutely love you to pieces of death we're gonna have to go for something on that because I think we need to show some love to our by yoke Slayer and try and get to round one one five on that for him we've got the ripped good nut nice throwback we got shangri-la I like it obviously we have got nabbed or until okay so what you see in here is Tom's way to show you how gaming DLC and asset ownership made easy creates new DLC tempo it makes no sense but right so we had the latest DLC for Revelations map pack drop and it was like oh my god that's amazing because it featured things from Verruckt access online that it featured things from shi no numa also shangri-la kino der toten nat durant owen and maybe if you were all the sprinkle things but look at these little assets which add a new like dlc dlc 5 assets ok now these things were already worked on time and effort and energy put into it created into Revelations so these things are like say 34 extent already completed full remastered Maps which are then throwing these revelations so then it makes complete sense to them to be able to go we've pretty much got saved for EPS in of the entire map why don't we finish the rest of it over the space of a few months and then release zombie Chronicles to create DLC 5 there's no point I'm going create a map that they've not realistically had to use before which makes no sense because then I say what about moon but that might just because it's their absolute favorite and not mine so we're gonna cross out but moon for example is in DLC 5 which to me is absolutely crazy because it's such a big map it was taking so much time so much effort to actually remaster that map because they're not just thrown in they have to remake these maps can from scratch here to have the layouts they can use some of the building assets and just improve the quality of them but it takes a long time to go ahead and recreate a new map or like recreate a new map panel map remastering it takes a long amount of time and effort they did a really good job with the giant and I'm looking forward to see what to do with it in the future and there's a really good job with the DLCs that were featured in Revelations but it's just a way for you to wrap your head around like why did the DD Sam up site why didn't they do call of the dead now they didn't do call of dead for my understanding is simple because they haven't worked on it they chose not to work on it and instead they decided to work on doing origins because that was the final DLC that they made from the last ecology in black ops 2 which was absolutely amazing the quality of the map was insane so it wasn't that much work that need to go in it to improve it and move for example well again let's not talk about me I don't but there's your simplified way of understanding how the hell or why they held they would choose certain maps to go into DLC 5 rather than any old map in general it's all about reusing the same assets as efficiently as possible don't get me wrong I'm absolutely stoked for these things to actually drop the DLC should be pretty cool but if I could have it myself I would completely get rid of moon and I would definitely replace it with lots of dead and you might be like why didn't they use mob of the dead because that would speech in Revelations now the answer to that it could be absolutely anything it could be the characters to used in it you know for whatever reasons they don't have the lightness to be able to use them anymore it was like a one-time thing for example like if you look at what was the what the hell was the first effort shadows of evil in shadows of evil they features so many celebrities in the actual DLC that they might not be able to like pay them celebrities again to reuse their faces and likeness yeah they could use the map again but they probably are doing is not the same characters in the game and from my understanding they're trying to stick to the maps that feature just the original characters so that's a win for me I can say thank God it doesn't feature transit but again if I can have it my way I would go mobile the Dead origins nack Toronto and key Toronto and probably would drop shangri-la I'm sorry I'm just not a huge fan of it shi no numa rooked an ascension and just for the sake of it even though it is a DLC that already exists in the realm of black ops 3 because you can buy the giant anyway I would actually throw in the giant then that way we've got black ops 1 we've got black ops 2 we've got all of the world war maps which I just feel is so necessary so that was the game that created ecology zombies to make it what it is today and then you know what thrown in ascension because why the hell not and I can't recall if in the revelations DLC there was actually anything to do with rocket booster packs I really paid too much attention to it but I feel like that's a really cool thing just for me personally seen as a like yoke Slayer that was like the map that absolutely made him and I'm watching my extreme he was like around a hundred and something or over and I was like holy shit this guy's a fucking beast obviously we've already got the giant DLC so and everyone's like what's the point of even talking about it so if we have to have one map back in particular that I think is such a fun map at the replayability of it was amazing and it's just really fun and just absolutely amazing because you know it beaches you by Leroy buried and two people back to the day was always like why'd you call it Leroy not his actual name that's not his name well I was actually talking to the developers at the studio and I was like what's his name and they were saying he doesn't actually have one and I was like I feel like Lyra is a good name and they were like Leroy Leroy this obviously not officially announced that that was his name but they were happy with that being his name because it just fitted the character and it made complete sense so I guess they are big eyes DLC 5 is confirmed and it will be coming out they actually announced backwards compatibility for black ops 2 on xbox I think and everyone's going crazy you're going plain and gold playing it all maps and doing all the Easter egg which is absolutely amazing but now they're really releasing the DLC so it's just meant to keep it on the actual platform on the model game on black ops 3 and the lifeline of black ops 3 is still continuing so I think it's just a massive to infinity what because we all know how good zombies is on that game so thank you very much for watching guys if you are excited make sure you leave a like rating I will definitely be playing all the maps I don't think I'm going to try and bombard you like crazy we fight 50 videos a day like it used to be back in Dave let's find this a way to do that I you guys know what's going on here if you new around it there's a lots of video on the internet search web perks hour and you know back in the day I used to look 22 videos a day on VLC launched but my computer and it that's still not fast enough for that shit so I'm not doing that again but I will catch you guys in the next video I'm looking forward to finding out when they see LCD drops I wish they would have dropped this on the day of release for when the for the DLC came out for infinite warfare but obviously they're not going to compete against each of the cell would have been a nice troll whatever so don't leave out like grains subscribe I would back

minute what is going on what is the syndicate project I'm gonna tell you right now back in 2013 I played The Sims 3 and created a series called the syndicate project the exact same that I'm doing now but the sims 4 is out now and back then I used to live at my dad's house which was just rather con for me and never had any idea that I'd have a house like out today so what I want to trying to do is recreate myself in the sims build my dad's house obviously it'll take us a while to get build up from scratch build my dad's house I could potentially build my dad my sister my stepmom girl that saw stuff in the house which would make sense like really truly sky off like me as a kid maybe but I can't bother doing that so we're gonna do is you're gonna create me in my old dad's house try and save enough money to make the new house and just see how things go so yeah this is gonna be clicked I clicked off so you can't hear any audio I will be streaming this for about 2 hours it won't be a daily fingers right now because I'm going to go into Goodwood Festival of Speed hopefully so yeah pretty much I'm just gonna try and shrimp so if you guys like the sims and want to watch it then you know what I say I'm gonna stream for two hours today but this may actually turn into like before our livestream instead because that I always get carried away with stuff but if you do like the idea of it guys that make sure you leave a like great if Sims is not for you you don't have to tune in you don't have to click the video read from that book I'm gonna try and make this a little bit of a cool

the boot size your boobs I am look my save game one I don't know what recovery name the name Cindy there you go that's safe alright I recreate myself in female version but today we have the pleasure of create myself in male version yeah so this is probably gonna like that who the hell is this guy this looks nothing like me from the get-go so I really appreciate everyone who shares the stream if

but we're gonna do it cuz my dad's house it's quite wide so we're gonna go up with a it won't be the exact scale for now but we're gonna try and create my dad's house okay we're gonna go for it because my dad's house was the first house I lived out you know I'm saying I'm so glad you do the syndicate project goes my favorite series that you didn't see me keep up the amazing work dude thank you very much Kristen when I ever go to Denmark hell yeah at large I am your friend I'm just in love you Tom you bring me happiness ah alright why are you playing this I like I love the sims absolutely love it alright let's build some walls so my dad's house he has a bit of a driveway and there's a bit of a garden down the side so it's like that thin there alright let's see if I can do a wall that's not even a full-size wall shit no on date which is a walls and empty rooms walls rooms okay my dad's is just like a it's like a thin long house my dad's alright so let's get he has a driveway so let's do let's go back a bit and he does have a small or walkway around the side but I'm gonna give him a bit of space alright so nope too far back too far in now it's cold there cuz it's a little patio down the side alright I like it life of a double a thank you very much for sponsoring as well as I own gaming thank you very much response room Justin I appreciate that a night of shame thanks very much appreciate your face all right let's go walls up right so this is gonna be my dad's house okay that's a good size cuz it's like if I split it into three real quick I might actually need to make it bigger no because there's the sleeping quarters on this side is the lounge there's a lounge and then it's like I said just got to turn on notifications other online notifications apply like guru all right okay so there's that right so my dad's house is pretty and interesting I don't know how to change my angle these these these might not be right for scales of rooms just yet but we'll see how things go my dad has a garage over here so I said well I think what we actually need to do is remove this wall and make this go over a bit more like this all right we're gonna do about oh gee all we have to do the og layout at my dad's house which is that then this comes out of it over here to make my bedroom alright and then this was the toilet this is the hallway like that you got your girl you guys will recognize it in a minute that's the doorway there oh no we need that spot door and don't worry so this is me trying to just currently making the layout of my dad's house it was like that and then there's a bathroom here I guess too wide okay if everyone's like what the hell is your doing right now I'm trying to do the layout of my dad's house all right so that's the back and then that's where the back patios are yeah this is good and then this is the kitchen it's separate it's kind of a small thin room but then this goes up to there and then there's a doorway there and that's his kitchen window and then this is the back room over here yeah so that that needs to go across like this because then this leads to his garage I don't know if you can do Garret in this game we'll have to find out and then there's a back door there and a step going down all right this is a that's a pretty good layout at my dad's house already oh shit no it's not hmm where it is yeah it has a really thin entrance there right so door so front door [Music] all right so I'm gonna put my dad's door there yeah actually has a closet there as well as odd as it is there's a closet right there with a door in it and then there's a door that got wrapped need interior doors we'll just need some cheap-ass doors simple doors yeah that's fine and he's got and they're brown so he's got a door there then it's a door oh shit wait I need to separate this room I realize I need to separate this room Tom this is great huh thank you alright I don't shit good morning that's better but so that wall doesn't need to be there for now there's a doorway thank God I learnt the tools yesterday otherwise this would be painful for you guys to watch even though it already is and then the doors are go into the carriage there and then there's a door that leads into the hallway actually know what it is it's there this one there is loads of doors here I know it looks crazy but this is just the way my dad's house is laid out oh I cap what I can't break the excel in a set with the door I'd say what say what what if I put that there yes now we can do it this is good this is good I've only got 10 grand left by the way I've got no furniture whatsoever there's a door over there there was actually a wall separating these two if I think about it correctly and does this stick out of it no it doesn't so it's actually like that because that was a small bedroom and there was a door there but this was a bit wider I feel like I need to extend this entire wall out a bit more good man building his dad's house well you got to remember guys that's where I first lived at my dad's house want it so if this is gonna be the life of Tom then we need to do old school my dad's got a brick house how's that not connected as Oh strange I don't know it's doing that well it's not that kind of brick this kind of brick like it's difficult actually but this was always like my hard work with the sin that's fine in the right kind of room was it red brick this one was that that's actually my dad's house perfect that's let's just do this I am doing the shot got to be able to do all of it by the way it's just not like me I think one of the walls isn't connected properly perfect right how we liking it how we liking it no guys I don't want to do the mother lode I'm not I'm not interested in doing the money cheat in this game whatsoever that defeats the whole purpose of me playing this game thanks seriously alright so we need to do hmm I wonder why do you wonder why I can't come shit what do I it's not let me do the whole rooms at once I did do the inside wait is this me there's a wall not connected somewhere why is this doing the outside of this wall or is it guys what is that doing that outside of that wall hmm looks good thanks guys okay so that looks good uh yeah it did the inside of this wall here I'm just drywall for now oh wait we could do walls down so that wow this is weird guys this is actually the like like this it right so you know my dad's like Donna please house this is the old layout of what my house used to look like oh so sorry guys I missed all the messages Zion gay me thank you very much responses extreme I appreciate Manuel thank you very much once again make thumbs-up from den Matt will minecraft ever return maybe but at the moment we're not right now oh wait good shout whoever just said that game options game play lifespan long thank you very much now I made my lifespan as long as possible so I can last longer alright so we now need put these up we need Windows so let's go for some windows that's a garage door but I don't see any options to do garage doors here hmm kind of windows does my dad have they're just like the big triple triple units what that really are they it's actually pretty accurate how do two of them he's got quite a few to do these individually oh there's more is more uh-oh oh not that big though it's it's that but I hate that you can put things you know in the middle this room might be a little bit too wide but no the rooms are pretty thin I could probably extend this route I could probably spend this out a bit but they're being of what it being one why it's pretty good because it's where the old grannies used to fire if you remember if you remember where for what you put two now it's only it was definitely only one like that okay that's where it's going it's going there it's going there Tom don't die I don't I've been tending not doing that was put that fits perfect in there then there's a window near the back over here near the door but you still need to place is that low was that high actually you know what wind it was actually pretty high up because it's it's a backdoor window in it oh that's good all right and then let's copy this and put this here I've only got nine grand by the way guys all right and then let's copy this one here because there's a kitchen window and that's a high one there's my bed that was a patio door there this was my bet that was my bedroom this was my office hmm that's weird I don't like that does that wonder if I really should steal a wall wonder if I should steal a wall here that's just--that's 1/2 wide that how to make it longer oh shit I can't read the chat where's my chat gun shot where have you gone everyone say hello yeah well yeah guys that's where what that's where I start watch the old granny fight seriously that's it that is it all right so this actually mmm it's ruined oh then no there's not there's not window there there's window there there's no window connecting on the users back window is this but it's a patio door and it's a double patio door oh that that is exactly what it is yeah this room's 1/2 wide I'm tempted to extend the kitchen one over but it'll make it a little bit cramped it's a skinny room because that needs to go there like that and I need to I need to bring this room over because if I trim this then that one ah but then that makes that one odd doesn't it it's can't we're we're fighting a losing battle there the way to fix is is if I brought this entire this entire room one over because then it makes this less skinny because that needs to be sort of symmetrical done it because is that windows much got are then it makes that one not symmetrical damn it what do you guys think so far is it looking good I think it is think he's looking pretty good mate it's got four carpet my dad had a pretty simple actually that's exactly what my dad had through his entire oh we were wait one key thing we're missing here this separate the kitchen and the dining room got it and then there was a little bit of their little bit the lip wall there weren't they well actually how doesn't look like that used to be like ah alright so is that all the windows oh wait no I've not even done this one I don't like that that's that where's the individual of that try playing window does it say in three stages hmm I'm probably staring it and just missing it look you're pretty good yeah well you just I don't know you just said need a roofer yeah I do need a roof right honey floors and to be honest ed the exact same floors I know mine was laminate wood no no that was exactly what it was and then and carpet in here cap it in there then we had like a weird stony tile art in here I got seven grand left by the way and I'm still building the house I'd like a weird slate you for in there and then it carried on to in here no I wouldn't let me do that then there you go drywall in there then we had the carpet in here as well and this was carpet in here and then the bathroom was like a clear that was exactly what it was and that goes in there as well Oh and then really windows are we needing any window individual

switching the meeting out for the health nice well we'll take it boys we'll take it let's try and see if we could find a 50% armor now let's get it just can't work out where he would have gone to but even if you run off in that direction what's over there literally nothing as he is he camping in the house still I don't see anywhere where he would have gone there's like there's no incentive for him to leave for anything over here this is this is the shit I confuses me when players just do the most you know there should be see a show series on YouTube players do the stupidest things like bitch where did this guy go what moving forward with or without you what was that accuracy absolutely terrible by me but we knew who's around it somewhere this guy looked a bit suspicious actually like as if he was actually fighting someone I waiting for someone unless he just saw me the entire time I hopefully no one's seen me I got a feeling someone might have been chasing him that's my only that's my only worry oh he's at him yeah that's him do you reckon I can pick him no directly sniped him did he get the kill did he get the kill oh yay did you got it this is a risky move by me right now we know where he is so that's good is there anyone on our tail anyone behind us I don't see anyone right now we have to get towards that guy I'm thinking is if I jump off the edge and run around we could probably again Oh sh I got rid of the fucking uh dammit I get a lot materials not a lot oh whoa whoa I'm a place you fucking metal that guy up there it's a guy in that tower on the edge now seen

died as that happened I was like holy shit my computer disconnects a PlayStation might disconnect my PlayStation disconnected from the PlayStation Network and I got it on the vlog and I lost my round round 80 gone I don't even know if it saved it if it even classed it is in my zombie barracks or anything like that but basically we just got that over I don't think it saved it Maps keynote at Oh earn no my round 80 run ended chama-girl wait I need time I hacked I need you to come here a second commit just as a witness I need you as a witness come here come on ladies and gentlemen you know Tom account from the vlogs he was here and was joking about turning my playstation on there's there's you in the camera so come here what happened what did did I or did I not get disconnected from PlayStation he said Tom McCallum and I quote yeah it was well funny so because I've got all night to stream I've got to try and get from round one to 100 again I know I'm not happy I don't fucking like this don't give me shit everybody everyone tweet a Playstation right now I'm going to tweet at them at PlayStation at PlayStation UK but why there you go tweet them but why so unfortunately that happened now if you want to be a genius you and you've not seen on either stream go and watch my last video and watch me go from around 1 to 80 and then in two and a half hours time you'll see that I'm going to be going from around 80 to 100 so I have to start this I have to start the rounds again trust me I'm fuming but I have to do it it has to be done because we've got to get to round 100 tonight I will not settle for any less I don't think I lost my gobble gums though which is the weird thing unless I did but I'm really sure I did not so it is an odd one but we have to go again and it's just part of the situation so we go again if you're fresh in here you're now in here for the start of a new stream I'm really sorry this was supposed to be maybe an hour long stream of me game from around 80 to 100 I probably coulda done it in an hour maybe two hours or some like that but instead oh no no no no no disconnected I could do a private much but then it won't go on the leaderboards so we just get the hope that we can do it did your place and should know my PlayStation did not shut down I repeat did not shut down did not turn off or anything that just happened so yeah we have to go again but I do have music for months the cat to be able to play so thank you to monster cat for kindly let me use their Spotify playlists in arts art shit so yet really good because

went down down because the PlayStation Network disconnected because the PlayStation Network disconnected that meant I disconnected that shit sauce that should sauce and yes I am pretty much wasted I'm over here battle ok I'm waiting for it to be don't [Music] light on ammo I could have put great power on you are correct and if I were to put create power on that would have given me more ammo for when that picks out this good out the box but I didn't want to do that [Music] hey there zombies are still spawning by the way I should probably wait from trial to get together that was a waste I've got 12 bullets left nice well I don't even get maximal then and waiting for it to be dogs who believes we can do this by the way when I pause I do have to shout out some people real quick we are

not - off I don't know what kind of music could be this playlist it could be good stuff it could be bad stuff so we'll just have to see you guys I'm just trying to get through these rounds as fast as possible at round 50 we will indeed I repeat indeed be using I think part funny to reload that will indeed be using the power vacuum as of right now I don't exactly need it on that's the max time oh that's good but we don't need it your ship I'm just gonna spam fire since I've got insta-kill got fill this rounds nearly over I say know what don't ski Pro going max ammo in the bag alright trade out the ray gun mark - or you will lose trade out the ray gun mark - otherwise you'll lose your thumb - good when you're down yeah if we go down and lose the Thunder gun that was so because in the last one so let me speak for speak proper on the last run that I did I went down and when I went down I managed to keep just two guns which was this debt with dead wire which is exactly what one Ihram and the Thunder guns but that was like the dream sell I'm for it now I've got three guns which is what we don't want I shouldn't pick smoking from the box and but it was just beyond that I did it him like an idiot so because I went ahead and begin to cut I'm actually running a bit cocky if some reason it's good it's so really rather I got so many guns alright bought because we did this now I have to be good so if I go down I do have the chance of losing the Thunder gun if I lose the Rex not a problem because we could just buy that again off the wall and you know do the pack punch system thing that we did boy if I lose the Thunder gun then we've got to try and keep using the box to get them moving again which is not so good let's keep rogue or one that has a double kill up in here this is a really powerful John by the way by eight jaws I don't have an ego scope on it right now which kind of sucks the previously was just so good for aiming at their heads and just take him a lot but you

raindrops drops a max ammo so right I mean I need to explain this because people ask me this a lot the reason why I put raindrops on is because right you can put a max ammo right and max sounds good but say you go down and you go say you go down and you go to use a gobbler machine if you go to try and like use it and you get maximal what good is that whereas if you get raindrops it gives you a max ammo a nuke a insta-kill one of everything so it's really really good plus it give you a free perk it gives you a perk ball and you use it twice so if you go down and you use gobble gum machine and that's what you get so I'm gonna just get the maximal you've automatically got map channel you've already got a fire cell you've got everything it's really rare but it's really really good the

where you're you basically pay and you get a little icon next name right now it's just a green dot but soon will be the syndicate logo it avoids you from slowmode so right now the chat you can always speak every 20 seconds so if you have it in slow mode then it's a win that's right it's not a win for you one sec fuck on this construe so get out of here get over to my spot turn to concentrate so a few of these and then I continue on talking so twitch it's called subscribing but on youtube if you subscribe like these guys are doing below if you click the subscribe button that on youtube just gives you notifications of when videos go live in subscribing is free whereas on twitch to twitch it's called subscribing and whereas if you follow them it's clicking follow follow subscribe and subscribe is follow whereas in YouTube to subscribe to someone it and support them like with money it's called sponsoring so YouTube just call it that to avoid the confusion even though it's still confusing so yes there you go spawns subscribing like on twitch is now called sponsoring on YouTube hope I can do even more because I think I did I think it did a very good job of confusing you all did you agree yes Bremer bye thank you very much hi Tom hi ever know you do men one sec and then we continue the music now this sounds like it's not to be hype as fuck hey yo appreciate all the

called Yui modern warfare Remus was a game of games I was hoping for my entire life Alec swap and it was beautiful it was amazing and it was fun and now it's become the game I'm not sure what it is the game was simple you had a gun you had a class and that was pretty much it now you've got melee weapons you've got kits for your weapons you've got goddamn DLC weapons like what actually is this now I want to say a guy exactly complaining because I love this game so anything new they add to it it's just like a continuation of my guidebook this is supposed to be an m16 and if we jump into it this does not look like an m16 it looks like an infinite warfare laser beam rifle but all I can say is let's give it a go I'm not sure if you guys saw but they dropped the beret in map pack which was the first ever DLC dropped for college it for back in the day now you think oh because this is a DLC and it's old they're just gonna release it for free because why the hell not no you are very wrong recharging like 15 goddamn quid for this thing because I'm an absolute fanboy I obviously went and downloaded it I know you shouldn't support the system but I am doing because I just looked this goddamn game plus I want to play broadcast on a play chance I wanna play co-op I want to play Creek so we're gonna jump into a game and just see how I feel about things I also just realized why the hell have I got this ginger dude as a character like I have no one for that whatsoever but look at it that that looks like me that's the default character this is what it used to look like back in the day you default simple character now you've got badass bum sky devil dog guy with a helmet goes up this and then a ginger person who kind of looks midget by leg but fuck sake well I said I told you I fucking dodge it the first game it's gonna put me into is kill house and I'm probably gonna get dominated I'm gonna go ahead and try the DLC weapons because this is all about what's owed on my team yet this is all about what's new in modern warfare remastered so if you can wish me the best of luck and hope for the best let's damn do this alright ali-a eat your goddamn AHA I don't even know if this is the way to play it Oh what the fuck is going just trying to play game of God you in a fucking player getting good a data chips it's a guy chilled on the rooftop over here I got I can't see
