Hey everyone, its Natasha of Natashaskitchen.com and today we're making a major comfort food!
It's creamy shrimp Alfredo. The sauce is so flavorful and tastes like fine dining
but it's one of the easiest dinners you'll make. Let's get right into it
start by cooking three-quarters of a pound of fettuccine noodles in salted
water according to the package instructions. Once the noodles are al
dente, drain but do not rinse. While the pasta is cooking, start on your shrimp.
Pat dry a pound of shrimp with paper towels then season with half a tsp
of salt 1/4 tsp of paprika and a quarter tsp of black pepper, then
give it a quick stir. Place a large pan over medium-high heat and add a
Tbsp of oil. Once the oil is hot, add the shrimp in a single layer and
cook about 2 minutes per side or just until cooked through. Make sure to remove your shrimp from the
pan so they don't overcook. Finally chop half of a medium onion and in the same
hot skillet, add two Tbsp of butter along with the chopped onion and
saute for about five minutes or until soft and golden. Mince one garlic clove
and add it to the pan, stirring for about a minute or until fragrant. Now the fun
part! Add 1/3 cup of white wine and I'm using a Chardonnay, it's not a lot of wine
but it adds so much amazing flavor. Cook that down until the liquid has mostly
evaporated then add two cups of cream, bring the cream to a simmer and cook
another two minutes. Next, sprinkle the top with 1/3 cup of Parmesan cheese, stir
until the cheese melts and the Alfredo sauce is smooth and it comes just to a
light simmer. Do not boil, then turn off the heat and season with salt and pepper
to taste. Add the cooked pasta and shrimp and stir
until the noodles are well coated in that creamy Alfredo sauce. Oh, you guys, my kitchen smells so good
right now and it's time for the taste test. And I love to add some fresh
parsley because it adds some beautiful color and fresh flavor to this pasta. YUM! Here we go. You know what's awesome about
this recipe, it is so easy to make and it's way less expensive than going out
and several of you have told me that this recipe is better than your favorite
Italian restaurants. All right, let's do this and a little more parsley, a little
more cheese. Mmm... I love those big juicy shrimp. Wow, that's the big bite. I think I
got this though. Okay, don't laugh, should I like cover? I probably have like sauce
everywhere! Wow! It is so good and the combination of fresh parsley, the
Parmesan cheese, the cream and that white wine, which it doesn't take a lot but it
really enhances the flavor. This is one bowl of creamy deliciousness. I hope
you guys enjoyed this recipe, if you did, give me a great big thumbs up below. Make
sure to subscribe to our YouTube channel and thanks for watching! Before I head
over to pasta heaven and eat this very ungracefully. I'm going to wolf this down,
that's what I'm going to do! Make sure you check out some of our most popular

hey everyone it's natasha natashas kitchen calm we're partnering with Tabasco to create a holiday menu and today we're making the main course I've had so many requests over the years for a good lamb recipe and this one is seriously amazing these lamb chops are seared on the skillet to create a golden garlic and herb crust that tastes fantastic and wait till you see the pan sauce you guys are going to love this recipe for the marinade combined 5 pressed garlic cloves 3 tablespoons of olive oil 2 tablespoons of parsley and 2 teaspoons of Tabasco sauce now the Tabasco adds great flavor to the lamb and it also has vinegar in it which helps to tenderize the meat now add a teaspoon of salt a teaspoon of pepper and a quarter teaspoon of dried thyme smell that marinade it is so good you'll want to use it on everything I'm using a two-pound frenched rack of lamb thoroughly dry it with a paper towel then slice it into individual lamb chops [Music] do your best to cut even slices but keep in mind the last one or two ribs are always the thickest you'll need to cook those pieces slightly longer or serve it to the folks who like their meat a little more rare transfer the chops to a nonmetal dish and then rub all over with your marinade now cover and refrigerate for at least 6 hours and up to 18 hours before cooking let your lamb chops sit at room temperature for 30 minutes heat a large heavy bottomed pan or cast-iron skillet over high heat add a tablespoon of oil and place your chops into the skillet one at a time sear the first side for three to four minutes then rotate and sear another three to four minutes or until you reach the desired doneness once they're beautifully browned remove them to a serving platter and let them rest [Music] tilt the pan and spoon out any excess oil leaving behind one to two tablespoons add half a cup of chicken stock and simmer for two minutes scraping the pan turn off the heat and add two tablespoons of softened butter one at a time swirling it in until it's well incorporated drizzle that buttery pan sauce over your warm chops and it's ready to serve Oh time for the taste test extra saucy mm-hmm Wow I really think the Tabasco is the secret ingredient here it makes the lambchops taste fantastic as it marinades it also flavors the pan sauce and gives it just a little bit of heat this recipe is so good make it and you'll impress your friends and family I hope you all enjoyed this recipe if you did give me a great big thumbs up below make sure to subscribe to our YouTube channel for more great recipes and we'll see you later big thank you - Tabasco for sponsoring this delicious recipe [Music]

homemade clam chowder is easy and such a treat it's creamy but light and so satisfying this one's loaded with tender clams silky potatoes and crunchy bacon start with some quick prep so your ingredients are ready when you need them chopped to ribs of celery and if you don't love celery finely chop them so you still get all the flavor and they disappear into the soup thinly slice two carrots into thin rings or half rings and finally dice one small onion [Music] I have six slices of bacon here that I've cut into half-inch pieces place a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat and add the bacon stirring occasionally until browned once the bacon is crispy remove it to a paper towel-lined plate keep about three tablespoons of the bacon grease in the pot and add your chopped carrots onions and celery continue cooking over medium high heat stirring occasionally for about seven to eight minutes or until softened and lightly golden sprinkle in four tablespoons of flour then stir and saute another minute stir in two cups of chicken broth and one cup of chopped clams with their juice seasoned with 1 bay leaf 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of worst ressure sauce 1/2 a teaspoon of Tabasco sauce 1/2 a teaspoon of dried thyme and 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of salt or salt to taste and a quarter teaspoon of black pepper bring the soup to a light boil while that's heating up chop the potatoes into bite-size pieces about a quarter inch thick add those to the pot then add 2 cups of milk and 1 cup of whipping cream bring everything to a boil then reduce the heat down to a simmer cover and lightly boil until the potatoes are easily pierced with a fork it can take about 20 minutes keep in mind the soup will thicken more as it cools and if it becomes too thick you can thin it out with more broth or milk it is done and I'm hungry so I'm pretty happy right now oh yes now that is a clam chowder my friends before we load up I'm gonna add some garnish so we've got our crunchy bacon that I fried up earlier and some fresh cilantro this is the surprising ingredient here but I'm telling you it is so good I discovered this after trying my favorite restaurant clam chowder and time too soon okay about big portions here let's see so creamy and it smells really good because it is good let's just say that Oh get in my belly [Music] um I'm so excited right now of course a little more garnish to make every plate super pretty and irresistible okay there we go of course your fingers won't be covered in cilantro okay that's not important right now it's so smooth and creamy and silky without needing too much cream this is quite a bit lighter than any restaurant version I've tried but it is just as satisfying this is delicious you've got those little crunchy salty bites of bacon and the cilantro adds just a little bit of freshness the clams in here are tender and flavorful the soup is really easy to make but homemade is such a treat make this and you'll be known for your clam chowder if you guys enjoyed this recipe give me a great big cilantro covered thumbs-up below make sure to subscribe to our YouTube channel and we'll see you later if you love seafood recipes check out some of our most popular reader favorites right over there and make sure to click below to subscribe and you'll never miss another one of our recipes

hey everyone it's natasha natashas kitchen calm and today I have a real treat for you it's my mom's blueberry vedette Nikki also known as pierogi we grew up eating these my mom grew up eating these this recipe has been in the family a long time and now I make them for my own kids the ingredients are really simple they're fun to make and I've got some great tips to share with you so stay tuned let's make the dough in the bowl of your mixer combine 1 cup warm water 1/3 cup of buttermilk 1/2 a tbsp of sour cream 1 large egg and a teaspoon of salt whisk those together just until well blended fit the mixer with the dough hook and add 2 cups of all-purpose flour now for exact measurements I use the scoop and scraped method mix on speed too until the flour is well incorporated then add the rest of your flour half a cup at a time I used almost exactly 4 cups of flour adding that last bit of flour just a little bit at a time until the dough is no longer sticking to the sides of the bowl once all the flour is in continue kneading for at least 15 minutes on speed - the dough should be soft and pliable infield just barely sticky to the touch dust your work surface with flour and with well floured hands divide the dough in half sprinkle the top with a little bit of flour and start rolling it out into a thin disc gears secret number 1 if the dough starts to slide around on your work surface flip it over once or twice while you're rolling it'll be much easier to work with also it's easier if you don't press too hard with your rolling pin just roll the dough now to cut out the circles you can use either a cookie cutter or any old drinking glass from the cupboard cut the circles out as closely as you can to get the most out of your dough but no worries because you'll be blending those scraps into your remaining dough to finish off the rest to assemble place the dough round in your hand with the stickier side up put half a teaspoon of sugar in the very center along with five blueberries then pinch the edges to create a tight seal and if you want them to be a little fancier use your fingers to twist and crimp the edges place your finished pierogi on a floured cutting board bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil and add 3/4 tablespoons of salt carefully place half of your pierogi into the boiling water once they float to the top let them cook another minute or two then remove them with a slotted spoon to drain cook your remaining pierogi in the same pot to serve sprinkle sugar between the layers this keeps them from sticking and makes them irresistible now you can serve these with Greek yogurt or sour cream or just eat them as is which is exactly what I'm going to do right now but be careful because those blueberries they can be hot when they first come out of the water mm-hmm you got that burst of blueberry juice with every single bite absolutely delicious Wow my kids love these too I put my baby girl in the highchair nothing but a diaper in a bit because I know blueberry juice is going to be everywhere but these are so good seriously guys and when you make a smaller batch like this they're totally enjoyable to make I hope you guys enjoyed this recipe if you did give me a thumbs up below make sure to subscribe to our YouTube channel for more great recipes and thanks for watching

hey everyone it's natasha from natashaskitchen.com Today we're making a wreath bread that has a crisp crackling crust
and a super soft center. Forming bread into a wreath is so easy and your
friends and family will be impressed. Good news, this recipe has very little
active time so you can make it in the background while you're working on your
holiday feast. First, stir together 14 ounces of warm water and half a teaspoon
of molasses. Set those aside and in a large mixing bowl combine two and a half
cups of all-purpose flour, 2 and 1/3 cups of bread flour, 2 teaspoons of salt and
one and a quarter teaspoons of instant yeast. Whisk that together then add your
water molasses mixture and stir together with a spatula just until it comes
together. If the dough still feels too sticky add more flour, one tablespoon at
a time. You'll need to knead the mixture together by hand for about four minutes.
I usually add about two to three tablespoons of extra flour. When you're
done kneading, the dough should feel soft and sticky to the touch but shouldn't
stick to clean fingertips. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it rise at
room temperature for four hours. Every hour as it rests punch down the dough
with a wet hand and fold it over onto itself a few times. Using a wet hand will
keep the dough from sticking to your hands without adding any unnecessary
flour. After the four hours of rising time, punch down the dough one last time
and pinch it in the center to divide into two pieces. Generously dust a large sheet of
parchment paper with flour. Place the first piece of dough in the center
turning to coat so it's easier to work with and use your fingers to poke a hole
in the center. Gently and evenly stretch your dough to about a 5 to 6 inch
diameter in the center and 9 to 10 inch diameter on the outside. Grab another
large sheet of parchment paper and repeat the process with the second piece
of dough. Let the rings rise at room temperature
for 30 minutes. Meanwhile preheat the oven to 450Àö F and place
a cast iron or broiler pan on one side of the bottom rack and a large
upside-down baking sheet on the center rack. Once the rings have risen, dust the
top generously with all-purpose flour. All you need is a pair of sharp kitchen
shears. Holding the scissors at a 45Àö angle, cut deep slits into the
dough about one and a half inches apart. Pull the leaves away from the ring as
you cut them. It helps to turn the entire dough ring as you slice to ensure that
you're keeping the same angle. Once all of your leaves are cut, fan them out a
bit with your hands and repeat with the second ring. All right, our oven is hot
and ready. Use a second baking sheet to help you transfer your dough. Transfer it
with the parchment paper to your hot cookie sheet and immediately add one cup
of ice cubes to the cast iron pan below, being careful not to drip on any glass
surfaces bake at 450ÀöF for 20 minutes then repeat with the
second wreath, adding more ice cubes. I'm so excited right now! It totally smells
like a bakery in my kitchen and we get to do the taste test! You know how when
you go to your favorite fancy restaurant and you get some bread that's like the
best tasting bread of your life, that's what this is! It's a true crusty French
bread! It is crunchy on the outside and so soft inside. So we're gonna break this
apart and that's the beauty of this, you can either slice it or break it. Look at
the steam! I probably should wait a little bit normally, but I am just way
too impatient. Oh man, that is soft bread! That's what I'm talking about. Okay, and
you can serve this with just butter. You know what else is really beautiful, you
can lay it out as like an edible centerpiece, you can put butter in the
center and then a dip that I'm going to show you here after we do a quick butter
taste test because I can't wait! Oh, yum yum! Actually you know what, listen
to this crunch and you will be sold. Take a look at this. Yes! I'm seriously excited
right now because this is the best bread ever! Okay, I'm gonna take a bite, big bite... mmm...
It has an unbelievably crunchy crust in the center is like marshmallow soft, this
is perfect. I don't think it gets any better than this. I'm gonna thoroughly
enjoy this, oh and the dip that I was telling you about.
So also fancy restaurant, you want to be like a fancy person. All right,
so a little bit of extra-virgin olive oil, a little glug. I like that word glug.
A little bit of balsamic vinegar and some salt and pepper and then you just kind of push your
bread around in it get all the flavors. YUM!
I love when there's a taste test number two! This is definitely a special
occasion bread but it literally took like five minutes of active time. It is
so easy. If you guys enjoyed this recipe, give me a great big thumbs up below, make

Hey everyone,  its Natasha of Natasha'skitchen.com.  Today we're making a fresh and wildly delicious avocado tuna salad.
This recipe is so easy, let's get right into it. Slice one large English cucumber
and transfer it to a large mixing bowl. Next the avocado, you can use 3 medium or
too large avocados, the more the merrier. Slice those up and add them to the bowl.
I love the avocado here because it gives the salad a healthy creaminess. Drain and
break up your tuna with a fork. Now, I'm using 15 ounces of tuna because it gives
the salad a nice amount of protein. Now peel and thinly slice a medium red onion
and add that right into your bowl. Now chop half of a small bunch of cilantro,
you should get about a quarter cup. Add that to your salad along with 2
Tbsp of fresh lemon juice and the cilantro and lemon give this salad
amazing flavor. Finally add 2 Tbsp of extra
virgin olive oil and a tsp of salt then we add some fresh black pepper. Toss it together and that's really all there is to it. Oh, it's lunchtime! Now you can serve this
for dinner as a side salad but it's also a really satisfying lunch because it's
loaded with protein from the tuna. I think it's time for a taste test. It
smells good too! YUM!
Get a little bit of everything on that fork full -  mm-hmm. The cilantro and the lemon give it so
much incredible fresh flavor and then you know it doesn't have any mayo. I'm
not against Mayo but the avocado makes the salad so creamy that you don't even
need it in this recipe. Wow! This is so easy and so delicious.

Hey everyone! It's Natasha of natashaskitchen.com. Today I'm going to show you how to measure your ingredients for
cooking. Whether it's dry ingredients or wet ingredients, I'm gonna share all of
our tips and tricks. This is super important to make sure all of your
recipes are a success. So let's do this! We start with tools of the trade,
nothing fancy, inexpensive things that you can get anywhere. So we've got our
dry ingredients, so you're gonna use this for things like flour sugar and then
also thick wet ingredients like sour cream, pretty much anything that you can
level off the top. All right and then, we've got our measuring spoons, you use
these for dry or wet ingredients, anything that calls for a spoon
measurement, and I love these because they're magnetic so they stay together.
They've got two sides so you can use one spoon for two things and they've got
this narrow side that dips into the spiced ingredients, these are awesome
I'll leave a link below. You don't have to wash all of them if you use one
because there's no annoying ring and then finally our wet ingredients
measuring cups. You're going to use these for anything that levels itself so when
you get down to here, you're gonna see a flatline. Okay, so let's get started. The
first thing, the thing that gets measured incorrectly most of the time is flour so
you'll definitely need a dry ingredients measuring cup and a spoon or a scoop. The
most important thing is that you've got a spoon your flour into the measuring
cup like so, alright and then level it off.
Boom! Easy! Never, ever just shove your measuring cup into there because it compacts the flour and you can get up to 25% too much flour. Okay, with sugar you
can dip the measuring cup right into the sugar. It doesn't matter because it's
already compacted. We level off the top, perfect measure. Now on to the brown
sugar. This one's a little bit different because a lot of recipes call for packed
brown sugar, so you're going to take your measuring cup and dunk it in here and
you're going to compact the sugar into the cup, just push it in there and the test
of whether or not you did it right is when you invert the sugar onto a plate
it'll keep its form, just like that. All right, now on to the measuring spoons. So
you can use these for things like baking powder, you can dip it right into there.
Easy spices, same thing just get it in the measuring spoon and scrape. And
vanilla, just pour it till the top. All right, now onto the liquid measuring cups.
that's these guys right here. So this kind of cup you can use for like, let's
say we have a liquidy liquid, you're will pour that in and get down to the
level of the liquid. So I want half a cup and I want to see that line right at the
half cup. All right, there we go. Now, as far as if you have some sticky
ingredients like honey, molasses, corn, syrup, anything like that, it's a good
idea to use a nonstick cooking spray and just spray the inside of your measuring
cup. You don't need a bunch, just spray it lightly and then same thing, get down to
the level of your measuring cup and watch it go in. So with that oil in
the measuring cup it makes it really easy to come right out of there. Look at
this, watch this! This is awesome! You get a lot less waste this way. My honey was a
little thicker than usual today. All right, that's pretty good. All right, so
then we're also gonna use our dry ingredients for thick ingredients like
sour cream, Mayo, peanut butter, the ingredients that don't level themselves.
You're will put that into this kind of measuring cup as well and then you can
just level off the top back of a knife, a straight edge, voila, and then finally
we're going to weigh ingredients. Some recipes call for weighed ingredients
like fruit or chocolate is usually weighed out. So you'll need a digital
kitchen scale like this one. This is our favorite. All right, so you're gonna put
your bowl right on top and then hit zero, that way you know you won't be measuring
the bowl. Eight ounces, totally okay. That's all there is to it. You're gonna
be measuring like a boss. Thanks for watching! If you enjoyed this video, give

hey everyone its Natasha Natasha Skipton comm today I'm gonna share with you how to make panna cotta it's an Italian dessert it sounds complicated but it's so easy and it's perfect for any special occasion and especially the holidays so let's get started first things first put one cup of whole milk into a medium saucepan and sprinkle the top with one packet of unflavored gelatin you're going to let that sit for a few minutes until that gelatin softens now we're going to put that over medium-low heat and stir it until the gelatin dissolves completely and your mixture is steaming make sure you don't boil the milk add in two cups of heavy whipping cream 1/2 a cup plus a tablespoon of sugar a splash of vanilla and a pinch of salt keep stirring stirring stirring until it's steaming again and then take it off the heat you're going to let that cool for about five minutes transfer your sour cream to a medium bowl I like using one with a pouring lip it makes it so much easier to serve now gradually add your warm cream while whisking also I found that if you let it rest for about 10 minutes it helps to get rid of any bubbles that formed from whisking I love how this looks in wine glasses but you can use any pretty dish you like refrigerate these for about four to six hours or until they're fully set now on to that berry sauce which is even easier than making the panna cotta start by putting one cup of fresh berries into a small saucepan stir in three tablespoons of sugar and half a tablespoon of lemon juice bring that to a low boil and continue cooking it for about four to five minutes or until its syrupy now here's the secret to having the prettiest berry sauce you've ever laid eyes on add one cup of fresh berries just stir those in and take it off the heat look at that Wow my mouth is totally watering right now once your berry sauce is at room temperature or just barely warm you can divide it evenly over the tops of your Panna cottas of course you can add a little mint or basil leaf to fancy it up I had so much fun making this but honestly I think I'm going to have even more fun eating it so let's do this taste test I love this every bite is covered with this delicious syrup YUM the panna cotta is so velvety smooth and you can kind of taste that sour cream in there it adds a great layer of flavor to this classic dessert wonderful yeah you can print the recipe with a link below please subscribe to my youtube channel if you haven't already and thanks for watching you

hey everyone it's natasha natashas kitchen calm today I'm going to share with you how to make delicious French raspberry macaroons or mocha rolls totally butchered that you see how the eyebrow went up Megara moms it's weird okay we're gonna get started this is one of the few recipes where you really have to weigh out your ingredients I know ger but it's important so we're going to get 120 grams of powdered sugar then measure out 70 grams of almond flour put both of those into the bowl of a food processor pulse it a couple times to combine and then blend it for about a minute and a half until it's like a fine flour we're going to sift those through a sieve and this is super important people's do not skip this step it's probably my least favorite part of the recipe but if you don't do it you can end up with a hollow cookie you'll have about half a tablespoon to a tablespoon of almond pieces left over just toss them in your cereal the next morning add two room-temperature egg whites to a large mixing bowl and you're going to beat those on medium speed just until they're frothy now gradually add your quarter cup of sugar then crank up the mixer to high speed and continue beating for about two-and-a-half minutes or until you have stiff glossy Peaks add all of your dry ingredients at once and we're going to use a two motion stroke so go around and through the batter around cut through the batter so that's three four five do a total of thirty five to forty complete strokes the batter should flow like lava and when you lift up the spatula you'll see a thick ribbon form transfer all of your batter into a pastry bag fitted with a round tip I'm using a really large baking sheet lined with parchment paper you can use to smaller baking sheets and just start piping them on you want to keep them about an inch apart and pipe from the center and pull up and around keep them about 3/4 inches wide because they do expand tap your baking sheet several times to release any air bubbles from the batter you can get rid of any obvious air bubbles with the toothpick now we're going to start making our raspberry powder this part's so easy it's just a quarter cup of freeze dried raspberries put into a ziploc bag crush it with a rolling pin and just until you get a fine powder now you can use the small sieve or a tea ball to scoop it out and you're going to sift that generously over the top of each macaroon cookie once that's on you're going to let these sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes and now's a great time to pre-heat your oven you're going to bake these at 300 degrees Fahrenheit for 15 minutes let's get started on that raspberry buttercream we're going to combine the raspberries sugar and a little bit of lemon juice in a small saucepan mash them up a little bit and bring them to a simmer now you're going to strain your syrup and push on the back with the spoon just to get as much of that delicious juice out as you can once your cookies are done baking slide them off that baking sheet right onto the kitchen counter you see those cute little feet that means we did it right once these cool down to room temperature they should be pretty easy to take off of the parchment paper so flip half of them over next we're going to finish up our frosting put six tablespoons of softened butter into a large mixing bowl and beat that together for about a minute until it's creamy now you're going to add that room-temperature raspberry syrup and start by beating it in on low speed just because it can cause a little bit of a splatter so hopefully you're wearing your ugly shirt and once it's incorporated you're going to beat it for about two and a half minutes until it's nice and fluffy I'm going to take a pastry bag fitted with a large round tip and just transfer all of that frosting inside be generous with your frosting you're going to pipe a big old dollop of cream on half of your cookies then you're going to put on their hats and that's it okay the moment I've been waiting for the taste test I think what I love most about these is how easily they fit right inside my mouth so let's try these wow these are amazing just the right balance of sweet and tart you've got raspberry on top of raspberry it's in the cream it's on both sides of the shell my goodness this is good I hope you guys love this recipe I'm sure you will I've got links below for the print-friendly version and please subscribe to my youtube channel and thanks for watching oh oh wait David David come here I made your favorite cookies chuckling oh there was not good that good you saw that you

Hey everyone, its Natasha of Natashaskitchen.com.  I'm gonna show you how to make a fancy, restaurant quality, filet
mignon at home. This is our go-to recipe for filet mignon. It's so juicy, flavorful
and unforgettably good. This is a simple, one pan meal that comes together in 30
minutes. So let's get started. It's smart to have everything prepped and ready to
go when you need it. The prep is easy. Start by thickly slicing one pound of
mushrooms, set those aside for later and finely dice 1 small onion. Place a
large heavy bottomed pan over medium-high heat and melt in two
Tbsp of butter and one Tbsp of oil. Once the butter is done sizzling,
add sliced mushrooms and cook for about 6 minutes or until they're softened and
most of the mushroom liquid has evaporated. Now add your diced onions and
stir for another 3 minutes or until the onions are softened. Meanwhile strip 1
Tbsp of fresh thyme leaves from their stems like so and finely chop. Also
peel and finely chop 4 garlic cloves. Once the onions are softened, add minced
garlic 1/4 tsp of salt 1/8 of a tsp of black pepper and 1
tsp of fresh thyme. Cook, stirring constantly for 2 minutes or until the
garlic is fragrant then turn off the heat and transfer the mushrooms to a
large plate. Wipe the pan clean with a wet paper towel. You'll need four beef
tenderloin steaks about 6 ounces each and ideally one and a half inches thick.
Season steaks all over with 1 tsp of salt and a quarter tsp of black
pepper. Place the same pan over medium-high heat and add 2 Tbsp
of butter and one Tbsp of oil. When the butter is hot and finished foaming,
add the seasoned steaks and sear 3 to 5 minutes per side, turning once for
medium-rare. Keep in mind, thinner steaks will take less time and
thicker steaks will take longer. Once the steaks are at your desired
doneness, remove them from the pan and put them on
the plate with the mushrooms. In the same pan add half a cup of red wine and boil
it down about three minutes or until reduced by half, scraping the bottom to
deglaze. Add one and a half cups of beef broth and boil until 2/3 cups of liquid
remains in the pan. It takes about five to seven minutes. Now stir in 1/2 cup of
cream and boil another two minutes or until the sauce is slightly thickened.
You can season the sauce with more salt and pepper if desired
then place the steaks and the mushrooms back in the pan with any accumulated
juices. Spoon some hot mushroom sauce over the steaks and as soon as they're
warmed through, take them off the heat. We've got the filet mignon, we've got the
flowers and we've got a date night in with the cameraman, who also happens to
be my husband who's patiently waiting for this. Okay, aprons off, we're gonna do
a taste test! All right and I like my steak medium-well so I'll go grab one of
the slimmer ones and lots of extra mushroom sauce. This is super good over
mashed potatoes because it serves like a gravy,
one of the best tasting gravies you'll ever try. Oh my goodness!
Did you know, filet mignon was this easy? I mean, this comes together quickly and
it has so much amazing flavor. All right, finish my mountain of mushroom sauce, I
just keep adding it on. Okay, here we go. Slice the roux, get in close because
you're gonna want to see this juiciness. Do you see that? All right, I can't bite
into that big old piece, I need something a little more bite-sized, all right there
we go. Wow! I mean, that just melts in your mouth and
pan searing it that way seals in all the natural delicious
flavors. This is so juicy and that creamy mushroom sauce acts like a gravy so this
is perfect over mashed potatoes. Then all you need is a side of asparagus and
you've got one memorable, romantic dinner. Make this for your next date night in
and it'll be a dinner to remember. If you guys like this video, give me a great big

Hey everyone it's natasha of natashaskitchen.com. I'm gonna show you the easy way to cut a whole chicken this will
save you money and you can use the leftover carcass to make the most
flavorful chicken stock all you need is a sharp knife and a whole chicken. Pat
the chicken dry with paper towels to make it easier to work with and you'll
start by cutting off the chicken legs slice only through the skin just below
the chicken breast. Now pull the leg away and pop the bone out you'll cut just
behind that bone right through the joint and it should separate easily. Repeat
with the second side keeping as much of the meat on the chicken leg as possible
when you're cutting a chicken if your knife has a lot of resistance when
you're trying to cut through you're probably hitting your bone so move your
knife around slightly until it goes through easily
keeping the chicken breast side up we're gonna remove the wings use your fingers
to feel for the joint and you're gonna cut right through that, repeat with the
second wing and it does give you a little more control if you pull up on
the wing as you're cutting to remove the chicken breast place the chicken on its
side you'll see on each side there's a fat line running down from top to bottom
the fat lines are really a roadmap for cutting the chicken use some kitchen
shears to cut right through that you're gonna snip right through the rib cage
separating the backbone from the breastbone. I usually cook with boneless
chicken breast so to debone the chicken breast slice right down the center
through the skin. Locate the breast bone in the center then cut the chicken
breast away from the bone to get a clean cut don't saw back and
forth but use long strokes and cut all the way down which should completely
debone the chicken breast. to separate the drumstick from the thigh flip it
over and cut along the fat line and you should cut right between the joints if
you feel resistance shift your knife around until it slides through easily. to
debone the thigh, locate the bone then cut the meat away from it on both sides.
get a firm grip on one end of the chicken bone and cut the bone away from
the meat with lawn careful strokes I hope you guys found this tutorial
super helpful if you did give me a great big thumbs up below and in the comments

the star ingredient, chicken. I'm using rotisserie chicken which makes this
salad so easy. You can cook the chicken breast yourself or use the well-drained
canned chicken and a pinch. So dice or shred 2 large chicken breasts and place
them into a large mixing bowl. Next, we add two large ripe avocados. Peel and pit
each avocado and slice them into bite-size pieces then add them to the
mixing bowl. Add 1 cup of cooked corn and I do think freshly cooked corn is the
best. It adds a really nice sweet pop of flavor to the salad. Add 1/4 cup of
chopped green onion or chives which makes this salad so fresh and fragrant.
I cooked 6 ounces of bacon until browned and crispy coarsely chop that up and add
it to the salad bowl. Finally, add two Tbsp of fresh
dill and now let's make that easy lemon dressing. squeeze three Tbsp of
juice from one large lemon, combine that with three Tbsp of
extra virgin olive oil one tsp of salt and 1/8 of a tsp of black
pepper. Stir that together until combined and that's all there is to it. This is
one of my favorite dressings. It smells so good! Drizzle it over your salad and
toss everything to combine. I am excited because this is lunch and I'm hungry!
What time is it? Almost 5:00, its a  late lunch, but I can't wait. All
that's left to do is the taste test so that's exactly what we're going to do. And I also like to serve the salad with
eggs hard-boiled eggs because it makes it just so satisfying. These are optional
but nice. There we go, all right, let's get a sample, a generous sample. Mm-hmm, that's delicious.
The lemon really shines in that dressing and it makes it so fresh and bright. I
love those little salty bites of bacon in there and then so much avocado with
healthy alternative to the creamy chicken salad you see normally but
definitely not lacking in flavor. You can serve it as a salad, you can make
sandwiches, put it in pitas, serve it in lettuce wraps and it also is really good
the next day so it's perfect for work or school lunch. Yeah this salad is awesome. If

hey everybody it's natasha natashas kitchen calm we're super excited to share with you this delicious carrot cake recipe it's got tons of carrots it's soft moist delicious you guys are going to love it so let's go over the really simple ingredients we start with a cup of sugar and then four eggs or large eggs and we have a cup of extra light olive oil you can also use a vegetable oil and we have 1/4 teaspoon of baking powder 1 teaspoon of baking soda 2 cups of all-purpose flour a whopping 3 cups of shredded carrots then I toasted a cup and a half of walnuts on a dry skillet and you can or don't have to add walnuts if you don't want to then for the frosting we've got one stick of unsalted butter 2 cups of powdered sugar and 16 ounces of cream cheese or 2 packages so let's get started first we're going to preheat the oven to 350 degrees and we're going to grease the sides and bottom of 2 round 9-inch cake pans and we're going to line the bottom with a parchment paper start by combining your eggs and sugar in a stand mixer and we're going to beat this together on high speed for about 3 to 5 minutes or until it's nice and thick and fluffy okay in goes the sugar and we're off okay it's been three minutes I think that's looking pretty good I'm going to put my mixer down to medium low speed and add my one cup of oil and let that mix for another minute just to get it well incorporated now we're going to combine our dry ingredients so we've got our two cups of flour and we're going to sift in the baking soda I like to sift it in because sometimes it gets clumps and that's the last thing that you want in your cake so there we go see there's tiny little clumps sift those all the way in and then add our baking powder and just whisk those together just until it's well incorporated now we're going to add this mixture into the egg mixture in fourths so we'll get the mixer back on to low speed and just start adding it in and it helps to scrape down the bowl a time or two just to get that flour well incorporated into the batter as soon as the flour is incorporated you're going to fold in the carrots with a spatula I love how much carrots go into this it just makes it a little bit less guilty okay now the batter is ready to divide so we're going to divide it evenly between the two prepared cake pans and I'm really particular about making sure they're perfect because I want to cut them in half later and make this a four layer cake so I usually weigh them on a kitchen scale to make sure that they're perfectly even so now we're going to bake these for 30 to 35 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean you want to coarsely chop your toasted walnuts half of these are going to go inside the cake and the other half is going to go on top for decoration these baked up perfectly just let those cool and a wire rack until they're at room temperature before cutting them once the cake layers are pretty much at room temperature you can get started on the frosting so we're going to combine our powdered sugar and our butter powdered sugar their butter softened butter has to be softened for this to work okay so whisk attachment and we're going to put that on about a minute just until it's creamed together now with the mixer on medium speed you're going to add the cream cheese one piece at a time now we're going to kick up the mixer the high speed and let it blend until it's completely smooth without any lumps it takes about five minutes while the frostings blending it's a great time to slice your cake layers so loosen them around the edges and then they should come right out okay and I peel back that parchment paper okay and then you're going to take a serrated knife I like this lawn one just because it goes through the cake easily so first deeply score the sides of the cake all the way around and now slice all the way through okay and you can see that cake is so moist and soft inside perfect so we're going to keep those layers together until you're ready to frost it because you don't want your cake to dry out don't want to scrape the bowl down once or twice just to make sure there's no stray cream cheese on the sides and that looks absolutely perfect so we're going to get started on assembling this delicious carrot cake so start with your first layer put that on a cake platter and then you're going to add a nice layer of cream cheese okay now we're going to sprinkle some nuts over the top and then the second layer goes on and repeat that with the rest of the layers ok we're putting out our last layer and then we're going to frost the top in size now for the last layer I always like to put a bottom side because it's nice and flat got that perfect surface for frosting okay we're going to frost the sides all the way around okay and don't even panic if you get a little bit of crumbs on the sides it really doesn't matter it just makes it look a little more rustic which my husband says is code for sloppy but we know better and also you're putting nuts on the side so that's how we're going to decorate it we're going to put nuts on the border of the cake it's such a simple decoration but it looks pretty okay and before I get too excited here you do want to clean off the plate the cake plate so otherwise you get a mess of frosting covered nuts on the bottom so just wipe it off with a paper towel nice and neat okay now we're going to just pass the nuts onto the side of the cake and there really is no easy way to do this that I found so if you have an awesome secret or how to get nuts on the side of the cake let me know but I'm just doing this with my hand okay our rustic carrot cake so you can eat it right away I like to stick it in the fridge because once the frosting firms up a little bit it's much easier to slice so this is going to go in the fridge for half an hour just because I don't want to wait any longer than that and we'll come back for the taste test hmm wow wow wow wow it's amazing perfectly moist and not overly sweet like a lot of carrot cakes are this is fantastic you guys are gonna love this you have to make it like today today I've got links below to print the recipe

Mmm, juicy chicken and mushrooms in a
creamy sauce, under melty cheese. This creamy chicken Madeira is a copycat
recipe of the most popular dish at the Cheesecake Factory. Start with 1 lb of
asparagus. Snap off the fibrous ends then fill a pot with six cups of water and
bring it to a boil. Add a Tbsp of salt and cook the asparagus for two to
three minutes or until a vibrant green and crisp tender. Remove the asparagus
from the hot water and set it aside. Let's do some quick prep with the
ingredients so everything is ready when we need it. Thickly slice 1 lb of
mushrooms then dice 1 small onion. If you dice it finely it disappears into the
sauce. Now finely minced 2 large garlic cloves
then chopped 2 Tbsp of fresh parsley. Place a large oven safe pan over
medium-high heat and melt in two Tbsp butter and 1 Tbsp of
oil add the thickly sliced mushrooms and cook for about 5 minutes or until soft.
Stir in the diced onions, cooking another 3 minutes then add minced garlic cloves,
parsley, 1/4 tsp of salt and 1/4 tsp of black pepper. Stir that and
cook another 2 minutes then remove it to a plate and wipe the skillet clean with
a wet paper towel. Slice 2 chicken breasts in half lengthwise and pound
each cutlet between plastic wrap until no more than a quarter inch thick. Season
the chicken all over with half a tsp of salt and a quarter tsp
of black pepper. Place the same pan over medium-high heat
with two Tbsp of butter and 1 Tbsp of oil. When the butter is
finished foaming, add the chicken breasts and saute three to four minutes per side
or until golden and cooked through. Transfer the chicken to the same plate
as the mushrooms in the same pan, no need to clean it. Add one and a half cups of
Madeira wine, scraping the bottom of the pan to deglaze and boil until reduced by
half it takes about 5 minutes. Now add 1 and 1/2 cups of beef broth and boil 8 to
10 minutes or until 1/4 of the liquid remains. Reduce the heat to medium, add
half a cup of whipping cream and simmer another 2 minutes or until the sauce
thickens. Taste that luscious sauce. You can add more salt and pepper if desired.
Return the chicken back to the pan, turning it to coat in the sauce, top with
the mushrooms and asparagus and sprinkle with 1 cup of mozzarella cheese. Pre-heat
your oven broiler to high heat then boil for 3 to 4 minutes or until the cheese
is melted. I am excited! Bubbly, cheesy, creamy, delicious! Now, let's
do the taste test because I cannot wait any longer.
Oh my goodness! Which piece shall we have? Oh but wait, a
little bit of parsley because garnish makes everything just a little
more beautiful and tasty. Let's add a little bit more sauce make like my piece
super saucy because that sauce is so flavorful. The chicken is so juicy. Wow! All right,
let's get some chicken and asparagus of course. This is so delicious! The wine has a
little bit of sweetness in it, oh and then that combination of sweet and
savory, cheesy - amazing! All you need to make this dinner is a plate of mashed
potatoes. I hope you guys loved this recipe, I know you will.
It tastes like fine dining at home. Thanks for joining me in my kitchen and

Hey everyone, it's natasha of Natasha's
kitchen.com.  Watch and learn how to easily butterfly lobster tails and
prepare some juicy and flavorful broiled lobster. That lemon butter sauce is
amazing! You'll need 4 lobster tails, about 5 oz each and a pair of
kitchen shears. Cut through the top of the shell, snipping through the shell and
top portion of the meat as you go. Stop at the base of the tail then flip it
over to the see-through side and crack the ribs using both thumbs down the
center. This helps to open up the shell. Remove and discard the vein if you see
one. Lift up the meat from the shell keeping it attached at the base then press
together the shell underneath and set the lobster meat back over the top and
open it up to butterfly the tails. This is a great time to pre-heat your oven to
broil on high heat while making the marinade. In a small mixing bowl combine
1 Tbsp of freshly chopped parsley and 2 pressed garlic cloves add 1 tso of Dijon mustard, 1/4
tsp of salt and a pinch of black pepper. Next, add one and 1 1/2 Tbsp of fresh lemon juice and be sure to use fresh, it makes all the
difference. Finally add 1 1/2 Tbsp
of olive oil and stir to combine. You'll fall in love with this marinade, it
tastes and smells so good! Spoon it evenly over the lobster tails
then dot the tops with 2 Tbsp of unsalted butter. Place the pan under the preheated oven
broiler and broil for 10-11 minutes or according to the lobster tail
size chart that I'll link in the notes. Finished lobster should be white in the
center and register at least 145ÀöF on an instant-read
thermometer. Transfer them to a serving platter then quickly make your butter
sauce. Pour the lobster tail drippings into a small saucepan over medium heat
add 2 Tbsp of butter and as soon as it reaches a simmer, take it off
the heat. Oh yes! I am so giddy right now!
Ohh... this sauce smells so good and to make it just a little bit fancier
for a special occasion, I do like to dress up the lobster tails with a little
bit of fresh parsley and of course lemon wedges because it's so good to squeeze a
little extra lemon juice over the top as you serve. Oh wow! Oh my goodness!
I can't believe this is my job! I'm working here people! All right and then I
like to drizzle this lemon butter sauce generously over every lobster tail
because - YUM! This adds so much amazing flavor, don't skip the sauce, it's
delicious. Okay and now the moment of truth - the
taste test. Of course we can't not do a taste test - it's Lobster! Okay, time for a
bite... Extra-sauce,
because - yes! Excuse me while I pass out.
This is so delicious! Wow! My absolute favorite way to make a lobster. You can
really taste that fresh pop of lemon juice and the sauce. I'm telling you guys,
you're gonna love this. If you enjoy this video, give me a great big thumbs up

Hey everyone, its Natasha of Natashaskitchen.com.  I'm gonna teach you how to spatchcock a chicken, this is our
favorite way to roast a whole chicken. Every part is so juicy and flavorful,
it's an easy dinner that comes together in one pan. You'll need a whole chicken
and a pair of good kitchen shears. Place the chicken breast side down with the
wings and neck facing towards you, identify the spine and use the kitchen
shears to cut through the ribs right next to the spine on both sides. Keep
that piece for later to make chicken stock. Now open up the rib cage and use a
heavy knife to score down the sternum. This will help to pop out that
breastbone and flatten the chicken. Season the inside with about half a
tsp of salt and a pinch of black pepper. Now flip the chicken over and
place it on a rimmed lined baking sheet. Using the palm of your hand push firmly
over the breastbone so the chicken lays completely flat. Use your hands to
carefully separate the skin from the meat over the breast thigh and drumstick
areas, you're going to fill those spaces with an amazing flavored butter. In a
small mixing bowl combine four Tbsp of softened unsalted butter
and one Tbsp of olive oil add one Tbsp of finely chopped fresh
parsley, then mince in two garlic cloves. Now add half a tsp of fresh lemon
zest then squeeze in one Tbsp of lemon
juice and don't add more than that or it'll be hard to combine the butter.
Finally season with a tsp of salt and a generous pinch of black pepper.
Mash that together with a fork for a couple of minutes until nearly all of
the lemon juice is incorporated. Pat the chicken dry with a paper towel so it's
easier to work with then stuff two-thirds of your flavored butter mix
under the chicken skin, make sure to get it in the breast, thigh and drumstick
areas, then spread the butter around by massaging over the top of the skin.
Roughly spread the remaining butter over the top of the chicken. The butter melts
over the chicken so there's no need for perfection here. Set the chicken aside
and this is a great time to pre-heat your oven to 425ÀöF.
Rinse and scrub two pounds of medium red potatoes and cut them into quarters. Next
prepare your 8 ounces of Brussels sprouts. Trim off the dry base and remove
any tough outer leaves. Cut the larger sprouts in half and if they're really
tiny leave them whole. Peel three medium carrots and cut them
into 1-inch pieces. Arrange all of your vegetables in a
single layer around your prepared chicken, drizzle everything with olive
oil and season generously with salt and black pepper.
Bake in the center of a preheated oven for 45 minutes or until an instant-read
thermometer registers 160ÀöF. When inserted into the
thickest part of the chicken breast. Oh yes!
Winner winner, easy chicken dinner! That's my kind of meal! All right, oh this
smells so good! Oh, look at that crisp salty skin. Wow! And
then, if you have any lemon left, I love to serve this with some fresh slices of
lemon, it just looks so beautiful, gives it a little pop of freshness and color.
And of course the vegetables and in all honesty I love the vegetables just as
much as I do the chicken. There's so much flavor there. Perfectly cooked and
especially the Brussels sprouts - my favorite. Ok, lets slice right into this and
because it lays flat like this, the chicken breast
turns out juicy and flavorful. Oh that looks juicy. Come on I'm hungry! It's not
the prettiest slice but that's what happens when you're desperate. Oh yumm, I'm
gonna cut into that juiciness. Oh, crispy! Crispy on the outside, juicy on
the inside, perfect! This is truly delicious. Wow! And I can
tell you that brown meat or the dark meat of the chicken even better. If you
like dark meat and that lemon butter under the skin and over the skin gives
the chicken so much incredible flavor, you can really taste the lemon the
parsley the garlic. YUM! The vegetables are infused with that
same flavored butter. Oh man, it just makes every bite irresistible good, yum
yum. My kids love this too, vegetables included. Mmm, this is gonna be a long
taste test, but yeah, it's just so good. The potatoes have a crisp, salty skin and
they're just creamy on the inside. Absolutely delicious! I hope you guys

Hey everyone, it's Natasha of natashaskitchen.com. We're cooking up a family favorite! These smashed potatoes are crisp
on the outside with a creamy enter and an irresistible cheesy crust. I've washed
two pounds of small potatoes and we're using a mix of red and yellow. Bring a
medium pot of water to boil and add two teaspoons of salt. Carefully add the
potatoes then reduce the heat to a low boil and cook about 25 to 30 minutes or
until the potatoes are tender and easily pierced with a fork. Drain the potatoes
and it's a good time to pre-heat your oven to 450ÀöF. Transfer
the potatoes onto a lined baking sheet evenly spaced and we're gonna mash them.
You can use either a potato masher or the smooth side of a drinking glass. Mash
them to about 1/2 inch thickness, pressing gently so you don't break the
potatoes apart. Now drizzle all over the tops with olive oil and season
generously with garlic salt and freshly cracked black pepper. Be generous with
that garlic salt if you love crisp salty potato skins,
it makes them taste like campfire potatoes. They are addictively delicious!
Bake at 450ÀöF for about 15 minutes or until the bottoms are
golden. Now quickly flip the potatoes season with more garlic salt, black
pepper and drizzle with olive oil. And again don't be shy with that garlic
salt. Back into the oven they go for 12 to 15
minutes or until the outsides are crisp and golden brown. When the potatoes are
all baked up, I'll sprinkle about 3/4 cup of Parmesan cheese over the tops and
bake another 3 minutes just to melt that cheese. Wo-hoo,  it's a good moment! We get to
do the taste test and right before serving or right when they come out of
the oven I sprinkle with some fresh parsley, give it a pretty pop of color
and flavor. There we go..., beautiful and delicious. Okay, so let's pick the
crispiest one! I love how they're like sizzling right when they come out of the
oven and they've got that golden crust, both on top and bottom. They are
fantastic so let's do this. Mm-hmm..., that's what I'm talking about!
These are so good, they've got that crisp cheesy crust and crunchy all around the
outsides. Seriously guys, these disappear so fast so I gotta go like find a corner
to eat these in because they're gonna fly off this platter. If you guys enjoyed
this recipe, give me a great big thumbs up below and let me know in a comment

hey everyone it's natasha natashas kitchen calm today we're making homemade sausage I'm sharing all my secrets tips and tricks you'll be a sausage pro in no time to start you'll need 4 pounds of really cold meat I'm using beef and pork which have been chilled in the freezer for an hour and a half we prefer a more rustic sausage so I diced 1 third of my leaner meat and transfer it to a large mixing bowl chop the rest of the meat into 2-inch pieces now a great sausage requires meat with a higher fat content so if your meat with a little lean add 6 to 12 ounces of bacon set up your meat grinder and push the larger 2 inch pieces along with the bacon through the grinder if you're using a KitchenAid attachment set it to speed for our diced and ground meats are combined and now it's time for the seasoning add 1 tablespoon of whole yellow mustard seed 3 teaspoons of salt 1 teaspoon of black pepper and half a teaspoon of mrs. dash or your favorite salt free seasoning toss that together by hand for about 30 seconds then add 1 cup of ice-cold water mixed for another 1 minute and it does get so cold so it's okay to use your Kitchen Aid and paddle attachment on speed 1 instead cover and refrigerate your sausage mixture while you prepare your casing I'm using a natural hog casing that has been well rinsed and soaking in warm 90 degrees Fahrenheit water for one hour rinse each casing all the way through with warm water set up your sausage attachment and lightly oil the tube thread one sausage casing over the tube leaving about a six inch tail hanging off the end do not tie off the end at this point because the first thing that comes through is air and it needs to escape now remove the meat from the refrigerator set the mixer to speed four and add the meat to the hopper pushing it down with the plunger and adding more as you go add the meat continually so you don't get big gaps of air in the tube but if you do you can poke the sausage casing with a sausage Bricker [Music] leave about six inches of casing on the back end to make sausage links tie up one end then pinch the sausage twist and spin to make individual links once the sausages are all formed you can tie off the back end and trim any excess casings because I had one extra-long sausage casing I want to divide that up so I'm going to show you how to do that pinch and twist a generous portion of your casing where you want the cut to be high on both sides of the sausage with kitchen string and snip in the middle [Music] I'm going to spin a few more individual sausage links and leave the other half as a coil use the sausage poker and flick the sausage about every two inches and especially where you see air bubbles this prevents it from bursting while cooking now it's ready to be baked grilled or sauteed you can refrigerate for a few days or put it in the freezer for later to bake the sausage put it in a preheated oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for one hour drain off the excess liquid flip the sausage over in boil five minutes flip the sausage again and broil another five minutes or until browned that's just a taste test I have been very patient and now I'm going to enjoy this [Music] oh come to mama I love serving this with mustard like this grainy one has so much flavor and you just can't beat a homemade sausage I'll take this over store-bought any day takes a little bit of effort but it is so worth it I love making this for the holidays and when I make it it makes a big batch which is great because it's freezer friendly I hope you guys learned a lot today and I hope you're inspired and excited to make your own homemade sausage you enjoyed this video give me a great big thumbs up below make sure to subscribe to our You Tube channel and thanks for watching [Music] need a little extra protein this week make sure you try our grilled flank steak and our juicy pork tenderloin [Music]

Hi everyone, its Natasha of Natashas kitchen.com.  I am so excited to share these cookies with you. They have a crisp
ribbon of meringue in a soft crumbly center. They are dangerously delicious. We
start by getting excited, then in the bowl of a stand mixer combine 16
Tbsp of unsalted softened butter. Next, you'll add 3 room-temperature egg
yolks. So we'll quickly separate the eggs and keep the whites for later. You'll
need that to make the meringue. Now add half a cup of sour cream and mix with
the paddle attachment on medium low speed just until combined. It won't be
smooth and that's okay. You'll need a total of two and a half cups of
all-purpose flour. Start by adding two cups to the mixing bowl. Mix on medium
low speed until the dough forms and add that last 1/2 cup just until the dough
no longer sticks to your fingertips. I usually use the full 1/2 cup. All right, that is exactly the
consistency we're looking for. Transfer the dough out onto a well
floured surface and divide it into four equal pieces. While I'm working with the cookie dough,
I like to get the meringue started so in the clean bowl of a stand mixer, fitted
with the whisk attachment add your three room-temperature egg whites. Beat those
together in high speed for one minute or until they're thick and foamy. With
the mixer on, slowly and gradually add 3/4 cup of granulated sugar. Once the
sugar is all in, continue beating on high speed for five minutes,
scraping down the bowl as needed. This is also a great time to pre-heat your oven
to 350ÀöF. All right, while that's going, dust your work
surface with flour then take one of your four pieces of cookie dough and roll it
into a log. Now, cut that log into 15 equal pieces, roll each piece between
your hands into a ball, then using a rolling pin, flatten them out to about
two inches in diameter. All right, and the meringue is finishing
up right now. You know it's ready when you pull up on the whisk and you see a
stiff peak on your meringue - just like that. Now, place a tsp of your meringue
into the center of each dough round, fold it in half and fold it in half again, no
need to pinch or seal these cookies. When they're done,
place them on their side on a parchment lined cookie sheet, keeping them about
half an inch apart. Now, you'll need a cup and a half of walnut pieces. Push two or
three pieces of walnut into the meringue of every cookie and it's so easy to make
these nut free if you need to just leave out the nuts. Now, bake these at 350ÀöF in the center of your oven for about 25 to 30 minutes or until
the edges are golden brown. Oh my goodness! My kitchen smells good, like
holiday baking, so once they're out of the oven you want to transfer them to a
wire rack so they'll cool faster because you want these to be completely room
temperature before you dust them with powdered sugar. All right, these have been
sitting in there now room temperature which means we get to do the taste test.
So we're gonna add some powdered sugar and add as little or as much as you like.
Remember the actual cookie has no sugar in it so the powdered sugar just
completes these and these complete me. And each one of these is unique because
they are handcrafted and they just look so beautiful on the Christmas cookie
platters. I got this recipe from a gal, named Tanya. She's a friend from church
and she's known for these cookies. They are scrumptious.
All right, here we go! Get the one with the most powdered sugar. The inside is
soft and crumbly and buttery and then it's got that lace of crispy meringue,
it's kind of like a shell. I mean, they're called shell cookies because this
they've got that little treasure inside of the walnut. These are darling and
delicious I! hope you guys loved this recipe! If you did, give me a great big
thumbs up below, make sure to subscribe to our YouTube channel and we'll see you
later. if you're looking for more holiday
worthy desserts, check these out right over there and click below to subscribe.

Hey everyone! Its Natasha Natashaskitchen.com. Get ready to get, excited we're sharing a healthier, juicier,
flavor-packed rice pilaf, called plov. It's an instant pot recipe so it's quick
and easy and the beef is melt-in-your-mouth tender. Once you start
the cooking, this recipe goes fast so I love to prep all of my ingredients ahead.
Peal and thickly julienne three large carrots. Now peel and dice one large
onion and it may seem like a lot of onion but seriously it disappears into
the rice once it's cooked and adds so much flavor! Now you'll need one whole
unpeeled head of garlic, cut it in half crosswise. I know it's a strange way to
cut garlic but you'll see, it's genius! I love that the instant pot has a saute
setting which means everything happens in one pot. To start cooking on high heat,
push sautee twice. Pour in four Tbsp of olive oil and when the
oil is hot add one pound of beef, cut into bite-size pieces.
Saute, stirring occasionally for about five minutes or until lightly browned
then add four Tbsp of butter and your chopped onion. Stir and saute for
about three minutes or until the onions are softened. Now stir in your julienned
carrots then add all of your seasoning. You'll need one Tbsp of salt half
a tsp of black pepper half a tsp of ground cumin 1/2 a tsp
of paprika and half a tsp of ground coriander. Stir that together and saute another
five minutes or until the carrots are softened. Meanwhile rinse and drain your
rice and once the carrots are softened spread the rice evenly over the top, do
not stir the rice in. Push your garlic cloves, cut side down into the rice. Now
pour in 3 cups of very warm or hot water and I try to pour over the garlic cloves
so I don't disturb the rice. Use the back of a wooden spatula to poke holes all
the way to the bottom of the pot, this helps to disperse flavor. While it's
cooking, push the multigrain setting or cook on manual high pressure for 30
minutes and the instant pot does the rest. While you use this time to do
important life activities. Once the 30 minutes are up, let it rest and naturally
depressurize for 10 minutes before switching to the venting position to
release the steam. Make sure the steam is fully released and the float valve is
loaded down before opening the pot. Finally, although it really doesn't take
very long in the instant pot, but we're gonna do the taste test. And it smells so good in my kitchen! This
is seriously the easiest way to make plov. The meat is just like fall apart
tender and delicious and most people will probably not even guess that that's
brown rice, it's just cooked to perfection. Delicious! So I'm gonna take
out the garlic and you can keep it in there. The cloves get so soft they're
literally like melting in your mouth so for folks who love garlic leave them in
there, just squeeze out the garlic cloves and serve the plov with them in and then
the whole pot is infused with wonderful garlic flavor. Good! I cannot wait cuz I
know how good this tastes! Are you guys as excited as I am right now?! YUM! Take a
look at this. Give it a quick stir. The rice is cooked perfectly, it's not mushy
because it's brown rice. mmm Time for the taste test. Oh my goodness!
It's so moist, loaded with flavor! Okay, and before I serve, I like to give
it a sprinkle of fresh parsley because it makes it beautiful, adds a little pop
of flavor and color. All right, here we go... get a little meat on every bite because -
YUM! hmm... This has so much flavor, absolutely
delicious. That meat just like falls apart in your
mouth - In 30 minutes. Can you guys even believe that? So good, and brown rice
takes like an hour to cook normally so this is super fast, this is a healthier
way to make plov because brown rice is healthier than white rice and it has
a little bit of nuttiness to it. All the seasonings work together so beautifully.
Mmm... It's a party in your mouth. If you enjoyed this recipe, give me a great big

Hey everyone, it's Natasha of Natashaskitchen.com. I'm going to teach you how to make an apple rose tart It is so
impressive looking and surprisingly easy to make, its crowned with a beautiful
rose pattern of sliced apples and it's perfect for company because it comes
together quickly. Pre-heat your oven to 375ÀöF and butter a
9-inch springform pan. Now, we're going to sift together our dry ingredients. You'll
need one and a half cups of all purpose flour, 1/4 cup of sugar, 2 tsp of
baking powder in a quarter tsp of salt. Dice up half a cup or 8 Tbsp
of unsalted butter and it's very important that it's cold, so straight
from the refrigerator. Add the butter to your sifted flour mixture. Using a pastry
blender, cut the butter into the flour for about one to two minutes or until
the butter is in pea-sized crumbles. Now we combine our wet ingredients. You'll
need one cold egg, well beaten with a fork, then add 1/3 cup of cold heavy
whipping cream and stir that together until well combined. Drizzle that mixture
over your flour ingredients and fold with the spatula just until it comes
together, do not over mix. You want the dough to still be crumbly. Transfer the
dough to your buttered springform pan and spread it out evenly. It's totally ok
if it's not perfect, just try to get it to the edges to prevent the apple juice
from escaping. Now peel, core and thinly slice one pound
of granny smith apples. It's about three medium apples. Thinly slicing the apples
will make it easier to arrange them in that beautiful rose pattern, so cut them
about 1/16 of an inch thick. Transfer the sliced apples to a large
mixing bowl. In a small dish stir together a quarter cup of sugar and a
tsp of cinnamon, sprinkle the cinnamon sugar evenly over your apples
and toss to combine. Arrange the slices in rings, starting with the largest ones
at the edges and working your way in overlapping the slices halfway as you go.
There should only be about a half inch space in the center left. To fill that
space, layer three of your thinnest apple slices in a long strip and roll them
together to form a little rose. Place that right in the center. Dot the top
with one and a half Tbsp of butter then place the pan over a foil
lined baking sheet to catch any stray apple juices and bake at 375ÀöF for 30 minutes. This smells good and this tart is a looker! I mean it
is stunning and impressive, but really pretty easy to make! So as soon as it's
out of the oven, you can take out the springform ring. Look at that! Oh, this is
just so elegant and beautiful, I cannot wait to cut into it and I find it works
best to use a serrated knife to cut through the apple slices so here we go.
Just carefully work through them, get myself a generous piece here and I love
how the juices from the apples just soak into that crust. This is
delicious! Look at that! Wow! It's like crumbly, buttery and soft. That
crust! I had a hard time naming this recipe because it's not a true tart, it's
not really a pie and it's not really a cake and that crust is, I guess you could
say it's the closest to a scone. Just a fluffy, buttery, soft scone... so good. Okay,
let's do this. Wow! It kind of tastes like an apple pie over
a soft crust. I love that little pop of cinnamon flavor and the sweet tart
apples over the lightly sweet crust. It's the perfect combination, my kind of
dessert. You know what else is awesome, if you're feeling lazy or just pressed for
time,  you can completely take all the apples with the cinnamon and sugar and
just pour them over the top without doing the design. It's quick easy and
will taste just as good. Make this for your next get-together and you will get
rave reviews. If you enjoyed this recipe, give me a great big thumbs up below, make
