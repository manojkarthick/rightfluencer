hi everyone this is Coco of cocoa cozy again and I'm bringing you my next audio post in fact this is my second Koko cozy audio post / design guide today I thought I would talk about the experience I had a few weeks ago when i was in new york city and i was staying at the greenwich hotel in Tribeca and I wanted to share with you some images of my time there and just talk to you about you know hotels and design inside hotels and what I really like and how some of those design tricks can be used in your own home so um I stayed at the greenwich hotel because I wanted for years to go to or least year to locanda verde which is the restaurant at the greenwich hotel and it's so popular that even as a guest I couldn't get in til 1030 and night but I did have my travel agent booked the hotel for me for two nights when I was in New York for work and it was right after Atlanta left Atlanta and then went straight to New York to go to a work party which was really fun but I had to stay at the greenwich hotel because I heard so many things about it and in fact one night a few years back my friends best of front am and her husband je and I kind of snuck around the hotel and looked at the indoor pool and we're in the the kind of lounge area for gas and it was just really cool that's kind of a cool edgy rustic kind of maybe rustic isn't quite the word it's more cool edgy and eclectic is the vibe there and I really liked it and I wanted to stay there so um needless to say I did get a room and I was told that I was upgraded to a suite and so when I walked in the door I noticed the first thing off and there are three things I want in a room a hotel room as of late and one is hardwood floors which is really hard to find two is good light which is so important and three is white bed linens well I walked into this room at the greenwich hotel and they were all there there was a long haul with these kind of medium tone wood floors that weren't shiny they seem to be kind of you know just oh no my computer is running out of juice hold on just a second while I get my charger hold on sorry back to the recording um I got my charger to work so back to the wood floors or onto the wood floors the wood floors were this gray almost unfinished looking wood and they looked fantastic and the room kind of had a cowboy friend chic look meaning it was very masculine but for some reason I found it quite appealing maybe because it was just very simple and there wasn't much to it so I walked down the long hall and and then I walked straight into the room which was supposedly sweep it was really just one room and it's New York and the room was 495 dollars a night not including taxes and all those other fees that they add in but in the room there was a great striped sofa that was right underneath the nice picture window with a great view of the tribeca streets below and then a great brick building right across the way so that that met to my criteria right there one was the wood floors and then to was a nice sunlight that was in the room and it was great i think i got there may be four o'clock in the afternoon and it was bright and it was sunny in the room and it just felt very fresh and by the way it didn't smell like anything it just smelled neutral it was just really nice so then underneath you know the window was a striped sofa that was just great if it had a kind of a classic classic curved lines to it it was a tight back sofa I think let me look at my pictures again because i am going off memory here but let me see if I can find my photos on this yeah the sofa is a tight back sofa with like two seats to to cushion see it's kind of a small little sofa with a very simple wood table in front and and it was just very simple and and I felt like it was a place where I could wake up and see this setting and not be annoyed by anything you know it was causing clutter it was just all very simple the bed and you can see on the bed at the end of the bed there i have my lou vuitton bag and my Gucci bag i was carrying like 5 million totes and i had two big pieces of luggage one was filled with cocoa cozy throws but anyways that they're my my bags into bed that the bed was kind of a big masculine chunky piece dark wood frame arched headboard headpiece very very masculine certainly not my taste necessarily but for some reason in this setting it really worked and I really loved it and the third criteria that i had about white linens there they were tada so from that point forward the room just absolutely worked for me then there was some added bells and whistles that actually you know I thought brought in an interesting style not necessarily my style but I would style that I really loved and I enjoyed staying in next to the bed there were some great brass reading lights which I thought were really worked and I thought you know there's space savers in a way but they looked good so of course I mean just as a tip view in your own home don't have much space on your bedside tables consider hiring an electrician to just put in some simple wall reading lights and something like this and brass could be kind of cool and and over in the corner of the room was a great desk writing desk with an animal print chair that was probably the most bold print in the room was the animal print chair and and I'd like the reading desk it was very small was kind of like secret it away almost it seemed like an enough but it was really bit just between the drape the the drapery panel and the wall and there was some open shelving above with some cute books and and and the best thing about this whole room was the fact that there was a map to New York that was included in the kind of guest book and it was a little map it was so cute I took it with me I'm always getting lost around New York these days even though I lived in New York for several years so it was so handy for me to have the phone map and I still have it it's someplace in one of my bags i'm going back to New York for the New York gift fair and i'm actually going to bring it with me so i really love that and just let me rewind very quickly there was a great tufted bench at the end of the bed and it had like kind of almost seemed like suiting fabric and that's what kind of made me feel like this room was kind of like boyfriend chic more masculine but really worked and there was also kind of a junkie craftsman chandelier light fixture it was made out of iron it seemed and also frosted glass and it just felt very almost craftsman and style then I think the crown jewel of the whole room really was the bathroom Oh actually remember I so there were only three things that I must have therefore for is just a great bath like a great bathroom and because you know when you're traveling you spend time getting ready to go out in your bathroom and you want it to be a nice space to be in and not something that's like cookie cutter gross or you know I'd stayed at another hotel that wasn't that nice it was supposed to be nice it was the st. Regis in Atlanta and it wasn't great ended up wall to wall carpeting and the bathroom wasn't great anyway but onto this bathroom this bathroom was fantastic it was um first of all just a full marble bath everything was covered in Marvel from the floors to the ceiling to the walls they use these great big huge marble tiles kind of field field tiles on the walls and in the walls of the bath and I thought they'd look great there was also a great marble mosaic tile on the floor i think these must have been quarter inch pieces of mosaic marble that were all in a kind of swirled a turn on the floor and it was just so pretty the cool thing about this bathroom was the corner shower there was a shower that had to I thought with two doors that were pained it was almost like leaded-glass doors but they were just paned glass you know with iron iron trim and our metal trim and the cool thing was the shower was really you could one of the sides was open to the door on the other side was just a window and it was just a great little device it almost felt like you're in a little booth when you were in the shower and the shower had a great what is it called when it comes down from the ceiling of rain rain head shower head and it was just a fantastic shower and then of course you know there were a lot of brass details in the bathtub which was a super deep bathtub I didn't take a bath there so I never got to use it but it said it like filled and like there was some sign on the on the ledge of the bathtub that said it filled in like 30 seconds or something crazy like that but it was a huge deep bathtub and then there were these great brass fixtures and just throughout the room there was a lot of brass used and the doorknobs and some of the fixtures and as you see in the the sink and the stand for the sink was also brass and so and it actually worked i'm not a huge brass or gold person but if used correctly like this in the right setting I think it's really quite lovely so that's it that's just my little tour of the greenwich hotel suite that i stayed and i don't remember the room number one night the night that we did go to locanda verde I took a.m. and JE back up to my room to show them my room and we walked down the hall and tried several doors and I couldn't remember my room number because the key was very like nondescript as most Hotel keys are so we literally went almost to every room on the floor I think I got the right floor and then finally found my door so I don't know how many people I woke up and trying to find my room but we ultimately found it but I don't know what room number this is if you find it's really the rooms cute you ever want to stay there but it was really just a great experience and and you know i think that there's some things here that you could you know if you like this kind of style that you could use in your home so i hope you enjoyed this design guide it's actually the first design guide it's the second audio post because the first audio post I just basically babbled about nothing or maybe I suppose saying hi or maybe I was trying to edit things I mean I really don't know but this design guide I hope I'm going to now turn off the audio recording and I'm going to try to edit in all the pictures to see whether I can make this interesting for you so anyway I hope you enjoyed this design guide it was a little longer I'd sudden the first ones i try to make these two think we're going on 12 minutes now so i'm going to sign off i hope you have a happy happy weekend again it's another saturday and and i will talk to you soon thank you so much for listening bye 
hi everyone this is Coco of cocoa cozy and I'm here with my next design guide this one I believe is the third the fourth or the fifth design guide I'm not sure so this one is about a an event i attended and i guess you guys all know because i talked ad nauseam about what gown i was going to wear i attended the emmy awards here in Hollywood and and I've got to say by the end of the week I was so tired of myself and trying to figure out like gowns and clothing what I would look like and I'm not a star so it really kind of doesn't matter but I was obsessed with the whole any preparation for a week so I'm thank you for bearing with me and listening to all that and as you guys know I wore the Badgley Mischka because the Carlos Miele dress the zipper broke and I end up having to be cut out of it about a half an hour before the show I mean before we left for the show so I'm so I think I'll just take you straight into what happened that day you know we all get up early in the morning on Emmy day we get our hair done and then get dressed and you know then we had a two o'clock in the afternoon cocktail party and we were all staying at the Regent Beverly Wilshire and by 2 30 p.m. we were in limos limos leaving the hotel and headed downtown to the nokia theatre to attend the Emmys the drive over was pretty uneventful um not lots of them not to substantive chatter about TV dresses make up an award show I'm very Hollywood for you guys in New York who are probably like don't they talk about anything steps into there and the answer is no we don't so so we live up we were definitely living up to the cliché of the the Los Angeles Hollywood type in the limo and then once approaching the theater you could feel the excitement in the air as you saw more limo first of all the line of limos began to paddle up because there was a security checkpoint and that all amounted to about 25 minutes of being kind of stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic wondering you know who was in the limo next to you and getting kind of nervous about it arriving at the emmys and then before we knew it our limo doe eyes flew open and and we were standing on the street and the throng of black tie clad Hollywood types elegantly pushing our way and their way into the Emmys I've got to tell you this is my fourth time at the Emmys four times I've been to the Emmys and each time you ride and you get there it is just as exciting as you can imagine and as the time before everyone is sparkling TV cameras are everywhere the muckety-mucks and the business are all around and for someone who works in Hollywood like me it is cool to see the stars I mean they're fine but it's also really I'm great to see all of your colleagues cleaned up quite nicely and I'm charging down the red carpet okay I must admit to one transgression there are no cameras allowed in the Emmy so imagine my panic as I approached security with my canon elph in hand um so in a James Bond type of move I exchange my purses purse with someone giving the girl my big sisters i'm judith leiber bag beaded bag that i purchase i borrowed from my big sis who would absolutely kill me if she knew that I gave her very expensive bag to somebody like on the drop of a dime without even thinking about it I took the other girls purse because she had this pocket that I could flip my camera into and and take it through security so I'm there I just told on myself I did sneak a camera through security and on to the red carpet at the Emmys and so therefore I'm here is the red carpet tada so the red carpet was a bit more of a zoo this year I'm I don't know why I don't know if it was because we were running late they had people yelling and screaming at us to move along no stopping move move along move into the theater and they were literally screaming so this meant that for like a few minutes you know we're all well dressed thought we look so cute but we were kind of felt like turned into a herd of cattle as we were moved along and and a little bit unceremoniously down the red part carpet and we did get a glimpse of a star here and there and got a moment to taken in and all the fans who were screaming oh I saw what's her name kelly osbourne was you know standing there I guess doing the e red carpet I'm from like some perch above I took a photo / I don't think she saw me do that and as I made my way off the red carpet and into the theater I ran straight into my good friend JD JD right out of the theater of the theater he's one of my best friends I'm always running into him like in strange locations but just at the right time so I had a quick chat with him a Hollywood air kiss and then it was up to my seat and yes I just said up the first year i went to the Emmys i sat in probably about rose seven it was surreal we were sitting right next to nominees famous actors directors producers and the heads of the biggest communication entertainment companies in the business this year I was in the low SH the loge is a loose bit more unglamorous and it's filled with the wat working Hollywood executive types who didn't get invited to be in the orchestra seats and we're all dressed up just like everybody else and we're all pretending not to be embarrassed and or envious that we were banished to the load but we all happily you know once you know we got over the shock of the shell shock of being not in the the best seats in the house we all settled in for a three-hour live show and it was still exciting the room was abuzz our seats were in kind of a weird place near the exit of the orchestra section the good seats so I saw a panoply of stars including a mr. big from Sex in the City who I never know his name but who kind of glared at me when I took his photo I think it was bad form and it was like really touristy of me to be snapping photos inside the Emmys but I did it nonetheless um so for about during two half hours you watch the show and like you do watch the show but you also get up and head to the lobby to schmooze with the rest of Hollywood and then right before last act to everyone pretty much everyone I guess except the people who are nominated for whatever award is given in the last act all jump up and make a mad dash for limousines well let me clarify that about half of the people make a mad dash or three-quarters the people make a mad dash for limousines the other quarter head straight to the Governor's Ball which is right on site and the governor's balls where all the winners and top executives producers and it actors are invited to the ball I went two out of four years so I was it for 42 years um and it's a fun party this year we were whisked off across town to another that Emmys any party at Fig &amp; Olive restaurant the party was the personification of sparkle we arrived there there was a red carpet lights cameras you entered into a pink lit tent which was on the side of the restaurant with a huge white bars the centerpiece the glowing light was key throughout the environment and came in the form of fuzzy chandeliers sputnik like looking snowflake chandeliers dangling and groups from rafters I guess and walls of votive candles floor lighting I've got to say I've attended quite a few Hollywood parties over the years and this one was a good one everyone was in a good mood I loved every minute and they had a photo booth I think there was great food there was you know great drink everyone was friendly I even asked an Emmy winner if I could touch his statue and take a picture picture and he without a blink said no problem and and then chatted about winning the Emmy we ran into stars from author and family who were really nice we um you know it was just so much fun we I'm stated the party for almost four hours before we hopped back into our limo back to the Regent Beverly Wilshire where we took more pictures of just the lobby and I think we didn't want to let the magical evening n so we tried to drag it out by by hanging around just a bit in the lobby and and then that was it and so by about one thirty in the morning um you know at that time was early Monday morning we headed up to our room and it was it was a well-designed and charming a hollywood awards night and experience to remember so i hope you enjoyed this little glimpse of the behind the scenes of the Emmys and and that's it for today's design guide hope you have a great day and by and I'll talk to you next time bye when I see you I wrote our words

hi everyone this is Coco of cocoa cozy I just wanted to introduce myself via audio post and I know a lot of you have been wondering who I am where I am what I do for a living in real life and I just thought I'd take this opportunity to introduce myself via audio i think i'm going to start this series of audio posts and occasionally come to you in this format and show you images of things that i like I'm just learning how to use the whole video photo editing and uploading to youtube and my youtube channel so you'll have to bear with me as it's going to be very rudimentary in the beginning hopefully it will get more sophisticated as time goes on but um I just wanted to say that I so appreciate all of you that read the blog and I so love hearing your feedback on all of the posts and hearing about your ideas on design you guys inspire me and I know a lot of you want to know who I am and no more about me but you know oddly enough I'm more interested in finding out about you guys but that being said I decided that I think it's it'd be great for me to get to know you just even a little better through this these audio design guides let's call them that so anyway so um that's about it for today I hope you will enjoy these audio posts I will try to keep them much more succinct although Bing brief is not really one of my strong points but i will try and and i look forward to sharing more design with you and doing some of these little design guides more often and i hope you enjoyed them and if you don't enjoy them let me know too and i'll just back to just only right and posts but i thought this would be kind of fun and also you know love to hear what you guys think of what trends you guys are seeing out there too anyway i hope you have a happy happy saturday um and happy weekend and I will be posting a regular post as well but I just wanted to say hi via my new audio video post so again happy saturday and i'll talk to you soon bye
