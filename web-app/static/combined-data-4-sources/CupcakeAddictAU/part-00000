hey guys it's Alisa welcome back to my cupcake addiction Easter is all around us and while there's nothing that I love more than chocolate at Easter time or pretty much any time today I'm gonna go a little rogue and we're gonna be making a milkshake we're gonna be making an Easter peeps milkshake you guys are going to love this to make your peeps milkshake of course you're going to need some peeps and I'm going to put my milkshake in mason jars today I've got some ice cream I've got some whipping cream and some whole milk a little glucose also known as light corn syrup some strawberry milk powder I've got some sprinkles think fun springy Easter colors a little bit of white chocolate I've got food colorings in yellow and blue and for your tools you're going to need a piping bag I've got mine fitted with a star piping tip a snaps your bag a pair of scissors and you're also going to need something to whip the cream with and a blender to mix your milkshake let's get started first up we're gonna make like a goodness or a drizzle that's gonna go down the inside of our glass so I'm just gonna take a little bit of cream pour it over my white chocolate and pop it off into the microwave just for 30-second intervals until it's really nice runny and smooth should only take about a minute while it's still melting I'm gonna add a generous amount of blue food coloring so you can see even just by sitting that on the bench for like an extra 15 20 seconds all that white chocolate melted and I've got a really nice bright blue ganache make the ganache nice and bright because it's going to be kind of contrast to the pale pink of our milkshake I'm gonna pour that into a snap seal bag and then I'm going to lay the snaps your bag down and Pat out my ganache so that it's sort of nice and flat and by doing that I'm actually able to start cooling my ganache down because I want it to be not as runny as it is when you first make it now for our peeps one of the cool things about this is I'm going to show you how to stick peeps into the actual milkshake on the inside of the jar I've seen this done with fruit but I have never seen it done with peeps before so this is where your corn syrup or your glucose comes in I'm going to break my peeps in half I'm going to take two pips and I'm going to spread them really nicely with corn syrup or glucose the easiest way to do this is actually with your finger because if you try to use a paintbrush or anything else glucose and corn syrup they tend to just get all stringy and they go everywhere so it's finger painting time you want to take that all the way up to your peeps ears and right around the outside edge so you don't have any kind of gaps around him I'm going to take my peeps now and that glucose is actually going to glue them to the inside of the mason jar so I'm making sure I've got a side with detail on it and I've got a side without I'm going to go with the side without so my peeps get all the glory and all the attention sliding them in right down to the bottom and then you want to press them right up against the glass squish your peeps in make sure the ears are nice and flat make sure everything's nice and flat against that glass now that my peeps are in place I'm going to do a ganache drizzle so I'm going to take my snap seal bag snip off quite a generous tip and we're going to drizzle just on the inside of the glass I don't want that to get on my peeps heads though so I'm going to try and keep it sort of contained particularly around this front section I'm actually going to tilt the jar so I've only done half and then I'm tilting the mason jar just so that it kind of doesn't just drip down behind them it actually does go on to that front wall kind of drizzle down nicely perfect my glass is going to go off into the fridge so that that ganache can set and my drizzle kind of gets frozen in time a little bit that one's chilling out of the fridge and now I'm gonna take my cream and I'm gonna whip it whip it good I've decided I don't just want average cream I want make cream to be colored cuz I've got a whole egg springtime you Easter vibe going on with this milkshake so I'm gonna add just a little bit of yellow food coloring and you don't need much of that in cream to make a pretty powerful statement that one you want to whip all the way through to nice stiff peaks and then we're going to pop it into our piping bag for that start if attached so for each milkshake I'm gonna take a cup of whole milk and then four really really big scoops of ice cream and my strawberry milk powder that one can go onto the milkshake maker and whizzed up until it's nice and smooth I've also taken one of my peeps and I've threaded them directly down onto a straw but because there's now keepin my straw I'm going to go with an extra strand I've picked really fun bright colored ones the straws can go in first then the milkshake make way peeps nice and thick with that milkshake turn my peep around and then on goes my cream and some of those really fun bright kind of Easter colored sprinkles there you have it we have made a peep shake this is gorgeous you've got your two little peeps inside just kind of peeping out you've got a peep on top it's all the fun colors of Easter and it tastes like strawberry milk so it's absolutely delicious if you're not already subscribed to the channel make sure you do for two new videos every week I'll leave a link down below to my Easter playlist with a ton more fun Easter ideas if you guys will excuse me I've got a peep shape to drink you

balloons black candy melts green candy or oil based food coloring toothpicks and a brownie pop mold as well as my brownie pop mold I'm also going to be baking in a 7 inch square cake tin today that I've lined with a little bit of parchment and I have the world's cutest teeny tiny mini for iPad we're going to kick it off with making our brownie mix 1 large egg 1/2 a cup of vegetable oil and 3 tablespoons of water no electric mixes here this is elbow grease I'm going to spray my brownie pop mold and then I'm just going to take about a teaspoon of my mix and put it into each mold a generous teaspoon you want each of your molds to be about two-thirds of the way full now for the Butterfinger baking bits so with these guys I wanted to make sure I had just brownie around the outside edges and then I'm literally just going to take small handfuls of the Butterfinger and I'm going to push them into the center a surprise inside our surprise inside ghost like there's so many surprises those your ghosts so now you can stir the rest of your Butterfinger baking dips through your brownie batter I use the whole bag of Butterfinger baking bits in mine but the thing I love about this is you can use all of them half of them some of them and apart from the taste it actually doesn't affect the way the recipe cooks prepared parchment-lined tin and this is a nice thick brownie mix so you will need a spatula just to smooth it off all of your remaining batter goes in there these ones are going to go off and do a moderate oven about 15 minutes you'll know they're done when you press gently on top and they spring back or a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean we're going to make our balloon bowls so I'm going to combine 10 ounces of my pumpkin spice morsels and then 10 ounces of my premier white horses just not quite a whole packet I'm adding 75 grams of shortening and that one's going to the microwave on 30-second intervals I'm going to stir well in between until they have a lovely fluid and very smooth orange pumpkin spice infused morsel mixture beautiful and silky smooth inflate eight small water balloon I don't recommend using normal balloons for this the water balloons are small the membranes super nice and tight so when you pop it away from your morsel bowls it'll pull away really quickly a larger balloon not blown up as full kind of tends to stretch and it will break your balloon bowl do not dip prematurely that is my one piece of advice to you my morsels are at optimum temperature so they do not feel at all hot to touch but they're still really really nice and fluid that's what I mean the shortening does so I've got individual pieces of parchment on little individual plates the key to not having these popping on you if to get them straight into the freezer as soon as you can so you can tilt your bold petting on what sort of a bowl you're dipping in you want to coat your balloons you can kind of roll them around a little bit and onto our parchment straight off into the freezer one at a time guys under the next one this recipe is going to make eight of these so if you only want four you can have everything and have leftover brownies once you're Brown is it baked let them completely cool in the tin and then for my large brownie I'm just going to run a knife all the way around the outside edge and because we've learned that base with parchment it should just pop out nice and clean use your hand just to support the brownie so it doesn't break we want that brownie hole and peel away the backing paper oh is the most satisfying part let that chill you can pop it in the fridge for 15 minutes or you can let it just chill out on the bench of your rooms cool enough but you don't want that to be an all warm when we go to slice out our little brownie discs a little Butterfinger ghosts look at that all eight in a row melt your remaining white morsels with 50 grams of shortening its ghosting time so a gorgeous little brownie pops already I've got them on a wire rack over some parchment and I'm going to spoon my white morsels over my goose make sure you put more on here than you think you're going to need and don't worry about any waste because we are not going to let that white morsel on the parchment go to waste give those guys a couple of good taps to smooth them out you can set those on the bench or in the fridge it doesn't matter and then we're going to use black candy melts to paint little adorable faces or super scary faces on the front of our ghost we're going to color the rest of our morsels green so I'm just going to lift up my entire piece of parchment and then I'm going to put it back into the bowl and then you want to take some of your green candy color so this is either an oil-based or a powder based color and we're going to tint our morsels a lovely green and then we're going to paint our little faces so I'm using a toothpick very complex and just a little bit of black candy melt and I'm going to paint cute kind of Casper esque ghost faces on mine the kids aren't going to want to see these too scary now these are just the surprises inside but I feel like as a standalone Halloween tree that really wasn't that hard to make these are ugly adorable let's press forward get the little graveyard scene all set up put your brownie onto a nice plate or something that's going to give it a bit of support and then I'm going to cut eight one and a half inch circles out of my brownie this is going to give you leftovers which let's face it is always the best part of baking all of those ones onto a tray you want to take a fork and you're going to put each of your little disks into the morsel and then coat them using a spoon make sure they're centered on the fork so they don't break in half and then you want to give them a couple of good taps and then place them on a tray lined with a piece of parchment and pop them off into the fridge to set with all of those remaining green morsels you want to take an offset spatula and spread them nice and thin onto a piece of parchment and then cover them with another piece of parchment that one goes off into the fridge to set as well for about five minutes once it's set you should have a really nice lovely sheet of green morsels so I'm going to heat my cookie cutter now just be careful this will get quite warm metal ones are best here give it a dry off and then I'm going to place it on top of my morsel and I'm barely even going to press it I'm just going to let the heat of the cutter melt its way through our little green morsel sheet start with your big ones here because that way you've got a little bit of space for your smaller ones which tend to be able to slip in anywhere you want to make each of the large and each of the small then pop those ones back off into the fridge before you go pulling them out because we want to make sure that they're super nice and chilled so they don't bend or break remelt any off cuts and pipe a small stalk and a few small green strands and curls on the one and a half inch circles to look like the top of a pumpkin once your balloon bowls set you can just gently sort of coax the balloon away from the top those top edges are going to be really nice and thin so we want to give them a little bit of breathing room and then we can take a toothpick and pop it pull out any of that balloon membrane make sure there's none left inside rather than eating my little skillet on the actual stove today I've decided just to fill it with a bit of boiling water because that's going to be enough just to make it hot enough to melt through what's essentially super thin chocolate so now I'm going to place it upside down just gently on the top just to neaten my edges don't apply too much pressure here your little Bowl will be fragile and that's going to be the bottom of our jack-o'-lantern so flip him over and then the same thing for the bottom which is now going to be the top something like that I know he doesn't look like a jack-o'-lantern yet but that's coming now you black candy melts and then paint a nice urn nasty little jack-o'-lantern face just on that front section don't make it too big choose your serving plate I've gone with kind of a plate but it's got quite a nice deep Ramona I'm keeping all of my elements chilled for almost the entire tier at any point because those bowls are super thin you will have a much better result if you keep everything in the fridge right up until you're putting it together and in fact up until you serve I'm going to place one of my large green disks down on each of my little serving plates back into the fridge and then I'm going to be each of these sites into the microwave for just 10 seconds they should be just melting or just softening that chocolate but the plate shouldn't feel warm because we don't want to melt the bottom of our jack-o'-lantern and now we build so this little disk is acting basically like our glue I'm going to put one of my little green brownies on top of each and then on top of each of those goes one of my little ghosts I got a little crafty with the expressions if you want you can sprinkle a couple of little candy bones into your graveyard they're an optional extra but I think they're super cute right up close to the brownie so they don't mess around with our checkered lantern now I'm going to pop on each of my jack-o'-lanterns but as I put each one on straight back in the fridge just in case you've got any residual warmth from the bottom of the plate our little surprise is all locked away inside that's adorable the moment of truth so I've got my little built jack-o'-lantern it's been in the fridge so it's super cold I've got a knife resting in some boiling hot water so it's really warm and sharp your little green morsel mixture and one of my lids it's time to cut the jack-o'-lantern in half I know little morbid bit of Halloween we can go there dry off the knife and immediately come down and you want to slice on either side of his face it should slice really easily and I'm just going to use the very very tip and I'm just going to melt through with the head of that knife finish your slice just before you hit the plate your little green morsel landing pad is actually holding the base of your jack-o'-lantern in so that when we pour kind of hold onto the base and allows our surprise dessert to flower open outwards instead of falling inwards heating in between each you want to cut five of these little sections but start with the first two so that you can get its face nice and unmarked as I melt through I can smell those pumpkin spice morsels they smell phenomenal your last one will always be your most delicate so tread carefully and if you get too nervous here you can leave that back section whole whoo alright so we're going to attach our little lid this closes everything up back up into the fridge until we're ready to serve jack and jack and jack and jack are chilling out in the fridge so i'm going to take my remaining premier white morsels and then i'm going to pour over a cup of whipping cream this one's going off into the microwave for one minute at a time stirring in between until it's super nice and smooth should only take two minutes three at the most color with red food color paste or gel silky smooth delicious red sauce I want to put this into a beaker purely for theatrical effect but I know that I'm never going to get it in that little hole so I'm gonna decant it first into a large jug and then into my beaker we got to stick with our theme Oh boil boil bubble and toil this is perfect I've got my potion ready to give my jack-o'-lantern a bath but before I do I think we're gonna have to bring in two very excited little boys they're gonna be wowed hot blood red sauce wait for it why is it cracking oh good you want to buy it mm-hmm it's amazing is it really good what do you see you have a bite 
hey guys it's Elise and welcome back to my cupcake addiction today I'm going to show you guys how to make a simple no bake chocolate raspberry tart this thing's amazing it's rich it's dark it's decadent and it is everything I love about fresh fruit for this one I've got some finely crushed chocolate sandwich cookies I never removed the cream for my sandwich cookies when I crush them because I find especially for a base the cream kind of makes it a little bit moister and helps hold everything together a little bit better I've also got some melted butter salted or unsalted it really doesn't matter I've got a little bit of whipping cream some dark chocolate and I've also got a ton of fresh raspberries I've also got a tart shell so I'm using like a 9-inch round with a removable base removable bases are definitely easier when you're working with a no-bake cookie base so your first steps going to be the base and I'm going to leave all of your measurements on the my cupcake addiction comm website so if you want to print the recipe and have all of your conversions and quantities make sure you go and check that one out I'm going to mix in my butter with my Oreos and stir it through this is a pretty typical no bake tart base it's really delicious but if you don't have enough butter and there it can be prone to crumbling so I like to make sure I've got plenty of butter and when I put it into the pan my mixture is really moist I'm going to pour my delicious butter and cookie mix into the pan and I'm going to evenly distribute it so my tart has the same amount of crust all the way through I'm never ever stingy with my crust mixtures here because there's nothing I hate more with cheesecakes with tarts with anything it's supposed to have a really nice crunchy base I hate feeling like I'm getting ripped off on the crust I always like them to be nice and thick pushing out to the sides of the pan and then I'm going to use just something with a flat base so that I can go through and really push down on that base and make sure that it's nice and compacted and really nice and even so as I'm pressing I'm sort of pushing that mix all the way up you can see I've got this really jagged top edge but it's all over the top line of my tart shell this is a trick to a nice neat tart shell I'm going to use my knife and I'm just going to cut around the top which is going to give me a nice neat edge if you happen to have any little bits full you can just neaten them up let's not waste any of our cookie base that is going straight in the middle of mo tar press it down and this tart is ready to go off into the fridge it doesn't really need to refrigerate for any amount of time before we put our Center in I'm going to pop it in there so that it can start the chilling process with my tart chillaxing in the fridge I'm going to take my dark chocolate and my cream and I'm going to make this is essentially a ganache so this is a combination of cream and chocolate I'm getting heated in the microwave on 30-second intervals if you don't have a microwave you can also boil the cream on the stove remove the boiling cream from the stove and then pop in the chocolate and stir it until the chocolate is completely melted my ganache is made and it's beautiful rich dark chocolaty and flowing and that's a two to one so it's two parts chocolate one part cream so it's quite a thick ganache I'm going to pour that over my chocolate cookie base all right I've got my gorgeous chocolate tart this is really nice just as a chocolate tart but it can be a little bit much without the beautiful sort of tart sweetness of the berries to break it up so I'm just going to push it out to the edges be careful not to push too hard because you don't want it to dislodge any of that cookie crumb until that cookie crumbs completely set it's still going to be a little bit fragile so I'm going to place this into the fridge for 10 minutes just ten minutes I don't want it to be set I just want to stop my raspberries from sinking to the bottom when I layer them on top at a 10-minute way that's probably the most time-consuming part of today's recipe which is saying something for how easy it is so now I've got my fresh raspberries and I am just going to line them up I don't want to just dump them on here I want to line them up really beautifully because my ganache is starting to set but not completely set it means my raspberries can kind of sink in just a little bit stick to that ganache so that they're not going to fall off as we start cutting the top and I can make them really nice and neat and beautiful and kind of level all the way around the top so if you've got some that are a little taller or a little shorter you can just push them down into the ganache just a little bit more making a little bit of room and in goes our last raspberry there is a little bit of work in putting them on like this but it only took me about five minutes and the effect is so incredibly worth it I'm going to put that into the fridge for an absolute minimum of two hours if you can leave it in there for three or four it's better so our base can firm up and become really really nice and stable that ganache in the middle can grow really beautiful and firm like any good type should be a my raspberries can chill out a little bit having a no-bake based tart served in a removable based tart shell makes serving incredibly easy all you need to do is pop the base of the removable base top shelf out and I always leave my tarts on the base while I'm serving your guests are going to absolutely marvel that you made this amazing five ingredient no big decadent chocolate raspberry tart in less than 30 minutes if you're not already subscribe to the my cupcake

your orange now to get stuffed full of candy oh I can do that you can do the Hat so you want to pile them up as high as you can without letting them kind of go over the outside edges because we need to stick it together right okay I think I've met my I'm impressed I'm at the peak I'm actually very impressed all right and then you take your other half smooth it off enjoy them together our better half a better half this is so smart and straight on top oh no I have too much candy to birds get oh I was like hold on okay I don't I just solve this problem I could help you alright now we have to make like the four or six little segments lines that go around the top yeah a little round hole okay did you down the arm there's no my got like yeah a little navel yeah oh is that why they're called navel orange all those horrible things cuz they have a neighbor I'm gonna make you a leaf oh yes please I'm gonna help I came here with like some of my ingredients but not all of them so I braided yours candy stash and her tools - and her equipments - I love nothing more than when I have leftover candy I'm surprised I haven't eaten at all alright oh is this my leaf that's your leaf and the little bit of the gummy should just attach it just sticking straight down on hey love it like the Real Housewives of Orange County oh yes this is my kind of orange family you need a little shake oh yes that's orange goodness right there it's covered sandwich so we have a pound cake that's been cooked in a loaf tin and we're just going to slice it like it's protocol II I'm into that I'm into that take it for the middle cuz the middle slices will be higher and then we're gonna use the end slices to fill another cake so don't use it all doesn't want a sandwich you mean we have to save cake okay I have to just a small amount I was ready to snack we'll have lunch lunch will be ready soon okay all right mom I don't want the corners okay two slices PQ two slices for me do you want the crust so enjoy the crust off I'll have the crusts on I'll be a good girl excellent so we wanted to look nice on the outside edges so I put peanut butter into a snap sealed bag you just want to cut like a fine tip off the outside edge and then we get a squiggle peanut butter kind of around outside and over the edges of our face piece of bread and while you're doing that I'm gonna mix some delicious peanut butter buttercream oh yes if you guys are looking for quantities and like buttercream recipes and things I'll leave them all on the website so check the link down below if you're actually going to make these there we go perfect so once you've done that you can take a little spatula and we're just gonna fill in the outside of peanut butter with peanut butter frosting so you've got frosting with your cake yum I wish I got this sandwich in my lunch and I kind of wish I did too make sure that your raspberry jam goes just slightly over the outside edges of your cake so that we can see it from the outside so we're ready to sandwich my redditor sandwich is so small oh it's so cute sandwiches are ready kids they're actually gonna eat this lunch and we could have done orange juice here but I thought we already had too much orange so I wanted a different color and I picked Hawaiian Punch because I figured that can be literally any color pretty much gonna be pink could be red with blue it's gonna be blue today you want to take a Hawaiian Punch or a small bottle and peel the label off try and get the label intact if you can as much as possible so peel it off but don't rip it and then I'm going to use a serrated knife and I'm going to slice through the middle be careful of your fingers once you've made you start with the serrated knife then you can just use scissors to cut all the way around once done you need to dry the inside completely thoroughly you don't want any moisture in there at all or it's going to cause streaks on the chocolate and then we're going to spoon in I'm gonna guess two tablespoons we're gonna do two coats here so it doesn't have to be too thick on the first round I'm just gonna tilt mine so you can kind of see it just sort of tilting up the sides you want to again pay particular attention to these top edges you need those to be just a little bit thicker because there were it's gonna crack when you pull it apart if anywhere can give a little shake tip tip shake tip tip shake it's gonna feel like you have tips like most of that chocolate out but we get it on the card so you want that you want it to be pretty nice and thin you put them in the fridge yes we shall yes Michelle so once you're set you want to just put in more chocolate drag it up the sides with a spoon and reset it again put that one like upside down onto a piece of parchment because that way the chocolate will kind of go down to the bits that we want thicker and if I keep pulling in the bit that we don't need any more chocolate in and now we chant oh that's sure there's no crumb coat that's just chill he looks as in I'm chilling she's like chill down once you're happy that your little bottles are set really really well set that you have yours is really really well set very happy this is my bottle I'm very happy with my bottle now we want to take the smallest sort of finest scissors you can find and you want to make a nick at a relatively thick point in the bottle and then you can just peel it back oh oh it's like opening a present try to apply even pressure as you're peeling it off so that you're not putting any pressure on one particular side at about there I'm gonna take my lid off and then I'm gonna pop that one out just by pressing the base Wow it's on the top of our bottle ape your bottle cracks during stress melt a little bit of extra candy melt just use it like a glue and stick it back together particularly if it's cracked underneath where the label goes cuz we're gonna stick a label over that piece anyway just oh oh that was fun that I am going to start slicing the remains of our pound cake so I'm gonna slice it into about the same thickness slices that we used for a little key bnj sandwiches you want to cut some circles out of that yes so the circle cutter that we've used is about this same size that goes kind of inside maybe a little smaller we can put frosting around and then we've got our chocolate frosting in a snap seal bag and I'm just gonna snip off a bit of a thick chunky tip to fashion a piping bag I'm gonna put a little bit of frosting in the bottom jump into yours as well yes please the bottom of both of our so that everything sticks together alright in goes our little cake circles press them down and again just be careful not to apply too much pressure to any of your thin spots and then more frosty now with this layer try and just keep it slightly unloading a lot oh that's a cute little dick more frosting more cake this smells so good now before you throw away all of you mess make sure that you keep the little ring thing and the lid I'm going to glue those together using a little bit of our leftover blue dip it in and join it up I'm glad you called it a ring thing I couldn't work out what to call it I think that's its official name something like that now we're gonna use the frypan technique like we did with orange I'm not going to touch the bottom half because it's got frosting in it and it's pretty flat anyway I'm just going to do the top half that I could hold those little lid the frosting should hold the cake in place there won't too much if there's like a little gap or anything because we're going to stick a label on top anyways alright with your label you want to try and meet it up as close as you can but pick the good side because every cake everything pretty much always has a good side and a bad side but the good side forward with my good size make that side least fingerprints I like that so I'm going to take just a little bit of my blue chocolate and just so you can kind of position the label in place and then once you're happy with you overlap just paint a little chocolate up the side and then finally you want just a little bit of that blue chocolate on the inside of the lid not too much am I going to use that stick the lid on a bottle make sure that whose Evers getting these knows that obviously the lid and the plastic wrapper are not edible we made a cake isn't it cute so chips I mean they're a staple in my lunch box sounds like celery was more eyelid chips did you did you get chips as a kid no I got chocolate you got chocolate chips chocolate this is kind of both this is chips made out of Charlie ass ah this is chocolate chips so we're going to make traditional of crisps but we're gonna make them out of white chocolate and a yellow chocolate with a little bit of sanding sugar so you want to take a piece of parchment and just take like a teaspoon a live tea spoon place it on the parchment and make like a like an oval kind of a shape think a chip that's flat think of a trip think of a chip channel you're in a chip maker okay I will just do a couple of little sprinkles of my yellow sanding sugar which is our salt and then you just want to slide your little parchment pieces into one of your little tube rolls you want a ton of these like a ton we're going to make a packet of chips you can do some long ways you can do some sideways pop them on a tray and into the fridge to set make as many or as few of those if you want and I find accenting them with an actual chip packet maybe what a little smaller than this is perfect to kind of get that school lunch look complete yeah to the fridge so out of the fridge all you need to do is peel oh yes what do you think so beautiful so beautiful you can change up the colors for different flavors kind of something around a yellow works really well look at chips it looks great perfect Elise I think we just caked a lunch I think we caked the heck out of a lunch is there a better way to go back to

hey I'm Elise droid and welcome back to my cupcake addiction where today we're cake poppin trolls to make your troll cake pops you're going to need white candy melts or melted white chocolate I'm using chocolate cake pop dough I'll link to the recipe down below you'll need oil based food coloring I've got pink and blue black candy melts M&amp;Ms Hershey's Kisses snaps your bags some toothpicks and of course cake pop sticks I like to dress my cake pops up with decorative straws so I'm going to use some of those and if you do want an optional extra here that makes the hair a little bit easier at a bit more troll-like try some cotton candy or fairy floss to make your cake pop though you want to take crumbled chocolate cake and I like to use ganache which is essentially a mixture of cream and chocolate add the two together and then mix them through kneading until you get basically a really delicious truffle each chocolate dough let that chill in the fridge for about 30 minutes before you try to use it once your dough has chilled in the fridge it'll be quite firm I'm just gonna cut mine to get the shape started always easier to roll and work with when it's chilled I feel like this is almost the shape that I will hunt I could eat cake pop dough like this it is incredibly delicious start with a ball and then you can just kind of squish it out and just taper it on either side to get that bubbly overly shape I don't want to say they have football like heads but they have football like heads something like this guy like an egg I meet up with those ones back off into the fridge for about ten minutes you don't want them super cold but you do want them chilling out our trolls are chilling out I just use white candy melts and color them with a little pink and a little blue because I want different shades of pink and I didn't want to have to get a ton of different colors so I'm gonna start super light and then more and more color as I get to the details on each of my trolls to get those variations of pink and blue M&amp;Ms you got to cut them in half you're probably going to break a few you have to eat those ones it's tough is there any safe way to cut an M&amp;M oh that is perfect that never happens all right I'm the M&amp;M cutting master can i replicate that perfect cut where is it Shane it was a real shame sneaking up to cut a few ate a couple cut a few but you need two halves of an M&amp;M and then I'm going to take them dip them into a tiny bit of chocolate and pop them in the sides of my cake pop balls to make troll ears they kind of have those cute little sticky areas by the way these are the only kind of trolls that we should have on the internet just saying once you put on your little ears in just give them their own personal space on the parchment trolls like personal space thumb trolls and then I'm going to take a cake pop stick I'm going to dip it about a centimeter into my candy melts and push it up into my trolls head this is a good opportunity to put your little decorative straws on so I like to slide it up the cake pop stick while my little seals are still wet and that way the chocolate seal will have fix my straw in place those guards go off into the fridge for about 20 minutes you want them to be firm to touch but not rock-hard before we dip the to cold or crack then I'll cold enough they'll fall off so 20 minutes is about perfect our little trolls are set I've got a little cake pop stand that I just made using a polystyrene block I actually showed you guys how to make this on Facebook live so if you don't follow me there there are tons of just fun little things that I do live as I'm making them in preparation for these videos I will leave a link down below I printed out this pattern and this pattern on a little bit of sticky paper and then just stuck it onto a polystyrene block that I actually left wrapped in plastic so I'll rip that sticky paper off when I'm done I don't use it something else multiple uses so I've got my little block ready to dry my little cake pops I have made two different colors of my candy melts so I want my blue guy branch to have a blue straw a dip I'm gonna tip a dip in tip and then I'm just going to pull any excess off and give them a nice little tap dip dip and tap particularly tap so that the ears are facing upwards just because that way you'll get a really nice definition between little trolls ears and the head it's going to run my finger around just to get a nice neat finish and then off into my cake pops down to set poppy will be pink of course dip tip and tap and continue until all of your trolls are dipped tipped and tapped and then we'll decorate I decided last minute to add in a little bit of like an aqua ET le green color because Harper has rainbow hair so of course she's gonna be my favorite troll because I love a good rainbow so I'm just adding a third color into the mix which you guys can use or not use make whichever of the little troll characters you like make your favorites I'm going to show you a bit of a different hair technique for Harper to that I think you guys are really gonna like so for my pink of my blue I'm gonna add a fair bit more of that candy coloring to my white candy melts to make a super dark pink which is going to be for Poppy's hair and then I added a fair bit more of the blue candy coloring and also a tiny bit of that black candy melt melt like three or four melts and just add it in to eyeb you kind of want like this dark blue grey color I played with a couple of different ways to get hair on your trolls and I'm actually going to show you two but the one that's the longest lasting and that's not going to melt is a kiss I know we're kissing our trolls we have a Hershey's kiss so I'm going to take a little bit of that darker pink put a little dollop on the back of one of my Hershey's it kind of just looks delicious and I'm gonna put that on top of poppy one of my blue ones on top of branch and Harper stays bold for now anyway she gets the best hair it just takes longer to come through good things are worth waiting for I'm gonna put my darker colored candy melts into a snap seal bag and snip off a really fine tip and then is going to code over the top of my her she's in little sort of lines you want this to look like the texture defective hair but it's actually going to be a solid block of delicious Hershey's chocolate on the inside branch gets kind of a normal masculine hair line a poppy gets a fringe cuz she's a little more stylish I also used the darker colorings to put our noses and mouths and I used a combination of leftover white candy melts a little of those pink and blue candy melts and the black to add on the eye details just using a toothpick or the end of a cake pop stick do the same with Harper but she wants one green eye and one pink eye not sure why that is I'll see the movie and I'll find out finally as an optional extra Poppy's kind of stylish I decided to add just a little bit of the green as a bit of a flower crown with some little blue flowers but you guys can decide which of the scenes from the movie you liked most and how you want to dress your little trolls up I've sized up some templates and I'll leave a link to those down below just cut around them and then attach them to your straws or cake pop sticks with a little bit of tape to make the bodies Harper's hair is going to be candy floss we call it fairy floss in Australia because they say that it's thin enough that fairies can use it as dental floss which i think is kind of cute I bought prepackaged rainbow fairy floss and you want to do this right before you're about to serve your little cake pops take the fairy floss and try to touch as little as possible and find a bit that has all four colors of the rainbow put a little bit of a green candy melt on her head pull them together to resemble troll hair and stick them straight down onto the candy mouth and then just Hooser zips your bag to go around the outside edges so that you're kind of joining the hair and Harper's head together so it doesn't look so stuck on those your three adorable trolls cake pops I'm in love with the candy floss hair I know it's a little much but I like a little much I hope you guys enjoyed today's video if you're not already subscribed to the channel make sure you do for new videos

hey everyone its Alisa welcome back to my cupcake addiction if you've been following the channel you would have seen that I've teamed up with Starbucks this week and earlier in the week bought you this amazing deconstructed tiramisu recipe which was the perfect partner to your cup of coffee today I'm showing you how to personalize your everyday cup of coffee for those days but you want a little something sweet without all the trouble of having to make dessert I'm going to show you how to make personalized flavored coffee spoons that you can keep on hand and used to really sweeten up that morning cup of coffee in the flavors that you enjoy best without having to sacrifice on taste or quality the flavors that we're going to be making as part of today's video and there are a ton i've got dark chocolate raspberry there's cinnamon there's going to be chopped mint french vanilla there's maca choker and it's going to be salted caramel so if I haven't got one of your favorites in there I am sorry but these are pretty much all of my favorites let's get started I'm going to start by brewing my coffee because I use the French press method which needs a little bit of time to infuse so I've picked the Pike Place roast it's a really nice medium bodied coffee it's one that I can kind of drink at any time of the day and I always like to grind my own beans so I buy the whole beans and then I grind them fresh because in my opinion fresh ground coffee just tastes that little bit better I'm going to make this up according to the package directions maybe a little stronger and then I'm going to set it off to the side so it can infuse about 10 minutes or so while I get started on all of my spoons you definitely need chocolate either dark or white or both if you're making a variety but because we have so many ingredients I'm going to leave down below what ingredients you need for each different flavoured spoon that way if you only want to make french vanilla you only need to pick up those ingredients or if you only want to make cinnamon sugar again you don't need to go on buy everything you see here first up we're going to melt both of our chocolates so I'm just going to pop them in the microwave on 30-second intervals stirring in between you can also use a double boiler if you don't have a microwave at home our first flavor today the classic french vanilla if I was going to make one that I was going to have every morning it would be french vanilla so I'm going to take a little spoon of the white chocolate and I'm really just keeping it sort of inside the realms of my little spoons and then I've got some really good quality vanilla bean paste you can scrape out your own vanilla beans if you want but this vanilla bean paste is essentially the same thing and it tastes amazing it's super high quality and it saves you a couple of steps along the way so I'm just going to take some of my vanilla bean paste and this packs a pretty hefty punch but I generally like a lot of vanilla in my coffees so I'm just making kind of like a little swirl I want to distribute it through all of that white chocolate so that as the chocolate melts I gradually get a little bit more and a little bit more of that vanilla that one needs to completely set so you can pop it in the fridge if you like you can do these in bulk but let that completely set before you dip so for this one I also found these little tiny sugar flowers and there is actually like a little lump of sugar that dissolves in your coffee but they look so adorable so I'm going to use those to decorate I'm gonna take my spoon now and I'm gonna dunk it into my white chocolate coating it completely let any excess kind of drip away and because I don't want to miss out on the handle or any possible extra white chocolate I'm just gonna just drizzle a little bit just along kind of dressing that handle a little bit before this has a chance to set I'm going back into my vanilla because you can't have too much vanilla in french vanilla and I'm gonna create almost like a little bouquet stem out of vanilla we feel like I'm doing latte art I'm a true barista and then on goes a couple of my little flowers and that is french vanilla one of my favorites and like I said if I was going to have an everyday of this would be it for my next flavor which is salted caramel I've picked my favorite type of caramel chew the Jersey caramel I'm not going to use a caramel syrup here because that's not going to stay on the spoon and it's not going to be able to sort of hold its shape microwave them for 10 seconds no longer just to soften them and then you're literally just going to press them onto the spoon using a little bit of white chocolate - effects now because I want to add salt to this I will mention here do not use table salt you need to use sea salt I'm using pink Himalayan sea salt because it's my favorite and if you can get the little flakes they're a little bit cuter than just the regular ground stuff so I'm just going to get my spoon and I'm just going to just run it along and make kind of a few little stripes and then ah not too generous sprinkling of the sea salt we just want the bare hint that's your salted caramel copy spoon we're ready to go these ones are my favorite these are a sometimes spoon but they're so cute cinnamon sugar among one of my favorite flavors but they're topped with teeny-tiny little doughnuts which makes them utterly adorable so I've got about a third of a cup of my white chocolate you'll notice I did my two white ones first and now I'm going to add two teaspoons of cinnamon sugar into my chocolate I'm also going to add in just a tiny little bit gonna use a toothpick I'm going to use such a small amount a tiny little bit of my dark chocolate and that is just going to help with the color to give us kind of a more dirty looking color when we make our little donuts and stir that all around mmm cinnamon sugar and white chocolate does it get any better this one here I'm just going to take again a little spoonful of my cinnamon sugar white chocolate and then being prepared to make a decent amount of mess I'm gonna coat that in more cinnamon sugar that one needs to completely set and we'll get on to making our little donuts beer donuts I'm going to use a snap steel bag and just pop a little bit of our cinnamon sugar chocolate in there snip off a tiny little tip and then we're going to pipe just some little rings depending on how quick your pipe you might need to do this at the halfway mark but I'm just going to sprinkle yet more cinnamon sugar on top of all of those little Donuts before that chocolate dries and then we're going to let those set either at room temperature in the fridge once your little donuts are set you can peel them off the backing paper and then I'm just going to use a little spoon or a knife or whatever you like and I'm just going to put a little bit of this pink frosting stick it all over because it's kind of hard to define the edges of the donor and straight away add your sprinkles or you can dip it straight down in the sprinkles because we've gone over the whole top you'll need to redefine your little donut hole by just pressing a toothpick through the center one tiny donut sprinkle ready to go and it's adorable so I don't add sprinkles it done and we need to make this guy a little bit prettier because it's kind of a little bit same theme at the moment so I'm gonna take my cinnamon white chocolate and again I'm just going to swirl from side to side which is also going to give doughnuts something to stick to again coming right up the handle and then I'm going to grab one little donut and another little donut just kind of like hanging out sort of resting on top then we'll clean it up again just using a toothpick around that bottom edge donut fans eat your heart out if somebody gave this to me when I arrived at their house with a cup of coffee I would die this is the cutest I think the cutest spoon by far off over to the side to set next up dark chocolate raspberry a fantastic combination and goes perfectly with coffee so again we're going to start with a nice little generous dollop of the dark chocolate this time and make sure you're using good quality dark chocolate here because it really will have an impact in the flavor of your coffee you're already using great coffee you want to be using the best ingredients to personalize it I'm using freeze-dried raspberries because they pack a really powerful flavor punch we're going to let that one set and then we'll decorate again with the drizzle decoration here because I want to be able to see some of that red poking through but under some of the delicious dark chocolate and then to finish off just a little more of my raspberry so I've got a little underneath and a little on top and a little bit sort of poking through those beautiful dark chocolate stripes and again just cleaning up my edges and sides using that toothpick so we know French vanilla is my go-to in the vanilla family for flavored coffees but chopped mint has to be my kind of decadent indulgent I'm gonna say my nighttime coffee treat it's one of my favorite flavor combos so a little bit of dark chocolate or a lot of dark chocolate again just dollops into the center of our spoon even it off and we're going to let that completely set now while that one's setting I've taken a little piece of parchment and cut it to like I guess a larger sized version of the top of my spoon you want to cut a pattern I'm gonna do little leaves because mint and leaves and mint leaves any pattern you like you could do an initial here you could do a little love heart so this is what my little pattern looks like and that's all ready for when I want to decorate I'm using green sprinkles or you think use a green sanding sugar but I thought green for mint and I've got a really good quality peppermint oil or you could use a peppermint extract that's going to compliment my coffee beautifully now this guy gets a little bit tricky so I'm going to use my toothpick and I'm going to bore out a little center hole this is going to be where we're going to put our peppermint essence in the hardest part is getting the peppermint essence in there I'm going to use my tiny spoon again and I'm just going to fill that little hole so it's really not very big at all because you don't need a lot when it comes to peppermint to make a really big impact for little drops of peppermint in there and then I'm going to seal it up with a little bit more chocolate just blobbed on top let that one set and then we'll do coming back get your little template ready and then you're going to take this spoon and dip it completely in and then while that chocolates still wet you're going to take your little template and place it on the chocolate kind of letting that parchment paper stick to your spoon and then sprinkle on your green sprinkles and let that entire spoon completely set before removing the template otherwise your chocolates going to turn into a mess but if you let that set your chocolate will be nice and neat and you'll have these beautiful little leaf shapes already imprinted on there peeling away our parchment for the big reveal just carefully and look at that three little green mint leaves on our delicious peppermint infused coffee spoon our final flavor of the day is rich mocha this is for when you want to take your coffee a little bit more on the chocolate side of things which let's face it there's nothing wrong with that so I'm going to take again dark chocolate and I'm gonna place it nice generous dollop onto my spoon and we're gonna let that set once you're happy that your little chocolate I guess your little mound has set dip in and again come up the side let any excess drip off not too much excess we want this one chocolatey and then I'm going to be kind of targeted about the way that I kind of stick these on I want it to look a little bit like the chocolate chip cookie and then it's I mean it's not just a big massive mess I love this one because it gives you the combination of dark chocolate and milk chocolate and that is your little choco maca spoon a great combination of darker milk chocolates to really complement your freshly brewed coffee those are six different amazingly flavored coffee spoons and now that my coffee is brewed I am going to plunge and I think that I've earned a bit of a relax my coffee is brewed and all the hard works done so let's see these babies in action in goes the coffee I'm in kind of a maka type mood and stir as that chocolate infuses into that delicious Starbucks coffee what you're going to end up with is not just any maca this is a homemade maca that's used the finest ingredients and you can enjoy this in the comfort of your own home I always like to keep an eye on my spoon because there's this certain point about now when most of it's in the coffee but there's still a little bit left on there for me it's kind of my treat this is just one of many ways you can personalize your favorite Starbucks blend if you want to head to Starbucks calm forward-slash at home you can check out a ton of other really cool ideas for ways you can personalize and pair with your favorite coffee blends 
hey guys it's Elise and welcome back to my cupcake addiction this year Easter is tricking us all and it's falling in March instead of April so I thought I had tons of time to come up with some fun ideas when really it's just around the corner I saw the other day on Pinterest these string eggs which I've never seen before and I thought they were so beautiful wouldn't it be fun to do a fully edible version so I'm going to show you how to make these lacy kind of filigree looking eggs out of candy melts and we're going to stuff them with candy because there's no such thing as too much candy especially at Easter time the things that you're going to need I'm using candy melts I'm doing pink today but you can see I've made a whole different range of colors here I've also got an easter egg mold so it doesn't really matter if you're using a hard plastic one I've got an individual I've got some of the more flexible plastics you can use any type of Easter egg mold if you can't find the way you are check online because they're available year-round I've also got a ziploc bag and a pair of scissors and essentially that's it depending on what you want to stuff your Easter eggs with you might want to have some additional candy so I've got some mini M&amp;Ms and some little solid Easter eggs let's get started so I've put my candy melts into my ziploc bag you can use a piping bag here too but it's kind of messy and it's nice to just be able to check the ziplock bag away at the end I'm going to just cut a nice little fine piping tip and don't go too crazy fine here because if you go too fine all of your little bits of lace and filigree will break so you kind of need that happy mediums they still look nice and dainty but they're not going to snap as you try to pull them out of the mold this is where you just kind of flick your wrist so it goes and I'm literally just squiggling inside there you want to overlay it a couple of times over itself but you don't want a solid color you want to make sure that you're getting like that really nice kind of lacy effect make sure you bring it all the way up around the edges and then before I finish up here I need to make sure that I've got something solid that I can stick my two halves together with so I'm going to run my piping bag all the way around the top you can see I'm kind of just squeezing it slightly on the inside room of that big Easter egg mold and then I'm just going to use my finger I'm just going to come around the outside edge which finishes off my shape really nicely and it clears up that edge so that my egg is come out nice and easily and there's not chocolate kind of sticking it all around the outsides again with my second heart kind of reminds me of finger painting or getting really messy in art class as a kid and around with my finger just to neaten it off these ones are going to set in the freezer I'm going to set them in the freezer because I want them to be really really nice and solid because they're so fine but the freezer will also help them contract away from that plastic egg mold and will help them come out a lot easier than just refrigeration once those guys have had time to set and give them about 15 minutes but they're pretty fine so they don't need huge amounts of time you should almost be able to hear them cracking slightly as they contract away from the outside edges we'd only have actual cracking but if your egg should crack it's not the end of the world you can just glue it back together with a little bit of that melted candy melt and out comes our beautiful lacy filigree looking egg now it's up to you you if you want to fill this with anything I tried stuffing one of these large ones full of little solid eggs and they were too heavy so they broke through it but I found they looked really nice when I took one of my little other filigree eggs which I made in my smaller mold and stuck that inside it's like an egg within an egg I guess you could put an egg within that egg in goes my blue it's really pretty because you kind of get that little poke of color through that pink and it kind of gives you the dual color effect and then I'm going to use my snap seal bag just to come around the outside edge you want these to be nice and cold when you're doing this so that the heat of your fingers isn't melting through that candy melt and so that edge sets really nice and quickly and on goes out other half you can smooth around the outside edge with your finger just to make it really nice and seamless and there is a little egg I kind of wish up stuck another smaller egg inside the smaller egg so that I had an egg within an egg within an egg but you get the general idea I hope you guys have liked today's really fun really simple video how to make your own string Easter egg I love these because they're gorgeous they're really unique but best of all they're homemade if you want a ton more really fun ideas for Easter I'll leave a link to my Easter playlist down below so you can see all of my videos from years past if you're not already subscribed to the channel make sure you do for two new videos every week thanks very much for watching 
hey guys it's Alisa and welcome back to my cupcake addiction today we're going to be making Toblerone cupcakes this is a super simple way to take a relatively plain chocolate cupcake and make it absolutely decadent and incredibly tasty we're starting off with a basic chocolate cupcake so of course you're going to need some cupcakes today I've got some about chocolate decorations if you haven't seen that video it's really handy for all kinds of cake decorating so I'll leave a link to it down below I've got a batch of our perfectly pipeable buttercream frosting which I'll also link to down below of course I've got a bunch of Toblerone in here I've got a bunch more Toblerone I've also got a little bit of whipping cream and I'm just using a piping bag with a round open piping tip let's get started the first thing we're going to do is make a Toblerone ganache which is basically just Toblerone and cream so I'm just going to pour the cream over my Toblerone you can either heat this through the double boiler method or I'm just going to pop it in the microwave on 30-second intervals because Toblerone melts pretty quickly and I don't want to burn it make sure you stir it in between each microwave now I don't want my frosting for these to be completely white and I kind of want it to have that Toblerone flavor so you can see there my gooey pretty delicious looking Toblerone ganache I kind of feel like I could just eat that over ice cream but I'm going to instead put like three tablespoons over my buttercream I don't want to go crazy here because I want to feed my buttercream out too much but I do want it to get that nice sort of caramely color with those little mini chunks of Toblerone crunch going all the way through I'm gonna stir that through beautiful and then I'm going to put this bowl in the fridge for about 15 minutes because we've just added a warm ganache it's kind of warmed up the buttercream a little bit it's gonna be a little bit too sloppy for me to Pipe so I'm going to pop it in the fridge and just let it firm back up while that one's fridging I'm going to use a knife and I'm just going to call out the center of my cupcakes I want quite a generous core cut out here because these are all about the Toblerone so really as I take that out I'm going to have a well in the center so that I can flood it with my delicious Toblerone ganache don't throw out these little cause just yet because we are going to slice off the very top and use it as a little lid so you don't get like a spill of ganache coming out alright I've got my little Toblerone wells ready to go and you can see they're quite generous so I'm not going to be skimping anyone and I made my drug learn ganache in a jug to make it nice and easy to pour this recipe is actually enough for 12 cupcakes but I've only got six here a little bit of that ganache is actually going to soak into the cupcake so into the actual cake itself so you can just wait a couple of minutes and then top them up so that nobody's missing out on any ganache or feeling like they've got a little bit less than the person next to them and then on go our little tops don't worry too much if you've messed up the sizes and shapes it's really just something to protect the top of the cupcake and stop too much of that ganache coming out and we put frosting on it's like putting back together a delicious puzzle beautiful let's check on that frosting once your frosting feels cool to touch you just want to pop it into your piping bag with that round piping tip try not to do too small of a piping tip because we know we've got chunks of Toblerone in there if you try to get too small on the tip you might get a blockage so I'm just going to pipe a nice round higher swell leaving a little bit of chocolate cupcake poking through around those outside edges on each of my cupcakes if you haven't seen my round piping tip techniques video I do go into a bit more detail about this nice round swirl otherwise of course you could use a star tip you can decorate however you like I just like them to be high because that holds on extra decorations on top for all of your quantities and everything in all of your measurements I'll make sure to leave them in the description box below or on the my cupcake addiction website so make sure you check that out if you're actually going to make these so you get all the right measurements we've got our cupcakes now I'm going to do a little drizzle I'm just going to use a spoon I don't want to use a ziploc bag here because it's probably going to get blocked with all those chunky bits of Toblerone so I'm just going to drizzle very gently on top not too much because we've got a lot of decoration so you can see I don't even really put much chocolate on the spoon and basically just dipping it into the ganache and letting a little bit of it drip off and then just letting it sort of fall down and as it falls I'm just moving the spoon around beautiful now you might think that those chocolate decorations down the end here look a little bit difficult but I need to tell you I made these using parchment paper so parchment paper and just spreading it on make sure you check out that video because there's tons of cool techniques you can do without very many tools or fancy equipment you guys can decorate your Toblerone cupcakes however you like but I like to put my little three square of Toblerone or if you can find mini Toblerone x' they're adorable too I like to put that at the front and then I've got my little parchment paper kind of crinkled decoration that I've brushed with a bit of gold just to break up the color scheme a little bit and then I'm going with a nice big jagged still sticking in the Toblerone triangle kind of a shape piece of chocolate with some little waffle balls on it beautiful we have way way way over the top down Toblerone cupcakes but when you bite or cut into those you're going to get that delicious gooey center of Toblerone ganache the Toblerone flavor runs all the way throughout even though we started with just a basic chocolate cupcake and these decorations are going to make you look like the master pastry chef to all of your friends if you're not a recent scribe to the channel make sure you do two new videos every week and as always guys thank you very much for watching 
hey guys it's Alisa welcome back to my cupcake addiction I've been doing giant versions of my favorite cakes and candy bars for a while now today I'm going to take you to one of my absolute happy places the jam donut but I'm going to do it in giant size the things are you going to need to make this massive mega jam donut or jelly donor I've got some flour sugar eggs I've got a little whole milk some cinnamon cuz it's a donor I've got some vanilla some oil just an olive oil or vegetable oil a little bit of butter and I've got some brass berry jam and some plum jam today I'm gonna leave all of the quantities measurements and conversions you need for your recipe today on the my cupcake addiction comm website today I'm going to make a double batch of cake so this is a single batch and I'm going to make two so we are making one heck of a jam donut let's get started the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to take my eggs my butter my vanilla and my cinnamon and also my sugar I think and pop it all into a mixing bowl I'm using a pretty large mixing bowl here and making a huge mess I'm using a pretty large mixing bowl here because this is a big batch of cake it's actually ended up being two big batches of cake in goes most sugar vanilla you know what your oil can go on at this point Isabelle kingo's the oil and eggs and then three teaspoons of my cinnamon one two three I want them to be really nice and cinnamony pop that down and you want to mix it until everything is really well combined and light and fluffy so that's had a minute of mixing and it's nice and light and fluffy and now I'm going to add in my flour try not to make a massive mess here and then in goes my milk I'm using self-raising flour but if you're using all-purpose or plain flour I'll also leave that option in the recipe so that you can add baking powder and create your own self raising flour starting that mixer on a really low speed and I just want this combined so my last thought I mixed for about a minute minute and a half this I don't really want to go more than about thirty seconds because I don't want to developer glutens in my flower I'm going to take my bowl so I'm using a metal 8 inch by about three three-and-a-half inch high ball here it's got a slightly flat bottom on it but otherwise it's perfectly round and I'm going to give it a really really good spray who needs cake tins when we've got metal bowls this cinnamon cake mixture does sometimes tend to stick just a little on the base of the bowl so I've got just a round of parchment and I'm just going to put it just on the very very bottom I don't want to cover the whole thing just that very bottom section Pat it down on the spray and that'll help our cake release really nicely and easily up comes our cake and that is all going into this bowl spreading it out so it's nice and even on top and you really want that to be about an inch from the top edge of your bowl I don't mind if it goes up a little bit because we want to be able to trim it off really nice and flat so don't overfill it you don't want it to overflow but don't be stingy on the mix here either if your bowls a little more deeper a little more shallow you might end up with just a little bit of leftover mix I personally would use that to make some cupcakes this one's going to go off into the oven it's going to take around an hour to cook and you just want to test it in the middle with a wooden skewer you'll know it's done when the wooden skewer comes out clean and don't worry if the top of this one gets quite brown the cinnamon and that makes it quite a brown cake and as you cook it it will actually Brown it's not burning I promise its moist and delicious into the oven it goes you're going to need two of those when your cake comes out of the oven you want to let it just sit at room temperature for about 15 minutes gravity tell is that going to protect your hands and then use a serrated edge bread knife to cut along the top edge using the rim of the bowl is a bit of a guide you're really going to flatten off that cake absolutely perfectly once you've got it all leveled off it at sat for its 15 minutes you can run a knife gently around the outside edge and then turn it out while it's still really nice and warm you want to rub your cinnamon sugar mixture all over it definitely don't be stingy but do this over a separate trace you don't make a huge mess you need that cake to be warm for this cinnamon sugar to stick if you're having any problems with it sticking in any particular area just brush on a little bit of plain water with a pastry brush and use that to stick the cinnamon sugar mixture I'm ready to put this thing together so my cakes are cooled everything's looking great I'm gonna take my raspberry jam and my plum jam and I'm going to mix the two together here in Australia they use a type of jam that you can only buy commercially in like huge buckets called razz plum jam it's a combination of raspberry and plum so I've just taken a combination of raspberry plum and I'm mixing them together my raspberry jam or raspberry jelly doesn't have too many seeds in it if yours is really seed heavy you may want to strain it through a sieve just so that you're not having heaps of crunch in the middle because normally a rose plum jams pretty smooth now it's time to get carving so I'm going to do all of this on my board because it's going to get a little bit messy with all of that sugar and just cake going everywhere if you're in the mood to make cake pops you are going to have some cake off cuts here so cake pops are probably the perfect solution if you don't want to waste any I'm going to flip my first cake over and a little bit of that sugar is going to come off but try not to handle it too roughly because we don't want to knock too much of it off off comes my little cooling rack and then I'm going to use my knife to kind of hollow it out I want to leave about two-and-a-half to three inches around the outside I don't want to go too crazy here because I need enough support on the outside of my cake to actually allow it to be able to hold together and not split apart because it's a dome we're going to repeat that with our second half make this one not quite as deep as your other one because this is going to be our top cake and it's going to be a lot of gem going on in the inside of this donut perfect now we're going to fill our two centers with our jam and I'm going to go a little bit lighter on on this top one because I'm going to have to try and flip those two together I'm also going to put the rest of my jam just around not all the way to those outside edges but I just want to kind of coat this outside section of my base cake so the two have got something to stick together with if you wanted to use a frosting here you could but try to make sure that you don't have anything actually poking outside these side edges because we want this to kind of look like a full ball without any frosting visible all right I'm going to assemble this in my final presentation location because once it's all assembled I don't want to be moving it around too much it's going to be as simple as taking one half this one here is going to be the tricky one because we don't want this Jam to fall out as it goes on top so you're going to have to work quick baking in that Bowl means the outside of your cake should be really nice and firm which is great because it's not going to fall apart so long as it's completely cool and flip it push your two edges together as a final finishing touch from a jam ball we kind of need that little spot where you can always see that they've injected the big doughnut with its Jam so I'm going to put my leftover raspberry and plum jam into a ziplock bag I'm just using a knife to hollow out just a nice little hole it doesn't have to go all the way to the center and then I'm gonna use a ziplock bag to inject a drizzle of that raspberry and plum jam so it looks like this is just being piped I've literally made a jelly doughnut the size of my head this to me is my happy place I love a warm jam donut anybody that you make this for is just going to be amazed at the idea of the concept and of course the deliciousness if you want to check out more ideas for things that you can upsize I'll leave the link to a giant playlist down below if you're not already subscribed to the channel make sure you do for two new videos every week and as always guys thanks very much for watching you 
hey guys it's Elise and welcome back to my cupcake addiction today I'm going to show you how to make a full-sized Wonka inspired candy covered drip cake to make your Wonka cake you're going to need frosting now I'm using a double batch of my perfectly pipeable buttercream frosting which I'll link to down below half of that I've tinted purple and this is an Americano color it's a regal purple and then the other half I split out into five colors and did green red orange blue and yellow I'm making a ganache today so I've got some cream and also some white chocolate and then a little bit of I'm using like a navy blue or a blue food coloring to go with that you can use candy melts or I chose to tint white chocolate today so I've got blue purple yellow orange and pink I've got candy of course apart from having just a white chocolate cookies and cream candy bar I've got giant chocolate buttons I've got candy coated licorice I've got these little kind of striped licorice strips some sprinkles I've got round sprinkles I've got little long sprinkles and then I've got kind of these rainbow candies guys this is a Wonka cake pick your favorite candies and go crazy with them the more colorful the more bright the better for the top of my cake I've got some taller candies so I've got a gigantic gummy bear because I mean if I think back to the Wonka forest scene there are definitely gigantic gummi bears and then I've got lollipops rock candy and basically just a really good variation in colors for my cake today I'm using 5 layers I've got 7 inch by 1 inch just over 1 inch high sponges by the time I trim those down they're all going to be about an inch five of those is going to give us a really nice tall barrel looking cake if you're looking at tools today I'm going to leave everything that you need in the description box below so the first thing you want to do is you want to level off your cakes now normally I use a serrated edge knife but you guys have been on me to get a cake leveler so I bought it very cheap one it was about $13 and we're gonna have a go at that so I'm just going to make sure that it's the right size for my cake by adjusting my little side pieces and then I'm just going to level off each of my cake layers once I've leveled off the top I'm going to use my serrated edge knife just to make sure that I've got no brown crumbs at all and then I'm going to level off the bottom or just sort of remove that Brown cake section from the bottom once all of your cakes are leveled you want to take a little bit of frosting and put down to cake board or your cake plate use that to stick your first layer of cake down and then I opted for a different color frosting in between each layer so I'm only baking white cakes but I'm using rainbow colored frosting and you'll still get a really colorful effect when you cut into this cake because I have five cake layers and the five different colors of cake frosting when you get to the top your red frostings actually going to form also the top layer of your cake so we're going to have to refrigerate this so that it's firm enough that we can code it again in purple with all of your cakes stacked and frost in the middle you want to take your serrated edge knife and just trim the outside edges I like to do this after the cake to stack so that I can make sure that they're all the same size and I'm just removing any of those browned cake edges from around the outsides of my cake pop no one off into the fridge and let it set for 15 minutes and once you're happy that your top section of red is firm to touch then you can take your purple frosting and using your offset spatula make like a crumb coat on the outside so you can see that I'm just working my spatula back and forward back and forward around the outside edge of my cake to collect any crumbs put your cake crumb coat it back up into the fridge for about 20 minutes and then we're going to come back out and do our final coat of frosting when your crumb coated cake comes out of the fridge you can take a generous amount of that purple frosting and use your offset spatula to apply it all over the outside of that cake including the top I'm going to use a scraper but a metal ruler also works really well for this and I'm just going to scrape back the outside edges so they're really nice and smooth for this reason you want to make sure you've got plenty of frosting on the outside so you're not revealing any of that cake underneath as you scrape back to smoothness once your cakes beautifully smooth you can use your ruler or your scraper to level off the top and get it as nice and sharp-edged as possible once your cakes completely frosted you want to work while that frosting is still nice and soft preferrence starts to crust I'm just going to take some of my larger candies and then some of my smaller ones and stick them straight onto that frosting kind of creating like a big colorful candy border all around the bottom put your cake back up into the fridge for about 20 minutes while your cakes chilling out of the fridge we're going to make some custom chocolate shards to go on top of this Wonka cake I love this because you can really get creative and customize the colors so I'm going to start with my candy melt on my blue chocolate and I'm just gonna pour that all over my baking paper now you're gonna spread it around a little bit and then just add in some spoonfuls of yellow because I like the contrast of color and then you want to take just the back of a skewer and you're just going to kind of bigger eat it all the way throughout to swirl that around I chose to use some of my sprinkles and some of my little rainbow candies yeah intermixed with some of those larger candies but it ain't got too crazy because I kind of want this to be like a candy bark with pops of candy attached I'm going to make two different colors so I'm gonna repeat the same with an orange Beth's with a little bit of purple spooned in once again figure-eight it and then add your chosen candy I'll do it for two colors here but guys go crazy and pick your favorite colors you want to set those off to the side and after about four or five minutes they'll be just starting to set but they won't be firm that's your opportunity to grab a really sharp knife and cut them into shards I like to go for a big long triangles yeah set them off to the side and let them completely set at room temperature and then you'll pop them back into the fridge just five minutes before you want to use them finally in addition to your chocolate shards I just took some melted pink candy melt literally dipped it just a Hershey bar in it let it dribble down a little bit and then topped it off with sprinkles kinda looks like a block of chocolate kind of looks a bit like a shot so now it's time to make your ganache you want to pour your cream over that white chocolate I'm going to microwave that on 30-second intervals it's only going to take a minute max stirring really well in between until it's super smooth once it's smooth I'm going to add a couple of drops of food coloring I kind of wanted like not too much of a vibrant blue more of a powder blue so I opted for an America or navy blue this is actually a candy coloring but I find if you don't add enough to make it Navy it gives you a really nice kind of a powder blue once you can actually set you just want to set it off to the side just at room temperature cover it with a bit of plastic wrap so it doesn't form a crust and we need that to come back down to not cold but certainly not hot anymore before it can drip over the top of our cake so we've got our candy border and our cakes frosted and the moment of truth any drip cake always comes in the drip so you'll see the consistency there of my ganache it's quite thick you don't want this to be too thin or you're gonna end up with runs and dribbles everywhere so I'm going to put all of that on top and I'm going to use my offset spatula just to strategically spread it around using my offset spatula now I'm just going to gently push out to the edges and then let it drip over the sides without cake now frosted candied and dripped it's the best part I've got my complete in little chocolate shards and they're going to be the first things that I put in because I know they're going to be quite delicate I'm just going to carve a little guide hole just into the back roughly where I think it's going to go and make sure that your decorations are not too close to the very back of your cake because you don't want them to drag back and actually pull the cake away all right and they go in goes all of your delicious candy alright that's it we've done it this is our Willy Wonka inspired over-the-top candy drip cake I hope you guys loved how it turned out I am beyond excited Willy Wonka one of the ultimate movies and for me this is one of the ultimate cakes I hope you guys like today's video if you're not already subscribe to the channel make sure you do for two new videos every week and as always guys thanks very much for watching 
hey guys welcome back to my cupcake addiction today I'm excited to be bringing you an awesome back to basics and I'm going to show you how to make candied bacon so that you get perfect candied bacon every time for all of your bacon baking needs I'm excited to be teaming up with the guys at Oscar Mayer today who are sponsoring this video and helping me to turn their perfect bacon every time into my perfect candied bacon every time there are a bunch of variations on candied bacon depending on the crunch and sweetness you want to achieve but when it boils down to it it all starts with the perfect rasher of bacon I'm opting for Oscar Meyers naturally hardwood smoked bacon rashers today because they hand cut their bacon so I know I'm gonna get the perfect size and really neat slices once my candied bacon is ready I'm not quite sure why bacon and maple go so well together they seem like an odd combination but of course to make my candied bacon I'm gonna be going with a maple glaze to make your maple glaze you're gonna need 3/4 of a cup of brown sugar 6 tablespoons of rice wine vinegar 6 tablespoons of good quality maple syrup and about 1/4 of a teaspoon of ground black pepper we're gonna oven bake our bacon today so you need the oven preheating to 350 Fahrenheit or about 180 Celsius and I'm gonna use a baking tray and then a wire rack you're gonna want to line that baking tray with parchment because this gets a little sticky first up you want to mix all of your ingredients together in literally any order just dump and stir until that brown sugar is dissolved I'm gonna open my bacon and separate my slices and then I'm gonna put all of those bacon rashes into the bowl of maple glaze some people like to brush their bacon I like to dump mine you want all of that marinate in the fridge for about an hour and guys this is the step that makes my candied bacon just a little bit better than everybody else's according to my husband anyway but I think he has to say that once my hour of frig marinating time's up I'm gonna pull out my oscar meyer bacon rashes and I'm gonna use my tongs to kind of pincer them at each end transport them down onto the tray and then open them up once they're there this is gonna save you a little bit of stickiness because that maple glaze while delicious gets a little bit messy that tree is going to go off into your modern ovens so 350 Fahrenheit or about 180 Celsius for 10 minutes set timers for this cuz the bacon changes pretty quickly after the first 10 minutes your bacon should be still sort of raw looking so that pinky color you want to take those bacon rashes off using the tongs again and dip them again in that glaze when your bacon rashes are all dipped and back on the tray you're gonna put it into the oven for another 5 minutes we're going on 5 minute intervals from here on in after 5 minutes your Oscar Meyer bacon should be browning around the outside edges and instead of dipping from here on in we're gonna brush with a pastry brush and give those Oscar Mayer bacon rashes a nice hearty coating on the front flip them all over coat them on the back and then back off into the oven for you guessed it another 5 minutes so after 20 minutes total cook time this is essentially your first level of candy bacon it's like a little bit browned around those outside edges and it's kind of flexible so if you like your bacon sweet but chewy you want to put it in a Caesar salad to spice things up this is the soft stage of candied bacon and I should mention that after baking upon sitting the bacon actually firms up a little bit so even if it looks a little flexible now once it's actually set it gets a lot firmer to get to our next stage of candied bacon you're gonna give everything another brush with the maple glaze front and back put it back into the oven for another 5 minutes when that comes out you're gonna notice caramelization happening all over the piece of bacon and the Browning around the edges is gonna be deeper in color but this Bacon's gonna be kind of somewhere in the middle of super crisp and crunchy caramelized candied bacon and kind of that soft flexible candied bacon that we saw earlier so this is actually my preferred level of candied bacon it's crispy around the outside edges but it still retains that lovely kind of bacony color and then it's a little chewy in the middle but super sweet and delicious but there's more if you've managed to stop yourself from eating all of your candied bacon at this stage then it's time to give it one last coat of the maple glaze again with the pastry brush back and front and back into the oven for I'm gonna say five minutes there's a lot of 5 minutes when you're Oscar Meyer candied bacon comes the oven it's gonna be deep rich brown in color it's gonna be crispy all around the edges with a very slight hint of pink in the middle just because the edges are brown when caramelizing does not mean they're at all burnt so don't freak out this is just the sugars and the maple soaking into the bacon and it's that delicious crispy Nastase it a lot of us really love so that's your three stages of candied bacon and you can store that in the fridge for about a week I separate mine with parchment paper so the bacon doesn't stick to its bacon friends and it's easy to peel off when I want to use it now I figure we should do some bacon with our bacon all right I wanted to say that this whole episode I'm going to show you how to make some really really simple maple bacon cupcakes with my candied bacon I'm using a batch of my classic vanilla cupcake recipe if you don't have the my cupcake addiction cookbook I'll leave a link down below you can find that recipe and once they've been cooked and completely cooled you want to grab a sharp serrated edge knife I'm gonna core a nice little circle out of the center of each of my cupcakes and I know you're gonna want to eat this but hold off for a second to compliment my vanilla cupcakes I've got a batch of my classic vanilla buttercream frosting again all recipe linked that one down below before I get started though I want to turn this into more of a maple frosting without going to too much trouble so I'm gonna separate out one third of my batch or approximately one third and then I'm gonna take some really nice quality pure maple syrup and I'm gonna add it in one tablespoon at a time till there's about three tablespoons I'm gonna mix really thoroughly after each single tablespoon so that I can check the consistency and make sure my frostings not going to runny pop that smaller mapley batch into a snap sealed bag and I'm just gonna snip off a generous tip off the end and I'm gonna squeeze that maple filling into the cavities of each of my vanilla cupcakes essentially making the maple vanilla cupcakes slice the very very top off those little core Center pieces that you cut out and use that like a little hat to trap in all of that maple frosting and then for good measure I'm gonna add just a little drizzle of straight maple syrup on top of each of those cupcakes be careful it doesn't run off the side so you're gonna get sticky wrappers to avoid that you can actually pipe a very small ring of that maple frosting around that cord out center so it sort of holds that maple syrup in place to the rest of my frosting I'm just gonna add one more tablespoon of that maple because I don't want this to be too sickly sweet mix it all the way through and then I'm gonna pop that into a disposable piping bag with a round open piping tip I'm gonna pipe a low swirl by going around the outside of my little maple syrup swimming pool situation I've got going on here and I'm gonna make sure I keep it really low and flat because that's gonna give me a great base for the decorations so we've got our cupcakes which are now frosted we've got our candied Oscar Mayer bacon rashers and what goes better with bacon then eggs the candy bacon needs candy eggs so I'm gonna melt a little bit of white chocolate and I've just got a baking tray lined with parchment put a teaspoon sized dollop of that white chocolate onto your lined tray and then I'm just kind of push it and coax it out a little bit so get that fried egg esque shape I'm using a little yellow candy I'm gonna pop it just slightly off to one side and that's gonna make our yolk let those guys set at room temperature not in the fridge or else they'll curl up and when they're ready and set you can just peel them off the tray and now we get to put it all together so the easiest way to cut candied bacon is actually not with a knife I like to use kitchen scissors so I get a nice neat cut I don't get sticky maple everywhere I'm gonna place one of my half strips of bacon towards the back of my cupcake and then I'm gonna pick one of my candied eggs off the tray pop it straight down on leaning slightly up against our Oscar Meyer bacon strip and then I'm gonna add a little caramel sausage just to the side so I've got some little caramels or toffee chews that are quite soft and pliable and I'm just gonna kind of round off the edges and stretch them a little bit to look like a big jelly bean to make the little end bits that you'd see on a sausage I'm gonna use pair of scissors and I'm just gonna make one small almost cut in one direction and then turn my sausage and make another small almost cut in the other direction that's gonna make those little twisty ends that you see on sausages and you have caramel sausage candied bacon chocolate egg caramel sausage this doesn't sound right but it does sound delicious okay adorable very delicious sure they are absolutely show-stopping every single time I think what if Oscar Mayer is gonna take the title for the most perfect bacon strip every time I'm gonna take the title for the most perfect candied bacon strip every single time I hope you guys enjoyed learning everything there is to know about how to make your own candy bacon at home big thanks to Oscar Mayer for teaming up with me on today's video and as always guys thanks very much for watching you 
hey guys it's Elise and welcome back to my cupcake addiction today I'm going to show you guys how to make five different ice cream sandwiches that are made out of non-traditional things to make your five ice cream sandwiches I've got some pop-tarts I've also got some peppermint patties so these are like little chocolate disks with soft peppermint inside some large pretzels but you can also use small pretzels I've got a couple of rice krispies treats and I've got some Kinder Bueno because YUM I chose these ingredients because when you make an ice-cream sandwich you want something that's soft enough that you can actually buy it through and it doesn't squash all of the ice cream out of shape so I've dimmed all of these things they've got a good consistency to be able to get through without making a complete mess I've also got a little bit of melted dark chocolate you'll need a couple of cutters so I've got a circle and a square the square is going to be about the same size as the bueno ice-cream sandwich I want to make and the circles tiny bit smaller than my peppermint patties and also my pretzels got a knife and a spoon you're also going to need ice cream I've got a peppermint ice cream a caramel ice cream and a plain vanilla ice cream and I will note when you're using bigger things like this Square tubs of ice cream are a lot easier to use than the smaller round ones let's get started I love the taste of pretzels with ice cream but I also don't want the ice cream kind of going all the way through these little holes so I'm going to seal them up with a bit of chocolate so take a little bit of your melted dark chocolate and just spoon it into each of the little cavities filling them but don't overfill them not too thick here because again we need to be able to get through these when our ice creams in place beautiful those ones can set now for my queer nose for some reason every time I open a bueno it seems to be broken in half so I thought rather than getting you guys to try and find that elusive packet that hasn't broken in half you know take a pair of scissors and just shave off the sides so they're pretty neat and then you're going to take two halves and we're going to join them together with a little bit of the melted dark chocolate again I chose Beunos because they're really really nice and light and crispy inside and they've got that lovely filling so when we go to bite into them they're going to kind of bite through not squish everything out of place you get ice-cream wafer chocolate and delicious hazelnut filling in every bite it's going to be amazing alright few rice krispies treats I'm using too these are cereal treats we get them here in Australia they called lc/ms I'm going to slice them lengthwise in half so I've got two kind of flat bits and then I'm going to take two of those flat bits and we're going to join them together like this with a bit of dark chocolate and onto the parchment to set that's basically it for preparation if you're going to do the pop-tart ones you need to toast the popped-up so they're cooked and then let them cool down so they don't melt the ice cream straight away so first up our peppermint patties you want to do two peppermint patties and we are going to take our circle cutter again just slightly smaller than the size of your peppermint pattie and then I'm going to flip one over I'm going to push down you into my fresh ice cream and you can make these as thick or as thin as you like and as a tip if you want to make several of these each time try to level the ice-cream off so that it's kind of all back in the center it just makes it easier to call them out or if you want to make a tongue you can just slice the entire tub all right comes out if it's not perfectly neat you just want to slice off the back so you've got kind of a flat side to your round and then place it on to the peppermint pattie and on goes our lid first ice cream sandwich is ready to go the next two I'm going to make both of them with salted caramel ice cream and this one actually has little chunks of hazelnut so it's perfect for my Kinder Bueno your little pieces should be set we're going to take this square cookie cutter and again that square cookie cutter it's actually just because it's a rectangle shape just a little bit bigger so in goes my square cookie cutter in the very top and then under goes my knife just to help lever it out smooth off the back and into my burner time will tell but I do feel like that one's gonna be my favourite now as I mentioned because you're gonna have like a bit of a divot or a gouge out in your ice cream just smooth it back off just gonna push it down with my knife because we also need to cut a circle out of this for our pretzels all right so my circle cutter goes in undergoes the knife flatten it off now I decided to make the flat side of my pretzel the outside of my sandwich because I've kind of got like a little bit of an indent and that's going to be a little spot that will start to catch some of the drips from the ice cream as it melts giving me a little more time to eat it on goes my little disc of salted caramel ice cream and press it down all right these guys are already looking pretty intense next a pop tart ice cream sandwich I've got my pop-tarts toasted but cool so they've been cooked but they're not hot anymore and I'm going to cut around with a sharp knife in about the same shape as my pop-tart if you're making loads of these you can freeze trays of ice cream of course you can home make your own ice cream I'm going to dig that out we've cut all the way around it so just dig it up with the knife and then onto the pop-tart I'll goes the other piece of my pop-tart and that is your pop-tart Ice Cream Sandwich finally it's the rice krispies treats now make sure that your dark chocolates still melted because we're actually going to drizzle this at a bit of chocolate so I'm going to make it on the parchment for this time I'm actually going to lay the rice krispies treat right on top cut around the outside edge just like we did with the others and this is going to be a little bit harder to level off than the ones that we cut out of the cookie cutter so I'm going to kind of like pick it up and then I'm going to cooked the ice cream into the shape of my rice krispies treat sandwich smooth out those edges and then on goes our lid before that one is ready to serve it needs a good drizzle of that melted dark chocolate to make them utterly delicious and they kind of look a little prettier I think so that's it these are my five recommendations and of course I'm talking about my favorites here I hope you guys have enjoyed today's fun and easy tutorial if you can think of any other things that I should have Ice Cream Sandwich let me know down below if we can get enough I'll do another next five things you should ice cream sandwich video if you're not already subscribed to the channel make sure you do for two new videos every week and as always guys thanks very much for watching 
do you think that's the best that's the best or that's the best oh that's the best oh that's the best oh that's the best oh that's the best [Music] welcome back to my cupcake addiction today I'm going to show you guys how to not bake a shopkins party well some of the elements from a shopkins party today we're going to be making apple blossom strawberry kiss delish donut cheeky chocolate and kooky cookie god I love these guys names the things that you're going to need I've got an apple I've got a chocolate bar a donor strawberries choc chip cookies parchment paper skewers and toothpicks white candy melts fondant some oil-based or candy colors snaps your bags black candy melts red candy melts and sprinkles I've also left a link below to this cheeky chocolate chocolate bar template he's probably the easiest one of all to me let's get started we're going to kick off with apple blossom just take a skewer or a big too thick and you want to shove it straight into the top of apple blossoms head that sounds very morose now I've colored some of my white candy melts you can also color white chocolate just a nice kind of a light green using oil-based or candy colorings and then I'm going to dip my Apple take your dipped apple and place it just onto a piece of parchment which will help it make a little foot so apple blossom has something to stand on while she's drying I'm gonna make the little worm that kind of sticks up out of apple blossoms head by using just a little bit of pink fondant I've got a great recipe for marshmallow fondant if you want to easily make your own at home otherwise you can use store-bought roll it into a ball and then just make like a bit of a wormy sheep a wormy sheep and then you just want to make some little lines to make like the worms body and a couple of eyes and a cute little mouth if you need to roll anything I've got just a little bit of either icing sugar you could use corn starch here I'm just gonna sift a little onto the bench so my fondant doesn't stick I'm gonna roll out some of my white and some of my black when it comes to circle cutters you can also think if you've got something else that might work just as well or you can freehand cut these but I'm going to cut out a nice big circle and then I'm gonna take some little Nick's out of it to make a small flower it could blossom in apple blossoms hair if you've got blossom cutters you a lot of time but if you don't it's a good way to make a blossom a couple of little divots in the sides and then a little ball of yellow fondant to finish it off as that blossom I'm just going to cut out four little circles two black and two white and then lay them on top of each other and just trim them to make the expression that I want I'm only making one because she's going to be winking I'm going to attach my Daisy mo worm and my leaves but I'm going to wait to do anything with the face until it's all set and I'm actually going to do all of my faces together time for delish donut so I have one regular store-bought donut you can make your own or you could buy it if you don't want to make your own and some of our white candy melts tinted pink delish donuts getting a facial and then tap my sprinkles that I've chosen I've got blue yellow and pink kind of long Ginny sprinkles and then blue yellow and pink hearts you know it's very cute I'm gonna sprinkle just on the top sort of section I'm not going to do the bottom because I want to leave room for her eyes she's gotta be able to see I'm gonna precision sprinkle something like this and you let that set just for a minute while I make a little foot so delish donut can stand up to make my little foot I'm literally just gonna take a spoonful of pink chocolate and pop it down on my parchment and then I'm gonna stand delish up in her little donut kind of feet I'm gonna have to support delish donut until she's ready to set and very supportive oh I've got you I've got you go I'll be the wind beneath her wings I'll be the Phil Matier Louise all right I'm tired of supporting delish donut I'm gonna stick something behind a sprinkles can support her sprinkles support everyone now it's time for kooky cookie the best part about kooky cookie she has a bite taken out of her which is our job I'm up for the challenge the bites too big I'll have to go again about too small have to eat more she's getting up too little pink feet as well so it makes sense to make her at about the same time as you make delish donut I'm just gonna put too little blob so they look like to the Linda vidual feet kind of like a little pink heart and then we'll stand her up in that I'm being so supportive today supporting delish donut I'm supporting kooky cookie I'm a very short attention span now the chocolate can support cookie cookie what have you've got to do to support your cookie away my hands are free to move on to cheeky chocolate easiest one of the bunch so cut around your little cheeky chocolate template you can also cut around her little hands because that way they'll pop out when you actually wrap the chocolate wrapper around the chocolate bar you're literally going to need one chocolate bar and a piece of parchment here and you just want to trim off using a Hershey so I'm just going to trim off the very very top section so I've got kind of like a short stumpy little chocolate bar I'm going to wrap a little bit of parchment around the top section first I'm going to rip it so it looks like it just ripped chocolate bar wrapper fold it over a tiny bit and then I'm going to kind of check that cheeky chocolate looks quite cozy in there and then trim off along the bottom edge I've made the template a little longer than you need so that you can actually trim them and then around wraps cheeky a little tape on the back and cheeky chocolates born for final touches here I'm just piping using a snaps your bag a few little love hearts onto a piece of parchment and you let them set and then I'm going to attach them to each of the little chocolate squares so they're kind of lovely chocolate squares strawberry kiss perhaps the most adorable of all of our shopkins treats find big juicy strawberries you might have to go through a few you might have to chop dip a few and eat them but you want nice big red chopped strawberries and you want them as fresh as possible to make sure that my strawberry kisses gonna stand up I'm actually gonna cheat a little bit and just take a very small flat bottom I'm technically cutting off her legs sorry I've got some red candy melts or red coloured chocolate and I'm going to dip strawberry kiss not all the way I do want to see some of that luscious red strawberry coming out grab her by I mean it feels like I'm grabbing her by her hair and then you consider on your parchment to set or stand her on the parchment to set fondant eyes ah strawberry kiss no this is a good time to make the rest of your eyes so each of your shopkins as a roll is going to need two of those unless they're winking or smiley facing in which case you can get away with making less eyes I've made smaller size Halfmoon eyes for cookie-cookie small eyes for strawberry kiss and then I've got a full set of big wide-open eyes for delish donut and 1/2 eye and then a winky eye for apple blossom once your strawberries set you can add some little yellow dots using just a toothpick and some yellow candy melts and then you want to make a small green foot using a leftover apple blossom chocolate and just gently rest your little strawberry on top so that strawberry kiss has a set of feet to hold her upright then you want to put that little bit of black candy melt into a snaps your bag and just pipe on eyelashes on each of your little shopkins a little bit of pink with the toothpick makes everybody's gorgeous little lips and your shopkins are complete you might not want to make every single one of these but I guarantee there's at least one or two fun ideas in there that will add a lot to your next shopkins event particularly the little chocolate bars I think are the standard staple take-home gift for pretty much any guest I would love to hear down below which was your favorite of these no-bake shopkins treats make sure you check out our shopkins cupcakes with free printable cupcake wrappers if you want to make some super simple accompanying cupcakes if you're not already subscribed to the channel make sure you do for two new videos every week and as always guys thanks very much for watching guys Oh apple blossom bites the dust [Music] I want you guys just to appreciate for a second the fact that I styled my buttons to match our theme today shopkins buttons I know they're actually earrings but they were too small to be seen so I switched to the bows and improvised 
I love space this is where time [Music] welcome back to my cupcake addiction a couple of weeks ago you may or may not have caught my galaxies inside cake pop video where we kick popped the solar system well I ordered this shirt online which arrived the day after I shot that video and of course I needed an excuse to wear it because it's kind of Awesome so today I'm going to show you guys how to make a simple galaxy bowl cake and we're also going to be mixing our own galaxy sprinkles you guys need to make your Galaxy Bowl cake you're going to need black candy melts you'll also need some edible Luster's and get creative with your colors you don't just stick to silver paintbrushes chocolate cake and I baked a batch of my chocolate cake in a round Bowl tin I'll leave a link for the tin that I use down below you're also going to need a little bit of chocolate ganache you can change up your flavors but I want dark this is the galaxy I also promised I was going to show you guys how to mix your own galaxy sprinkles so I have a ton of really fun galaxy inspired sprinkles that we're going to mix together the perfect galaxy sprinkle mix we're going to cast black candy melts in our ball molds you should have two halves of your ball mold but first because we know we want it to look like the galaxy I'm gonna spread and sprinkle and kind of flick some different colored Luster's in there go crazy this is your galaxy it can be whatever you want it to be so I've got different size paint brushes you can do everything from nice little streaks to just flicking and dropping little different colored pieces of luster in there for my halves of my galaxy bowl cake I'm going to take black candy melts I'm gonna pour them straight in and then I'm going to spread them using a spatula don't over spread here because we don't want to disturb too much of our luster you've gone to so much trouble to get your galaxy pattern perfect you do want to make sure though that your candy melt comes all the way up to the outside edge it doesn't matter if you can see some little gaps in the bottom because we're going to add a second coat but we do want to make sure the edges are nice and thick because that's how we're going to join everything together drip out any excess because two thin coats definitely better than one thick one here these Bolton's are perfectly round which means that they don't tend to sit without wobbling around they sometimes come with these little rings but if you don't get a set that comes with the Rings or you need to stabilize any round bolt in you can do something as simple as a cookie cutter or a mason jar lid these guys are going to go off into the fridge to set I'm going to give them a good 15 minutes and then I'm going to apply a second coat of my black candy melt once the second coat of black candy melt goes on they got to go back into the fridge for another 15 minutes and then I'm going to snap freeze them for five minutes snap freezing just means put it in the freezer that's going to cause the candy to contract from the metal edges of your bolt in and you'll be able to slide it out really easily while your ball is setting you can take your cake now and this is easiest to do if your cake is completely chilled so pop it in the fridge for an hour or so I'm going to slice away my bulbus top or most lightly raised rounded edge you'll see how firm that cake is that's because it's cold so much easier to carve cake when it's cold now because I've made my cake in the same container that I'm also making my chocolate ball in but I know my chocolates going to take up about this much room you just need to trim away the very very outside edges seems a shame because their cakes so nice and shiny you can draw away these off cuts but just hang on to this one just in case we need any filler cake to really make up our levels once your half cakes nice and trimmed you just want to come around and I'm just going to roughly divide it in to make this top section a little bit smaller than the middle section because this is going to be what's going to hold our galaxy candies in place and again with the other half well that guy's chilling out we're going to make our own galaxy sprinkles I love making my own sprinkle mixes because when you want something really specific it's almost impossible to find it in stores so I've got a combination of black jimmies blue jimmies I've got purple and silver jimmies I've got some little colored stars with a hint of pink because I like pink these guys here came in a little sprinkle kit I'll leave a link to it down below but they almost look like moon dust otherwise little silver nonpareils are super cute here then I've got some little shiny kind of mini nonpareils and you absolutely must get the teeny-tiny edible stars they make this mix and you don't need many of them to pack a pretty powerful punch for my galaxy sprinkle mix I want black to be my dominant color so I'm going to start with three tablespoons of my black jimmies and then a tablespoon each of my blue jimmies my purple and then my silver I love these little moon rocks because they've got a bit of sparkle so I'm going to add one tablespoon and stir it through but I'm pretty confident I'm going to use more than one and then a tablespoon of my little black and white nonpareils a good tablespoon of my star sprinkles a couple more moon rocks and then I'm going to add a half a tablespoon at a time of my little silver stars they can go off to the side that's what I'm going to fill my pinata with so when we cut it galaxy sprinkles will come out this is how easy these should pop out super super easy you shouldn't have to coax them you shouldn't have to really do anything with them other than just pull them out take a look at that pattern so this is what putting the lustre on the inside of the bowl does and then once we're all finished we're going to put more luster on the outside it's a nice start kind of gives us the basis for our galaxy now that you know they're going to come out quite safely clean out the edges of your metal bowls and put the balls back into the bowl and then rest them back onto their little cookie cutter feet this is going to help them stay stable but it's also going to stop you getting pesky fingerprints all over the outside now we're going to add chocolate to our galaxy so I've got my ganache and it's really still quite smooth and fluid and I'm going to pour that into each of my halves scraping it up the sides in goes our little small layers of cake a little more ganache before I put my next slices of cake in I'm going to cut a nice little center hole so they've got somewhere for my sprinkles to live [Music] before I fill that with sprinkles I'm gonna use my little center holes and just trim them into two small slices and add them on top of the ganache on the bottom layer of cake that's going to make sure that my sprinkles don't stick and they've got kind of a free little cake space to be free and so they pour nicely when we cut add a couple of tablespoons of sprinkles and pack them in nice and tight and then add another layer of ganache but make sure that you don't go over those sprinkles I like to leave them about a centimeter or so on a breathing room so they don't get ganache mixed in with my sprinkles here using those little offcuts that I told you not to throw away you're going to just build up your cake on top of that ganache layer covering the sprinkle hole to keep the sprinkles in place and just trim it so that it doesn't go above the outside edges of the cake in NASH it in so you've got basically a very smooth ganache covered chocolaty layer of cake with a hidden sprinkles surprise popping runs off into the fridge you have two options whenever you're joining a cake that's made of chocolate you can join it together and then pipe in black candy melt but I prefer the nature of the options a hot skillet just gently place it on the top rim of each of the bowls then you want to pick them up carefully using a piece of paper towel or a tissue so you don't put too many fingerprints on them and join them together don't freak out if they're not completely smooth here into the fridge so it's nice and chilled before we hit the next step take a heat proof jug and fill it with a really hot water and then you want to soak a knife in there drying the knife each time just use the side edge of it to melt the two sides of your little ball together and get rid of any of those jagged edges that might still be overhanging you're literally just melting away any excess and just joining it nice and neatly I like to take a little bit of paper towel and just dip it into my hot water and then use that to really smooth off that seam but don't worry if it's not a hundred percent perfect because you've got room to cover this with all of your Galaxy detail put that up into the fridge for 15 minutes so it's nice and chilled after all that hot action going on and our center seam I'm going to start with a little more lustre I'm using quite a big brush you notice I'm tapping some of it off and I'm just gonna really just brush around to kind of make a little bit more of that galaxy effect ooh that's cute then I'm going to mix a little vodka with my remaining lustres and I'm here to get my inner kid on and just flick and make a huge mess I'm using different sized paintbrushes and different techniques zagging flicking kind of whack in without touching there's a few different things going on here but this is how you're going to get a bunch of different really cool space looking shiny sparkly effects in your galaxy bowl cake this is so much fun but so messy finally I'm just going to take my gorgeous little silver edible stars anywhere I want to stick one I'm just going to first place a little tiny dab of water and then use that wet toothpick to pick up a single star and pop it in place I found this really cool plate from West Elm and I love the texture that it's got because it reminds me of the rings of some of the planets and to stick my ball in place because I don't want it to roll around I'm going to apply just a very small emphasis on the word small here little dollop of candy melt right in the center the cool part about this cake is that it is perfectly round so you don't really want to be able to see any foot sticking out because that takes away from the coolness of the illusion I'm going to make sure that it's straight and centered when you pick it up just place your fingers right down underneath again any finger prints you want to keep them on the bottom and you may just need to add a little more luster in case any of our bits that have been in the bowl got neglected maybe a couple of extra stars if I stand here I basically become one with the galaxy I don't even think you can see the cake this is the coolest and one of the easiest ways to make a galaxy cake I can't cut into it now because Ollie will kill me if he's not here to see the pinata surprise the candy inside was his idea do you wanna see the cake I made yeah wait there the galaxies in my fridge [Music] I can't be ready yep Wow what do you think cool can we smash your old phone and Jesus sprinkles why would you smash it why wouldn't we cut it yeah all right do we cut it in half or do we cut a slice I think cut a slice yeah yeah to cut a slice you need to use a superhot knife so this is where little hands stay out of the way is that a boiling water is that has that been boiling because you're here but it's pretty hot all right ready to kind of there's a mountain stars is a galaxy inside our galaxy Dell exception that is exactly how you make a galaxy that is exactly how you make a galaxy cakes if you don't already subscribe to the channel make sure you do for two new videos every week and otherwise thanks very much for watching what are you doing at the galaxy Jake I strange he is destroyer of galaxies [Music] destroy [Music] hey I I feel popping candy in my brain in your brain the popping candy you really like it no open your mouth open your mouth what's it doing [Music] [Music] 
hey guys it's Alisa welcome back to my cupcake addiction a little while ago I made some strawberry shortcake ice cream sandwiches on home and family on the Hallmark Channel and those of you guys that saw it have been requesting that I post the whole recipe here on the channel so today I'm going to show you how to make no baked strawberry shortcake ice cream sandwiches the best thing about this recipe you can change it up so easily chopped mint chip no problem plain vanilla absolutely let's get started the things that you're going to need today I'm using strawberries I've got a half a can of condensed milk and I put two and a half cups or 600 mils of heavy or whipping cream I've also got a little bit of vanilla essence I've got a circle cutter and I'm going to use some we didn't have any white Oreos here so I'm just using some white sandwich cookies and I've scraped the cream out so I've just kind of got both halves of the naked cookie as a variation you could substitute your vanilla with a bit of peppermint add the touch of green food coloring pop in some little miniature chocolate chips and sandwich these between a chocolate Oreo for a delicious mint chip edition today it's all about the strawberry shortcake let's get into it so to start off with we're making a very simple vanilla no churn ice cream so we don't have a churn a beat you do need an electric mixer here because we're going to beat the cream and the cream is going to be what gives the air to our ice cream before we freeze it kind of a cheats ice cream this actually freezes up a little firmer than a regular ice cream so it's perfect for ice cream sandwiches in goes our vanilla and like I said for a chopped mint option you'd leave the vanilla out and have peppermint essence instead I'm going to whip this now to soft peaks using my electric mixer all right I'm happy that my cream and condensed milk mixture is semi whipped and you can see that it's holding its own weight but it's still falling off the beaters you definitely do not want to over whip at this point you may want to lick your beaters but you don't want to over whip so I'm going to put half of my mixture now straight into a tray I'm not going to line it just to freezer-safe tray and the size of your tray is going to determine how thick your ice-cream sandwiches are so if you want them to be really thick and a lot of ice cream in between your cookies you could go with a slightly smaller trade in the one that I'm using otherwise I want mine quite thin so that I can eat more of them so this is the size I've gone with today it's about a nine by eleven now even as I'm putting my spatula along that ice cream base that's actually continuing to whip the cream so this is why you definitely don't want to over whip it at that early stage because I know we're going to like move it around a little bit we definitely don't want to risk splitting our cream and having it go chunky I'm gonna lay my strawberries all over and I'm going to go to trouble to try and not really have many gaps of ice cream poking through because this is strawberry shortcake and when I cut these I want to be able to see the line of strawberries in between the two layers of ice cream for each sandwich once all of your strawberries are in place I'm just grabbing any of my little strawberry bits and pieces and just going through and covering up any gaps and then I'm going to take the last of my mixture and I'm going to pull the whole lid over the top pretty evenly I kind of want to distribute it pretty evenly so that I'm not disturbing my strawberries too much when I spread it all out this cream and condensed milk mixture smells phenomenal now gently I'm just going to spread out my rest of my ice cream mixture on top of my thick line of strawberries and then we level it off give it a couple of good taps on the bench so that all of my ice cream sandwiches will be the same size you want to cover that one in plastic wrap because it needs to freeze for a minimum of six hours overnight better but a minimum of six hours and whatever anything like this goes into the freezer if it's not covered it can tend to pick up the smells and the tastes of some of the other things that are in the freezer and it takes away from the deliciousness I'm going to pop that one into a freezer and I'm pretty sure I've got it quick switch that I made earlier this morning that's already frozen ping the magic of YouTube this is the one that I made earlier today you can see I've covered it nicely with some plastic wrap that is really really nice and firmly and very solidly set which is exactly what we want for an Ice Cream Sandwich because I was telling you all about that chopped mint variation and I thought it would be mean for me not to show you what it looks like I also made a batch of that mainly because I really like choc mint and I kind of feel like making something for myself but I digress let's grab our cookies and we're going to take our cutter now the ice cream is not going to be too hard to cut through but those strawberries are going to be really frozen so they're going to be really tough to cut so you'll need to really put your muscles into this one down you go pushing all the way down and then lifting back out and out comes our beautiful little core of ice cream down goes one of my cookies look at that gorgeous line of strawberries and then on goes my top cookie he looks adorable with these guys they're going to take a second to stick because that ice cream almost needs to melt just a fraction so that the cookie stick so just let them sit for about 30 seconds to a minute then put them into an airtight container and store them in the freezer until you're ready to eat them so out of that recipe you should get 24 of your finished strawberry shortcake no big ice cream sandwiches these are perfect for the changing of the seasons they're so fresh and so light and it's like a favorite dessert but then kind of rethought a little bit a little chocolate mint ones one of my husband's personal favorites and I'm definitely going to be getting into I feel like strawberry first and then mint or vice versa I'm not sure I hope you guys ever loved today's super easy no big strawberry shortcake and mint slice Ice Cream Sandwich video if you're not already subscribed to the channel make sure you do for two new videos every week and as always thanks very much for watching you 
I don't even know what kind of flower you would call this it's like I don't know I really don't know [Music] hey guys welcome back to my cupcake addiction today I'm going to share with you a fun find so a fun find is something that I find that's fun and I decided to share it with you guys a while ago Russian of piping tips took the baking world by storm and I got a set and started playing with them so I thought that I would show you some fun ways to use Russian piping tips if you haven't seen them before a Russian piping tip is like a piping tip on steroids so these guys make really cool flowers and roses and tulips and things in just one squeeze there's a few different variations of them so today I'm just going to show you six but if you want to see me try out like the bull Russian piping tips or the pointy ones or some of the other varieties in the set then let me know so I think I would recommend if you are going to get Russian piping tips if you don't need this huge set like the 24 tips set because it's kind of just variations of the tips you already have if you're going to get a set of things I highly recommend if you don't have one you should also order a leak piping tip that's any piping tip that has like this little V cut out of it because these flowers look so much better with that little bit of green to kind of make them pop we got cupcakes we got frosting we've got our piping tips so let's get into it although there's no need to be Russian see what I did that [Music] I'm going to do cupcakes you can also do to some cakes I think they look super cute on cupcakes they do come with a cup lot in the set you can use it if you like I didn't I just snip the tip off my bags shoved in the piping tip and then suck in some frosting so it's the technical term so this first one is going to be a rose piping tip this is the Russian roads and possibly one of the most popular piping tips so in a pipe a rose cupcake now if I see you here if you want to add a little bit of height to your cupcakes and I sometimes like to so I'm in the data a little bit of my green even though it's got the leaf piping tip and I'm just going to like squeeze it on and then I'm just going to kind of smooth it off with a knife really this is just to give me like a tiny bit of height on top of the cupcake so that I get a nice rounded mound of flowers and they come in a little color in the middle if your cupcake Bertie dome don't worry about this with my mound ready to go and it's green because I just wanted a bit of grass under my roses I'm just going to pipe a rose look at that through the sample we literally buy a rose in about three seconds when you're making these I actually find they turn out differently if you twist the bag a little bit if you come up a little longer if you go shorter but they seem to turn out a bit cuter when they're a little shorter and stumpy er so a digit pipe pipe twist and then like push down for a second before coming up to get that nice kind of short fat looking rose if you have any little petals like this guy so not quite doing what they're told just gently gently push them into submission you can see what I mean about needing some greenery and some leaves so I like to just go into any of my little gaps and just pipe nice little leaf they just kind of I think they just finish it off and I add that pop of extra color cupcake number one the Rose is kind of awesome and I think everyone's favorite Russian piping tip moving on so I've got my little mound and we're going to use this world so this well again works really well if you press it down quite firmly I will say you guys don't use store-bought frosting for these because it's just not honestly it just doesn't work it's too sloppy I'm going to add a couple of rooms to this one because I like it and of course the leads just around the outside of this guy I think I'm a nice big fat leaves on this one I don't mind this well let it I love it as much as I love the road just my opinion I kind of feel like I want this one to be an assortment and I think these always looks best in super vibrant colors I would like lots of different ones on the same cake popular roses they cute by themselves so this guy I don't know what it makes yet so let's try out tip number three I don't even know what kind of flower you would call this it's like I don't know I really don't know so with these guys it's kind of best if you like we eat the frosting out push it down and actually push the flagging bag down before you take it all you can give it a little twist if you want and just neaten up any of the little top edges sometimes they can get a little bit like kind of rough couple and red come on red little and a bit of yellow this one's a tulip tip so these make really pretty tulip looking flowers but it's kind of like a short fat kind of tulip they come in different sizes this one's gonna be all pink you can see there as you pipe that out you get like a bunch of scented dots and then you get the little outside area this one I mean I don't really think it needs as much of the green I'm going to add a little bit just because I've already got the green on the cupcake but it is kind of a standalone flower maybe just some little ones all right we got another yellow bag so this one should give us a slightly dainty achoo up with kind of a spinner petal something like this guy might add a few pink ones on there as well follow that she looks together it's two tulips all right super cute look they're all kind of pretty much the same thing they're all making kind of a flower but they're slightly different it's nice to have a variety finally we're going to do this guys they said like a weird triangle in the middle and then like six dots that go around the outside I actually have no idea what it's going to make huh interesting I was not expecting that you know this cupcake is going to get all of the colors and all of the flowers on these two of each and my favorite the Rose like a whole bouquet perfect so that's it our garden of Russian piping tips flower cupcakes is ready to go they all look adorable and it's really simple to use apart from recommending that you guys do get the green leaf tip so that you can add that bit of greenery I just think it really makes these cupcakes also make sure that your frosting consistencies right even before you color it it pays just to put a bit of the white frosting in a piping bag with any one of the tips it doesn't matter if the flower pulls off of the cupcake it means your frostings a bit to stick you just want to thin it down with just a little bit of milk or water but don't go too crazy because you don't want a too thin or your petals will flop anyway super fun fun I'd love to know what you guys thought of it if you want to see me do the Russian Bowl piping tips more of the Russian piping tips from the flower set or the pointy ones that are also Russian piping tips let me know and I will be coming to you with more fun fun as I find them oh if there's anything else that you found that fun let me know down below it'll be fun super fun have it all the day you guys thanks very much for watching [Music] you 
all that hand painting work go on in a second well [Music] welcome back to my cupcake addiction today I'm getting my spooky on but in kind of a cute way and we're going to make adorable candy chocolate sugar skulls or sugar candy chocolates kills their sugar skulls and they're made out of chocolate it's kind of hard to work out the things that you're going to need to make your sugar skulls you'll need some white candy melts or a compound white chocolate and you're also going to need some candy colors or oil-based food colorings you could also switch these out for pre colored candy melts in a bunch of different colors you'll need a fair few toothpicks and a few snaps your bags I'm using a skull jell-o mold but I'm using it as a chocolate mold today and I've also got some little battery-powered tea light candles and candy lots and lots of candy let's get started first up you want to mold your skull so I'm going to take plain white candy melts into my skull jello mold and I'm going to do two thin coats here spoon in a generous amount and because you've got a lot of little nooks and crannies inside your skull you're really going to want to tap it on the bench make sure it gets in all of those eye teeth and kind of cracked head holes and you want to pay particular attention to those top edges because they're the ones that are going to crack if anywhere when you go to pull this out you want it to be nice and strong once you've got your first coat in in the interest of saving chocolate you can just tip out any of your excess make sure that it's pretty evenly distributed and again those edges are nice and covered off into the fridge with that one we're going to let that set and then we're going to do another coat coming back from the fridge that should be really nice and chilled you want to do another coat paying particular attention to get it nice and thick around the eyes the teeth and that big bulbous forehead these are kind of pressure points so make sure that you've got a little more chocolate there as well as around those edges before this one goes back off into the fridge I'm going to scrape back any chocolate from those eyes you can use a knife or a spoon and then I'm just going to run my finger around them to get them as smooth as possible because I want the chocolate everywhere except the eyes I want those I've left clear pop that one back up into the fridge for at least 15 minutes so it's really nice and chilled and then pop it straight into the freezer for just five minutes that's going to snap chill it and it's going to contract it away from the outside edges of our little mold and help it to release a little bit easier once that one's nice and chilled you should just be able to gently coax it and you should be able to see that it's pulled away from that jello mold on the inside so it shouldn't really be stuck anywhere but you can just gently release those sides just to help it out a little bit I like to support it with my hands as it comes out just wouldn't have any cracking especially around those eyes there's our skull deliciously I'm gonna say perfect or almost perfect handle gently if your skull should crack or break remember you have a ton of detail on these so just glue it back together with a little bit of melted white candy and get decorating and make sure it gets a leaf or a vine or some flowers or something over it all right now it's time to decorate you have a lot of options with the decoration here I'm opting for super bright colors but regardless of what you choose you want to start with your black detail so I'm using black candy melts and I'm using a paint brush to paint the insides or the blacks or the hollows of the eyes I'm also going to paint the inside in the hollow of the nose and once I'm happy that I've got a nice coating of that black candy melt I'm gonna pop the rest into a snaps your bag and cut off a super fine tip use it like a bit of a piping bag I start by edging around all of those teeth so filling in the black and defining each of our little sugar skulls pearly whites we're going to have loads of other colors on top of this black so don't worry for blacks not absolutely perfect once you've got the eyes the nose and the mouth sorted out you can start your detailing and I prefer to do one full side and then turn it around and try to mirror image mirror imaging is actually really hard so don't be too out of yourself if both sides are not completely perfect and these guys are designed to be hand painted and hand colored so there really shouldn't be too perfect let your black outlines completely dry before starting to flood them with colour that's going to stop them from bleeding into the colors that it'll make you really pop you can pop it in the fridge for a few minutes if you like try to work one color at a time I did all of my black then all of my yellow all of my blue details and so on so that I'm not constantly trying to keep five different colors of candy melted really you can get as creative as you like yeah it does sometimes pay to have an inspiration image so that you've got something to kind of copy off and to make sure that you're getting both of your sides relatively even I want to show you guys this very carefully so that's it that's a little sugar skull all decorated keep that nice and chilled until you're ready to remove it because that chocolate can tend to be a little bit soft particularly in warmer weather and the more chilled it is the more easily you're going to be able to move it around and the less fingerprints you'll leave from here you've got options you could use them like a pinata you could fill them with cake but I decided to put mine into my little trick-or-treat container because it's going to add a really nice warm glow - what's otherwise just a container of candy so I used a container that was going to be big enough and I chose black piled candy inside and then activated two little tea light candles right behind where the eyes were going to go I added my little sugar skull straight on top and then piled more candy all around the outside edges the result is unbelievable the kids can come in with little hammers they can smash up the sugar skull eat the chocolate pieces and then dive into the candy underneath now I know this camera angle is the best for this I don't think I can do it just as trying to lift it but this is our sugar skull glowing little trick-or-treat container this is one of dozens of awesome Halloween ideas that I have on the my cupcake addiction youtube channel i'm gonna leave a link to my halloween playlist down below I have eight new ideas this year but I do load the videos every year so don't discount the ones we did last year if you're looking for really fun simple and over-the-top Halloween entertaining ideas so the ultimate judge in any situation at my house is always the kids I think we should bring them in and see what they think is it too creepy or is it just cool enough that they can't wait to get to the candy underneath hey no looking I'm okay such a pretty skeleton it is do like a.j I'm gonna smash it alright smash it Oh hand painting work go on in a second well it wasn't tasting second [Music] Wow 
[Music] welcome back to my cupcake addiction where today I'm making a cake that is actually too scary for me to properly research you guys have been requesting a stranger things cake and while I do not ever watch these types of shows because quite frankly they scared the absolute bejesus out of me I am going to make a stranger things cake for you guys today and I'm being led by your comments some Google searches that I wish I'd never made and what I've managed to source online without ever having to watch the show we're gonna make a stranger things cake [Music] the things you'll need to make your stranger things cake I found these adorable Christmas light necklaces online I'll leave a link down below they are about four dollars each optional extra but they add a lot some brown food coloring some little fairy lights with tiny battery packs chocolate ganache which i tented black a mini cake board and I ended up using two of these a black edible marker a sponge white candy melts powdered sugar some fondant I colored mine ivory or very very pale Brown a large cake board or you can build like I did straight at a cake stand some decorative light bulbs or light bulb candy jars I've also got three batches of my chocolate cake I baked each batch in an 8 inch round tin and I added a tablespoon of black food coloring before I cooked so I got like super black chocolate cake as always guys I will leave all of your measurements recipe links quantities conversions and links to handy things like this in the description box below let's get into our petrifying stranger things cake to start off with make sure each of your cake layers are the same height and relatively flat on top cut each cake layer in half so you end up with 6 same size layers of cake and you can build this on a cake board but I found a cool spooky tall black cake stand I'm going to build directly on that down goes my cake and then a thin layer of black ganache another layer of cake and another layer of black ganache don't make these layers of ganache because we're not going to add a central support so you don't want to divulge out the sides once you've got all of your cake layers on you can put a nice thin crumb coat of black and ash all the way around the outside edge and on the top pop that up into the fridge for about 20 minutes to let it set and then come back and put a second coat of black and ash all over the outside I mean use an offset spatula you can also use a ruler here to get it nice and smooth what you should have is a nice black as night whole smooth ganache cake with black cake layers in between I'm going to put that off into the fridge while we make some of our topper details for your little light bulbs these guys here are little candy jars and I just used a knife to call out the very very bottom they've got a tiny hole but you can make that a little bit bigger so you can get your light strands through the others that I found are different shapes and sizes and these are actually Christmas ornaments so they've got quite a large hole at the bottom when choosing your little lights go with one with a copper wire I folded mine to make three so each of my filament light bulbs got two kind of long skinny sections of light and then I tied the copper wire around to make it look like one it's supposed to look like the two spiky bits of the inside of a light bulb take a nice bowl of your ivory fondant and your smallest cake board this one for me is the three inch you could use a little cardboard here and just push it down so that it makes a small mound a little bit of white candy melts to secure in place and I'm going to put the three of my light bulbs pressed into that fondant but secure it in place with a bit of that white candy melt something like this we literally crafted light bulbs I know take your ivory fondant now and I'm going to sprinkle down a generous amount of just powdered sugar so it doesn't stick to the bench because this is such a tall cake I'm not going to get you guys to cover it in one big piece that's difficult at the best of times but super hard on a cake this tall you want a piece that's going to go around the outside and only as high as the cake because we're going to trim it off and have a black top moist in the cake I just used some paper towel and a little bit of water or sugar syrup and then you want to stand your rolling pin up alongside the cake and wrap that large long piece of fondant around it smooth that fondant on either using your hands or a fondant smoother and then you want to run a pizza cutter the bottom edge to get a really nice neat cut against either your cake border in my case the cake stand leave the top as it is I'm going to take a sharp knife and wear my fondant overlaps at the back I'm just going to slide the knife down and I should make a nice cut between both layers which enables me to have a relatively neat seam on the back with your fondant overlap on top take a super sharp knife and just trim it so that you've basically got a flat line in line with your ganache top layer be really careful here it sometimes helps to cut off the excess before going and be a nice neat line take that 9-inch cake board now it's ever so slightly larger than my cake even after it's been covered in fondant and all it can - and I'm just going to use it as a bit of a rough measure to cut a top circle of fondant so wrong you're falling out not too thin and use the board as a guide to cut a nice disc mark out kind of a wide circle on the inside of your disc and drag the back of a circle cutter through you want to create a lot of drag here so it looks like it's been ripped or torn I'm kind of trying to make the ripped effect the look of the portal that did one of the walls so I've researched in stranger things gently place that over the top of your cake in line with your fondant and just use your fingers to smooth it off so you've got a nice neat seam and that top disc sits beautifully flush against the cake I want my filament light bulb centerpiece to be a completely standalone feature so I'm going to take a second cake board roll a bit of fondant out onto it still in that ivory and then cut a little well for the button battery pack to live I cannot stress enough how important it is for you to remove this before the cake is served button batteries and wiring are definitely not something you want getting into your cake so by making this a completely separate standalone illusion and by sandwiching those button batteries in between two thick cardboard cake boards we avoid the risk of having them go anywhere into anyone's pieces of cake use all of those off cuts from tearing away at that top piece they should be jagged ripped and quite ghastly looking and use some water to attach them to the outside edge covering up any of the joins between the two boards you kinda want to peel them back a bit so it looks like the portal in stranger things kind of like some things be just busted through the top of the cake now it doesn't quite look like something's just busted through the top of our cake yet so I've microwaved a little of my excess black ganache and I'm just going to paint over my black fondant on the top there so I've got this like big black kind of gross textured excess in the center underneath those filament light bulbs I've got a few different size paintbrushes here I'm literally just going to paint finally a couple of kind of long crack marks in the top of that ivory fondant to complete portal of the monster the only part of this I'm not going to cover in ganache is again where I can see that little button battery pack I don't want anyone getting confused here so I definitely want to be able to see that poking out at the very back of my cake a so that I can turn my little feature on and off but B so that it is noticeable if not hidden I'm going to divide my cake into kind of thirds this bottom section I'm going to make look like the wooden wall or the wooden bottom half of the wall and the top section is going to be that bottle kind of brown ivory patterned wallpaper to make mood wouldn't look I'm going to use my smoother or something of the same size just didn't measure around from the cake board all the way up so that I've got a nice even line I'm just going to mark that out in a few locations then you want something not too tall here so I'm actually using this weird it's like a wooden spoon but it's got an edge on it that's not super sharp the back of a knife would work I like something like this if you've got a tool you can score it but I'm just going to use that to come around and just make nice firm indents be warned fondant tends to spring back a little bit so make them firm once I'm happy that I've got my planks of what I'm going to use my knife and I'm going to do like the front section that's super sharp make a few little scores in the wood and then I'll turn it over and I'll use the back section so I've got some sort of more blunt ones don't worry about too much texture here finally going to take a thin strip quite a thin strip this is going to make like the border between the wooden wall and the wallpaper I'm going to wrap that around the top of my wood detail and paint the whole lot with a little brown food coloring mixed with just a little bit of water or alcohol I'm gonna kind of sponge now and I wanted to look almost like a small flower it doesn't have to be exact that I'm going to use that like a stamp to stamp the little brown floral detailing all over my ovary wall we're getting really close so our wall is done a portal is done our spooky filament light bulbs done all that is left to do now is put on creepy lettering and then wrap around our Christmas lights my creepy lettering I want to do three rows I've got a little reference image so that I don't mess it up and I'm also going to start in the center of each row so for me I know that my first row is going to be de NS I'll start with E with the DNF on either side which saves me starting a here and then either getting too far or not far enough always started the middle with lettering now you could use an edible marker here but I decided the effect of my black ganache there's actually a lot more what it would actually look like so I'm going to hand paint my nine in ganache and using the second I saw this creepy wall on my very first Google search there was no way I would be watching this show we are so close all that's left to do is to drape our Christmas lights like I said these are necklaces they're at four dollars each I think they're a must-have for this cake I'm not going to fix them to anything again these are something that need to come off so make sure that if you are serving these people know that the little light bulbs are not edible it is the risk that we run whenever we use a non edible element in an edible cake all it live to do is light it up what did you just what's a lot you just turn them off oh no it's going on everything will yeah it's dark it's creepy and I can hear noises whatever make this cake what just happened I still flat out refused to watch it but I think I've managed to do a pretty good job of capturing stranger things in cake form this one's a little too scary for me to think about bringing my kids into so we're gonna leave it there I hope you guys have enjoyed my tribute to stranger things for all of those that enjoy I hope you love it for all of those like me I just wouldn't Google it it's it's kind of petrifying it looks like the scariest thing that I have ever even just seen Google Images off don't watch stranger things it's there's no need there's no need but make this cake because it's awesome and share it with

choose to subscribe you can hover over the little alarm next for the subscribe button up to receive a notification so you guys get an email free to your inbox every single time I upload a new video in today's video I'm reworking one of the recipes from my new cookbook sweet celebrations in the book I show you how to make this really cool whimsical rustic tree-stump cake a part of my rustic romance chapter I've turned this cake into a really fun woodland cake but today what are you turning it into a fairy house and not just any fairy the queen of fairies Tinkerbell and friends in a cake I'm going to build my cake today on a wooden slab you can get these really cheap online I've also got some chocolate ganache dark candy melts or compound dark chocolates parchment paper a cute little fairy door tic-tac red M&amp;M white candy melts I've got some straws and a five inch cake board some fun candy rock crushed white cookies you can use any some green food coloring and I've got my thinkable figurines your renewed flowers I'm looking for fresh and super bright colors you're gonna need four six inch cake so if you've got my recipe book that's two batches of my classic chocolate cake mix and each pack is baked in to 6-inch cake tins I'll also link to that recipe down below let's get into our fairy house cake and you can see the fairies behind me are getting upset all kinds of mischief so before they completely trash my kitchen I think we better get started I'm going to start by carving the very bottom and then also the top of my cake and then I'm going to divide them in half so you should end up with about eight one inch high six inch round cake loads I'm building on my wooden cake board it's a few if you want to put anything down like a piece of parchment but I'm going to use a six inch cake board should say that most cake itself doesn't actually touch the base now normally this guy I would say is unacceptable because it's kind of the right height but it's really rounded but don't worry you've got one that's slightly less imperfect because that can be used to make our roots the other one we're going to stack and layer with ganache in between so a little ganache down on the board and then first layer of cake a small amount of ganache in between and then another layer do that improve your four layers of cake so whenever you have quite a tall cake I say as soon as you over like five layers of cake we're going to use some supports to start the top waves of our cake crushing the bottom so I've got the milkshake straws IKEA straws are also really good for them they're kind of fat and they work like an egg so if you pull them that way they're not that strong but end-to-end they're actually really tough and they're super simple to cut I always use straws of supports because there's so much easier to cut than the wooden dowel before I cut them I'm just going to pull them up a fraction just so that they hide kind of inside the cake instead of poking at the top unevenly a little more ganache and then in goes my centreboard this is really standard practice whenever you're making a multi-storey cake but do make sure that if you're dropping it off at a party or serving it that you let people know that those four straws and a board in the middle so they can remove it prior to serving another layer of cake and you stack until you've got all seven you can find all of these stacking layering and tearing instructions in this we've celebrated cookbooks over to watch them here in this video of course now that we've reached the peak or the pinnacle of our cake just cover the whole thing in chocolate ganache and then we can pop it off into the fridge about 15 minutes to set before that one goes off into the fridge I'm going to take my not so desirable cake layer so we're calling ugly because no cake is ugly he's a little bit unique and then I'm just going to cut it basically like a great big pie you can kind of take like some of the edges of your pie and you're going to create makeshift tree roots so basically just push it up against the side of what will eventually be out Tinkerbell tree this is just one of the recipes that I show you guys in the sweet celebrations cookbooks however as well as super fun new ideas it also incorporates really fun drinks in DIY so you guys get into the question of what do you do once the cake made how do you kind of elevate it that little bit more to create an entertaining extravaganza or if you just want to make a cake you can bake at about this point I'm going to stick my fairy door on it's up to you if you want to make this out of like a fondant or out of gum paste so I'm just using a store-bought fairy door as make sure it's washed and dried thoroughly and I'm just going to press it into the ganache think about has an entrance now just a little bit of ganache on each of those route and again don't worry if this is not a super neat coat because we're going to cover all of this with bark and tree matter well back to the fridge chilling out I'm going to show you guys a pretty funny trick I'm all about saving you time money and stop you from having to buy fancy equipment so while you can buy a blast impression that for fondant about thirty or forty dollars will you do the same thing with parchment paper and a little chocolate take your parchment perfectly good parchment and screw it up we're not throwing it in the bin you want to unscrew it and voila you have texture we made our own impression mat my book is full of fun time-saving and cost saving tips just like this one all right I'm going to take my chocolate now like I said you can either use a dark candy melt or a compound chocolate either dark or milk is fine and then you just want to spread it if it has cocoa butter anywhere in the ingredients list it basically means that it won't stay set at room temperature it'll just look like it's melting but what it really needs is to be tempered on goes my other piece of parchment move it off and then we roll up into the fridge about five minutes it's not going to take very long to set it all five minutes later we're back from the fridge and this is what you should have don't worry butt cracks it's kind of supposed to we've made a whole lot of pieces of tree bark so let's get our cake out of the fridge because I've let that cake kind of set it makes it really nice and firm to work on but you'll need to put just a little more ganache on the outside so it's sticky again you also want to put a nice amount of ganache on the top and then we're going to run the back of it soon through the top to give it like a gift kind of like a wooden log effect something like that now that I've got my fresh coat of ganache I'm going to start with my longer pieces of that chocolate and you want to make sure that they just come a little bit over the top so you can see them kind of like poking up over the top of the top of your log your smaller pieces in a nebula scrapping it to just cover the roots in some ways we've got gap big or small try and get as close together as you can but we are going to join it all together with a little more chocolate don't make this cake if you don't like chocolate my advice also don't come to my house if you don't like chocolate well that's not fair if you at least like white chocolate you can come to make your little mushrooms you're going to use red M&amp;Ms or peanut M&amp;Ms and white tic tacs just a cat a tic-tac to the base of each little M make sure the M is not showing and let them set and then use a little to speak to put little white stars on top of each of your mushroom I took just a regular cookie and Oreo whatever you like dipped it in some of those dark candy melts or compound dark chocolate and then place it onto a piece of parchment while the chocolate still wet stick your fairy in to the chocolate so she's held in place then you want a bigger spoon and put like a generous blob of that leftover chocolate and make almost like an ice cream cone shape that's going to stab into the side of the cake and the little cookie is going to be a platform this is not a must but I think it really adds the most super cute so I'm going to carve a little guide hole where I want each of my side fairy maybe about there and then press it right into the side of the cake and then one on the other side just bear in mind it so if you're going in this bottom layer you've got straws in there and make so you're not exactly where your middle peg board is so just drop hopefully they'll get out of the way now you guys might think that that's done but if you leave it like that those little bits of bars are going to start falling off and we can do better so I'm going to use my remaining in the compound chocolate or candy melt I'm just going to paint and that's going to bring everything together which is delicious glue when starting to bring it all together so I'm going to make a little moss just by using some crushed white cookie anywhere cooking you like and it snaps your bag and a little bit of some leaf green into the snap sealed bag there's my cookies I've got a paste but it is actually easier to do with a liquid food coloring because it just distributes better but it will still work with a pen shake it all about money to massage the paste through a little bit just to let it distribute and then shake them off something a little bit like this we made moths and it's actually delicious let's take a moment to appreciate the fact that I actually found a tiny shovel that interest food it's all take a minute it's kind of cool all right don't even need a spoon I just wanted to use my Conny shovel so I'm going to take a little bit more of my dark melted chocolate and then just apply it like randomly to the roots of my tree and then sprinkle on a little month add a bit of green Tinkerbell's overseeing my project management hands are on hips I don't know she's impressed now adding flowers to a cake this can be kind of a point of difference depending on how you want to add them I wanted to use a little edible like solid flowers but I couldn't find them anywhere they're actually really hard to find so I'm going to use real flowers I don't want to do a big pile on top I kind of want them sticking out and around all over my log so we're going to use straws to stop the flower stems from touching the cake the straw is essentially going to act like a little tiny v's almost inside our cake work out where you want your flowers to go you can pop the straw and it should go straight through or you can pick a gap between your chocolate trim it off and then in goes some flowers you don't really want to see the straw just kind of hidden in there and then in goes some of our little flowers it's so pretty Tinkerbell can sit on top she's kind of the boss of everything anything I want to move around I'm just going to put a little chocolate on the base of she can be our door girl she decides to gets into Tinkerbell tough good person to know a few more flowers a couple little mushrooms down under my flower they can heed to go straight into the ganache or you can use a little bit more of that melted chocolate or candy melt to attach just to add a little bit of greenery I'm going to use some basil and some mint kind of like the way they smell to add a little bit of freshness but just to get a little bit of real living greenery just around the roots I'm not going to lie I kind of want to live in this little berry lads would think about two of the girls I thought we're just going to be too much but I love this cake because you can pop off all of your little fairies have them out as a favor of course the birthday boy or girl gets think about because she's the guest of honor but all of this started from a very rustic wedding elegant looking love cake I love looking at things differently I love giving you guys multiple uses for things if you haven't already got a copy of the sweet celebration cookbook it is on sale now and it literally has tons of these ideas what do you guys think I've been making this think about cake well I don't care what walks around you can add a few little rocks around you wanna get some to Jacob to add around as well oh you tiny these ones because these ones candy but then you can't eat no more just candy well Wow yeah should we cut it everybody always wonders how you cut a cake like this because of the board in the middle you can actually cut it like two separate eggs like a cupcake find a bottom cake why should I cut boy that I want to cut it's your party I don't want to cut Tinkerbell now Rocky's painting a rocky stinking earthquake ladies earthquake yeah paper say to the face paint yeah I hope you guys have enjoyed today's video make sure you subscribe for new videos every week and as always thanks very much for watching [Music] 
I'm going to choose the white rabbit that's perfect because you're always late [Music] [Music] welcome back to my cupcake addiction I'm Elise strong and today I'm taking you guys down the rabbit hole and we are going to be up against the clock for a very important date we are cake popping Alice in Wonderland [Music] pops you're going to need cake I chose chocolate also some ganache you'll need red candy melts white candy melts some decorative straws some cake pop sticks some toothpicks candy colors these are either oil-based or powder based colors that we can use for coloring chocolate luster dust some paintbrushes a little vodka or you can use pure lemon extract here an edible pen snaps your bags parchment paper scissors black candy melts white fondant a couple of cookie cutters and a little tape you'll also need some pictures of your different Alice characters and you guys can choose if you want to make all of these if you just want to make a few I'll leave a link to that template down below first up you'll want to crumble all of your cake just by hand into a bowl I'm using my chocolate cake pop recipe I will leave that one down below and I've got a bunch of different cake pop recipe options in the my cupcake addiction cookbook sweet celebrations which I'll link to down below add in your ganache and then stir and stir until it comes together in a really nice chocolaty cake pop door you do need to get pretty hands on as you get to the final stages of mixing and really once you're done your cake pop dough should resemble almost like a cookie dough let's start rolling our shapes I'm going to do two just straight out balls they're going to be for our Cheshire Cat so just to stand it about an inch round ball Alice is going to be a slightly different shape I'm going to take my regular cake pop ball and then I'm going to smoosh it and just kind of shape it so it's a bit of a teardrop but with a slightly flattened waist this is going to be a waist and that's the bottom of our skirts the white rabbit is not going to be a ball so I'm taking quite a bit of my cake pop dough and I'm just going to kind of compact it and then fallout it out and cut out my circles which is going to give me a nice but with a super nice flat edge perfect for a clock so starting with a ball again I'm going to kind of flatten it down I want like a round base and then just using my fingers I'm just going to shape like the top of a teacup so kind of flattening out the top of keeping that nice round bottom to make a cute little teacup sheet for Tweedledum and Tweedledee and tweedledumber depending on what you think of them again I'm going to do the little round cake pop ball but I mean I sort of take this one out to a bit of an oval and flatten it and what I want to make here is almost like the bottom half of a very round person - any feet so I'm making like a like a half circle that's flat on top then finally for my Queen of Hearts I'm gonna do a very similar shape to that rounded bottom of Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee then I'm going to come in with a knife and just cut like a little V so that I can give her like it's kind of gonna make the bloomers that she wears underneath her little skirts or dresses something like this all of my little Wonderland shapes a roll but I want to put those into the fridge for at least 20 minutes before I try to dip them or put them on stick once you're happy that your little pops are sufficiently chilled they should feel cool but still slightly be able to press out of shape it's time to put in all of our lollipop sticks so i've pre-colored my candy melts the red ones were already red and the white one's already white then I added a little green candy color a little blue candy color a little pink candy color and a little bit of purple only a really little bit of purple because he's just for decoration I'm going to take my various colors of candy now and I'm going to dip my little pops starting with my little clocks which are going to be using my white so I just dip in about 1/2 to 3/4 of an inch into my white candy melt and then place it straight into the top and with these guys I'm going to keep them laying flat because I want to retain all the shapes that we work so hard to achieve blue for my little Alice's pink for my Cheshire Cat this one's actually the one that I think is the cutest my little teacups gonna be green but because Mad Hatter is completely and utterly bonkers it's also going to be upside down and then read on the bottoms of may Tweedledee and Tweedledum and of my Queen of Hearts into the flat tops of the round bottoms one thing to play careful attention to on all of these is to make sure that your cake pop sticks are as straight as possible just so that they're not leaning when we finish off because we're laying these down and not standing them up it can be kind of hard to tell perfect off into the fridge just for five minutes so that we can chill all of those seals and then they're ready to death it's time to dip I've also got some little decorative straws and in my opinion these add a ton to your finished product so I'm going to start with my little clocks or stopwatches and while I'm laying them all down to let them set like that when I actually go to dip them I'm going to stand them up so they're all straight dipping into my white with my little clock making sure that I cover that seal getting rid of any excess and then I'm going to place it down so it sort of forms a little foot underneath onto my parchment paper well that one's still wet I'm just going to dip the tiniest little bit of the end of my straw in that candy melt and I'm going to drop it down over the cake pop stick and it's going to stick into that freshly dipped little pop next we're going to dip Alice so we take our little blue ones making these seals colour-coded actually really kind of helps remember which shape goes with which character she's going to be my little blue and dark blue stripes draw my little Cheshire cats will be pink green for my little teacups and then my little red buts Red's always for some reason a bit thicker than all the other ones so notice I like to give it either a little tap on the bench or a good stir before I start my dipping dipping the first of my butt's I decide to do Tweedledum and Tweedledee different colors because then at least I'll be able to tell them apart then the Queen's bloomers there's a first as you set the Queen's bloomers you'll actually be making like a little set of kind of like little feet for the bloomers that really make it look like it is a pair of bloomers all of my pops are dipped so I've put a little bit of my green as well as my purple and then a little pink in two snaps your bags so that I can pipe a few of our details with the green you're going to pipe some little handles for our teacups so I'm just going to snip off a very small little corner I'm just going to pipe a few kind of like curly questionmark shapes pipe a few of these because some are going to fit different cups a little bit better and if any of them break you've got spares and then I'm going to do the same with my pink and we're going to pipe like some very thin knitting needles that are going to go into the ball of twine that our Cheshire cats playing with it's not really from the movie but cats and twine just kind of work together so I'm going to take my cake pop and over my little piece of parchment here I'm basically going to go back and forth really really quickly streaking in all different directions to make my cake pot look like it's a ball of twine if you guys have a choice as to which cake pop you're actually going to choose take this one it's got like three times as much chocolate on it something like that we're starting to finish off some of these guys so I'm going to start by painting some details on my Queen's bloomers with an edible marker I'm just going to paint some little black hearts I like that I think it adds a little bit of comedic value and then cut around your little template and we will stick the top half of the Queen onto her bloomers and Queenie's done for tweedledum and tweedledee we're going to take one black candy melt literally just one and slice through it and then slice through it again we're gonna make little feet for our Tweedledum and Tweedledee I'm just gonna dip each foot into a tiny bit of candy melt just the edge and slide it up against our little characters feet and then sticking on my little templates with a little bit of tape Tweedledum and tweedledumber I mean 20 what are you done what is this is this the you're done you finish with that what about moron Tweedledum I'm not gonna stand up with no legs is he okay now it's just like new yeah he's all better like a ball of twine sentencer have our little knitting needles so I'm gonna use just a teeny tiny bit of my pink and stick my knitting needles into my bowl of twine and then my chair shake out on top just using a little bit of tape there little Cheshire Cat oh those guys are gonna be some of your easiest ones and now we need a little bit of fondant to work on our others so I'm just gonna roll my phone and out the first thing a minute cut is a nice circle and then I'm just gonna use my knife to take like a couple of little chips out of the sides of the saucer and then I'm going to use the back of my smaller circle cutter and that's just gonna be pushed in to kind of make the indent of where the teacup is held in this also you take a little Bowl or something and just set that little sauce up upside down and ideally you'd leave this for like 12 hours to 24 hours and it would sit quite firm with that really nice little raised saucer edge on it if you don't have time to sleep in flat and still be fine next up we're gonna roll out Alice's skirt she basically just gets one piece of fondant and kind of like a bit of a triangle shape to make it a little skirt because Disney Princesses or Disney characters have impossibly small waists I've got my little template handy so that I'm kind of getting it about the same size it's still miles too big eat something Alice God have a bit of cake I mean use a little water on the back of the skirt just to attach it I want to trim that just below a little bottom line of our skirt and then we can pop Alice straight on top using a little bit of tape judging by the size of our waist a very little bit of tape ah her legs Jake about her legs evil leg eating baby oh it can't be finished for though you can't just eat everybody legs and then be finished literally just eating the legs okay she won't stand up oh poor Alice she'll never walk like she did before our final fondant roll for this guy I'm gonna create like a long white strip of fondant which is going to make the nice rigid edge that will actually get a paint gold for the outside of our clock a little bit more water on the back of our white fondant I like to cut like a little angle of each of the ends so that I can curl it around when I get to the top place my pop in the middle and perfect so there's my little round clock with its little edging I'm gonna add some little black edible marker numbers and then a tiny bit of that red candy melt for the hands finally I take a little bit of luster dust and mix it with that tiny bit of vodka and then paint the outside and edible gold I'm gonna let that one dry before I do anything else or add my little rabbit but that's essentially finished and then finally we can just finish off a little mad had a teacup so I've got my teacup I've got a little bit of the melted candy melt and I'm choosing one of my handles that I think is the cutest and then I'm just going to apply the hand we're using a tiny bit of the candy melt and then stick on my mad Heather and then on to his little pre-prepared saucer if you want to add a bit of candy melt so that it sticks feel free her little water which in you a very merry unbirthday is our Mad Hatter finally we can stick our white rabbit on top of our little stopwatch and that completes our little set of Alice in Wonderland cake pops we've cake popped one of my all-time favorite childhood movies despite the fact that I'm not really fond of the Cheshire Cat and I think the bunny's obnoxious this is still one of the coolest movies that I ever saw growing up and it stalls a very special place in my heart the very last thing that I want to do is just trim off the straws because all of your stores may or may not be a different heights different sizes depending on what brands layer we're done we have literally cake popped Alice Wonderland and all of the friends and foes that she makes along the way I hope you guys enjoyed

hey guys welcome back to my cupcake addiction today I'm excited to be teaming up with Yowie in a sponsored video to show you guys their new rescue series 26 adorable characters all with nature inspired toys inside if you haven't seen a yard before they're basically a super cute sometimes angry sometimes mischievous sometimes a little dopey looking character they all have their own personalities and when you open them up they're the best of both worlds something to eat and something to play with the thing I love about Yowies is their personality on the inside it's kind of different to their personality on the outside everyone's a little bit different inside you've got a little container with a surprise and when we open it up if I got a little tiny is that an AMA dealer let me take a look this is part of the rescue series so they're all gonna be nature-inspired a Chinese penguin I didn't even know a Chinese Pangolin existed super scaly super weird they've got that right so every Yowie teaches you a little bit more about nature and you're always excited to have teamed up with the Wildlife Conservation Society so every Yowie eat does a little bit of good for the planet what's gonna be inside Yowie number 2 oh but I have the hippopotamus with built-in sunscreen so I promised I was gonna show you how to make a Yowie desert and when I looked online there were literally none of these so I'm pretty sure we're gonna be the first I'm gonna show you how to make a surprise inside surprise inside yowee surprise cup with a cupcake on top of course I'm gonna build my Yowie desserts in these little plastic kind of disposable wine glasses I'm gonna start by making some blue jelly or jello and I'm gonna add in the hot water but then cool it down really rapidly using about four pieces of ice I'm not gonna go the full amount of water because I want it to be a little thicker and once that ice is melted you can take a tablespoon of that jello and pour it into each of your I'm gonna make six wine glasses put those ones into the fridge to chill while those guys are chilling it's time to meet your maker this guy let's see what's inside the anticipation what is this it's this little news guy right I got a read about this guy who's the murky ooze making drunken they make it their special business to seek out fresh sparkling rivers and streams to ooze into until everything is so murky and dark that no one can see and nothing can live there the ooze is bad the use is pollution eeny meeny miny you all right this guy chocolate delicious of course a rhino a black rhinoceros horn high speed herbivore you do not want to meet one of these out on the plains of Africa we're gonna make some little trees so I've melted some dark chocolate and I'm gonna put it into a zip seal bag and just snip off a very small tip I'm gonna pipe onto some parchment paper some really messy rough kind of tree trunks but I'm just gonna give them a little point at the bottom so they're easy to shove into my cupcakes I'm gonna give them sort of these little spikes on top that kind of look like tree branches just to hold everything together and then I've also got some white chocolate that I've melted you could use green candy melts here but I'm gonna do white chocolate and then use a candy coloring in both blue and yellow to kind of get my nice green color again into a zip sealed bag and snip the tip off and I'm gonna use this to pipe like really messy squiggles all over the tops of those tree trunks to make the top of a tree and I'm gonna finish them off with some little red round candies or sprinkles to kind of make them look like apple trees and give them a bit of color let those guys set at room temperature and for the last five minutes you can put them in the fridge but make sure they're really well set at room temperature first so they don't curl up and contract so our jello setting and our trees are chilling out I'm gonna open another Yowie pink my favorite color no no y-you weren't first this guy look so happy my kids are gonna be so dirty at me for opening all of these without them I'm trying to guess these animals but this one is it like a number a number that was a good guess a bat that can't fly a number I've baked cupcake mix in a muffin pan and you want it quite large so it's about the same size as the top of your wine glass and it sits nicely I'm gonna frost these up to make them look kind of like freshly plowed dirt you want to start by putting some chocolate cookies into a zip sealed bag and then just smash them up until they're kind of roughly crushed and then I'm gonna add just a little chocolate frosting and kind of smear it mostly all over the cupcake I'm gonna just card that cupcake with those crushed cookies and voila we've got our freshly plowed garden cupcakes waiting for their trees once they set all right you're in my way so we're gonna have to open you and see what's inside a Lima I think he's a Lima no a la Gibbon a loud strong swinger I've never heard of Allah given so I'm interested to find out more so it's time to put our yaoi deserts together the blue in the bottom is the Billabong where the fabled Yowie is said to have existed so he's gonna sit in there on his little jell-o Billabong base kind of trapped but also just waiting for us to eat him actually really cute and my trees all set and ready to put into the cupcakes so I'm gonna put the trees in the cupcakes before I put them on top of my little yaoi cups so just pull your trees off and gently well they're still nice and cold press them straight down if you've got a relatively solid cake you may like to use a knife to just make a small guide hole my cakes are super fresh and super soft so I'm going straight it enough tree trunk poking out the top to be realistic but enough in the cupcake to actually support the weight of the top of the tree I will mention with these trees that you need to either use a candy melt or a compound chocolate that doesn't contain the ingredient cocoa butter if you want your trees to say set at room temperature and not have to be refrigerated for this one I'm gonna use just a mason jar lid as kind of a little cupcake stand I'm just gonna upturn it on the top of each of my Yowies and you should do this only when your cupcakes are in position so this is my take on a fun Yowie dessert I've got the blue representing a pond or Billabong the Yowie is hidden inside with chocolate inside and a surprise inside we've got our cupcake on top covered in its delicious cookie dirt and then our little trees for the nature aspect of the rescue series of Yowie characters so when it comes time to serve lift remove yeah we out jello at the bottom to eat let's see what's inside this guy it's like a desert with the desert with the desert with a toy everything a camel with two humps all he asked me the other day can a camel have three humps I was like I'm pretty sure or not can a camel with one hump store more water than a camel with two humps this is the bactrian camel a two humped herbivore you didn't think I was not gonna open the rest of my Yowies did you I'm super curious as to what the rest of my rescue series look like well the rest of my twelve it's a bird it's a weird-looking bird I don't know what this bird is a southern ground hornbill loud on the ground sounds a bit like me a lion king of the jungle Jacob would love this he loves lions this reminds me of my childhood Yahweh's have been around in Australia for years what is this Nash the tiger tooth tree chomping grumpkins and starting to think that grumpkins and not necessarily a good thing what do we got inside this one ooh oh it's like a small house so it's not just animals this is actually really cool this is I get cleverly constructed from breads turn the desert yet keeps Rumble cool on those blazing summer days and warm on frosty winter nights my lucky last Yowie is of course the pink one Pink's my favorite another lion this is perfect cuz now I don't have to choose who gets the lion they can both have one I hope you guys enjoyed this take on a Yowie desert and a big thanks to Yahweh for teaming up with me on today's video have a great day guys see you next time [Music] 
hey guys it's a Leeson welcome back to my cupcake addiction today we're going to be making another one of my famous no bake tarts as usual this one uses minimal ingredients there's just five today and it's going to be ready in less than 30 minutes these are fabulous if you want to whip them up at the last minute and I have a ton of new baked tarts on my youtube channel so I will leave a link down below to the playlist in case this one's not quite what you're looking for today's tart is going to be a Toblerone tart the things that you're going to need to recreate york Toblerone tart i've got some milk chocolate and i've also got a large Toblerone and many many small ones i've got some crushed white cookies you can use any white cookie you like anything from a graham cracker a shortbread pretty much whatever's on sale i've got a little bit of butter it doesn't matter if that's salted or unsalted and i've got some heavy cream or whipping cream I'm gonna be making mine today in a 9 inch tart pan with a removable base let's get started the first thing you want to do is you're going to melt your butter down and pour it over your cookie crumbs and stir it all the way through I mean leave all of your quantities and conversions on the my cupcake addiction comm website so if you want to recreate this recipe you can go and print that recipe out there you want to stir this through and look depending on the type of cookie you use you can have different levels of absorbency it just changes depending on how dry the cookie is whether it's a shortbread as opposed to like a graham cracker so you're looking for the consistency of wet sand take my measurements but if you feel you need to add a little more butter get it to that wet sound consistency so that you know that you've got the right consistency what you really want is when you pick it up and give it a squeeze it holds its shape curl like a cake pop dough or something but you don't want it to be crumbling apart you really need to be holding its shape in goes my base mixture and I always make a ton of base because I'm a bit of a sucker for the crunch that it gives to the tart but it also makes it a bit more stable particularly because we're not baking it don't worry it flattens down and you want to make sure that you're compacting it really really firmly as you're compacting it you also want to let it kind of slide up the sides and the edges and can pack those down let it get nice and jagged up there because we're going to neaten it off and get a really nice shell line to our top as a rule to the thicker you make the base the less money you need to spend on Tobler ins to fill it up once I'm happy that it's pretty nicely compacted I'm going to use just the base of a glass so this one's like a science beaker just to push down which also helps to compact those edges with any no-bake you've got to have a strong base or else it's going to crack and crumble so the firmer you can push and the more you can compact it the more stability we give the top now that I'm happy with the compacting in the policeman of my base I'm just going to run my knife all the way around the top edge you see how lovely and neat it makes our top edge I'm going to put my top base now off into the fridge it's time to make our fillings I'm just removing all my cookies from my makeshift cookie holder and if you guys follow me on the my cupcake addiction Instagram you probably already saw this idea in this photo and some of you guys even guess what I was making so I've got my chocolate in a bowl I'm just gonna break up my large candy bar all right over goes my whipping cream this one's going to go into the microwave on 30-second intervals and I'm going to stir in between each microwave until it's really nice and smooth won't be completely smooth because you'll have your little chunks of honey new guard in there so my tart shell it doesn't need to be really particularly cold I'm just starting the chilling process and my turbo rone mixture is really nice and smooth except for some lovely lumps of almonds and honey nougat I'm gonna pour that straight into my tart base I feel like I'd also just dip strawberries into this and just eat it as it is smells amazing just using the back of my spoon just to spread it all the way out to the edges couple of laptop and then off into the fridge for 10 minutes before we decorate your Toblerone base now should have kind of formed almost like a little bit of a skin but it's just going to be firm enough that you can start laying your Toblerone on top I chose to cover mine in Toblerone but if you don't want to have that much Stabler on the top of your tart you could also put some nice little drops of frosting or fresh cream around the outside with just a piece of Toblerone on each I always tend to go over the top with these things I love this idea I love it because it's so incredibly easy but it looks really difficult so it's one of the kind of cheap desserts that you can whip up in half an hour and everybody thinks you feed in the kitchen all day I hope you liked today's video if you're not already subscribed to the channel make sure you do for two new videos every week and as always guys thanks very much for watching 
kind of murder a murder is a cake chick [Music] [Music] welcome back to a very spooky my cupcake addiction where today we're going to make cake with heart literally a cake with a heart a bleeding heart the things you're going to need to make your bleeding heart cake I've got some red candy melts you also need some cake I'm using my red velvet cake and I'll leave a link to that recipe down below I baked a double batch in three 8-inch cake tins I've got some white chocolate some cream a batch of my buttercream frosting I'll leave a link to that one down below a heart either chocolate or jello mold some red food coloring and a jagged murderous looking knife first up we're going to make our heart so I'm using a traditional jello mold or jelly mold and I'm going to use it as a chocolate mold today I'm gonna make a hollow heart so I'm gonna take my red candy melts spoon them in I'm spooning my heart and because it's got all of these like super gross little I'm gonna save veins and arteries and things you want to make sure that you really push it into all of the little crevices so that you don't lose any of the functions of your heart give it a good coating and then you can tip out any excess because we're going to do two thin coats here rather than one thick one this is crews tidy up around the outside edges I'm just going to use the back of a knife and then that one can go off into the fridge don't worry if you've got some little kind of clear bed so you can see through it again we're going to do a second coat so set it in the fridge five minutes and then another coat of that candy melt goes on top ah someone died in here I'm going to pour my cream over my chocolate give it a little stir through and then that's going to go off into the microwave for one minute intervals stirring in between you should only need about two to three minutes max on this once you're happy that there's no more lumps in your ganache then just add some red food coloring so you get a really nice rich vibrant red ganache brewing up some devilish delights your ganache should look nice and smooth and we read cover that with some plastic wrap and pop it off to the side to start setting and then you want to do a second coat on your heart the first coat of my heart has set but I've still got some little clear spots where I can actually see through so you want to do a second coat to make sure that you have a completely covered heart and so that doesn't crack when you try to pull it out I'm going up a little lesson this time and it will actually set a bit quicker because the chocolate on the inside is already cold again out goes any excess and then just clean up the top edge back off into the fridge to set it's time to carve our cakes so my cakes are chilled because it just makes for easier carving and I'm just going to trim off the very outside edge and any caramelization and then level off the tops reveal that lovely red cake underneath once your sides top and bottom are trimmed then you just want to divide each layer into two so we get six layers instead of three on the inside something like this if you want a sugar syrup those you can I'm not going to because I know this is going to be served within a day of making it so I'm actually just going to take a little bit of my still runny ganache and use that almost as my crumb coat it's going to soak into that red velvet cake a little bit soak into any of those little bubbles from the baking process and give me a nice smooth coat for when I go to put my good layer of ganache in between each layer blood everywhere so even as I finish up the sixth one you can see from my first one it's already starting to soak right into that cake so I'm actually infusing my red velvet cake with some extra moisture and also some really delicious white chocolate bloody goodness I'm going to let those set until that ganache layer is touch dry and then I'm going to come back and I'm going to stack them all directly on a cake plate if you want to chill your cake layers it is actually always easier to work with kind of cool cake and you want your ganache to be not super firm bit thick so when we poured it on it poured straight onto the cake and now you can see it's kind of globbing which means it's smooth enough for us to spread but thick enough that it's going to hold up its own kind of shape and give us a nice little layer between our cakes so I'm going to start stacking at the bottom one layer of cake I'm going directly onto my cake plate because it's so cute I don't really want to board under this and then a nice clean coat of ganache I normally hate the side of blood but this I can handle you can use almost all of your remaining ganache but set aside about a half a cup of good clean crumb free ganache we're gonna use that later and then I'm just going to put just a nice crumb coat all the way around the outside edge of my cake seal everything in I'm gonna pop this whole cake off into the fridge because I want that ganache to set really nice and firm before we go adding any of our details on top about 20 to 30 minutes should do it my cakes chilled out and my ganache is touch set so I've got my buttercream frosting in a piping bag and I'm just using a large open round piping tip we're going to pipe a nice easy petal technique all the way around the bottom edges of our cake I love a good petal technique because it's so much cooler than just a straight out frosted cake and it leaves a lot of room for error so to do this you just want to blob and then drag so you'll see my blob goes on and then drag back down so essentially I'm kind of squeezing and then pulling and smoothing at the same time to get each of those little individual petals it looks like it'll be super time-consuming but it's actually a really simple way to frost a cake when you get down to your very last row or to take a bit of buttercream and just pop it on the top of the cake and use an offset spatula or even a ruler just to spread it out so it's relatively flat don't be too precise now your last row this is your opportunity to join everything together so these ones might be a little fatter or a little thinner depending on how much space you've got left you don't really want to see any red at all peeking through and if you do you can just put a little of that frosting into a snap seal bag and just kind of cheat a little and fill in any spots where your red might be peeking out like this little guy just here so my heart has been in the fridge it's a cold heart and I can already see it's most of the way pulled away from the outside of my little jello mold so I'm going to just pull it all of the way away I feel like a doctor I made a heart you guys alright my heart's going to go directly on the top of my cake and I'm going to try not to handle it too much at all then I've got a little bit of boiling hot water and a heat proof jug so I'm going to take another knife and heat it up not my stunt knife because mine's actually made of plastic so this is my stunt knife which I can't heat up this is the knife that I'm actually going to use to go through the heart where stabbing our cake and why not so I'm just going to really just rest and I'm just going to let the heat from the knife melt its way through this is painfully slow but don't rush it because you will break the heart nobody wants a broken heart it's a long time to kill someone thought you just be in and out boom stab done we are making progress the murder weapon was a purple knife the victim an unassuming red velvet cake I shouldn't look quite so gleeful I already love it but it's not quite done yet because we need to add a little bit of excess blood or juice I just stabbed heart would never be whole it would be messy that little bit of ganache that I asked you to kid just give it a microwave you don't want it to be hot but you want it to be kind of fluid so if you heat it too much let it come down a bit so it doesn't melt through your frosting and then I'm just going to kind of drizzle it a little bit I want it where the knife blade touches I want it coming down that heart but more importantly I kind of want it to pool around the bottom I don't want this dripping over the edges I just want like stupid of moisture on my heart and I also want to disguise that little spot where my knife has hit the heart we murdered a cake I know rest in peace cake in my stomach now that we've murdered the cake I feel like I should get my two little accomplices in to really help me complete the crime the boys are definitely going to want to see what's going on inside this cake without a real knife stuck in it there's been a murder let's have a look boys well flavor cake dude money put inside the murder cake read me blog Jacob sneezed all over it Thank You Jacob I hope you guys have enjoyed today is a spooky gruesome Halloween video if you've got any other ideas for Halloween let me know down below and if you recreate this hit me up on the my cupcake addiction hashtag on Instagram because I love to see it when you guys recreate my cakes and bakes at home [Music] you 
I know it's kind of with you guys can't see at me right now but I really wanted the cake to be the focal point [Music] before we get started let's just take a look at how much I love unicorns on this channel I've made unicorn cookies that actually poop stars I've made standing unicorn cakes I've made it unicorn milkshakes unicorn named it and I have unicorn made it that was kind of cheesy today is unicorn cake put the unicorn or could just be a mad rainbow cake it is rainbow clouds unicorns and everything good in the world I bring you the ultimate triple rainbow unicorn cake if you're going to replicate this cake either with or without unicorn at home you don't need a large cake board I'm using a 16 inch cake board I've got a batch of sugar cookie dough and a double batch of my vanilla frosting recipe they're both from the Swift celebrations cookbook if you guys have that at home otherwise I'll leave a link down below you can check out both of those recipes I've got some fondant in bows pale blue and white and I've got a bunch of different colored food colors you can use paste liquid or gel here and I've got all the colors of the rainbow you're also going to need cake so I'm using 8-inch cake layers but I'm only baking about an inch of batter in the bottom of each and I've colored them super bright colors of the rainbow you can use your favorite vanilla cake recipe or you can even cheat here and use store-bought but you want to make sure that your colors are nice and vibrant now you want to roll out your cookie dough pop down a little bit of flour and use a rolling pin to roll it out but not too thin here because it's got to be pretty strong I'm going to use a big round Bowl here instead of making a template this one is about a 10 inch Bowl but you can change the size of your rainbow end of your clouds depending on how many people you need to come to the party place the bowl face down onto your rolled cookie dough and then I'm going to trace around the outside edge with a pizza cutter but I'm going to make sure that I leave like a long straight line rather than finishing the rainbow off where it would otherwise be almost like a long leg on each of our rainbow thighs I'm just going to go by eye here and use that pizza cutter again just to create the inside loop of my rainbow and then I'm just going to need not the base and kind of create almost like a very slightly pointed edge to help me drive my finished cookie into my cake I find it easier to slide a piece of parchment underneath and just shimmy the cookie on top of it you want to bake your cookie for about 15 minutes and normally I tell you to pull it out when it just starts to brown around the edges but for this one because I want to make sure that it's definitely baked leave it in for an extra minute or so and watch it so that you can see when it gets just slightly darker Brown around the edges when you cookies Brown pull it out and let it cool completely and then I'm going to use literally anything sticking here you guys you can use something like honey you can use corn syrup or glucose I've got a little bit of caramel topping so I'm going to use that cause it's delicious I'm going to roll out some white fondant really nice and thin and then I'm really just roughly shaping it with my hands so that it kind of resembles a bit of a horseshoe shape I'm going to drape it over the top of my cookie and that terrible syrups going to help it all to stick in place tuck it all the way around the edges so that it kind of hugs the outside of the cookie and then I'm going to use a pizza cutter just to cover on the outside edges and cut off really nice and close to the base of my large rainbow cookie we do find an employee we're going to make basically in edible paint so take a little bit of your food coloring I'm using a paste here so about a quarter of a teaspoon with a few drops of either vodka or clear lemon extract this is going to help your paint to dry really quickly and if you don't use something like the vodka or the lemon extract your paint's going to stay wet for days and it's not going to be pleasant at all to handle the vodka evaporates and that actually helps your paint to dry much much faster I've got quite a wide flat paint brush and this is actually the perfect size for a rainbow sized stripe but I'm going to start with my bread and I'm going to basically let the paintbrush do a lot of the work in coming around the outside edge of my rainbow and painting in my red line repeat this with all of the colors of your rainbow you do have the option here to do something like a standing sugar like I did for my rainbow skittles illusion cake a little while ago or of course you could color individual balls of fondant in all of these different colors roll them out in strips and then lease them over the cookie but that's a far more time-consuming option than just painting them the downside of phasing them like this is that that paint will stay wet which makes it a little bit harder to handle so I recommend doing this step either the day before or at least a few hours before you want to put your finished cake together doing it now makes sense because we've still got stacking and fondant covering and all sorts to do you want to cut away any caramelization from either the top or the bottom of your cake layers but you can Rev the sides in tact at the moment get them as level as possible I always like to work on chilled cake here so you can either put them in the freezer for an hour or in the fridge for a couple of hours it just makes it so much easier to cut them and it makes them less crumbly once you've got all of your cakes looking nice and vibrant and colorful I'm you're use a cake leveler on the lowest setting to give myself quite thin layers of cake air because I don't want a massively tall cake each of my cake layers only about 1/2 an inch tall but the cake leveler makes sure that every single one of those layers is perfectly the same to keep your cake layers from getting crumbs all over each other I like to place it on a plate with a piece of parchment in between each of your colors and stack them up that way you can keep some chilled they're easy to move around and you don't kind of mess your yellows with your greens or your blues with your Purple's I'm putting on a piece of parchment because I want this whole cake to be pretty easy to move around but it is going to mean it's a little more slippery on your cake board in a cake turntable so just balance it as you spread a really thin layer of buttercream frosting in between each of your colors repeat that with each of your cake layers adding just a thin layer of frosting in between and again working with chilled Kassia just helps to stop all those crumbs getting picked up and makes these thin layers of cake a lot easier to work with once your cakes completely stashed in your whole rainbow of colors is in place you're going to cut it in half right down the middle I know it seems weird to do this to a perfectly good cake support the cake using your whole hand and then you want to take one half and place it rembu side down or flat side down onto a cake board and do the same with your other half you can leave the parchment underneath if you like using a serrated edge knife here I'm going to trim away the very outside edges and now you can start to see all those beautiful colors peeking out of those caramelized sidewalls of vanilla cake once you've got those edges all trimmed off you should be able to see amazing super bright vibrant stripes of color using my serrated edge knife again I'm just going to make like a V incisions clip to the right-hand side of the top of my rainbow and then again right down the face of the rainbow and then turn it around and repeat on the other side so you have a V on the left and a V on the right-hand side of the top of your rainbow and you've kind of just curved off those bottom edges a little bit this is going to help us start to form the cloud-like shape and you get to eat the scraps I know it's not looking quite cloud-like just yet you need to take some buttercream frosting and I'm going to use an offset spatula just to push it sort of in and all around those V shapes and all over your rainbow cake this is going to trap any crumb so make sure it's just a really nice thin coat then we get a really beautiful white coat on the outside once this thin coat step make sure you've got your buttercream all the way into all the little crevices and corners of those little V's that you cut out and your cake is completely covered and then pop it off into the fridge for about 15-20 minutes so that first coat of frosting can firm up repeat that with both sides of your rainbow you basically need to do these steps twice so that you end up with two similar clouds once that first layer of frosting set apply a generous second layer of frosting all over the outside of your rainbow cloud and then just use the back of the offset spatula to kind of scrape it so that you round off all of the edges around those V's and also round off the sides it should be starting to kind of look like three little mounds almost like a cloud but not quite I'm using white fondant to make my clouds perfectly white but also to create kind of the bubbly texture of a cloud so sprinkle down a little bit of powdered sugar or cornstarch and rolling a fondant nice and stead not super thin here about an eighth of an inch we're all a bigger piece than you think you're gonna need because you definitely don't want to come up short and then lay it over the top of your buttercream covered rainbow cloud cake I'm pressing in all the way around the bottom edges of my cloud and making sure that I've gone right into the V with my fondant and then I'm going to use a pizza cutter because I find it gives me the best to just kind of wheel around the bottom edge relatively close to the base of the cloud don't worry if you don't get right into the base of the crowd I always find it's better to leave a little bit of extra fondant and then I'm going to use that same pizza cutter just to kind of push some of that fondant underneath this is going to help to round off the base edge of a crowd as well as kind of seal everything in the frosting the rainbow cake and all of that deliciousness inside to finish it off I'm actually just going to run my fingers around some of those little crevices and kind of follow some of the natural lines of the fondant to create those big kind of separated cumulus clouds type shape pop that one off to the side and repeat all of that with cloud number two I don't ever like just a plain white or silver or gold board peeking out from under my cake and I want this to kind of look like the sky so I'm going to cover my board in the light blue fondant I'm going to roll that out really thin because I don't like to waste too much fondant when I'm only using it to cover a board and then I kind of like to trim around the edges by using the side of my knife to just rub it through the fondant rather than cutting it off or giving you a jagged edge rubbing through it like this makes it a nice neat edge and gives it a really nice kind of an angle this part is the second most nerve-wracking part of this cake we get a transfer the two clouds on to that big board I've actually got like a big cake mover if you don't have one of these think about sliding something underneath to help you move your cake like a cake server or even a piece of relatively stiff cardboard I'm going to let both of my cloud paint just ever so slightly off the corner of my cake board only like a half an inch because it kind of makes it look like my clouds are a little bit suspended in it here you need to measure the inside of your rainbow and you need to place your clouds the same distance apart as whatever the width of the inside of your rainbow is now it's time for the rainbow cookie I'm going to measure my rainbow to make sure that I cut enough of a guide hole but close enough is good enough my rainbow is like three and a half inches so I just like estimate that that's going to bring me to about here and then using a nice sharp knife right on the center I'm going to cut a guide hole straight down cut them I know my rainbow to be on an angle so I'm just going to kind of guesstimate middle and slice again this could be the rainbow of old rainbow cakes we've ever made here and to be very careful to support it pretty evenly cookie on the back rainbow and over on I'm going to line it up with my two guide holes and very gently pushing evenly I'm going to push it down you really careful here you guys one side at a time to imagine if the cookie broke and I'm just going to press my little bits of fondant back together so that my rainbow is filled into its clouds the final finishing touch is our little unicorn it's adorable I'm in love with this cake it turned out so stinking cute but I feel like we've got to cut it to really know what's going on here I think we good oh my god now this this is a rainbow cake that I can't wait to eat of course I love the cookie I love the unicorn I love the rainbows but the best thing about this cake is if you're having a smaller event you can literally serve one cloud save the other clouds for tomorrow I hope you guys have enjoyed today's video you may know me as being pretty well known for rainbow cakes rainbow desert unicorn themes we - make sure you head over to the channel and check out some of my recent rainbow unicorn themed uploads and as always guys thanks very much for watching you 
Wow [Music] welcome back you guys it's no secret that I am obsessed with giant-sized pretty much everything from my giant Samoa cookie that I made a couple of weeks ago all the way through to my very first ever giant candy bar which was that huge no-bake giant Twix I'm obsessed with things that I love but bigger today I'm going to show you guys how to make this epic giant Kinder Surprise egg filled with Kinder Surprise eggs kinder ception kinder and kinder and kinder maxi kinder to make your giant candy you're going to need some food coloring so I'm using red blue green and yellow I've also got some red candy melts and I've got white candy melts I mean here's a combination of white candy melt and actual white chocolate here because I want the super white color of white candy melts but I kind of want a taste of white chocolate I've got some milk chocolate candy melts or you could also use compound milk chocolate a little white fondant a little black fondant and a giant egg mold so I'm taking advantage of the fact that it's Easter and I picked this egg filled with little eggs up in Target for $5 I looked at it and I was like this is actually a fantastic mold for giant kinder eggs even if you have no needs it is free stuff go on buy one now stock up and keep it in the cupboard for that time when you need to make a giant kinder egg it could be any time really if you can't find one of these near you have a look online sometimes Amazon eBay is the perfect place to find kind of obscure Easter themed things outside of the season first of all you want to remove the little plastic handle from your giant Easter Egg if there is one empty out any of the contents and clean and dry it make sure you wash it with soapy water and make sure it's thoroughly dry so that we can then apply our candy melts to the inside these are great because the bottom section is like actually flat which means my giant kinder is not going to roll around everywhere I mean here's the bottom section to cast like the red wavy base of the a million red candy melts and I send mine out a little bit using some coconut oil or you can use cocoa or Crisco I've got a whole video dedicated literally to how to melt candy melts and chocolate and how to spin them down because sometimes they can be a little bit thick and chunky to work with so check that one out if you want to know a little more about melting your candy melts so pour in your red candy melts and I'll leave all of your quantities and everything that you need on the micro-tv addiction comm website so I'll link to that post down below I'm just going to fill the egg and sort of twisted at the same time so that the candy melt goes up and then comes back down and then goes up in another section so you might need to just go over the same spot a couple of times just tilting and twisting and turning and twisting until you can't see any of that plastic egg and all you can see is a nice firm covering of that red candy melt all the way around the base of the egg pop that off into the fridge for five minutes to set in the meantime you can melt your white candy melts because I've removed my plastic handle I've got these like two little holes in the top section of my egg and when I put my candy melts in there I don't wanna make a huge mess so I'm going to use a little bit of melted candy and I'm just going to sort of plug up the holes and let them set I'm using candy to stop candy from coming out it works once your little holder set you could pour about three-quarters of your white candy melts into the egg and then you can either just twist the egg and sort of let the candy melt run up the sides or if you're having any trouble here just use a spatula to kind of encourage that white candy melt to drag up the side of your Easter egg if you're doing two coats of white candy melt you it's not such a big deal but if you're going to go like me with an inner coat of white chocolate which can be a little yellow up make sure this first coat doesn't have anywhere that you can feed the eggshell through do you want it to be completely white pay particular attention to the edges the top edges of the top half of that egg because anywhere that you miss you're eventually going to see dark chocolate poking syrup I found it easiest to balance this mega egg on either like a little washi tape or a sticky tape or inside a small bowl to stop it from rolling around as its setting you can pop that off into the fridge to set by now the red base should have set so I'm going to take the remaining white candy melt and I'm going to use a spatula just to apply the white candy melt very gently around that pop inch or two inches above the red wave I'm not going to fill the whole thing here because it's just going to not being really sick so this is just concentrating the white where I need it the most be careful not to drag that white back and forward into the red or you'll smudge your red so just get it on spatula across at once and if you need to fill in any gaps let that first coat set first because the last thing you want here is a smudged red line back up into the fridge for that one and then I'm going to melt my white chocolate I'm using the extra white chocolate because I know I only did a really thin coat of that white candy melts to start off with and I personally prefer the taste of white chocolate over caramels so I'm going to melt my white chocolate and pour it into the top half over the white candy but you'll see the color difference there and then I mean they're just going to tip or your good spatula to get that white chocolate coating the entirety of the inside of the top half of my egg and then again for the bottom finally because kinder eggs are kind of white chocolate and chocolate and then inside the wrapper this is like a reverse kinder egg but I can't make it without the milk chocolate so I'm going to use compound milk chocolate but you can also use milk chocolate candy melts again melt them down thin them out a little bit with a little coconut oil or Crisco or COFA so that they're not super super thick here and then I'm going to coat the inside of the top half and the bottom half of both of my eggs if any of that dark chocolate goes over the sides you can either just use your finger or you can use a tissue just to run around the edges to make sure that all you can see on any of those outside edges is that beautiful shiny white off into the fridge to set we're starting to see a pattern this is always the part that's a little bit daunting we've gone to all that trouble to get all of these layers of chocolate and now we have to remove essentially a relatively fragile chocolate shell out of our plastic mold it's not as difficult as you think and there are some very visible signs which you'll notice here on my red half to indicate that your shell is completely set and ready to come out you can see where the red has already started to pull away from the plastic outside and then you can see here this darker red color where it's very obviously still stuck so I just apply a pretty even amount of pressure just on to those sections where it looks like you're still stuck and if they push away easily and I see that kind of clear of finish pop up then I know that it's ready to come out if any of those little red sections play hard-to-get and stick put it back in the fridge for another five minutes because you don't want to risk falling out a chunk of your eggs as you remove your container the top has the same principle it's slightly harder to see because you're working with white but if you know what you're looking for because you've started with the red it's actually not that hard to decipher which bits are still stuck and which bits have come away the benefits of working without clear moles all right top half done bottom half done we want to make the writing here and if you have access to an edible image printer or want to save yourself a fair bit of time cutting out individual letters I recommend ordering an edible image online I'll leave a template down below that you guys can print out that's pretty well sized for this size egg and you can often send those off to places online they'll print them out for you an edible paper you can just stick that straight on the egg I'm going to show you guys there's more time-consuming way so I'm going to start by rolling out some black fondant really nice and thin and I'm going to trace around the entire template so the whole word surprised this is going to make the black outline but I'm not going to have to be so particular about getting all of the letter outlines perfectly situated you'll also need to cut out the letter K because the K on kinder is black and the rest is red so my individual letters for the word surprise I'm going to use the white fondant and I'm going to cut around each individual letter which can be a little tedious but can be done in advance instead of coloring the fondant all those different colors I'm just going to use the food coloring with a little bit of clear alcohol like a vodka or gin or you can use a QR lemon extract here this chip helps the food color to evaporate a lot quicker which means it drives a lot faster than painting with Street food coloring by ourselves I'm going to paint all of the letters according to my template and then I actually decided to use a little bit of red fondant to make the inder from kinder which could also be tinder swipe left for tree I guess that weird okay if you don't have red fondant just use the white again and paint it now the thing with their food you need to keep it kind of covered from the air so you can do it a little bit in advance but just put your little kinder and surprise in like a Tupperware container so that it's not drying out and it will be ready to go whenever you're ready to stick it on the front of your egg it'll last up to a week if it's airtight to stuff my Kinder Surprise egg I actually got all of those leftover plastic eggs that came with it so I'm going to make some of my own treats for the kids which is essentially a recycling of things they already own but I'm hoping because it comes in this really cool novelty giant egg they won't notice that they're toys they already had old strong I also have a little mermaid she's going to miss her with two boys I feel like that's not the ideal gift but you never know you never know who's going to get those because Kinder Surprise they're illegal here in America yes illegal I smuggled ten in and these have all got aeroplanes in them for my kids anyway there are worse things to break the law for so I'm going to mix up actual illegal Kinder Surprise eggs with like my little homemade perfectly legal Kinder Surprise eggs I'm taking a hot fry pan and I'm going to rest that face down on the base of the kinder egg this is just going to help to flatten it off and make sure I've got a perfectly flat smooth finish for when I go to stick the top on and then I'm going to take that same skillet and I'm going to heat the top half of the egg or the bottom of the top half once you've got that nice and flat and nice and flush again make sure you can't see any of that dark chocolate wipe around the outside if you need to or remove a little bit of the excess and then I'm going to very carefully pick it up using two tissues or paper towels so don't leave fingerprints and rest it on top of my kinder stuffed kinder base make sure you're lining this up nicely as it goes into position and you put a couple of seconds to sort of wiggle it around before it starts to set with the top in place I'm going to take a little more of that white candy mouth in a snap your bag and just snip off a really small tip to fashion a bit of a piping bag and then I'm going to squeeze extra candy mark in all the way around that outside edge and use just your finger is the best thing here to smooth it off this helps to fill in any gaps and make sure that your two halves of your egg are really firmly stuck together this likely won't be the super neatest thing in the world so take a paper towel or a napkin and just dip it into that really hot water flamingo mug optional and then I'm going to essentially use the heat that is now in that paper towel to just wipe around the outside edges you'll see this does two things it removes any excess but it also smooths off any ridges and makes that little seam around the center sorry much neater if you've got any little chunks around the top of your egg or anywhere that you're not happy with squeeze in a little candy mouth let it kind of set and then use this technique to smooth it off and you won't even be able to tell our eggs basically done all you need to do now is take your Kinder Surprise logo and I'm going to start with the surprise I'm going to apply a little bit of water onto the back of the paintbrush which is going to help it stick don't do too much water here or it will slide down the egg so less is more I'm going to fake the whole logo in my hand and try not to over handle this just in case your food colors not quite set and then I'm essentially going to place my hand on the front of the egg and then flip the logo up so it fits perfectly covering that theme it's the right spot as per placement of the kinder eggs but it also does the added bonus of covering the seat again you've got a couple of seconds to move this around slightly if you need to with black fondant you can sometimes get a couple of streaks so if that happens just wet your paintbrush and make sure it's clean and then kind of click slide it up the side of the chocolate to remove any of those little black streak marks finally I'm going to add my kinder lettering and I'm going to start in the middle and work my way out so they don't start with decay in the wrong place and then finish with the letter kind of not meeting up with the end of my word surprise I use this always when I'm applying writing to cake okay guys are we proud the giant Kinder Surprise egg I'm a giant Kinder Surprise eggs a while back but they were like this big like the size of my head that is your giant Kinder Surprise egg you can store it in the fridge if you want to you could leave it at room temperature provided it's not too hot and you can make this like a week in advance I'm not going to smash it right now because my boys arrive into America in a day and a half this is our arrival gift I'm pretty sure two kids two small hammers and a ton of that's the biggest Kinder Surprise egg you've ever seen Wow you 
that's chocolate act more chocolate that hey what are you doing in my kitchen yes selecting out some of the ingredients what do you think we should make today haha a giant hose cat ah it's almost like we already have that conversation and decided to make a giant hostess one [Music] my brother's birthday tomorrow and we are very can a giant closest um cake I'm so jealous but you just had a cold ocean themed cake last weekend that one yeah well you have to get that a little wash after the head of the floor we're gonna make a giant hostess cupcake in the base of a giant cupcake mold okay all of this party hat and it is going to be for Jacob's birthday if you guys haven't already checked out family adventure Network you can check out all his birthday shenanigans and fun over on our family vlog channel but for now shall we make a giant - yeah but how but why am i Leslie Cameron why are there three cameras Oh give me your hypothesis why do you think there'd be three cameras oh one down here I've no idea no idea that's why I make the videos and you make it a cake oh I'm gonna need that to get started what oh let's make a giant hostess after we wash the pen yeah you wanna wash the pen [Music] let's see if all of it could point out all of our ingredients and name member what they are and Wow Wow cocoa chocolate hot chocolate eggs yeah more chocolate manager so oh what's that taste it remember by time are you ready taste that one by club and we also have sugar what's this one oh we know water water ahh because it's a bit thicker than water well done high five ah it'll be a little over perfect you can put them take your dry ingredients and mix them together so I've got my sifted flour some salt baking soda and sugar and it's going to stir them through so they're really well combined and set aside you want to put your whole water in with your coffee and mix it around till that coffee is dissolved and then I'm going to put in the chocolate and use the heat from the hot water to melt through the chocolate so you should have like kind of a nice chocolaty copy syrupy mixture don't worry about the flavor of coffee in your cake you're not actually going to taste it it's just going to make the chocolate flavor more rich and delicious now I just want everyone to pay special attention to all these very unique skills when it comes to cracking eggs go egg crusher go we hit we study we hit we study we hit up we study crushes in and think Hatch's it seems like an odd choice yeah okay nice all right dude you'll tell on the story you tell everybody what the next step is oh right on you need a whisk Oh I put this one what is that Vennela is it what made a weird cool pattern no it looks like the egg is bleeding oh that's with that a little bit okay then pour in the next thing you all just shot what ingredient is that and no idea oil ha ha and then smell it vinegar don't get your water and your vinegar mixed up because that would be bad why get whiskey will smells kind of gross without vinegar in it you're going to pop those yolks go up one pot pop the other can you tell me a funny joke what like joke but I said yolk that was the joke oh it was a horrible mom joke I'm sorry all right my little scientists in the making how about if you grab this bowl and put it into that container and then mix them through or you can put that in a dynamite look that you should start waving that around whisk it whisk it whisk it why mix it all right wet ingredients into dry ingredients I'll hold this and I'll hold it over this will make a nice little well because it'll stop it's getting so many lumps you poured it as I'm stirring I'll have a combined team effort nice well this looks amazing make know well in the center kind of stops you from getting so many of those little lumps and bumps why I just told you to distribute the wet ingredients and it helps the wet ingredients see how they're all gathered on the side wall they just come in a little bit at a time instead of in huge big lumps which means we get less AFER's will pop like we did with the cooker alright now that I've done all the hard work you want to pretend that it was you Wow Ally great job so have batters made and now it's time to grease the pan and get it in the oven I'm gonna grease but what's out the job like morning has fresh you want that grease really well and then we're going to pour our mix into the cupcake liner I normally like to fill mine to about here it's got a fill line up here but I always go between the fill line and the rim because they can handle it and it rises a bit anyway all right are you going to do this or am I going to do this how you want to do this good I may regret this go on then I don't want to watch but I have to dude need oven me so Olli we need to find a tray for this and then I'm going to put it in a moderate oven it's going to take anywhere between 45 minutes and an hour and because it's sort of fudged you are you off to it's busy because it's so foggy you can't do the skewer test on these so you literally need to cook anytime between 45 minutes and an hour and you'll know when you give the tray a little shake and it stops jiggling in the middle that's when it's good to go because this cake is exactly the same size and shape as the base that we're going to make out of chocolate I need to shave just a little bit off each side so I'm getting you the large serrated edge knife and I'm just going to gently carve away about the outside quarter of an inch or so of this cake so that when I go to put it in our giant hostess cupcake case it fits in really nice and seamlessly to make my chocolate shell I'm using either a compound chocolate or a candy melt and I've got that melted down I'm just going to pour half of my mixture into my giant silicone cupcake case and you can either just twist it around so the chocolate kind of slides up the size or you can use a spatula you're going to drag that chocolate up so you've got one in nice even coating put that one off into the fridge let it set for like 15 minutes and then you can bring it out and put in the remaining half of your chocolate so you get a second thin coat two thin coats is better than one sick one and it will set so much faster you have confined by 7-minute frosting recipe either in the sweet celebrations cookbook or I'll also leave it on the my cupcake addiction comm website if you want to save a little time here you can cheat a new smart relative love Ally I'll take your face and carve our frosting is in a piping bag we dig small do you agree that its small and round yes a small and round piping tip and a chocolate shell set so when your shell comes out of the fridge you just want to roll down the sides the silicon should peel away really nice and easily gently roll it down be very careful not to touch these outside edges or it's gonna get fingerprints all over I like to kind of support it on the inside and then on the face and I'm actually going to roll that silicon mold back in the right way and put it back in there hip support for moral support physical sports ability things everyone needs to feel you're good moral support army I have no idea what that even it's a good thing you do Ollie's going to make a ganache by pouring the cream over the chocolate and again I'll link to my ganache recipe down below as well as the quantities that you need to make this we in a microwave adjust for one minute and if you need an extra minute you can but just stirring it you should see it come together in a really nice thick chocolaty frosting mixture so a little bit of ganache give it a good stir and then let's put in a bag a quarter of your ganache we need most of it for on top and we're just gonna scrape it up besides this actually stick the chocolate shell to the outside of the Hershey's you should get a little closer there only is it possible now we're going to pick up the hostess the mega hostess Kristen and just drop it in fancy hot toilet is perfect is all that's alright we're going to trim it now okay or not can I just four words no mother ever wants to hear five words how about if I do the piping but I give you an equally as important job what people need the probably is taste testing look how moisten you that into the middle you want to cut this just down on a bit of an angle outside to each direction because you need it to be just a little bit show up than the height of the cupcake cake but not too much we don't wanna get rid of too much cake once I have piled to the top I'm going to press it down and you should get about another couple of millimeters as it just settles into place perfect or hard cuz you don't want to crack your cupcake case I'm going to use just a sharp knife to kind of carve out a little bit of a hole in the center of my giant cupcake and this is going to do roll down marshmallow fluff while seven-minute frosting is going to hide inside for a delicious cream self-censor all right Olli I got a big job I'm going to hold you're going to spoon okay all right bring it on like he's caught me not as important as piping and here's the back of the spoon and just gently push around that chocolate ganache you want to become almost perfectly in line with those outside edges of the cupcake cake I'm just using the back of the knife just to smooth out towards the edges I don't want it to trickle over the edges of the outside of that cupcake cake so keeping it in this silicon mold kind of protect it from getting to be mentally but also allows us to get it really nice and flat and all the way to the edges alright only we are about 15 minutes away from finishing this off we're going to set this to the fridge for 10 minutes and then we're just going to pipe on that little host dust well still good seal of approval once it's added 15 minutes in the fridge just check the top to make sure that it's set roll down the silicone outside and I'm going to use two tissues to very gently touch the outsides of that cupcake case so it's not believed fingerprints while also using my other thing is to kind of push away the silicone liner finally a little bit more about what frosting in my fighting bag just get it as carefully as I can replicate the hostess cupcakes well on top gently gently Wow there's no Abed well Jake is going to see us tomorrow so from

started on today's Beauty and the Beast inspired cake I'm starting with a double batch of my chocolate mud cake mix and if you guys have the sweet celebrations cookbook you'll be able to cook along with me from page 211 if you don't I'm going to leave all of your recipes and dimensions ever you need to recreate this on the my cupcake addiction comm website I'll leave a link to the post down below I've made a double batch of that chocolate mud cake it doesn't taste like mine it doesn't look like mine it is to my feet and I baked it out in an 8 inch round tin and then also a 6 inch round pin there's enough left over for them 6 cupcakes for me I used quite tall pins here because only got shorter layer tins you'll need to take 2 or 3 inch layers up at 3 entire cake so I've got a wider case I've got to double back to my vanilla buttercream frosting and I just tinted it kind of an eggy yellow so it's that super deep yellow of Belle's dress a little bit of whipping cream and some chocolate I've got one single beautiful red rose and this year is a little classic cattitude you can look for these in novelty supplier sauce they're very popular around Halloween you can also find them online with the plastic test tube we're going to use that like a little vase this guy here is a little cake Durham I've had it for ages but if you don't know where to find one again look online I think it's either generally called a cake dome or this one was actually called a clock or a cloche and I know it sounds fancy and then I've got cake boards I have three cake boards a six inch and an eighth inch to match my cake layers and then I've also got a larger cake board I just covered my cake board with some glitter red craft paper and a little yellow washi tape on the side so that it provides like a really nice contrast to the yellow of my cake but because that's not food space you definitely want to have a baseboard underneath your main cake so it doesn't touch thick with a paper let's get started first off you want to trim any of the tops off your cake so if they've risen any domes need to be trimmed off so you've got two nice flat cakes dividing your cake layers industry you can either use a serrated edge or a bread knife or a cake leveler here once divided I'm going to use my six inch board to stack my three layers of 6-inch cake with a little of that pretty freshly melted ganache in between because recognize is so fluid I'm literally just ruining it on and then spreading it out but not too much between those lands pop those off into the fridge to set with just the ganache in between and then when they're kind of filling phone you can bring them out for a butter cream coat start with a nice thin crumb coat they expect this coat of buttercream to get quite dirty it's going to pick up a lot of your chocolate cake crumbs and all of that ganache around the outside edges once you're happy that you've coated it a cause all of your crumbs put it back in the fridge or the freezer for about 15 minutes just to let that first coat set with your crumb coat stat you should be able to kind of tap on it you want to stick a generous amount of frosting all over the cake all over the top and all over the sides more than you think you're going to need I've got a scraper I'll often also use just a regular metal ruler for this or you can use your offset spatula but I'm just going to drag along the outsides of my cake starting with the sides trying to keep my scraper as level as possible with my little cake turntable so I'm turning the cake and I'm scraping off excess frosting revealing a really nice smooth buttercream coat make sure you don't hit cake underneath once your sides are nice and smooth you want to get your offset spatula and I like to just kind of drag the frosting in small sections into the middle of the cake so that no point am I kind of pushing frosting over the outside edges and bringing it in so that I can get a really nice smooth flat top put those cakes back up into the fridge or freezer and let them completely set before you go any further and now it's time to build my first circle cutter and I'm using one that's just slightly bigger slightly bigger than my test tube but I want it to be too much bigger but I don't want it to be smaller or else the test tube going in it can force the cake apart and the whole thing is going to split we don't want that at this stage so I'm going to find the center point roughly the center point of my cake and I'm going to start that off with my circle cutter I'll cut out a nice circle and that's really just to give me a nice little neat dot point so I've done it up with jagged edges and then I you the nun sister run around that circle to kind of loosen everything inside around that circle hole make sure not to get any crumbs on the cake so that you avoid the crumbs turn your test tube upside down and push it down into the cake effectively scooping out all of those crumbs of course you need to wash your test tube and dry it off and then pop that straight down in the hole and I could put a little frosting into this seal bag and just ran it around the edges using my finger to smooth it off to just make sure that my little test tube phase is perfectly in place with no gaps around the outside edges to stack my cake I'm going to take my presentation board so that cake board that I covered in the glitter card stock with the washi tape around the outside and if my bottom cake onto that cake board with a little bit of ganache then I'm going to use four fat straws or milkshake straws place them into a pot and cake relatively close to the center and snip them off so they're all even take the six inch cake now and pop it on top it should be evenly supported by those straws so it doesn't crush the cake underneath to cover any gaps between your tears I'm going to put my leftover yellow frosting in a piping bag with just an open round piping tip when doing a very simple kind of a solid edging style so you just want to pipe a small dot and then use the piping tip to drag that dot flat on the tail next dot flat on the tail next dot flat on the tail all the way around start and finish at the same point on both of your lives so you've got a very definite back of the cake where your two little lines of scallops are kind of joined up so this is what you should be looking at I'm letting my inner florist out and finding my best red roses trimming them off to size so one thing that I did find with this cake is I really want to see the greenery from the flower leaves but they were too low down on the stem so I pulled them off the best leaves and we're just going to pop them in up the top so that we still get the same effect don't forget to water your roses all those die really quickly what are your flowers guys not be okay I have my single rose going in and I want to make sure that sort of helps just towards the front of my cake and then I'm just going to rest these leaves in because it's all going to be covered nice little glass vase on top where our glass cake dome on top like so and then I'm going to take a second rose and because the road in Beauty and the Beast is always constantly losing petals I want to put just a couple of petals on the ground like time is running short rose petals are edible and non-toxic but just make sure the variety of Rose that you've chosen is okay to be eaten laughs it definitely not least on goes our little vase and I'm just going to push my leaves up so they don't get moved around too much and rest it on top that is possibly the easiest beauty in the base multi-tiered cake thing I love about this cake is the dorm on top actually makes it look like this massive three-tiered cake it's absolutely beautiful we've got that little bit of elevated fresh rose and it embodies everything Beauty and the Beast without being a classic princess doll cake or thing to Kitty I feel like I could see this working at an engagement party at a bridal shower at a birthday it doesn't have to be just for the kids so I'm sure they're going to love it to make you subscribe to the channel if you're not already - new videos every week and as always guys thanks very much for watching [Music] 
I love space this is where time [Music] welcome back to my cupcake addiction a couple of weeks ago you may or may not have caught my galaxies inside cake pop video where we kick popped the solar system well I ordered this shirt online which arrived the day after I shot that video and of course I needed an excuse to wear it because it's kind of Awesome so today I'm going to show you guys how to make a simple galaxy bowl cake and we're also going to be mixing our own galaxy sprinkles you guys need to make your Galaxy Bowl cake you're going to need black candy melts you'll also need some edible Luster's and get creative with your colors you don't just stick to silver paintbrushes chocolate cake and I baked a batch of my chocolate cake in a round Bowl tin I'll leave a link for the tin that I use down below you're also going to need a little bit of chocolate ganache you can change up your flavors but I want dark this is the galaxy I also promised I was going to show you guys how to mix your own galaxy sprinkles so I have a ton of really fun galaxy inspired sprinkles that we're going to mix together the perfect galaxy sprinkle mix we're going to cast black candy melts in our ball molds you should have two halves of your ball mold but first because we know we want it to look like the galaxy I'm gonna spread and sprinkle and kind of flick some different colored Luster's in there go crazy this is your galaxy it can be whatever you want it to be so I've got different size paint brushes you can do everything from nice little streaks to just flicking and dropping little different colored pieces of luster in there for my halves of my galaxy bowl cake I'm going to take black candy melts I'm gonna pour them straight in and then I'm going to spread them using a spatula don't over spread here because we don't want to disturb too much of our luster you've gone to so much trouble to get your galaxy pattern perfect you do want to make sure though that your candy melt comes all the way up to the outside edge it doesn't matter if you can see some little gaps in the bottom because we're going to add a second coat but we do want to make sure the edges are nice and thick because that's how we're going to join everything together drip out any excess because two thin coats definitely better than one thick one here these Bolton's are perfectly round which means that they don't tend to sit without wobbling around they sometimes come with these little rings but if you don't get a set that comes with the Rings or you need to stabilize any round bolt in you can do something as simple as a cookie cutter or a mason jar lid these guys are going to go off into the fridge to set I'm going to give them a good 15 minutes and then I'm going to apply a second coat of my black candy melt once the second coat of black candy melt goes on they got to go back into the fridge for another 15 minutes and then I'm going to snap freeze them for five minutes snap freezing just means put it in the freezer that's going to cause the candy to contract from the metal edges of your bolt in and you'll be able to slide it out really easily while your ball is setting you can take your cake now and this is easiest to do if your cake is completely chilled so pop it in the fridge for an hour or so I'm going to slice away my bulbus top or most lightly raised rounded edge you'll see how firm that cake is that's because it's cold so much easier to carve cake when it's cold now because I've made my cake in the same container that I'm also making my chocolate ball in but I know my chocolates going to take up about this much room you just need to trim away the very very outside edges seems a shame because their cakes so nice and shiny you can draw away these off cuts but just hang on to this one just in case we need any filler cake to really make up our levels once your half cakes nice and trimmed you just want to come around and I'm just going to roughly divide it in to make this top section a little bit smaller than the middle section because this is going to be what's going to hold our galaxy candies in place and again with the other half well that guy's chilling out we're going to make our own galaxy sprinkles I love making my own sprinkle mixes because when you want something really specific it's almost impossible to find it in stores so I've got a combination of black jimmies blue jimmies I've got purple and silver jimmies I've got some little colored stars with a hint of pink because I like pink these guys here came in a little sprinkle kit I'll leave a link to it down below but they almost look like moon dust otherwise little silver nonpareils are super cute here then I've got some little shiny kind of mini nonpareils and you absolutely must get the teeny-tiny edible stars they make this mix and you don't need many of them to pack a pretty powerful punch for my galaxy sprinkle mix I want black to be my dominant color so I'm going to start with three tablespoons of my black jimmies and then a tablespoon each of my blue jimmies my purple and then my silver I love these little moon rocks because they've got a bit of sparkle so I'm going to add one tablespoon and stir it through but I'm pretty confident I'm going to use more than one and then a tablespoon of my little black and white nonpareils a good tablespoon of my star sprinkles a couple more moon rocks and then I'm going to add a half a tablespoon at a time of my little silver stars they can go off to the side that's what I'm going to fill my pinata with so when we cut it galaxy sprinkles will come out this is how easy these should pop out super super easy you shouldn't have to coax them you shouldn't have to really do anything with them other than just pull them out take a look at that pattern so this is what putting the lustre on the inside of the bowl does and then once we're all finished we're going to put more luster on the outside it's a nice start kind of gives us the basis for our galaxy now that you know they're going to come out quite safely clean out the edges of your metal bowls and put the balls back into the bowl and then rest them back onto their little cookie cutter feet this is going to help them stay stable but it's also going to stop you getting pesky fingerprints all over the outside now we're going to add chocolate to our galaxy so I've got my ganache and it's really still quite smooth and fluid and I'm going to pour that into each of my halves scraping it up the sides in goes our little small layers of cake a little more ganache before I put my next slices of cake in I'm going to cut a nice little center hole so they've got somewhere for my sprinkles to live [Music] before I fill that with sprinkles I'm gonna use my little center holes and just trim them into two small slices and add them on top of the ganache on the bottom layer of cake that's going to make sure that my sprinkles don't stick and they've got kind of a free little cake space to be free and so they pour nicely when we cut add a couple of tablespoons of sprinkles and pack them in nice and tight and then add another layer of ganache but make sure that you don't go over those sprinkles I like to leave them about a centimeter or so on a breathing room so they don't get ganache mixed in with my sprinkles here using those little offcuts that I told you not to throw away you're going to just build up your cake on top of that ganache layer covering the sprinkle hole to keep the sprinkles in place and just trim it so that it doesn't go above the outside edges of the cake in NASH it in so you've got basically a very smooth ganache covered chocolaty layer of cake with a hidden sprinkles surprise popping runs off into the fridge you have two options whenever you're joining a cake that's made of chocolate you can join it together and then pipe in black candy melt but I prefer the nature of the options a hot skillet just gently place it on the top rim of each of the bowls then you want to pick them up carefully using a piece of paper towel or a tissue so you don't put too many fingerprints on them and join them together don't freak out if they're not completely smooth here into the fridge so it's nice and chilled before we hit the next step take a heat proof jug and fill it with a really hot water and then you want to soak a knife in there drying the knife each time just use the side edge of it to melt the two sides of your little ball together and get rid of any of those jagged edges that might still be overhanging you're literally just melting away any excess and just joining it nice and neatly I like to take a little bit of paper towel and just dip it into my hot water and then use that to really smooth off that seam but don't worry if it's not a hundred percent perfect because you've got room to cover this with all of your Galaxy detail put that up into the fridge for 15 minutes so it's nice and chilled after all that hot action going on and our center seam I'm going to start with a little more lustre I'm using quite a big brush you notice I'm tapping some of it off and I'm just gonna really just brush around to kind of make a little bit more of that galaxy effect ooh that's cute then I'm going to mix a little vodka with my remaining lustres and I'm here to get my inner kid on and just flick and make a huge mess I'm using different sized paintbrushes and different techniques zagging flicking kind of whack in without touching there's a few different things going on here but this is how you're going to get a bunch of different really cool space looking shiny sparkly effects in your galaxy bowl cake this is so much fun but so messy finally I'm just going to take my gorgeous little silver edible stars anywhere I want to stick one I'm just going to first place a little tiny dab of water and then use that wet toothpick to pick up a single star and pop it in place I found this really cool plate from West Elm and I love the texture that it's got because it reminds me of the rings of some of the planets and to stick my ball in place because I don't want it to roll around I'm going to apply just a very small emphasis on the word small here little dollop of candy melt right in the center the cool part about this cake is that it is perfectly round so you don't really want to be able to see any foot sticking out because that takes away from the coolness of the illusion I'm going to make sure that it's straight and centered when you pick it up just place your fingers right down underneath again any finger prints you want to keep them on the bottom and you may just need to add a little more luster in case any of our bits that have been in the bowl got neglected maybe a couple of extra stars if I stand here I basically become one with the galaxy I don't even think you can see the cake this is the coolest and one of the easiest ways to make a galaxy cake I can't cut into it now because Ollie will kill me if he's not here to see the pinata surprise the candy inside was his idea do you wanna see the cake I made yeah wait there the galaxies in my fridge [Music] I can't be ready yep Wow what do you think cool can we smash your old phone and Jesus sprinkles why would you smash it why wouldn't we cut it yeah all right do we cut it in half or do we cut a slice I think cut a slice yeah yeah to cut a slice you need to use a superhot knife so this is where little hands stay out of the way is that a boiling water is that has that been boiling because you're here but it's pretty hot all right ready to kind of there's a mountain stars is a galaxy inside our galaxy Dell exception that is exactly how you make a galaxy that is exactly how you make a galaxy cakes if you don't already subscribe to the channel make sure you do for two new videos every week and otherwise thanks very much for watching what are you doing at the galaxy Jake I strange he is destroyer of galaxies [Music] destroy [Music] hey I I feel popping candy in my brain in your brain the popping candy you really like it no open your mouth open your mouth what's it doing [Music] [Music] 
hey guys it's Elise and welcome back to my cupcake addiction today I am super excited to team up with Nestle Tollhouse and bring you guys an amazing rainbow love heart surprise inside bundt cake this is perfect Valentine's Day but this is also an amazing cake to share all year round the things that you're going to need I'm using Nestle Tollhouse semi-sweet morsels today and I'm also going to use Nestle Tollhouse cocoa powder you'll need some food colorings and make them nice and bright and I've also got some flour I've got butter vanilla a little oil some eggs and I've got some sugar you'll also need some whipping cream and you leave all of your measurements down below as well as conversions depending on where you are and whether using self-raising flour or plain flour all-purpose flour with a little pinch of baking powder I've got a love heart cookie cutter some snacks your bags I've got a serrated bread knife and I'm using quite a large tray a cookie tray or a brownie tray that I've lined with some baking paper a bunt tin and I've got a bowl in a mixer over to the side let's get started the first thing you want to do is we're going to make up your vanilla cake this is my favorite recipe and we're going to do a double batch because we need quite a bit to make our rainbow love hearts so in goes my butter you want to put that in with your sugar and also your oil and vanilla we're going to beat that up until it's really nice and light and fluffy about three or four minutes once you happy that's nice and light and fluffy we're going to add in our eggs I'm going to leave all your measurements for this vanilla cake and separate it into the vanilla cake and the chocolate bundt cake on the my cupcake addiction website and I'll link to that post down below so make sure you check it out everything you need to bake this cake once your eggs or if you just want to give them a quick mix through make sure they're really really well combined again it's great to other sides of my bowl just to make sure that my mix is nice and evenly mixed and then you're going to add in your flour and your milk and we're going to mix it not too long here because we don't want to over develop the glutens in a vanilla cake so you just want to give it a quick mix until you can't see any more loose flour in there and everything's combined started off nice and slow so you don't end up with a massive dust storm beautiful my vanilla cake mixes lovely and thick and delicious and now I'm going to divide it evenly between six bowls it doesn't matter how much batter you have in each Bowl so long as they're all roughly the same once your batter is divided evenly into six bowls you want to color it six different colors and choose your favorites and mix the food coloring through make sure you go for really nice vibrant colors here once all of your colors a mixture you want to put each individual color into a separate snap seal bag you see roughly how much batter I've got so we're going to make a lot of stripy cake right now I'm going to start with my red I'm going to use a pair of scissors to cut off quite a thick chunky tip they're basically acting as piping bags so if you put a stack of piping bags feel free to use those but not many people have six of those laying around so I'm going to start by piping a nice thin line not too thin or you'll be half hours of my first color which for me is going to be red and then I'm moving on to orange cutting off the tip make sure it doesn't go into your cake and I love this particular cake recipe because you can see how kind of thick and chunky it is it holds its shape really well in one color doesn't bleed into the next you just want to keep on lining your vanilla layer cake in all the different colors and you'll notice once you get to the next layer once you finish your first full layer of cake you can actually start lining the exact same color again on top so you kind of end up with like a double thick line the cake batter recipe that I've given you works perfectly for a double batter in this tin and I'll leave dimensions for that down below that is one of the most amazingly vibrant cake batter trays I've ever seen that one's going to go from the oven and it's only going to take between 14 and 16 minutes to bake but you'll know it's done when you press lightly in the center and it springs back and doesn't sink look at this this is my version of heaven I love a good rainbow cake before I took that out I'm just going to take a knife and I just want to run around the outside edges we've got the baking paper on the bottom so I'm not too worried that I'm going to get into too much trouble with sticking I've also learned just a board with another bit of baking paper and I'm going to invert that onto my track making sure not to touch those hot edges and flip it as you lift that off you reveal the most amazing gorgeous vibrant striped rainbow cake this is how we get the rainbow strap technique inside our bunt I'm going to pop this off into the freezer I don't want it to be frozen solid but I want it to be really really nice and cool because that's going to make it a lot firm at a cup for your chocolate bundt I'm gonna take four ounces of my Nestle Tollhouse semi-sweet chocolate morsels and I'm going to mix them together with a quarter cup of cream and microwave them on 30-second intervals stirring in between it's only gonna take about a minute but what I'm gonna create here is a really delicious semi-sweet chocolate a river with my chocolate syrup done and that's what's gonna make this boat cake super rich and fudgy I'm gonna take all of my cake ingredients now this is a super simple recipe because you really just pop it all together and mix so in goes my sugar my eggs and your egg should be at room temperature for best baking and rise results water also at room temperature I've got a little oil which helps to keep our cake really nice and moist my Nestle Tollhouse cocoa powder because this is going to be a chocolate cake I've got my butter now generally speaking all use salted butter if you don't have salted butter you can also use unsalted butter and just add a pinch of salt to your recipe a little bit of vanilla to really bring out that flavor and a little bit of flour with that baking powder already combined I'm going to mix that through before adding my chocolate syrup I'm you know poor in my next little house semi-sweet chocolate river mixture and this is going to make that color really dark and that flavor really fudgy with our chocolate cake mixture all mixed and ready to go you want to take some nonstick cooking spray and give the bundt in a really good spray don't forget to do the middle bit I always forget to do the middle bit so I'm gonna bake like about a half an inch just a really small amount of chocolate batter on the bottom of my bundt in which is actually gonna be the top of my bundt cake don't put too much here else you're not gonna have enough room for those love hearts to sit on top we're gonna bake this for about seven minutes so that it's par Becht and it gives our little love hearts a nice little flat spot to sit on and use most spatula just to spread it around a little bit and into the oven it goes well that goes baking you can take your cake out of the freezer it doesn't have to be frozen solid but freezing it makes it a lot easier to handle so I'm just going to flip it and that baking paper means it doesn't get stuck to my board peel off the baking paper on top and I'm gonna use a bread knife just to level it off so that all of my hearts are gonna be the same sort of height so just carefully just taking the very very top off this is always my favorite part of any rainbow cake because I just start lifting that take off you reveal the beautiful rainbow cake beneath without any oven browning or any of the edging of cakes it's just stunning now that I've revealed my beautiful cake and leveled it off I'm going to use my love heart cookie cutter and you can actually do this with any shape but I love how it's really nice and easy to balance back in our bunt tin so I'm going to cut love heart shapes as close together as I can and as I do it I'm trying to make sure that I get all of the colors of the rainbow in my love heart so when you're picking your cookie cutter you need to pick one that's going to fit inside your bunt in nicely but that's also going to be able to capture all of those beautiful rainbow colors you're gonna need a lot of these love hearts so keep cutting until you've used up all of your cake you can see how firm that cake is so setting it in the freezer for a little bit really makes it a lot easier to cut and especially if you start to push it out of those get cut as it stops it from crumbling now we want those frozen solid so while our bunt is baking our hearts are freezing and it's time to start thinking about assembly now with my bundt cake nice and kind of baked I'm going to take my raw butter and I'm gonna put a little bit more of that on top it's gonna kind of act like a bit of a glue so I'm just gonna use my spatula and just kind of smear it on its going to melt a little bit because it's raw cake going on to kind of warm hot cake you don't need too much here I'm going to take my little frozen love hearts now so there's a really really nice firm and solid and I'm going to place them upside down all the way around that bundt cake kind of in the middle as much as you can leave a little tiny gap in between each of them because otherwise they're not going to kind of sit in properly in your round shape perfect you've got all of your little love hearts kind of lined up I've got my chocolate cake batter in a large piping bag and this is just so that I can get a really neat fill so I'm going to come in and I'm going to fill between my hearts making sure that I'm giving them each a little bit of personal space this is a beautiful effect because every slice of Funt cake you're going to get rain bowl of hot chocolate rain bowl of hot chocolate so it really makes for a beautiful surprising side effect coming down to the inside and I'm really really squeezing that chocolate cake batter in there because I want to make sure that I don't end up with any gaps or air bubbles inside my cake when I first tried a twice baked cake technique I wasn't 100% sure how cake would go being baked twice in the oven I was absolutely sure that it would come out dry but the moist cake around the outside actually protects it and the fact that we've got a little bit of oil in both of these cake mixes means they're a little bit moist us straight from the get-go I'm going to use my spatula now and I'm just going to just smooth that around but you don't want to overfill your bundt tin be really gentle here we don't want to disturb the points of our love heart I'm going to give my bunt a couple of just soft taps on the bench to make sure that chocolate cake mixtures gone all the way down and that is going off into a moderate oven for about 30 minutes but you'll know it's done when you touch around the outside edges not the middle the outside edges or the inside edges and it springs back when touched so my bundt cake is baked to perfection it looks fantastic but before I take that out I'm going to let it sit in that bunk tin for 15 minutes that's going to allow to sweat a little bit which will help it release really easily when I go to turn it out in the meantime because we can frost this one up warm I'm gonna make a really simple ganache using my Nestle Tollhouse semi-sweet morsels I opted for semi-sweet right the way throughout this cake but specifically for the ganache because the cake itself is quite sweet and this is going to take away from that super sweetness of like a milk chocolate feel free to switch it out if you're a milk fan or if you'd like something a little bit darker to make my ganache I'm just going to take my cream and I'm going to pour it over the top of my Nestle Tollhouse chocolate morsels and then that's going to go into the microwave 30-second intervals stirring really well in between it should only take about a minute and we're looking for a beautiful smooth glossy river of chocolate now I'm going to take my buns and I'm going to put it straight into a cake board but to do this I'm going to turn the cake board upside down stick it on top of the tin fill the tin to make sure it's not so hot and then I'm going to flip it I'm going to let the weight of the bundt pull down so that I've kind of not having to do too much to get it out and there's our bundt cake looking rather like an unassuming boring chocolate bun but it's going to be anything but when we cut into it just giving my ganache quick stir around to make sure it's glossy and smooth and silky and I'm going to spoon it on because I want it to kind of gather in little pools around the bottom of my bundt has nothing better than the smell of a rich slightly dark chocolaty ganache I always like to give ganache a couple of taps just to smooth it out a little bit not too hard because I definitely don't want a broken cake stand but essentially this is your surprise inside rainbow love hard bunt this is always the part that makes me the most excited but also the most nervous because you never know what's been going on here until you actually cut it's the moment of truth so when we cut in slicing down the cake feels amazing it's so soft and spongy we did it we made not your Nana's bundt cake I love this guy because it's so unassuming and when you arrive at the party with just another bundt cake and then people cut into it they're going to be amazed at how we got a rainbow-striped love heart baked right inside and beyond excited about how this turned out for me this is the ultimate Valentine's Day cake it says love it says rainbow and it's smothered in chocolate it doesn't really get much better than that bear in mind when you're serving this not every single slice is going to have the exact amount of rainbow because we did have those little gaps of chocolate so with your first slice make sure that you have a beautiful amount of rainbow on both sides of your piece and then cut even sized pieces around the bundt cake which will help you to keep that even rainbow look on all of your pieces throughout a big THANK YOU to Nestle Tollhouse for teaming up with me on today's video I had so much fun coming up with an average bundt cake that's

hi everyone its Elise and welcome back to my cupcake addiction I've been reading my comments and there have been so many requests for something Zootopia famed so today I'm going to bring you a utopia cake and later in the week I'm also going to show you how to make some really fun Zootopia cookies not one but two Zootopia themed treats the things that you're going to need to make your Zootopia cake I'm using a little figurine of Judy the rabbit this is a plastic figurine and I just picked it up from a local toy store I've got some white chocolate and I've got some whipping cream the colors that I'm using today are electric colors so I'm using electric orange and electric blue my ganache is going to be orange and my buttercream frosting is blue this is a single batch of my perfectly pipeable buttercream frosting I'll leave a link to that recipe down below and I've also got some of my sugar cookie dough again I'll leave that recipe down below this is actually only 1/2 batch so if you wanted to make the cake with the dough and then the cookies out of the dough as well make sure you check out that cookies video because you can get the whole lot done with just that one batch of dough I've got two different types of sprinkles some large colorful sprinkles and then I've got some smaller ones and I've just made a mix of orange blue and green kind of teaming in the Zootopia colors some pink candy melts some dark candy melts or dark chocolate a couple of popsicle sticks I've got a smaller circle cutter and then on large bowl I'll leave the measurements of those down below we're gonna be making a big donut I've got two chocolate cakes 7 inches by about 1 inch and I'll leave a link to my chocolate gig recipe down below and then for my tools I've just got a rolling pin baking tray scissors ziplock bag a knife and an offset spatula a little bit of flour to roll out a cookie dough let's get started first thing we're gonna do is make a sugar cookie so we're going to make a big doughnut the premise of this cake is there's a scene in the movie where Judy is in I think tiny town and she stops this gigantic doughnut that rolls off the top of a donut shop from squishing the little mold girl the daughter of the mole gangster father so I am going to make the donut and Judy is going to be saving the donut from crushing the cake so my sugar cookie dough is being chilled as it always should be a generous amount of flour down and because it's quite cool don't worry too much of it sort of crack sir the edges just press it back together it's better to roll it out a little too chilled than not children up or else it gets really sticky so you can see my little cracks here push them back together and keep rolling and you want this to be quite thick we don't want too thin of a sugar cookie here because it's got to hold its own way I'm going to show you guys a bit of a trick for getting really nice rounded edges and if you take a little bit of plastic wrap and just lay it over my cookie dough and this is going to give us kind of like the edge of the donut although kind of rounded side edge of the donut I used a bowl because I didn't have a circle cookie cutter this large I'm gonna place it onto my cookie dough and just to show you guys that thickness it's a pretty thick cookie dough that we've got going on there and then I'm gonna press down with all of my muscles lifting up now you can see by using that plastic wrap what we've got is a really really nice rounded edge just like a doughnut for my center hole I'm gonna use the back edge of my cookie cutter not the sharp edge because again kind of want it to be a little bit more rounded right in the middle and down she goes the only disadvantage with doing that is you get this really lovely rounded edge but you do have a little bit that you've got to tidy up around those outside edges it's worth it for the nice round edge but you just need to neat it up with a knife so you mine lined tray now and I'm just going to slide my offset spatula just underneath the cookie making sure he's not stuck to the bench at all and then careful and lifting the other advantage to working with super chilled cookie dough is that it's much easier to pick up it doesn't stretch out of shape that's going to go over here onto my piece of parchment and then I'm going to take my two popsicle sticks and I'm going to stick them up into the donut you can actually cook the popsicle sticks in the oven so they're going to go right into the bottom section this is going to be what sort of holds it onto the cake you'll notice that I'm supporting the cookie with my hand as I do this so that I don't stretch it out of shape one and two and kind of just Pat it out but we're going to put decorations on that so don't worry about it being too perfect that one's going to go off into a moderate oven so that's 175 or 350 for about 10 minutes but keep your eye on it because it's a little thicker than a regular sugar cookie as soon as you start to see it coloring around the edges you'll know it's ready and you can pull it out to cool smells amazing and it looks perfect but just starting to color around the outside edges but it's still nice and light in the little center pieces so let that sit on the tray for about 10 minutes before you move it onto a cooling rack just so that it's not just baked fragile when your little cookie completely cooled he'll be kind of like a bit of a kind of cute cookie lollipop so now you want to take your dark chocolate or your dark melts pop them into a snap seal bag and then I'm just going to snip off the tip it doesn't have to be too thin because we're covering quite a big area all right now I'm going to come down to my cookie and we're going to sort of trace the edge first so you want to come right out around those edges and you're kind of making like a wavy line you still want to be able to definitely see some of that Brown cookie around the outside edge because that's what makes it look like a doughnut and then the rest should be covered in delicious dark chocolate and then for the middle again you can just kind of come around the middle and then kind of take it into the center every now and again and then we're going to fill it in so flood flood flood and work quite quickly here because we want to sort of tap it down so that you've got the option to smooth off all of that dark chocolate before it starts to set if you guys are having trouble getting your chocolate or your melts to an ice melted consistency where you can pipe it or spread it or if they're too thick check out my how to melt chocolate and candy melts sometimes I'll add a little bit of shortening actually like that been adding coconut oil because I prefer the taste just to kind of thin things out a little bit especially with those candy melts they can sometimes be quite chunky when you first melt them and it becomes really difficult to do things like this finally there's a cookie with enough chocolate on it to keep me happy alright so at the moment it's all kind of squirrely and a bit messy I'm gonna take just a little cooling rack and you should be able to lift that by the sticks just support it underneath and rather than tapping the cookie I'm going to tap the whole rack on the bench having the rack also allows some of that chocolate to drip through as it kind of uses over the side beautiful and smooth now I've got my slightly larger sprinkles and I'm going to sprinkle around but I kind of want to stick to the outside edge in the inside edge only letting a few go into the middle because I got to put a bit of writing over there that says the big doughnut like it does on the movie and I don't want to have to write over too many sprinkles it'll just make my job a bit harder and someone that little inside edge perfect we're going to let that one completely cool I'd advise cooling that at room temperature and just letting it set and then we're going to come and put some text over the top in our pink candy melts once your chocolate set take your pink candy melt your pink chocolate and just pop it into a snaps your bag you can also use a piping bag with like a number one tip on it here but I seem to be quite deck stress for the snap seal bag so that's always my go-to snip off a very nice fine point because they're going to be doing some lettering we need to write on this doughnut the big doughnut so the top two words are the big and then the bottom word is donut like on the movie I'm going to start with donut and I'm going to do the letter n first so that I kind of centralize everything and then I'll do the do on the other side and the UT always you have a habit of kind of shoving everything off to one side too far so with my lettering I like to just do the basic letter and then kind of go and fill it in just in case I make a bit of a mistake on one of my first lines the great thing about the donut on the movie is that it's very obviously hand painted so we've got a bit of leeway here if your piping is not quite perfect if you're finding a melted candy spreading or kind of going everywhere not doing as its told sit the whole ziploc bag just on the bench for a few minutes and let it just cool down a little bit it might just be your candies a little bit too well melted it just needs to start to set back up again so it's a little thicker and easier to pipe with so again you'll notice I'm starting with the last letter of my first word and the first letter of my second word just to get my positioning and then I can go out from there all right our wording is done so now let that completely dry I'm just going to put it off to the side you can actually do this a day or two in advance and store it in an airtight container which makes putting together the cake on the day of the party so much quicker I'm in love with this donut alright I'm through our cake so like with all my cakes I like to live it off and I always just use a bread knife or a serrated knife if you have a cake leveler you could definitely use that as well turning my cake slicing it nice and flat on top and now to frost so I'm going to take my cake I'm going to put a little bit of frosting onto my cake board I'm actually using kind of a thick cork placemat for my board today because it's this really bright green color which goes perfectly with the Zootopia theme a little bit of frosting down on goes my first layer of cake and then I'm just gonna frost in between the layers not too much frosting and then my second layer of cake on top I'm gonna put a crumb coat of frosting all over the outside of the cake and then I'm gonna let that set before I put my nice coat on top trying to let any crumbs go back into your frosting bowl so a crumb coat is just a really thin firmly pressed in coat of frosting and let's go you're messy coat just holds everything in place so I can get a really nice coat of perfect blue frosting on top perfect so that one's going to go off into the fridge about 15 20 minutes to set while it's setting you don't get to rest we're going to make our ganache because you want the ganache to kind of get nice and runny and melted and then have a bit of time to set back up so it's not super super runny so you show me cream and I'm going to pour it straight over the top of my white chocolate and then that's going to go into the microwave for 30 second intervals stirring in between until it's perfectly smooth you should have quite a nice runny ganache it's going to be quite hot so you want to make it now so that it's got time to cool down before we put it on okay because we don't want it melting through that buttercream I'm gonna add a generous amount of my electric orange food coloring because I want this to be super bright it's gonna be a great contrast to the blue that I've picked that is my orange ganache so that's actually going to thicken up a little bit more as it sets but we are going to put that over to the side and get our cake out of the fridge all right cake should be firm to touch no buttercream comes off kind of sounds a bit like a drum so now we're going to put our nice coat of frosting on and you want your sprinkles at the ready here because they're only going to stick to fresh frosting they're not going to stick to semi crusted frosting so we're gonna frost all over with a generous amount of frosting you'll notice this cakes actually not a huge cake I don't know about you guys but when I have parties I have so many desserts that nobody wants a massive serving of cake and normally always only got like eight to ten friends over so I love that this is a slightly smaller cake that you don't have to serve to 30 40 50 people you can kind of whip it up very easily but it's still got that wow factor because of the big donut on top the character included once you've got all of your frosting on the cake wipe off the spatula and come around this is your opportunity to get the sides neat and straight all the way around in as long of a smooth movement as you can and then I use the edge of my spatula so kind of angled Cheers to come in and kind of take a little bit of that side edge frosting off while also smoothening and neaten in my edges all right okay it's frosted so now it's time to get some of our sprinkles and I'm just going to Pat them around just the bottom kind of intro so of the cake to add a little bit of color now you can get rid of your excess sprinkles and you should have a nice little rimmed edge I'm sort of being a bit risky here but that cake is glued to the bottom of the board so I think I'm okay sprinkles are pretty light get rid of any of those excess sprinkles and you should have an iced cake with kind of a sprinkled bottom edge back into the fridge we want that one to completely set so again buttercream should be nice and firm and your ganache should still be running you certainly don't want it to be completely set but it's now at least body temperature or room temperature not cold just not at all hot or warm so on goes a generous amount and then I'm gonna take my spatula and I'm just gonna spread all the way up to those edges to smooth it out on top and to encourage my drips I'm just going to give it a couple of small taps and I'm gonna let those beautiful drips do their thing back off into the fridge to set and that orange color is going to become more vibrant as that ganache set so we're back to the fridge and you want to pick the side that's got the drips that you prefer now I wrapped a little Judy's feet in a bit of plastic wrap just so that she doesn't come into contact with the cake and I don't lose any of her in the cake and what you want to do is you need to size up your donut cookie with the cake so Judy needs to be holding it kind of in the middle so she needs to almost look like she's the same size of it but standing on top of the cake she's too tall so I'm going to put her in kind of the side of the cake and then I'm going to frost her it so I'm going to take my circle cutter and I'm going to cut a bit of a space for her just through those top two layers and my cakes nice and cool and then using my sharp knife I'm just going to comment along the bottom of my little circle cutter because I don't want to upset the drips or anything else and lift out that piece like so so just testing out that I'm happy with the height she's going to be out with my little cavity cut there she's gonna rest in there just nicely up to her knees so I'm going to take a little bit of my blue frosting and I'm just going to kind of create like a little frosted section for her stick to and then in goes Judy I'm gonna push your feet right in so she's actually kind of tucked inside the wall of my cake and then I'm gonna frost her it popping your frosting into a ziploc bag can help you just position it a little bit more neatly and I'm going to frost right in here so she's will and stuck into position now just smooth out the frosting and then if you want I've got a little bit of my orange ganache left so I'm just going to just sort of redo those little drips over behind you tease back just so that we've sort of still got the same look going on around the outside of the cake now finally you got to take your big doughnut and we are going to position it in place so Judy's hands should really come either side of it and we want it to be relatively central in the cake you want to take a little blob of those dark candy melts of that dark chocolate and use it just to stick Judy's hand to the back of that donor essentially it's going to glue her hand in place and it's going to help secure her to the cake a little bit better just before disaster strikes Judy saves the day catches the gigantic donor cookie and hopefully shares it with me this is a really well sized easy to achieve Zootopia cake at any Zootopia fans going to go absolutely nuts for this if you're having a whole Zootopia themed party make sure you check out my Zootopia cookies and guys if you're not already subscribed to the channel make sure you do for two new videos every week thanks very much for watching 
it's time for a tiny party today I have steamed up with Google home and Google Play Music to make a tiny party for my kids I'm going to be relying on my google Oh help me plan and convert my recipes to make tiny items and Google Play Music is going to provide the perfect playlist for baking and having my mini party [Music] to make my tiny party truly amazing I'm going to need to plan out my desserts and my day goal for my mini desserts I'm thinking a tiny cake maybe some little cupcake sundae surprises and baby banana bites I'll also make miniature milkshakes and some tiny hot dogs to round out the party to style it up I found a pint-sized pinata mini party hats and I'll be showing you how to make plenty balloons because basically everything better in miniature so let's get about it okay google play some music for baking sure here's a Google Play Music station called farm to table first off we're going to make eight minutes okay so I'm going to take my butter and that's four tablespoons of butter my egg my sugar 4 tablespoons of sugar and a quarter of a teaspoon just a little bit of vanilla you need an electric mixer here if you like but I feel like to such a small cake it's kind of a waste of washing up so I'm just mixing by hand so that's all mixed up I'm going to add in half a cup of flour with a teaspoon of baking powder and then I've got 30 milliliters of milk ok Google what 30 milliliters converted into tablespoons 30 milliliters equals 2.0 to nine US tablespoons so 2 tablespoons of milk or 2 0.029 if you want to be precise we'll mix that one all the way around because it's cakes for my kids and I know they love sprinkles I've also got a quarter of a cup it's sprinkled once you put these ones in try not to mix them around too much because they will start to run if you over mix them so gently fold them through then you want to get it straight into your baking tin now my smallest cake tin is a six inch and I want this to be a really small cake so I'm actually going to fake it in a tin can to the 420 gram can okay Google what's 420 grams in ounces 420 grams equals fourteen point eight one five ounces so about a 15 ounce cans you want to give that a good spray with some cooking oil and then line it with a circle of parchment on the base and a length of parchment around the outside into the can not going too low it feels weird putting food into a can instead of taking it in you want to take your can of cake and you're going to put it into a preheated oven sometimes going to go in at about 350 Fahrenheit or if you're in Celsius okay Google what's the conversion for 350 Fahrenheit into Celsius 350 degrees Fahrenheit equals one hundred seventy six point six six seven degrees Celsius so 175 or 176 point six six seven if you want to be really precise you want to bake for about 25 to 30 minutes okay Google can you sent me a timer for 25 minutes all right 25 minutes starting now you'll know that one's done when it springs back when you touch it on top or a skewer in the middle comes out clean we're ready okay Google stop timer what's that one cool in the can for about five minutes and then remove it by just lifting a parchment and tipping out the cake pop the cake on a wire rack and let it completely cool before you start frosting to decorate I'm using about a cup of frosting that I've tinted pink you can make your own or use store-bought I'm going to slice the very top bit of the cake off and then divide it in half frost in the middle and all the way around the outsides getting it nice and straight I want to press smaller brown sprinkles around the bottom section and then I'm going to use just to start piping tip to pipe little tiny stars of frosting on top and then some different long sprinkles in the middle some tiny red bowls on top to kind of look like cherries and then we're going to complete a little quick three long candles and that's it the star of our mini party is done and it looks adorable so let's move on to some more cute mini things mini balloons yes you could just swap regular balloons small but then they'd be all wrinkly so I decided to use water balm to create mini balloon cloth two water balloons and tie knots in them and then I'm using a combination of either bendy straws or paper straw take a skewer and use that to really force the little balloon time right into that bendy straw as far as it can go and then take just a little bit of curling ribbon and tie it around that can help make it look more balloony but also support it on top if you've got paper straws they work really well too but you'll want to cut four small incisions just to the very very top just about a couple of millimeters long and then stand them out take your balloon and use the skewers to push it down into the paper straw just like you did with the bendy ones but then you want to close up those little paper statements and again tie it off with a little bit of curling ribbon sliding it all the way up so those little cup segments kind of trap your balloon in place mini balloons I like a combination of the curly straws and the street straws in all different patterns but it's completely up to you either way the absolutely adorable these also make a really cute cake topper just if you're looking for I do next up it's a tiny surprise cupcake sundaes so these ones I've baked the miniature cupcake and I found some really small little drinking cups I'm going to put chocolate coated candies in the bottom of mine in all different colors and then a really fun bright mini spoon pop your cupcakes on top of the candies and then I'm going to use some white buttercream frosting with an open round piping tip to pipe a nice high swell I've got some ice cream wafers and I'm just going to slice them with a serrated edge knife to make little teeny tiny looking triangular ice-cream Reese's a little melted chocolate in a snap sealed bag kind of Jerusalem on top and give them a tap to make sure it looks a little bit gooey luxurious chocolate and then add on some sprinkles and finally a little red candies add an ice cream wafer at the back and you're done super simple and the kids will go nuts to move we've got a mini cake mini balloons mini surprise cupcake sundaes but we're going to need something to drink so I'm going to show you guys how to make mini milk cake I found these adorable mini mason jars which is what I'm going to serve my milkshakes in for the ingredients you can make your favorite but if you want a really simple one I've got four teaspoons of chocolate milk powder 300 mils of whole milk and I've got 150 mils of whipping cream I'm not using a mixer today I'm going to be making mine in a mason jar we don't need very much milkshake for our mini party pour the cream into the milk and then add the chocolate powder pop on the lid and shake it all about because they put cream in that it's actually gonna whip a little bit in the mason jar so shake it for a fair while it'll help stick in your milkshake up let's take a look at our milkshake YUM you know you can actually whip cream in a mason jar from liquid to it there's a little known fact pour your milkshakes into your little mason textbook finish on the amount one mason guy equals four mini milkshakes and my leftovers kind of sad if you want a garnish I'm going to take a little bit of whipped cream some sprinkles and mini gummy bears chance to dress them up a little bit kind of adorable some a good sweet we've got drinks we've got some decorations I feel like we need something for a main course and make some fruit these guys are called grated banana boy they're a good way to get bananas in the potty but we're making them just a little bit more fun than your average banana I'm going to cut off any curved edges we're taking good clean healthy bananas and we're adding what just Cragen green call maybe a little cream so we're going to take these bananas and supplement chocolate awesome but it's going to make like a little chocolate foot free to Val banana pieces whoa I'm getting messy yeah whatever yeah all right I'm adding fresh cream on top of our banana bot and then do you want to sprinkle yeah and then I'm going to add a cherry if you don't like cherry just infer like a red M&amp;M or something it just kind of looks cute on top Holly it's nearly time for the party shall we go set it up yeah all right my mini party's gonna be set up on a mini table which is essentially a study done I'm starting with mini ruffles as a little waffle ball stuck to the wall and then I'm going to use of course my mini balloon add my mini pinata whose filled with mini candies t-rex with a hat and balloon because the boys will love it next goes on the mini cake surprise cupcakes sundaes Google home needs a spot at my party table named Ivan alibi I'm going to add my milk shake I'm going to make these laugh because I want them to be nice and hot when they go out but I found there's a little tiny dinner rolls and I'm going to make miniature hotdogs and it's going to cut my rolls and add in a miniature sausage my kids love cheese so that's a must and then since tomorrow sauce and relish and out they go now that my hot dogs are ready they can go on as well as a couple of tiny presents let's get the kids in okay Google Play some fun family music alright here's a Google Play

[Music] welcome back to my cupcake addiction on today's video I am excited to be partnering with Gameloft with a video inspired by the Disney Magic Kingdom's game they're celebrating the introduction of news Beauty and the Beast characters for the game and what better way to celebrate them with Beauty and the Beast cupcakes we're not just making these guys we're making all the Beauty and the Beast cupcakes even just on guest dawn if you guys haven't played the Disney Magic Kingdom's game I'm going to leave a link down below where you can download it it's totally free and it's lots of fun my kid play it I play it we play it together and just between you and I I kind of have a tendency to play it a little more when they go to bed - to make your Beauty and the Beast cupcakes you're going to need some buttercream frosting I'm using chocolate and I've also got some vanilla that I printed a nice deep yellow I've got a few assorted piping tips in both rounds and swirl a little fondant in red and pink some crushed chocolate cookies one tiny peanut butter cup a mini red M&amp;M and a white candy melts I've also got a glass dome and of course cupcakes I'm using my mud cake recipe which I'll link to down below along with both my chocolate and vanilla frosting recipes you're also going to need some fresh roses I've also made you guys some perfectly sized templates that you can print I'll leave a link to those down below as well let's get started the first thing you want to do and you can do this well in advance to save time on the day it's cut around the template they're perfectly sized for standard cupcakes and I like to print mine on slightly thicker paper or attach them to a piece of cardstock tape it to speak to the back of each of your template so that you've got all of the characters that you want to make out of today's series I'm going to start with Cogsworth and Lumiere and as predicted they're gonna share a cupcake so by the looks of things then I'm so happy about and you use chocolate for a second I'm going to start with a flat top frosting style so it basically just put a ton of frosting on top of the cupcake and then use the back of a knife to smooth it down pushing it over the edges and then wipe off the knife and use the back of the knife to kind of straighten those edges up so you've got a nice flat top and nice high smooth side I'm going to roll out a little bit of red fondant because I'm rolling out the red carpet for these two and cut it into a strip laying it over the top of that frosting they look a little mad and kind of like they're fighting so because I want them to be fighting over something worthwhile I'm going to make a tiny cupcake using my little tiny peanut butter cup a small sausage of pink fondant and then I'm just going to use a little water to attach one red mini M&amp;M on top cupcakes I know that there are bigger bolder characters in the movie but these two these are my favorites adorable fighting over cupcakes very appropriate for my cupcake addiction moving on the bell the bell of our ball tonight I'm going to use a regular cupcake that I baked this one in a gold cupcake liner with a little bit of frosting on top of the cupcake and then take an upturned strawberry and put cell into the strawberry place your strawberry on top of that frosted cupcake and then I'm going to use some yellow buttercream frosting with a round open piping tip in a piping bag and create sort of a ruffled dress if it so pipe a small circle and then drag that circle up to create almost like a long tear drop sheet and start around the line of the top of the cupcake so you can work your way up the little strawberry you might need to lift fill just a little bit so that you can taper that frosting nice and close around the toothpick and then place it back down so shoot super snug in her gorgeous ball gown ready to go and meet the Beast all right re-enacting the pose basically twins so the tribe chips apish up is always absolute favorite character so I'm going to give chippies a little saucer using that white candy melt flip it upside down because that's going to help raise it up off the cupcake and then I just use this straw to kind of just indent the shape of almost like a little teacup indentation on to that candy melt I'm using chocolate frosting paired with a star piping tip and I'm just going to make like a nice low swirl then I'm going to take mrs. Potts and ship and pop them on top of the cupcake you'll need to place chips toothpicks through that candy melt before he goes on top of the cupcake so you don't squish your little frosting swirl chip and mrs. Potts you know chip saves the day that's why Ollie liked it not because it's cute nope it could be friendly because he saves the day sitting good job chips no bees this is Jacob's favorite character which I think there's a lot about both of their personalities I'm starting my beast cupcake with a cupcake in a brown cupcake liner and another one of those nice life strawberries because this guy needs to be pretty big a good swirl of chocolate frosting on the cupcake to hold that strawberry in place and then on goes the strawberries well around the outside of the strawberry using just a round open piping tip to kind of create like an uber frosted cupcake and then I'm going to use a fork to rustle up the frosting to give it a hairy kind of effect so it represents the beast first take your template and pop it into the top of the strawberry putting Beast in place roll out your fondant and cut like an oversized triangle shape and then I just sort of made it up against the back of that template and stuck it to the frosting making sure that it comes around just underneath each of the beasts arm so it sort of continues down that red regal cape I feel like there's some size discrepancy in oles favorite character and Jacobs favorite character and I know who's going to win I think all he might change his mind I think his favorite character is going to be whatever is the biggest cupcake I couldn't make all of the good guys without making the bad guys so we're on to Gaston and you can bet Gaston being the villain that he is is definitely going to make an appearance with the new Beauty and the Beast characters in the Disney Magic Kingdom's game for Gaston I'm gonna start with a chocolate cupcake in a brown cupcake liner and I'm just going to use a spoon and a knife to kind of roughly apply frosting to the top make it like kind of a messy dome it doesn't have to be perfect roll your cupcake in some of your craft chocolate cookies so it looks like he's kind of standing on a mound of dirt and then indoors your Gaston on his little toothpick already he looks a little bit scary but you know he's not going to fight the Beast without having his torch so I'm going to use a long golden candle to rest in the dirt beside him which can be lit if you want these for a birthday party happy birthday to me Gaston not so good to you this one's a bit of a feature cupcake so if you're going to make the entire range I'd only recommend having one of these as kind of a signature special one in the center I'm using some yellow frosting paired with just a round open piping tip to make a nice low swirl the top of the cupcake and then I'm going to take a milkshake straw and insert it into the top I got a green one for the road cut the milkshake straw also ever so slightly protruding out of the cupcake and it's kind of can act like a bit of a vase take one of your roses and trim it to size and then place it inside the milkshake straw don't go with a skinnier straw here because Rose stems can be pretty thick I'm adding a couple of fallen petals then popping that glass dome on top so this really resembles that iconic rose they know it's not the one with the most candy but it's probably my favorite finally is a bit of an optional extra you can actually pair Beauty and the Beast together just a regular cupcake in a brown cupcake liner and I'm going to use that yellow buttercream frosting again with an open round piping tip make a nice pie swirl and then pop down my template with both Beauty and the Beast this is a great option if you want to save a little bit of time but still have all of the characters all you need to do is pop them in and they're ready to go wonder if these guys feel like dancing they say you shouldn't play with your food but I feel like when you're recreating and I kind of clean from movie it's probably acceptable I love coming up with all the designs for all of your favorite Beauty and the Beast characters a big thanks to GameWorks for partnering with me on today's video I love the Disney Magic Kingdom's game and with the addition of the new Beauty and the Beast characters it's only going to get better my kids are so excited to eat the cupcake play the game and kind of live life imitate art I'm going to leave a link down below where you guys can download Disney Magic Kingdom for free let me know when you've got it and what you think because I absolutely love it and I know you guys will too you can only get the Beauty and the Beast characters in the Disney Magic Kingdom's game between March 9 and April 3rd so if you're thinking about downloading it and you want to see all of your favorite Beauty and the Beast characters I suggest you get onto it quickly thanks very much for tuning in to another my cupcake addiction video let me know if you make these guys to play us some of the cutest cupcakes I've ever seen see you next time [Music] you [Music] 
hey guys it's Elise and welcome back to my cupcake addiction a little while back I posted this pretty cool and relatively easy a rainbow layer surprise inside Instagram cake and you guys absolutely loved it but ever since you've been asking me to make something else social media related so today I'm gonna be showing you how to make some really fun social media cupcakes and I hope that I've managed to cover off on most of your favorite social apps the things that you'll need to make your social media cupcakes I just made a batch of vanilla frosting and I've colored it in two different shades of blue add a little food coloring and then a little more to get your darker blue I've got red yellow and because I didn't want to make a whole batch of chocolate frosting I just added some Nutella to a bowl of my vanilla frosting to kind of hack a vanilla frosting and make it chocolate with a delicious Nutella retwist I've got some melted white chocolate or candy melts scissors a knife and I've got a ziploc bag and I've also made you guys some templates today so I've created some really fun little printable cupcake wrappers and also some cute little Instagram outlines and I'll link to those down below so you can download them print those out on something slightly thicker than paper so I normally use about a 210 GSM cardstock otherwise you can print them out on paper and stick them to something a little bit more heavy-duty so they support your cupcakes I've got a piece of parchment or baking paper and another template for our toppers and of course I've got my cupcakes I'll leave links to good cupcake recipes down below let's get started you want to take your parchment paper and I'm just gonna lay it over the top of my little printed template and then I've put my white chocolate into a ziploc bag and I'm gonna snip off a very fine little point to make a pretty precise tiny little piping tip if your white chocolates too runny just let it sit in the bag on the bench for a couple of minutes so it's not going everywhere when you try to start piping it I'm gonna trace around my templates starting with my little snapchat ghost and I always like to start by doing the outline and then filling it in because that way I kind of have more room for error if I make a bit of a mistake err on the outline I can kind of drag the chocolate back inside the shape and as the outline starts to set it gives me a really nice little guide and a barrier for all the rest of my white chocolate to sit within and then you're gonna pipe the little white chocolate stem so this is basically what holds it in place in the cupcake and it's a delicious bit of white chocolate hidden within the cupcake because I know these are going to set as we go along and I don't want to have all these little ridges in there after I'm apart each of my stoppers I'm just gonna slightly tap my paper on the bench don't go too crazy you don't want to like mess up your work chocolate but you'll see it just sort of flattens the top out and makes it a little bit less lumpy and bumpy moving on you want to do all four of your little logos those ones you don't want to set in the fridge because if you put them in the fridge it's gonna cause the chocolate to kind of curl a little bit so just set them at room temperature while they're setting we can frost up our cupcakes so I've got mine all sitting in the cupcake wrappers but I don't recommend actually frosting them in the cupcake wrappers I'm gonna frost them just in their regular little liners and we're gonna do a flat top frosting style this is a style of frosting that I use all the time and I love it because you don't need any piping bags or any piping tips we're literally just using a knife if you didn't catch my video ro showed you five cool fun decorating techniques using nothing more than a knife I'll leave a link to it down below basically what I'm doing is I'm just piling on a ton of frosting I'm smoothing it so that it sort of squishes out over the outside edges of the cupcake it looks a little bit messy at the moment then I'm gonna wipe my knife and I'm gonna come around and just scrape it back so you can see there I get like a nice neat kind of a high wall around my cupcake once I've got my high wall I'm just gonna use the knife again just to even out the top and there I've got a flat top frosted cupcake so I'm gonna make sure that my frosting matches the color of my cupcake case and you also want to make sure when you're using these paper cupcake cases or these cardboard cupcake cases try not to let your buttercream frosting touch the cupcake case because the butter from it will actually kind of absorb into the case so you can see I've got my cupcake liner right flush up against that cupcake wrapper that's gonna go off to the side and I'm gonna frost up the rest of my cupcakes so now that you've finished frosting up all your cupcakes your templates should be set and when you go to peel them off you should just be able to take them straight off that wax paper if they're not coming away quite easily they may not quite be set yet so you might want to leave them for just a little bit longer now I've got these quite long different sized cupcakes but you can size it up against your cupcake and you can snap a little bit off if you think it's gonna be a little bit too tall because we haven't set that in the fridge your chocolate should be quite pliable make sure that you're in line with your front logo and it's ass sticking your little chocolate toppers straight down into the middle make sure you stick it straight down because if you try to go on an angle you risk snapping us there's our Twitter social media cupcake love this guy and a little snapchat cupcake I kind of wish that I had have done some kind of a black outline around the ghost but I think it works without it have you're not following me on social media make sure that you do I post on my Facebook and my Instagram actually a lot more than I post here on YouTube in goes your Facebook logo like and of course YouTube I couldn't be on YouTube making cupcakes that don't involve YouTube and finally for Instagram now what I do Instagram is I just cut around these little empty box templates and then I picked photos that I liked so I've got Jakob with a stache I've got Oliver eating a gigantic cupcake so I just printed the picture stuck it inside the little Instagram frame took the Instagram frame onto a toothpick and then I'm going to pop it into the top once again I'm making sure that that little Instagram template doesn't come in contact with that chocolate frosting I thought this one was really simple and I kind of wanted to keep them that way because I wanted to make sure you only needed one color of candy milk in the white so I didn't go getting crazy amounts of ingredients involved I hope you guys loved today's social media cupcakes video make sure you follow me on social media if you're not already following me here there and everywhere I'll leave all my links down below if you like this video let me know down below if you want to see something else I always love to hear suggestions and as always thanks very much for watching 
so which one is Ali's favorite one me and which one is Jacobs favorite one Oh [Music] welcome back to my cupcake addiction now a little while ago the world or just the internet went absolutely crazy for me reglaze cakes I didn't want to show you guys how the professionals do it we all know they have their fancy tools and equipment I wanted to show you how you can make stunning mirror glaze cakes at home this is mirror glaze made simple I'm going to share my recipe with you but I'm also going to show you some super fun over-the-top stunning decorations that you can achieve in under 15 minutes the things that you need to make your mirror glaze base recipe you'll need some condensed milk some white chocolate some gelatin I'm using powdered gelatin today because it's easiest to find some glucose or light corn syrup some sugar some water a hand blender for mixing and a sifter we're also going to be using heat today so you're going to need a nice sturdy pot and something to heat it up with I'll leave all of your quantities and conversions for your glaze recipe on the my cupcake addiction comm website the first thing that I'm going to do is bloom my gelatin so I've got about 1/2 a cup of warm water I'm going to pour that over my gelatin mix and just stir through let that sit off to the side and then you want to take your water sugar and glucose and pour it all into a nice sturdy pot dipping your tools into water before they go into your glucose container helps the glucose or the corn syrup not stick to them anywhere near as much that is a little tip that you will find invaluable give that a little stir through you want to pop that onto a medium high heat on the cooktop until it starts to boil as soon as it reaches a nice rolling boil you can take it off the heat and then add in that gelatin and also the condensed milk stir it through and then immediately pour over your white chocolate and stir until it's kind of combined coming back from the heat and this stove don't be alarmed if you've still got some undissolved pieces of white chocolate that is what a hand mixer or a mini gives it emulsifiers for all right it's time to strain into my sifter the smooth delicious uncolored mirror glaze now look there's not a lot of lumps and bumps in that but take a look here you can see what we've avoided having inside our Mira glaze any one of those is going to cause an imperfection in our perfect mirrored finish and we don't want that now's the time when we can color our glaze but you don't get to pour it till it's cooled down enough that it's not going to make a huge mess so unless you know you want all of your glaze the same color I like to separate my now so that I can choose and make lots of different colors glaze can get kind of messy but I like a little bit of mess I prefer a color paste you can use liquid but you're going to need a lot more of it this is going to give you a really nice vibrant color and look there's no exact measurement color it to whatever color it is that you like I'm going for a super rich red on this glaze for my classic style mirror cake and I'm going to be showing you a bunch of really cool ways that you can decorate your mirror cakes pretty confident there's something for every occasion you might come across me and which one is Jacob's favorite one I love that cuz you love berries alright and then mommy's favorite one is the rainbow so daddy which one's your favorite one we made one for each of a family so you've got that glaze recipe down pat and you've got coloring the globes which is super easy completely sorted get creative with the colorings while this is coming to temperature I'm gonna cover it with plastic wrap just so it doesn't form a skin now let's talk cakes the mirror cakes that went completely viral like these round ring shaped entré Mays they're like a mousse cake with tons of layers inside take a lot of time to make got me thinking about multiple uses for my giant donut mold don't tell professional pastry chefs about this they're going to absolutely die so I took a batch of my chocolate cake recipe which makes enough for two donut molds and three leftover cupcakes that's just a bonus and when you tip it out you have essentially a ring cake you is a super simple way to achieve that same high end mirror glaze cake result at home it's gonna look just the same as today on the internet no one's really going to know the inside much different here's the trick to a good glazed cake breeze it you want that cake to be super cold so I'm just going to carve off the lumpy part so it's super flat on the bottom you really don't want to disturb your inside edges of your little donut because that's going to be what makes the mirror glaze Cakes so incredibly perfect and pretty turn it over get rid of any crumbs and then we're going to wrap that in plastic wrap and we are going to freeze it I've got my frozen half donut cake and I'm gonna rest it on top of a bowl the bowl is on like a wire rack over a tray that's lined with plastic so we can catch any mess this is gonna be my red I'm gonna call it love fancy this is going to be red it's gonna be gorgeous super high-end and really easy to decorate okay I've got my red I'm gonna pour it over this guy's gonna get two coats because I know I want this red to be super vibrant against that chocolate background don't be nervous here just go in go in with confidence with glaze more is more oh la la I'm gonna let that coat of red completely set then I'm going to give it a second coat because I want this red to pop so I've let that one set until it stops dripping about five minutes or so and now we're going to do a second cart then drag off any excess because I don't want to add drip on drip on drip it's not even a thing drip on drip on drip now give my glaze a stir if your glaze gets too thick at any point you can pop it in the microwave for like 15 seconds at a time just to get it to that right temperature on goes our second coat see how vibrant we can get this baby oh yeah if you notice any air bubbles in your glaze you can just take a toothpick and just pop them try and do it while it's still pretty wet because then they'll just like blend into the rest of the mirror so for my decorations for this one I have some fresh strawberries a little gold luster and some dark chocolate Hershey's I'm going easy but also really cute I like that now look there's nothing wrong with a regular Hershey's kiss but we can do better this is elf fancy sir in goes a little bit of my gold luster or a gold shimmer I'm gonna dip the tip of my Hershey turn and drop and then I'm going to take a paintbrush and I'm just gonna brush some gold onto like Hobbs of my strawberries own the fancy alright that's it from now on I only add gold strawberries no more playing strawberries gold strawberries anybody get that memo now I'm going to run my spatula around the bottom edge of my little cake get off any of those excess strips and as soon as it's completely stopped dripping I'm going to transfer it onto its final resting place or its display plate you may need to do this a couple of times to neaten it off tove you have to get inside your cake I like to use a toothpick for this and just make sure that you've got no drips or any kind of pooling in there he's so fancy when you want to transfer into the display plate you want to put your fingers just under the outside edge of your cake and you're going to pick it up position it where you want it on the plate move one finger right to the back and then drop it move as quickly as you can here and if you do get any drizzle on the plate you can just use a wet paper towel to clean it off the one thing that I always notice about these mirror glaze cakes is they tend to stick the decorations off to one side so that's what I'm gonna do it's gonna line up a few strawberries and a few Hershey's unlike half of la fancy behold la fancy he's so fancy don't be afraid of the glaze you put something in the wrong spot you've got a little bit of room to kind of slide it around I know I was surprised I thought the glaze would feel a lot fuzzier than it is but this glaze just bounces back into shape I sure named in fancy hey she'll be mine this one I'm calling Lorraine burr see you guys know I'm partial to color I've colored my glaze red orange yellow blue green and purple all right let's glaze I'm gonna start with my red this one I want to be divided in sections so I think my colors could be a bit more vibrant and that cake underneath chocolate so a little more glaze let it drip and then when you're confident that it's almost stop dripping you can just run and offsets that's your a knife around the bottom try not to drag your colors into each other I like to just scrape it off on the side of my tree and then around the center with the toothpick and don't worry that leftover ganache is not going to go to waste I really want the decorations that add a little bit of height to be quite white so I've got some lint bowls I've got some white hair shoes and also some little white morsels or chocolate drops that's literally all I'm going to do to this mirror cake I would say less is more but we've put six colors of glaze on top so more is more but maybe less on top I love how this looks I think it's absolutely stunning and I think the rainbow less excess this one I like to call own unicorn e'er this is gonna be by omage - unicorn so I've colored my clays four different colors I've gone with pink purple blue and then yellow and I'm going to pour them over my frozen cake in sections because I've done so many colors I kind of want these all to blend together I'm going for a tie-dyed rainbow effect I'm just going to spoon on all of my different colors kind of in separate sections so the colors are running into each other nicely you can let it drip away a little bit it should set pretty quickly and then just run a spatula just around the bottom section so I've got a little bit of rock candy I've got just some pastel stars and then I've got some cute little gold stars I don't go too crazy on this because the glaze kind of does all the work for me but I do want to add a little bit of fun this is the most fun of all of our glazed cakes I always like to add something that gets a little bit of height and a little bit of just something extra along one side so I'm going to add on some of my rock candy I rock candies a little bit big you're not just mash it rock candy is hard get violent in this kitchen then finally these little gold wants it can be tempting just to sprinkle these straight on but I apply them with a toothpick a little water on the end of the toothpick and then just can add just a little bit of sparkle reminds me of the time that I made pinata cookies look like rainbow unicorns that poop stars so one thing you guys would have noticed it's a lot of wastage it's not going to be wastage but part of mirror glazing means that you do have the stuff that falls into the tray and the stuff that falls into the bowl so we're going to make a galaxy version so by lining the bottoms of your little trays not only have you avoided a huge and sticky mess but you've also papered yourself to be able to grab and then slide down and essentially squeeze it out feels a lot like sticky slime here this is the gross part this is just part of cleaning up after me reglaze expected it's going to happen this is going to go off into the microwave for like a minute minute and a half I don't want it to be hot because then I'll have to wait for it to cool down but I don't want it to be kind of solid and chunky either like this just check on it give it a good stir and when you're happy that it's at a good consistency you can add a fair amount of black food coloring to get a really nice black mirror glaze for a galaxy cake pass it back through the sister to remove any crumbs now we could do our galaxy playing black but I'm gonna add a little luster into my black as well as on top of it cuz I love this party never let anyone dull your sparkle I love this one because I love that we get to use all of that leftover glaze we don't really waste all right I'm not going to stare that all the way through look at that and now we glaze I'm going to let that one keep on dripping but while it's dripping now we get to get messy so I want to splat on my dry lust is on here basically just however I like I've got all different colors we don't want a rainbow but solar system can be colorful I've got different sized paintbrushes a little blue a little flick each one will give you a slightly different effect hmm a couple of bigger chunks and then very finally I've got some little tiny tiny silver edible stars that I'm going to add on so just wet the tip of your toothpick dip into your little edible stars these guys are super fragile and you don't need too many of these they give you a lot of bang for your buck once you're happy that it's stopped dripping you can just run a knife or your spatula all the way around the bottom and then transferring on to its final resting place using our lift and drop method so that is four different ways that you guys could use mirror glaze this was easy to make we didn't use candy thermometers to be perfectly honest I don't even have a scale and we kind of estimated some of the measurements this is not a hard recipe to replicate the biggest thing that you have to consider is the temperature of your glaze and the temperature of your cake as it goes on you guys can troubleshoot that you are literally the next pastry chefs of your neighborhood I hope you guys enjoyed seeing these poor awesome mirror glaze techniques a little bit out of the

hey everyone its Alisa and welcome back to my cupcake addiction today I'm going to show you the ultimate candy box cake this is cake that looks like a box of candy and the best part about it you can customize it to include your favorite candies or the favorite candies of the person you're making it for the things you'll need to make your candy cake I've got some blocks of chocolate try to make them nice relatively thin blocks because we want to be able to cut through them when they're on the sides of our cake I've got a ton of different candy so everything from little watermelon slices pineapple candies M&amp;M skittles gummy bears you name it I literally have all of my favorites I've got some pink Pocky some sprinkles and then I've got a bunch of lollipops so I've got one massive room buy one and then a bunch of assorted colored small ones I've got a single batch of my perfectly pipeable buttercream frosting I will leave a link to that recipe down below and I have three pre-made eighth inch by six inch by one inch high cake layers for today's video we're gonna be using a hairdryer this could be a first in cake decorating but I'm going to show you a really cool technique that uses funnily enough your hair styling tools I have a serrated edge knife and just a shallow tray because we're gonna make a lot of sprinkly mess here let's get started so first up we're going to separate our cake layers and stack them so just a little bit of buttercream frosting on the bottom buttercream is pretty sweet and there's a lot of sweet stuff going on in this cake so I'm really going to do a really thin layer of frosting in between each of my cake layers on goes our second layer and a little more frosting and our last layer now for this one I'm going to use these blocks of chocolate to essentially make the outsides of my box so I want to size it up roughly so that my chocolate block is about the same length as my cake maybe just a little bit longer to allow for some of that frosting so I'm just going to line up my block and then I'm going to make a nice cut with a serrated edge knife and just trim off some of my cake so that it's the perfect size for one even block across the front for my side panels is not going to be a block of chocolate that actually suits that size so I'm going to trim my chocolate down so that I'm sort of losing my top square so just size it up you want your chocolate to always be just a couple of millimeters bigger than the size of your real cake because we've got to allow for frosting all right now my cakes the right size I'm just add more frosting on top just a really thin coat this will be my crumb coat it's designed to catch any of those pesky little crumbs and not that it really matters I always do this out of habit but we're going to be putting panels all over the top of this anyway so it really doesn't matter if there's a couple of crumbs in our frosting if you guys are following me on facebook you would have seen me doing some of the portions of this cake live I've started to do Facebook live streams so I I showed anyone look tuned in when I went live last week or the week before how to make these panels and a couple of hints and tips and some troubleshooting over chocolate versus candy melts versus compound so you guys aren't following me on Facebook you can if you want to see what I do live see a little bit of behind the scenes stuff and ask me questions if you have any all right there's our first rough frosted cake Tekin gonna just sit off to the side you don't need to chill it or anything and we're gonna make some of our panels for your chocolate shard you're going to need your sprinkles your hairdryer and your block of chocolate now a block of chocolate is face down so mo bricks are facing the elf oil and it is sitting on a piece of Al foil in quite a shallow wire tray because we're going to make some serious mess I'm gonna put my hairdryer onto the medium heat setting and onto the low-speed and we're going to just heat the back of the chocolate until it just starts to get shiny or is a little bit tacky to touch we definitely don't want to overheat the chocolate here we don't wanna melt the whole block seconds 15 depending on the head of your house you'll notice that I'm doing this I'm actually moving the hairdryer all the way around on front favoring the middle for those edges are going to milk alright it's just started to get shiny and if I stick my finger into it you can see that I'm leaving little fingerprints so it's just starting to go tacky so now you want to take a ton of sprinkles you know sprinkle all over hence the tray make sure you don't discount those edges and also the end so that we can cover absolutely everything and then just gently press down we want to stick the sprinkles into the chocolate we don't want to crack the chocolate corners edges sides everywhere and then that is going into the fridge for about five or ten minutes we're going to let that melted portion completely set back up and we're going to have ourselves a sprinkle block so when you come back out of the fridge you should just be able to let all of your sprinkles slide up your chocolate to reveal the amazing gorgeous fully sprinkled panel behind so block have chopped it on one side and really cool sprinkled panel on the other so once all four of your little blocks are ready you want to take your cake and I'm just going to frost up this side and this side if you feel that buttercream that hasn't been in the fridge and that has crusted very important here that you're only frosting just before you want to stick these on otherwise you're going to end up trying to attach chocolate to dry buttercream and it's just never going to stick I don't want to put too much on here because I know my blocks are pretty close to size with my cake and I'm going to try and be neat about it especially around those bottom edges this doesn't have to be perfect because it's going to be covered by chocolate so I'm going to take one of my blocks and square side in or boring side in as I like to call it position it right in the middle so it's slightly overhanging on either side and press it nice and flush against that frosting on goes our next block press the two together now you want to just take your other blocks and they should have been sitting out at room temperature for a while so you don't want these cold fridge crack cold and try not to have that too much around the outside edges because they've kind of got this nice little sprinkled line around them and I'd like to keep it that way so I'm just going to line it up with my sides I want this to nestle in between these two guys so I'm going to make a mark just here which should give me the perfect I shot that way I know where I've got a cut now you can heat your knife Here I am going to cut very very gently in several long strokes so I've got a really sharp knife sometimes I also like to heat the knife up in some boiling water and then really just let it melt through but I couldn't be bothered boiling the kettle so I'm just going to do this instead perfect and then I'm going to frost up my end and stick in my piece before I stick that one in understand take a little bit of frosting and I because I want my two ends to match that are both kind of sprinkled and I've cut that one I'm just going to put a bit of frosting on the end and it can kind of match there we go disguised and onto the end of the cake it goes I'm going to do the same thing for the other side while your cake should be perfectly square that's sometimes a chance that maybe it's not quite as perfect as you'd like it so I like to make sure that I measure them each individually this one here I actually cut off like a whole piece and a little section and this one here I only need a whole piece obviously my cake is not completely square a little frosting to disguise my hand and then a little more frosting down this end of the cake on goes my shot we have a box made of chocolate and sprinkles and filled with cake so far I am loving what's going on here but there is definitely more now we're on to the good part we're going to frost the inside section now so I haven't done this beforehand because again this is sort of crusted buttercream and I want fresh buttercream so I'm gonna use my offset spatula you could also use the back of a spoon if you don't have an offset spatula but seriously these things one of the handiest tools they just help you kind of get into all of little sides and edges now that all of my blocks are in place I can frost nice and snuggly up against them this is also your chance to even out the top of the cake if you've got some sprinkles on your frosting don't worry about it you're not going to see them everything is going to be covered in delicious candy all right again it doesn't have to be neat so don't spend too much time on it you're gonna take your pocket out and we're gonna do two Pocky and I picked pink because I thought it was just a cute color they come in brown green all sorts of other colors I'm just going to roughly line them up and then as Pocky is designed to do I'm going to snap them these are basically my little dividers once that's done you want to divide with Pocky again your little box into eight so for across lay them all on first because it can be kind of hard to judge what halfway is until you've got them all lined up between the offcuts from the cake the offcuts from the sprinkle chocolate blocks and now the offcuts from the Pocky we are not going to have to wait and do we get to the party to get a pretty decent sampling of this cake I've actually decided cutting my Pocky is the easier technique especially for these guys if you use the scissors to cut them just helps you get that perfect size in your pocket cuts so easily we're ready to add our candy and we're actually nearly done I'm going to start with my pineapples and they're going to go in my little lower corner so I'm going to use the Pocky to just sort of slightly elevate the backs of my little pieces of candy and I'm going to try and position them nice and evenly in there so I can squeeze in as many as possible but they're all kind of like contained in their little section and then moving on to all of your other favorite candies one of the things that I love about this cake is it doesn't really matter what the occasion is who the birthday boy or girl is it's gender neutral it's age neutral this is like at anything-goes cake everyone has a favorite type of candy or a favorite chocolate so it doesn't matter if this is for your mom's 60th or for your little boy or girl's first birthday it's kind of everything cake keep in mind here I'm gonna try not to position my M&amp;Ms and my skittles too close to each other I'm gonna try not to push my gummy babies and my little jelly tots too close to each other because I want to make sure that I've got a good variety and there's not like two of the same candy nestled right next to each other there is something about precision candy placement that makes me feel very relaxed all of my candy is laid out and this looks like something you'd see in a high-end candy shop now of course this is gorgeous just as it is but we can always take it one step further can't we surely so I'm going to take my large Ollie pop I don't want to put it too close to this back wall because I don't want it to like fall backwards and drag the cake it's kind of a heavy lollipop so I'm going to just put it in like an inch or so down to about there and then I'm going to take some of my smaller lollipops just kind of add them in just to add some varying levels of height and some extra pops of color because this cake needs more color and we're done this for me is pretty much the ultimate candy cake if one of my friends picked out my favorite candies for me it would be the ultimate in cake personalization who's not gonna love a cake with this much candy on top if you're not already subscribed to the channel make sure you do for two new videos every week and as always done thanks very

R we literally dr. dotting a cake absolutely oh you're star dotting the cake I am I thought you were gonna do like a long drag looking really cool I love the purple too okay Don yay oh my god guys check that out this looks like this looks I don't think it get any more fun than all those sprinkles but this is about the most fun cake I've seen today breaking Hut safety hat success Becky Huck 11 buttermilk heaps of recipes call for it I never ever have it sometimes I freeze it sometimes I just don't have it sometimes I forget to buy it what about you I'm pretty much pretty much the same buttermilk is the bane of my existence but I read and I do this all the time as she picks up the big sharp knife I read that a little citrus in your regular milk will turn into buttermilk because I am so bad with actually remembering to get buttermilk I use this all the time you can use lemon you can use lime I just start to say everyone pretty much has letters in their fridge pretty much a bit of a squeeze and ice normally do a wedge I have also tried this with the supermarket lime juice in the supermarket lemon juice so that definitely works this one has lime in it if you're going to use citrus you need to let it sit you can see that it's already starting to curdle you'll see it curdled let it sit for like five minutes and you've got buttermilk your other alternative a little vinegar I prefer the citrus vinegar in my milk No thank you a couple of drops of vinegar and that should curdle almost immediately okay so I'd like something new and I use by the ton of buttermilk in my recipes because it makes them super moist and you'll often find buttermilk and recipes that have bicarb soda because it's the ingredient that kind of reacts with the bicarb and gives you that perfect amount of rise as well as extra moistness moistness moisture twistmas it works baking hack success success breaking hack number 12 we did that really well this idea was actually shown to me by a friend of mine named Mallory you know when you want to make fondant decorations for on top of a cupcake but you've got to wait for your little fondant disks to set for I mean between 12 and 24 hours so they don't flop over arias or thin Oreo suggests Oreos are raised the ends that I like the way you think so I've got a little frosting I've got my Oreo fins to make sure they're nice and evenly placed I'm gonna have to eat any that break and I've also got some sprinkles but you guys can kind of go crazy on the design here I'm gonna pop a couple of two's cuz it's Jacob's second birthday tomorrow oh my god it's so cute you could also use that really cool little star dotting technique that you showed us earlier all right then take a few sprinkles if you like or some sanding sugar or pearls decorate up your little twos and you can frost up your cupcake as normal and on goes a little topper Nick do you want to do me the honors and fast I'm a cupcake the master very nice sprinkle off any excess sprinkle and on goes our little topper so we've added a little bit of height and personalize the cupcakes in like five seconds flat and best of all we've added Oreos there's always time for use baking her success success safety hack number 13 unlucky for some but yummy for us I love our job so you know those times when you feel like a cupcake could be elevated by like a really pretty filigree laced cupcake wrapper I make those every week all right we'll you might not but sometimes I think you can take the plainest cupcake and really up the ante on it with a lace cupcake case but they're kind of expensive and that's if you happen to have them laying around or fancy a trip to the shops behold the doily also known as the Nano doily also known as the old lady pleat cover also known as something really versatile that I always have on hand don't judge me so you want to take a pair of scissors and your doily and you can do small doilies for mini cupcakes or large doilies for big cupcakes can you guess where I'm going with this Nick oh we're gonna do a rough my arms we are gonna do a wrap around if you got some tape handy I do it my glamorous assistant Nick ladies and gentlemen all right this is actually my kind of sized cupcake case can you guys imagine I'm just gonna have the one once you've got that cut you just want to size it so I like to actually wrap it around the outside of the cupcake and you'll notice I left a little bit of space on the bottom there so you can wrap it around and it's a little bit more flexible too which kind of allows it to sort of mold to your cupcake a bit better so cute isn't it gorgeous then we size it up can you give me a little cut there hon perfect two-man job there you have a repurposed Nana doily we're just taking it off too much we have we have it's not even frosted yet and it's pretty darn adorable this guy lace cupcake case DIY on to two minutes yes it was a two-man job but I think that might have seen me rather than the project it's so much fun to make so easy and it looks super cute and it cost like I need a couple of cents Celina and work turn 13 smooth exactly hack complete okay Lee so I have a bit of a problem I have eggshells in my eggs and I really need to get them out now there are a couple ways you can do this but they all end up in disasters and it takes ages so I'm going to show you an easy way to do this now I watch this on TV once and the way that the guy on TV described it was that eggshells are attracted to each shells and it's true okay so we're going to use the eggshell and we're going to scoop the eggshell out it's in here trust me it's in view and they look happier to be back together honestly that's what the attraction is complete thanks you're free I've also heard that wetting your finger with water works you on track yeah oh good all right wet your finger and see if that helps get the eggshell up now it's about the size no does not work no no I mean what it is not worth it okay yeah the eggshell attractions of eggshell that serious complete do you guys have ever seen squish cook on my youtube channel you will know that when he cracks an egg he crushes it so pulling out eggshell is something that I'm very familiar with very familiar with and now we have a new technique absolutely now I want to try something that I saw and that I'm sure all of you guys have seen does head dragging out the egg yolk with the bottle actually work as easily as it does everywhere else I've heard this but I've never tried it this is not part of the tack this is like a bonus hack so it's pretty small I don't know if it's too small oh yeah let's give you good that's the point if it doesn't work with any bump I don't have to buy a specialty bottle squeeze in press it likes it totally worked it's in there all right well I mean you don't get like 75 billion views on YouTube pulling an air gap and nothing but I'm impressed because I would have thought that was too small and I didn't think of a breakfast car I'm impressed egg hack done okay guys so we're all guilty of having some less than best before baking products so with this one we're going to be testing out if out baking powder is active or not so we want to make sure that it's going to help our cakes right now it's a really really easy thing to do pour some water into a bowl and we're going to put a little bit of our baking powder in there now this should fees we are seeing some physical yeah you're good to go so we can bake a cake now I never knew this one yeah so cool I mean I just thought baking powder even though it has it used by just technically lasted forever so this would explain why some of my like flakes didn't rise as much as they should with my less than best before baking yeah so you guys if you're about to leave a comment in the comment section would be like at least my cake didn't rise this is what you need to test you should test all of your spices the gelatin the spice the cinnamon it's probably all out of date I mean best if it still works hahaha my mother-in-law went through my cupboards and cleaned out everything out of date and I was like not the spices the spices are still good out of date and nothing left so I think this is a baking hat success and I'm wrapped because I just learned something new nice foot baking hat 16 I did not say that okay guys so one of the most important things when you're measuring your ingredients for your cakes is being super accurate it's so important when you're baking so I'm going to show you guys a super easy way to make sure you've got the perfect cup measurements so we're going to grab our cup of flour I'll be your glamorous Bowl assistant I'm the ball handler today now you can do this with our measuring spoons or measuring cups now I just got a handy dandy knife with a straight edge and we're just going to level it off and guys this makes all the difference I guess the key is to be sure that you're not pushing down on it you're just going straight across because you don't wanna compact it you just want to that is a really neat way to get the perfect half a cup very nice alright you guys have baking Hight's video number one now you have baking hacks video number two we're going to link to each of them down below we're also going to link to everything that Nick does cuz you're definitely going to have to check him out we hope that we found some really fun ways to bring sweet treats into your house with less stress less mess and more savings yes you 
I go first I'm gonna do a soldier and I'm gonna do are you copying me I'm Elise drone and welcome back to a very festive my cupcake addiction where today we're taking edible gifting to the next level we're making edible gift boxes that you can fill with edible gifts before we get started I've had loads of you guys asking where my videos are and why I'm not uploading which is weird because I've still put out a hundred videos this year so if you're not seeing my videos you can go to the little bell icon next to the subscribe button you need to be subscribed to the channel and then it will come up with the option to get notifications when I post take that option you'll get an email every time I post a video and you'll never miss a single one let's get into it you'll need some graham crackers or you can bake your own cookies some candy melts I've got red and white or you can use white chocolate and color it using candy colors a good an exacto knife some snaps your bags a random assortment of sprinkles a little bit of candy tape or you can use fruit roll-ups and different candies to fill our boxes with well I might be dressed completely for Christmas these are also an awesome idea for year-round gifting think Valentine's Day a special gift for someone that you love for their birthday change up the colors and these can suit any occasion and you use three of my sheets of graham cracker for each of my little boxes and because I know graham crackers aren't available everywhere like Australia I'm also gonna leave a template down below if you want to bake your own sugar cookies I'll link to my sugar cookie recipe and you can basically make the exact same shapes but there's baking involved the graham crackers make it a no bake option first of all I'm gonna cut my shapes so these guys already perforated but I'm using a serrated edge knife to soar through the graham cracker or the biscuit so it doesn't crack gently does it for even little pieces and then this guy here I'm gonna cut my graham in half but I'm gonna take just a little bit off there's no exact measurement here it's like a quarter of an inch just so that my base fits inside the four walls for my top I'm gonna cut a section that's about a quarter of an inch larger because I've shaved the quarter of an inch off the base and then I'm also just gonna make up a little extra piece this will be easy to stick together but you just need to kind of measure it out so you've got another quarter of an inch on the other side so it's still a square you're making like a little edible puzzle this is the size that I'm gonna do mine you guys feel free to make yours as bigger as small as you like you could use whole grams rather than these little pieces just keep in mind that the very very top should be the largest square and the very bottom should be a smaller square so that everything fits together flush once it's all dipped I'm gonna make today's box green but like I said mix up the colors if you want to use candy melts you absolutely can but I prefer the taste of white chocolate so often I'll use a compound white chocolate and just color it with a little bit of oil-based or powder based coloring sometimes called candy colors make sure you don't use a liquid food coloring in chocolate or it'll cause it to seize all right let's dip so the easiest way to tip out grams is with a knife and fork and you just drop your gram into the chocolate push him down smother that gram with lots and lots of your chocolate yeah and then we'll tap it off so I'm gonna scrape the fork along the bottom to get any excess off and then I'm gonna use my knife because we should always eat with a knife and fork just to slide it down on score parchment for this little guy that's kind of our jigsaw piece I want to just get a tiny bit of my chocolate first and kind of glue the pieces of our puzzle together before we dip so let that set and then our four little sides when you're dipping it's easiest if you put it in upside down and then kind of flip it before tapping it off it just gives you a smoother finish and then finally our top piece make sure this is really well set to pop it in the fridge for a few minutes if you have to and then into that chocolate dip and let them set they don't need to be completely set here you want them to be a little bit soft so either room-temperature but I wouldn't chill them and then you just want to bring your exacto and you're just gonna kind of trim down the sides you don't want to expose graham cracker hero cookie here you really just want to neaten up those edges all of these little off cuts and shards you can remelt and use for decorating but you want to put those ones off into the fridge so they get really really nice and chilled before we join them all together these guys are chilled I've got a little bit more of my green chocolate in a snap seal bag so I'm gonna snip off a pretty generous tip cuz I don't want to go too fine here I want a fair bit of chocolate joining these together and then we assemble so put your lid off to the side and start with the base I like to put the chocolate all around the outside of the base and then add all of my pieces because that way I've got a little bit of room to kind of move them around to make sure they're all perfect if you've got any little gaps or any little pieces where it's not gonna meet up absolutely perfectly just filled them in with a little bit more of that chocolate and smooth them off I find building this on one piece of parchment and then picking the whole thing up and moving it to a fresh piece to be the perfect way that just gives it a fresh piece of parchment so that it doesn't have any kind of overlap from any of that stuff that's come off the sides and then voila your lid goes straight on top our Christmas box so now we're the good bit it's time to stop and decorate for my decorations I'm just using a fruit strap or you can use a candy strap and mine's red and orange I only really want the red side so I'm just gonna slice it down the middle and eat what's left I wish you had some help in the kitchen you're here you can help I don't know if this is your kind of job for starters I need someone to eat all the orange bit of this fruit mmm well I can do it I'm gonna do a red one with this one it's hot take all my ingredients what are you doing with my candy strap oh you want to take your boxes and fill them with whatever you like gifts candy more candy I go first I'm gonna do a soldier are you copying me what I'm gonna do Santa I'm gonna do well then I'm gonna do a minty what about a candy cane ooh I like spicy foods now I do not like spicy food my pellet is evolving look now it can't be too full or else you can't put your lid on huh I think you crushed it huh once it's filled with big candy I'm gonna use little eye candy to fill in the gaps see like M&amp;Ms tada lids on now I'm gonna show you my super special ribbon tying trick that I use every Christmas take a piece of your fruit and lay it out like this it's a foot of fruit so if you cup your box and put it on the fruit - the fruits right in the middle and then we're gonna fold the fruit over and then we'll cut it you do it your way that's what being in the kitchen is all about you get creative squish I'm gonna use a little bit of the melted candy just to fix my ribbon and you have can decorate these however you like like holly is doing a little perfectionist at work and then a really simple little bow you can just take like a long piece of your fruit by the foot and loop it over itself twice so once you've got like a little almost like a little one of those breast-cancer ribbons just push it together and then take a smaller piece and we're just gonna glue that over it saves you having to tie it like a little shoelace cut beautiful what are you gonna do with those because this fruits so sticky you can actually just pinch it at the back I made you a bow that's mine and then we'll snip this little guy I'm gonna add an M&amp;M for a handle here's a little bit of melted chocolate perfecto high-five this guy here we decorated using just a little bit of candy melt with a toothpick to make a wreath a little sanding sugar on top and then some little candy coated chocolate chips and we made it a tiny little card say it says oli shall get no presents for Christmas this year unless he does the dishes well that could change very quickly all right Ellie which one are we gonna give to Jacob which one are we gonna give to daddy and which one are we gonna have you're taking that one what which one should we give to Jacob mmm this one and then which one should I give to daddy the one with the love who's gonna get this

 cookie book cookie cookie [Music] it's no secret that I've been working on my book sweet celebrations for what feels like forever but now that it's done I thought the perfect way to commemorate would be with some book cookies I'm gonna call them bookies that just makes sense I'm not just going to be cooking my book I'm going to be cooking some of my favorite youtuber books today let's save your favorite youtuber made the grade we're going to make book cookies and then inside I'm going to create little individual surprises that represents the person that wrote the book let's get started the things you're going to need to make your book cookies of course that you're going to need cookie dough some white fondant a little plain flour you'll need a knife I like an exacto or a stanley knife here scissors snaps your bags some powdered sugar a little honey a paintbrush some candy melts in white a rolling pin and nail file I'll show you how we're going to use that and whatever candy you want to fill your bookies with I've also got a couple of templates for you guys so I've got the template that you'll need for your cover and spine and pages you'll need to print that out on regular paper and cut around it and then I've also made the template of my book and my top youtuber books which I printed on edible paper so first we need to roll out our cookie dough my cookie dough has been chilling out in the fridge I always like to keep it nice and cool before rolling sprinkle down a very generous amount of flour and when I say generous I mean generous I always like to stock my dough by just pressing it a little bit and then a little more flour on my rolling pin so nothing sticks we'll roll it out it's not quite as thin as I want it yet but here I'm going to slide it onto a piece of parchment it's gonna make my life a lot easier so I'm going to slide my parchment right underneath the cookie dough and then I'm just going to roll out basically about the same size as my piece of parchment when you're making something like pinata cookies especially with a book that's got square edges and pages that really need to meet up for precisely it's best not to move the cookies around at all if you can possibly avoid it until they're baked we want them to stay as true to template size as possible I'm going to leave the recipe link for this cookie dough in the description box below but of course you know it's also available in my new book once you're happy that you've got your cookie dough covering your parchment I'm just going to trim off any of the edges to make chef's cookies for me and then I'll grab a baking tray and we're just going to throw the whole thing on to a baking tray gonna do this quickly perfect now I would recommend chilling that sheet in the fridge for 15 minutes before we try to cut it just gonna make your life a lot easier our templates are cut our sheet is chilled so now you can start tracing around make sure that your book cookie covers are in your nicest cleanest area of your cookie dough I am going to say this is a lot easier than making an actual book I'm going to use my exacto to come right around the outside edges keep them straight keep them even preheated oven and cold cookie dough is always the best for making sure that your cookies don't stretch and kind of go out of shape when they're cooked you can remove your template and then you can just peel away the excess pieces of cookie dough and if it's still nice and short they should just lift up pretty nicely and easily depending on how much time oven space and patience you've got you can actually make those one at a time I'm going to cut another one out while this one bakes they only take 7 to 10 minutes to cook and you'll know they're done when they just start to color around the edges they'll go like a golden e brown color now they're ready for us to start getting ready to decorate you'll notice that I mean they're pretty straight they're pretty good but in the baking process we've got just a few little areas where they're not completely perfectly straight this is where our nail file comes in so make sure it's a new and clean not a used nail file but this is the best way to get super precise edges on your cookies without cracking them without breaking them have a look at that we've got a little bit of an edge I'll take a pedicure and a shellac Thanks all right I'll take the flick massage smooth crisp straight perfection the beauty salon is closed and you can put the nail files away because now we have all of our little pieces of cookie ready to create our book so you're going to have three pages and I've labeled them all on the template for you you'll be your spine and your covers away we're going to cover our three pages in fondant and then I'm going to make little book like marks on them so they look like pages so I'm just going to put out a little bit of my powdered sugar all right a lot of my powdered sugar and then we'll roll out our fondant super thin if you find your fondant at all sticking to your rolling pin you can pop a little bit of that powdered sugar on top I've also got a great recipe for homemade marshmallow fondant this would be the perfect recipe to use if you wanted your books to have that little bit of marshmallowy goodness really thin get it thin then get it thinner look at that in fondant perfection all right so you're going to cover each of your pieces of book cookie or Pocky in fondant I'm going to set aside my covers in my spine and I'm gonna work on the pages so for my pages I'm gonna take a little bit of that sweet sweet honey and you could also use something like a lemon curd here if you want a little bit of different flavor I wouldn't use anything dark like Nutella because you don't want to show through your white fondant and I'm going to cover all three of my pages in white fondant once I'm happy that I've got like a rough coating of fondant on there I'm just going to use the sides of one of my spatulas or you could use the knife and I'm just going to make messy little page indents all the way through my book has a lot of pages 240 in fact old color photos delicious ideas creative recipes whole chapter on Halloween Halloween's coming by one barmbrack all right not looking like much so take your exacto grab your first pages and then I'm going to use the exacto to trim right along the edge line of that cookie we have our first P you want to complete that with the rest of your pages your other pieces of fondant can just sit and pop them under just a piece of parchment or something so they don't dry out too much I'm using white candy melts instead of white chocolate here because they're true why so they're going to go nicely with my fondant and not kind of had that yellowish tinge I've got them in a snap seal bag and I'm just going to snip off a generous tip to do a makeshift piping bag now choose your flattest cookie to be your front cover and set that one aside this one is my perfect cookie here will be my front cover I'm going to start with the spine and I'm actually gonna build each bookie on its own little piece of parchment just so they don't know to stick to the table at any point keep any of its white candy melt goes awry so I'm going to put a little bit of the white candy melt all the way along the edge like a chocolaty glue and you'll see that I've left a bit of a gap and it's on the inside edge of that spine and then join together now with your pages start with the two shorter sides but just position everything first you want your pages to be just slightly in from the edge of the book II because if you look at an actual book the pages are not right up against the edges they're kind of in a little bit gives us room for the cover in the spine when you're happy with positioning we can stick them all in place one thing that I don't want is this little bit of cookie poking through so I'm just going to use a little candy melt I'm gonna fill it in or kind of brush it over and then we'll add some little lines to make it match in with our pages we can let our book cookies set at this point and then we're going to fill and top and cover while your books are setting I told you we're going to be stuffing these with super cute things the kind of team with the theme of the book so I've got some M&amp;Ms some Reese's minis and a little bit of pink fondant to make your little teeny tiny cupcakes you're going to need to take one Reese's mini I spread my with a little bit of honey and then wrote a long sausage with my pink fondant I coiled this sausage around so that it kind of did three tones and left a little peak on top and then added a tiny bit more honey onto this side of one red mini M&amp;M stuck it on top like a cherry we made mini cupcakes these are adorable sure I get to sample one it's my logo mmm back to work so with my book cookie now set I've got all of my sidewalls ready and my front cover ready to attach but first I have to stuff it with candy so I'm gonna take yellow M&amp;Ms I was looking at the cover of my book and really the bright colors apart from the blue a yellow and pink so I thought I've got the pink on the cupcake do the yellow in the M&amp;Ms just yellow I know it goes against everything in my soul not to make these rainbow I'm putting the M&amp;Ms in because they're gonna hold all the little cupcakes in place and stop them from kind of banging around inside the book on your book cookies nice and full with candy and then I'm gonna lay down and kind of squish in all of my little mini cupcakes okay adorable I might have made a few too many a little mini cupcakes but I'm sure they're not going to go to waste here I'm in love always what's going on here my logo immortalized in candy and then my book immortalized in cookies this is like candy ception sort of in a word so I've got my little cutout pieces of fondant and again I'm going to apply honey onto the side of the spine and also onto the cover of the book and then I'll line them up to make sure they match up nicely now so it gets kind of fun so I mentioned I was using edible images these are images printed out on sheets of icing paper not everyone's going to have an edible image machine at home like I do but I have left you templates and you can send those to a ton of places either online or your local cake decorating shop and a lot of the time they'll print them out for you it's worth doing because then they look exactly like the little books to attach your edible images all you need to do is peel them off their backing paper and if they give you any resistance you can slide a knife for an exactor underneath the sides or if they're still not coming loose really easily put them in the freezer for like 15-20 minutes that will actually believe it or not help to loosen them from the backing paper we have a cover people we have a curve and it looks surprisingly like me these ones aren't super fragile they're easy enough to handle but you don't want to over handle them so I'm going to cut mine out once you've got your pieces cut out I'm going to use a little just plain water don't use honey or anything here and a little if you put too much water on it's actually going to soak through your edible image so I'm really just dipping the brush once and making sure that brushes all the way over both my spine and my cover and then on goes first a little spine and then the cover this could actually be even more exciting than my actual cover reveal once your little cookies are in place I like to just press them and just sort of wrap them around so you get that really nice like wrapped book kind of flush fit we have a cover we have a book we have delicious cupcake addiction logos going inside the book and now we're ready to join it all together so I have a little bit more of my white candy milk in the snap seal bag and I'm just basically going to glue this whole thing together the last thing to do is to knead not our scene and our book cookie is done we know that it's full of delicious candy I mean I let that set before I go picking it up and shaking it around but anybody that gets that is going to be super excited let's see what we're going to do without other youtuber books for Lilly Singh's book how to be a boss it's not released yet but I know it's going to be amazing I decided to fill it with red M&amp;Ms and of course Lilly's signature red lipstick because we know she loves red lipstick Tyler Oakley's book binge made perfect sense to fill with candy I mean the cover says it all candy wrappers and then candy inside and of course for his own offense he knows nerdy nummies I took little mini chocolate chip cookies and use some black candy melt a tiny bit of pink fondant to decorate them to look like her little smart cookie logo so when I say I'm gonna be reading quietly I'm pretty sure you guys know what I'm actually gonna be doing I hope you guys

hey guys it's a lease and welcome back to my cupcake addiction if you follow the channel you'll know that I'm a massive fan of no baked desserts anything that saves us a bit of time in the kitchen and still looks and tastes amazing is right up my alley today I'm going to show you guys how to make a no-bake Snickers pie you might have seen motoblur own tart you might have seen my new big strawberry cheesecake this is yet another fantastic idea that you can not bake and surprise your guests with when they come over for dinner and realize what if their favorite candy bars has been turned into an amazing dessert the things you're going to need to make your Snickers pie I've got some roasted but unsalted peanuts some milk chocolate I've got some white cookies you can use any type of white cookie you like from shortbread through to graham cracker these guys are milk coffee really doesn't matter I've got a lot of Snickers bars I've also got some butter and I'm cheating today with a can of caramel if you want to make your own caramel you are more than welcome to and I have a great beautiful thick caramel recipe that I'll leave a link to down below as part of my giant Rolo recipe I'm going to use a can today because it saves a ton of time it's really easy and it sticks to the no baking part of this particular tart I've also got a little bit of whipping cream and I'm going to leave all of your dimensions and quantities on the my cupcake addiction comm website I'll link to that post down below you're going to need a removable base tart pan so mine's a 10-inch round removable based tart pan with quite a low sidewall you guys can mix up the size but you may need to adjust the recipe slightly if you're going with a different size or shape tart pan let's get started so you want to crush your cookies i crush mine in a food processor because you want them to be really really nice and fine kind of like sand and I've also melted my butter just in the microwave take your butter now and you're going to pour it over the crushed cookies and stir it through depending on the type of cookies that you use some will actually absorb the butter a little bit faster than others so you may need to just slightly adjust that butter measurement you're looking for like wet sand the type that you'd make a decent sound castle out of that holds together when you squeeze it in your hands and then you can just pour the whole lot into your tart pan flatten it down pressing out to the edges and as you press out to the edges you want to make sure that you're pushing so that it comes right up nice and firm and over and above your sidewall I like to take like a cup or a small jar and just press down you'll actually notice it forces it into the corners a little bit more so you don't get super super thick corners and just helps those sides to push up but it also helps to compact it really nicely whenever you're making a no-bake base you want it to be super tightly compacted because that's essentially kind of what holds it together when you go to serve your pie I'm just going to take a sharp knife now and I'm going to trim the edges off nice and flat with the top and coming outside or away from the tart pan you can pick up any of those edges you can add them back into the vase if you like we don't want to waste any cookie here this just helps to give us a really nice neat thick edge I'm happy with that that's going to go off into the fridge for a few minutes while we work on the next part of our Snickers pie caramel now this can sometimes be called dulce de leche the one problem that I find with these cans of caramel is when they come out they're kind of lumpy so I like to use the electric mixer or you could use a hand whisk just to make sure that they're really really nice and beaten so they go super smooth perfect smooth and flowing caramel now I'm gonna take my peanuts put them all in and stir them through this is like the caramely nutty layer of a Snickers bar pull your base out of the fridge and then you're just gonna spoon over your caramel mixture spread it out so it's nice and even as I get close to the sidewalls while I'm smoothing I'm trying to just sort of push into the sidewalls but not drag any of that peanut caramel back purely because I don't want to pull any of that cookie away it's not completely set yet so it needs a little bit more time to be completely in its place and I don't want to ruin those beautiful sidewalls getting this super smooth is almost impossible because it's full of peanuts but I'm just using a spatula to smooth it out as best as I can and get it as smooth as I can and then you can pop it back off into the fridge all right you can take your cream and chocolate now and I'm going to pour the cream straight over the chocolate you essentially make just a thin layer of ganache so you want to put that into the microwave for 30 second intervals stirring really well in between and that's going to make them milk chocolate lay out that goes on top of our peanut caramel layer now you get to chop up your Snickers bar and this is where you get to steal chunks of Snickers bar as you go I've put five Snickers in the recipe but guys go crazy here if you want to combine Snickers and Twix if you want bigger chunks or smaller chunks this is your no big tart you can have more or you can have less that's the beauty of making it yourself I've kind of like cut my Snickers into cubes and then I'm just going to go across ways because I want these to be pretty messily cut so you can either be really really nice and smooth you can see that that consistency it's quite a thin ganache and it's beautiful and lump free so I'm going to grab my tart out of the fridge now so you just want to pour your ganache evenly you really want to cover all of that caramel on top and let it pull out to the sides of our tart the ganache is actually going to set once this is refrigerated which is going to help hold everything together now if you're using a slightly different size or shaped tart pan that ganache is kind of where you can equalize it a bit if it's too long you can microwave a little bit more chocolate and cream to bring the size of the sides up a little bit if it's too high you can not put in all of the ganache you want it almost level but just slightly below level feel free to go crazy on the decorations you can pipe rosettes you can do whatever you like but I'm gonna pile I am gonna pile Snickers all over this thing I want it to be a little bit more heavy on the Snickers in the center but I also want to make sure that there's no part that doesn't have Snickers you can see there as I pop in all that Snickers that ganache is already starting to raise itself up so make sure that you're keeping an eye on it and stop adding Snickers before the ganache goes over the sides of the top my last little few sprinklings can just fill in some of those gaps and that's it how easy was a Snickers pie to make all right it's not it you can't eat it just yet it needs to be in the refrigerator for about three hours before you serve it which is going to help the caramel snap but it's also going to let that ganache set and the base set beautifully so when we cut it and serve it it's really nice and neat and easy to serve after you've patiently waited for your three hours you want to remove the tart by just pressing gently on the face and lifting it out I actually prefer to serve my no bags still on those metal bases underneath and just transfer that whole thing onto a cake tray or a serving plate use a nice hot sharp knife for best results when cutting and as you slice through you'll see your layers of cookie your beautiful peanut caramel that delicious ganache and of course Snickers on top I hope you guys have enjoyed today's know baked Snickers tart recipe not only is it super simple I'm talking like 15 minutes simple to whip up there is nobody

much for watching you you 
do I have anything on my face I do [Music] diapers nappies but napkins whatever you want to call them these suckers have been part of my every single day for the last five years Jacob is nearly out of them but not quite my best friend is having a baby and I thought I want to make us something sweet but I don't want to stick to the pacifiers and the onesies and all of those sweet gorgeous fun things that come with having a baby I'm gonna make a retreat that shows of what she's really in for with kind of a sweet spin we're gonna make poopy diaper cookies with different types of poop because you never know what you're going to expect with a newborn to make your disgustingly delicious cookies you're going to a coarse neat cookie dough and I leave a link to my recipe down below you can also pick it up in sweet celebrations cookbook if you haven't already ordered a copy you'll need a little extra flour for rolling out a rolling pin some snap steel bags a pair of scissors and an exacto knife parchment paper and nail file for kneading up those edges some powdered sugar white fondant paintbrushes and luster dust in silver some black candy coloring a nice large round cookie cutter a little honey some white candy melts your choice of filling I went with Nutella and peanut butter but I think there's a few options here I also wanted to make this a little bit easier for you I mean I know not everybody has these at home and they're kind of an awkward shape so me too a die for template I'll leave a link to that down below as well first let's roll out our dough get these poopy diapers moving first up you want to sprinkle down a generous amount of flour then you're going to roll out your cookie dough don't go too thick here because you're going to have three cookies stacked on top of each other you want to cut three circles and don't worry if they're not perfect circles and then stack them on top of each other you can cut away the very top section which is why it doesn't matter if those circles weren't complete when you started and then using that same circle cutter cut out just a very small leg hole on each side doing this in a stack makes or that all of your cookies are exactly the same size and dimension and you don't have to guess as much separate the cookies out lay them on a tray lined with some parchment and then you want to flip one of the cookies in each set of three one's going to be the backside of the diaper and one's going to be the front side further Center cookie I'm going to use a smaller circle cutter just to cut small circles and basically hollow out the inside of it I use a circle cutter here because a knife tends to drag and it'll pull your cookie out of shape place those off into a moderate oven for between seven and ten minutes until they just start to go golden brown around the edges coming back from the oven you want to let your cookies completely cool I'm going to take a little bit of my white candy melt hop it into a snap seal bag and snip off a very small fine tip by flipping the cookies you avoid having this kind of ugly side on the outside of your diapers and they turn around to make a really nice neat set something like this only we know what's going inside I'm gonna take just a nice thin line of my candy melt now and now you get to choose your filling yes you could do lovely little pink sprinkles if you wanted a gender-reveal maybe a little blue you get a little surprise inside we're gonna put a big surprise inside ours I have Nutella and I also have some crunchy peanut butter I kind of thought if you're a newborn phase you could also make like a white chocolate ganache color it kind of a must any color I've got a good variety of textures colors and stages of infancy for your peanut butter because it's crunchy you need quite a generous tip cut off Nutella you can go slightly smaller and we're gonna fill our diapers this is the wrong it's right Oh Jacob delicious level it off we don't want to have any kind of an explosion or a sidewall leakage for those darker days we've got Nutella I feel like you could also do Nutella with kind of a peanut buttery swirl in some days who knows what's gonna go in there a little bit more of my candy melt try and stick relatively close to your inside edges here so that it doesn't come out too much over the outside of your nappy and sandwich in your delicious diaper feelings oh this is so disgusting but they smell amazing unlike the one that I was faced with this morning our diaper cookies are made and they are dirty filthy little diapers but they're not finished yet these are very simple to decorate all you're gonna need is a little bit of fondant and some pins obviously we can't use real pins here but I'm gonna take a tiny bit of black food coloring and just stir it through my white candy melts make this like a really light gray color because that's just gonna help our luster dust when we give them the silver shimmery effect you don't need very much of this and you do want to cut a very very very small fine tip these little pins are super small so to make your little pins kind of just make like a dot at one end and a dot at the other and then join them together with two long streaks give your parchment a couple of nice little taps which will just help to smooth things off set those at room temperature so they don't curl and then you can pop them in the fridge just to make them really nice and firm two of mine didn't make the grade so I've got my four best I'm just gonna brush them with a little bit of silver shimmer or luster cookies are made oops inside safety pins are ready and now it's time to cover our diapers if you're a mum you will have done this a million times if you're not watch and learn this is what you've got ahead of you roll out some fondant really nice and thin sprinkle down a little powdered sugar first so it doesn't stick to the bench and we want this really nice and thin you can freehand cut your diaper if you like if you're experienced like me you'll know they're all about this shape but if you have not yet done the diaper duty we also made you a template so you can cut around the template and use that for a perfect diaper and now we cut all the way around our template so lifting this guy off you should have your template and a nice little cutout diaper looking pattern I guess we're basically seamstresses what's inside what yeah what do you think it could be nothing does it sound like anything does it smell like anything I'll give you some clues you've definitely seen it before you've definitely done it before and I have to see it still pretty much every day any guesses look book cookies what do you call it a diaper or a nappy yeah nappy what do you call it a diaper and a pee all right removing that from your head as stylish as it is now we have a job to do these are diaper cookies and I need to put an actual nappy on them so we need to brush them with some honey you want to help yeah me too brush your sugar cookies all over the front and the back and a little bit between the legs with some of that honey can you take off the plastic and take off the template I got dirty diaper on my hands why are you never this helpful when I have actual nappies to change where are you when Jacobs got a dirty diaper on goes there die the diaper cookie and then you're gonna take your diaper and wrap it around bringing the little tapered edges to the front and using a little bit more honey to stick them down all right normally I don't love diaper duty but in this case I'm making an exception this is so cute you could leave it like that but I'm gonna add little safety pins because I feel like even though modern-day diapers mainly have little tabs it is a cuter with pins I chilled my pins in the fridge for a little bit simply so that I can hold them for longer because they're very thin and you'll melt them much quicker than you think then I like to do just a little bit of white so it looks like they've actually gone through the fabric diaper duty complete only you and I know our little hidden surprise inside if you love this idea but you hate the thought of making your diapers dirty feel free to use it as a fun pinata cookie a gender-reveal or pretty much whatever you like but I think this is a really cute way to give parents a taste of what they're actually in for put at least with kind of a sweet twist I hope you guys have enjoyed today's video if you're not already subscribe to the channel make sure you do for two new videos every week and as always thanks very much for watching [Music] what's inside you're lucky ready do you think in there you feel yuck yeah [Music] you [Music] 
hey guys it's Elise and welcome back to my cupcake addiction you guys might have seen the myriad of soda bottle treats that have been getting around from gummy soda bottles through to soda bottle cakes I wanted to do my own take because I love a good trend so I'm going to show you guys how to make any soda bottle pinata super simple all you're gonna need for this is chocolate or a colored candy melt if you'd prefer to do a different type of soda and candy I'm doing Cola so of course it makes sense that I would have tiny Cola bottle candies for pick your favorites whatever you want to stuff your soda bottle pinata with you're also going to need a skillet a really sharp knife try and get a serrated one and a pair of scissors let's get started this is one of the simplest no big things you can possibly make it's actually my dad's birthday today so I'm making this for him start by peeling away your label and you want to make sure that you're actually peeling it away rather than cutting it because your chocolate bottle is going to come out just a fraction larger than this bottle so you kind of need that overlap space now I've emptied out all of my Cola and then I'm going to carefully so that I keep it intact just lift away my little ring and set my ring on my lid to the side and then we're going to cut through the center you're going to have your tag back over the center so keep your little tag or wrapper intact as well as your top two pieces and I found the serrated edge knife the easiest to get through without asian making any creases or crinkles in the bottle once you through a portion of the way you can use your scissors just to finish it off don't worry if these are particularly even but do try to remove any of these little jagged bits you don't want those scratching up the outside of your chocolate bottle so I'm just gonna trim it off so it's relatively smooth be really careful here cuz bottle plastic is kind of hard so make sure you're getting rid of all of it so none of it risks getting into any of the edible component of your pinata you need to make sure that your bottle is completely clean and dry so give it a really good wipe out your counter any liquid in there it's gonna cause your chocolate to seize again be careful here this little bit of edged plastic is pretty hard and it is a possibility if you're not careful you may just cut kinda like a paper cut in your hand I'm gonna put the lid of my bottle back on so it's got something to catch the chocolate and then we're gonna fill I'll start with this guy so pouring more chocolate than you think you're going to need now I'm just gonna roll up around the outside making sure I've got a really nice thick coating perfect I'm going to let that sit for a few minutes just like that and then I'm going to repeat that process so I get a slightly thicker coating on to the top half I also think these would look fantastic in those little maybe the 3 9 ml bottles or the 600 ml bottles there's little party favors to take home this little guys kind of awkward so I suggest sitting in just in a cup or something just to let him set and then we'll give our base a second coat again more than you think you'll need with this it's actually best to melt more chocolate i melted about 500 grams of chocolate it's best amount more than you think you're going to need because it's always easier to work with too much than too little and then you can just place all of your leftovers into a snap seal bag seal it up and keep it for the next time you need chocolate I'll also mention if you're using chocolate rather than a candy melt here you do want to make sure that it's a compound chocolate not a curvature so a compound chocolate does not contain the ingredient cocoa butter and that will actually allow the chocolate to set at room temperature rather than having to be refrigerated if you are using a couverture chocolate which has cocoa butter you'll need to temper it there are tons of tutorials online that show you how then I'm just going to take a piece of baking paper just on a tray or a board and I'm actually going to flip them upside down and let them set in the fridge off to the fridge for about 15 minutes to let our little Cola bottles set up nicely so coming back from the fridge and that has only been about 15 minutes I am going to take my top and you'll see the chocolates kind of drizzle down a little bit you can just break that off if you want and then you just want to put your scissors in underneath very carefully and just create like a little nick and then you're going to use that to tear down trying to handle the chocolate too much text as you can see it's really quite nice and shiny and you want to try and keep that shine as much as you can you only need to take that first little bit off and then you can take the lid off and pop your top half out you'll notice I'm handling it from the inside rather than the outside and the little lids also fine to touch then the same for the bottom piece so again I'm just going to pull away any of that I'd even trim it away so it's nice and neat and then again a little nick and we're gonna peel this section away you only need to peel this down to about here just so that we can release that kind of bulbous bottom of the bottle so coke bottles out and it was actually pretty simple and I'm gonna start heating up my skillet now I'm hitting the skillet because I want to make sure that my two ends that meet up are really really nice and flat I'm going to take this little guy because the top section actually comes out quite a bit thinner than you need for the lid to go on and otherwise the lid slides down and looks a bit funny so I'm just going to dip him in some of my remaining melted chocolate just to start bulking up that top a little bit off to the side to set now knowing that we want to minimize the amount of fingerprints on this you'll notice I've been picking it up by the inside just using my hands I don't want too many fingerprints on the outside so I'm going to use just a napkin or a tissues nice just something soft just to hold it so that my Kweli fingerprints aren't getting all over it I'm just going to grab my skillet I'm gonna place it straight down and just sort of rub it gently only for a couple of seconds until I get a really nice kind of even top it just flattens it off it makes it a lot neater and then you can start filling it with candy I almost feel like this one might have less sugar than the the actual soft drink that was in there to begin with with my candy I've chosen kind of like some little M&amp;Ms candies and then coke bottles and some larger truffles but with any pinata you want to make sure you've got a good variation in candy sizes the big ones help to fill it up without you having to spend a ton of money but the little ones give that really kind of nice spill effect when you smash into it which is the best part of any candy pinata this is looking amazing alright so now I'm going to take this and I just want to kind of measure it up that looks just still not quite thick enough for what I want it for so I'm just going to dip it one more time and then on goes my little ring just gently onto that chocolate and then followed by the middle now I'm reheating my skillet I don't recommend leaving it on the heat cuz you've already got a bit of chocolate in there which can then start to burn so I'm just gonna handle this one just carefully by the neck back down on the hot skillet and let it melt away just a little and then that melted edge can stick straight down onto our bottle push it down so you've got a nice seamless sort of a line last but not least it's so to finish off our giant soda bottle pinata make sure that you've got enough chocolate joining together so don't be too skimpy when you skill it because you need an ice melted edge and if you see any gaps in the chocolate you can use a ziplock bag just squeeze in a little bit more chocolate kind of run your finger out it to smooth it off no one's going to see that section so it doesn't matter if it's not absolutely perfect but you definitely want to make sure it's joined so empanada doesn't fall apart alright finally last but definitely not least it's time for our label so I'm just going to paint just a line of chocolate on each side I also think it should be super cute if you custom-made your own label but kind of had whatever soda bottle within the birthday boy or girl's name line it up nicely at the front I'm messy but it's looking sorry so cute it actually just looks like a bottle of Cola so my husband who's the silent guy on the other side of that camera insists that I smashed these in a bit of a show-stopping way so here goes we are about to take up in Yoda's you can hear all that candy inside ready set oh my god we have made the hugest mess there's literally candy everywhere somehow I still feel like this is gonna be easier to clean up than if i spilt actual sodor everywhere today's video is super quick super easy and really really fun and even though it's left me with one heck of a mess to clean up I think I'm up to the challenge thanks for much for watching you 
high five dude high five and high five - dinosaur what happens all alone in the kitchen with nothing but cakes accompanied by drives you mad [Music] hey guys welcome back so Jacob and Ollie's birthdays are both coming up this week and Jacob has been obsessed with this guy since the good dinosaur movie came out we're going to make a good dinosaur cake the things that you need to make your good dinosaur cake I'm using three 6-inch chocolate mud cake this is my mud cake recipe from the sweet celebrations cookbook which I'll link to down below but it's also my favorite recipe that on my blog so I'll leave a link to that home I plan Arlo the dinosaur figurine mines plastic and poseable so I'll leave a link down below to where I got this one from if you guys are looking you want the one who's arms and legs can actually move I've got a 12 inch cake board a small 6-inch wooden tree stump cake board you can buy these online it's not a must-have I just thought it kind of added a nice rustic you touch I've got for quite fat plastic straws two 6-inch cardboard cake boards a double batch of my childhood can - I'll link to the recipe below I've got some candy rocks so you can generally find these little candy pebbles that have chocolate inside but it also lucked out and found some of these awesome jellybeans candy rocks I'll link to them again down below chocolate Pocky stick some green fondant and I've got some candy melts in dark milk and peanut butter flavor you just want a variety of shades to your candy now first up our we've got a cover our cake board let's cover our cake board I always like to cover my boards because it just adds a bit of color so I'm just going to sprinkle down a little corn flour roll out my green fondant really nice and thin and then I'm going to lay it over the board as it gets to about the right size and I'm just going to roll it out until it's basically the same size as the board you can add a little bit of water underneath your fondant just to help secure it in place and then I'm going to use a knife and rather than cutting around the outside edge kind of just going to rub the nice side along the edge of the fondant which will help it really neatly come away from the board it's not going to care it's just going to kind of break off softly for boring black sick glorious green now we've got some grass for our entire good dinosaur cake to sit on now we're going to carve our cake so you want to take a serrated edge knife and I'm going to start by just shaving away the very very little bit on the bottom and then carving away the top so anything that's rounded or raised on pops you end up with like a nice flat cake divide each cake in half you should end up with six 6-inch round by one inch high chocolate mud cake layers I like to carve my case while they're either really chilled or semi frozen because they carve it a stack a lot easier take your first six inch cake board and I'm going to put a nice generous smear of ganache on the board and then I'm going to put down my first layer of chocolate cake I'm going to spread a generous amount of ganache in between each layer using my offset spatula but when I get to layer four for chocolate cake ganache chocolate cake ganache all the way into your fourth layer of cake you need to add a little bit of structural support you're going to take four straws you can also use wooden bamboo skewers here or wooden dowels you want to push them all the way in in four separate locations around the center almost making like a small circle of straws on the inside of the cake I particularly like these plastic straws for kids party cakes because I know to remove them but with the boundry skewers they're kind of sharp and pointy and I would hate to have a piece of that break off in a children's cake snip off your straws to size and then I'm taking a smaller board you can either cut down one of those other 6-inch cardboard boards or I actually have this little 4 inch board laying around so I'm just going to use back spread ganache all over the top of the straws and then pop down your cake board and secure everything in place with another layer of ganache before continuing on with stacking your cake ganache a little more cake because my cakes are really nice and cold the ganache in between each layers set really quickly but if you find that your cakes are sliding around on top of each other at all put that cake in the fridge for about 15-20 minutes to let all of that chocolate ganache set which will make the next step a lot easier I'm going to make a small amount of ganache and just spread it all up and down the sides of the cake it's a pretty tall cake so going up and down is a little bit easier here than trying to go side to side and you want to just make sure that it's completely covered in ash all over the sides and if you feel you want to set this in the fridge again for 15 minutes you can but as I said mine was cold to start with so this first layer is set pretty quickly now I'm going to set a generous and I mean generous layer of ganache on the outside you want this coating of can actually quite thick because we need to press all of our little rocks and other elements into it and if it's not thick enough your rocks can have nothing to stick to I'm just going to use a metal ruler to kind of scrape back and get my cake relatively even it doesn't have to be perfect at this point because this thing is literally covered in detail - don't panic about sharp edges flat tops or straight sides too much just get it to a basically tall cylindrical shape at this point I'm going to move my cake onto that little 6-inch tree stamp cake stand I'm going to smear some ganache straight on that tree stump board and then I'm going to very carefully lift my cake please sit down and I'm just going to support it very slightly on top of the cake because it is kind of top-heavy and can feel a little bit wonky before placing it gently onto the cake step I'm not going to get you guys to put your cake into the fridge at this point because we need that ganache to be nice and soft so we can stick all of our pebbles and rocks and coffee sticks and everything into the side of it so let's start with the base layer I'm using chocolate Pocky sticks which are basically small bread sticks coated in chocolate and I'm just going to snap them off haphazardly and poke the ends in all around a very very base about the bottom half to 3/4 of an inch of my good dinosaur silo don't be tempted to eat all of the ends of the stick so they promise you we use six packets of coffee for this cake and you will need literally every single one of them part my couple that I might have nibbled on just a couple now it's time for our rocks so these little jelly bean rocks are awesome they're really shiny but they're also quite large which means you don't need to be placing for hours some of them are stuff on hold but some of them are actually cut in half with a pair of scissors so they stretched even further and once sorry much in this case each slice it's going to be cut please some all over the cake and I sort of alternated with the jelly bean rocks the little candy rocks but then I also took two of each color of the candy melt and kind of sandwich them together like a little candy melt burger and shove them into the side in the case this gives you a whole bunch of different options for different rocks really a nice variation to give you the effect of that kind of old-school rustic eerie silo take five of your peanut butter candy melts under turn them around so that the flat side facing forward and I'm going to put them three at the bottom and two at the top these are going to make the flat rocks that the dinosaur family put their little paw print marks on once you applied your candy melts you can keep those those rocks until you get to about an inch away from the top of the cake you want to start there because we need a little bit of space to apply more Pocky so that we can get the kind of sticky-outy straw bits that are at the top of the silo to match the bottom when you hit the top of the silo you want to make these Pocky breaks quite a bit longer than the ones on the bottom level because the top straw of the silo actually hangs out almost double the width so again I'm just breaking sticking in my pocket and you'll have a lot of those leftover ends here because you don't want to just waste all the Pocky by only using the good bit so again just dab one of your other pocket into some melted chocolate and just touch up the little ends so that all you see is chocolate and there's none of that bread stick available perfect now we're almost done but we've still kind of got this naked top of the cake going on so I'm going to get all of my scraps of Pocky and summer covered and some are not but I'm just going to lay them around almost like a bit of a fan shape separating out like a pie gonna lay all of my longest Pocky first and then I'm going to use that melted milk chocolate or dark chocolate just to get all of the rest of that Pocky and lay them down this kind of makes the top of the cakes come together with that side straw and give the impression that the whole top of our silo is covered in delicious chocolate breadstick straw I'm going to use a little broken piece of Pocky and I'm just going to dip into some of that melted either dark or milk candy melt I'm going to make the little paw print shapes that make two family members marks some are a little bigger I've got like dad mum and then the three kids but I'm not leaving any blanks because in my story everyone already has their mark and no one's still waiting to earn it I'm also going to dip Arlo's foot into some of that chocolate so it definitely looks like it's just finished putting his little paw on the side of the silo look at what we made you guys so now it's time to put everything together so I want to put my main silo onto my green cake board and then I met but I love in place and still got a mini is some melted chocolate but I want to make sure that I get the melted chocolate on the base of the seat of this on the right place on the board because I had rocker in place you can kind of handle it a little bit down like so and lift it off and I should have three nice little imprints where my feet just stuck and if I work to clear and place a small dollop of chocolate here yeah and I think here I'll be able to pick my silo in place so long as I put it back in the exact same location perfect down at eye level with it stick it into place and let that set in the silo should stay nice neat and even and also take out a little bit of those balance issues because now you've got a bigger base sick Arlo in place like so and he has this adorable little critter and hangs up his tail that also tends to do an awesome gift for the little birthday girl or boy so we're going to finish it off by just putting a little mud puddle around the bottom I'm literally just going to blob chocolate I always love putting my cakes on a larger cake board because I think it gives you so much more real estate to play with you guys might have seen this in my Willy Wonka illusion cake where I literally had half the cake on the board the waterfall and the Oompa Loompas you can have cake but you can also have all this space to make your case look a lot better a few more of our little candy rocks our good dinosaur cake is complete so like I said this is Jacob's birthday cake I'm now letting take a look at it but it's not like to eat it so we get to the party if you guys don't follow our family blog channel make sure that you check it out we have some pretty interesting adventures and some pretty crazy times have an open day you guys whoever you make this for I hope your little dinosaur loves this cake as much as we enjoyed making it see you next time 
hey guys I believe and this cake not only tastes delicious it's also remote control and it's Drive delicious have you guys enjoyed this video if you want to check out my pages it's my cupcake addiction and with no stuff like this all the time well we're okay we're good oh we're not good [Music] it's still good I think we're good today I'm going to show you guys how to make a remote-control truck cake that actually drive I know it's going to be a lot of fun I really shouldn't eat and drive apartment obviously your truck you're also going to need some things to make your cake portion I'll leave a link to this toy truck down below I've also got some cake I'm going to use pound cake gear but you could also bake a regular sheet cake and cut to size I'm going with the super easy version so that you guys can whip this up in as little time as possible I've put some cardboard cake boards some chocolate ganache and I'll leave a link to my ganache recipe down below I've got food coloring in yellow red and black you guys can choose your own colors here a little silver luster to add a bit of shine and some white fondant because my trucks life a word to the wise don't let the kids play with his first make sure the truck stays clean and dry and try not to crash it off the side of your kitchen bench we're gonna have a little fun the first thing I'm gonna do is I need to filled up my space a little bit because that's the moment I've got all these different wonky angles and I can work around these guys but this one needs to come off gotta go I'm going to use the serrated edges nice to just cut off anything that's kind of raised on my back deck but these little guys here on the front deck there's not a lot that I can do about that so I'm going to use some fondant and use it almost like an edible play dough and there's no exact size here it really depends on the size of your truck and it may take a little trial and error to get it even but I'm going to kind of roll it into a bit of a sausage and then squish it out into like a flat rectangle so it fills up that truck bed so it's all one level take your cardboard cake board and I'm going to cut it to the same size as a regular pound cake as I said you guys can use your own cake recipe here you could draw a mud cake you could do whatever you like but I discovered that a regular pound cake that is just store-bought is the perfect size for my truck bed so I feel like it's a bit of a match made in heaven and saved us a bit of time once you pay your back piece I've got a tiny indent in my front section so I'm going to cut a smaller piece of that cake board assist it inside and then I'm going to trim another piece of cake board to size so I essentially have the main part of my truck which is that entire back truck bed and then I've got that little cabin right behind the cab of the truck I'm going to use almost exactly three store-bought pound cakes here so you want to start with the length of the truck bed and I just sort of sliced off the two ends so that my two pound cakes could fit together really nice and flat and then cut a smaller piece of town cake out of your remains to fit that little piece just behind the truck cab he's kind of like you're going mini cakes with the remains of your pound cake I'm almost going to jigsaw this together so I'm going to cut this like 2/3 3/4 of a pound cake right down the middle makes two layers and whatever I've got left in scraps I'm going to make almost like little chip sized portions that kind of fit in as a jigsaw you want those big solid stable bits of pancake on the end and those little kind of jigsaw stick together bits in the middle now we make our cakes you can pull them off the truck on their little boards and we're going to make the cake on their individual boards and then we'll attach them all to the truck at the end I'm going to finish because ganache gives you a really nice firm setting when you want to leave fondant over a cake and it's basically a combination of cream and chocolate I'll leave a link to my ganache video down below you guys can check it out if you've never made it before I'm going to start by putting a little ganache just scrape down onto those little cake boards and then lay my first layer of cake down literally anywhere that cake touches another cake so those little size sections or the tops or all of my little pieces I'm going to put a nice little thin coating of ganache in between to stick everything together as opposed to frosting ganache actually sets really nice and firm so it helps to hold the structure and the shape of your truck as well as obviously being delicious once you've got all of your pieces in place you can take a bit of time to can - the outside edges the smaller ones believe it or not it's actually harder and I find it easier to pick it up and use an offset spatula just to kind of smear ganache all over the sides of it you want to set that in the fridge so as soon as you've got a really rough coat chuck it in the fridge for 15 minutes and then can come back and it won't be so hard to work with repeat that for your long section of the truck again putting it in the fridge then you can bring out your short section again and apply a second coat at this point if paid to take a little bit of time to get that coating of ganache really nice and smooth you can use a ruler to smooth it off or an offset spatula but I like to make sure that I have the shape that I want before I lay the fondant over the top because as much as you think you can get a great shape out of fondant really it is the base in the foundation of the ganache shape that gives your finished cake is overall look I'm going to put those back up into the fridge and I'm going to let them set for at least thirty minutes maybe even an hour until they're really nice and firm at this point I have a back trailer and like a front cabin area I'm not a truck driver I can try it's not the place where the guy sleeps because that's in the engines the engine I don't know my future as a truck driver is looking dubious I'll have to stick to cakes so I've got the back of my truck and then I've got my little small piece these guys are pretty smooth but I'm going to take a little bit more of pretty fluid ganache so you can actual set like firm and then you can microwave it for 10 seconds at a time to get it a little more spreadable and I've actually taken mine just enough about 15 seconds in the microwave so it's a little runny err if it starts to separate or get it all grainy give it a really good stir and it will bring it back together you want it to be smooth and shiny and glossy but sometimes on the remelt I don't know why it can just separate a bit so I'm going to use this just to put a really nice final smooth coating and by setting that cake in between this allows me to have a really stable base to build from my biggest concern here is to try and get my corners and my edges nice and sharp because we don't want to have a rounded truck that's just not correct I may be a truck driver but I know they're pretty square many of you guys have ganache square cakes before y'all know square cakes are the devil and if you have a choice go round whenever possible obviously we can't have a round truck so I have to deal with it whenever you're doing squares you want to try and build up the corner as much as possible because it's always going to be your corners the top of your corners particularly the kind of lose height and end up sagging and making your whole cake look rounded oh that's right adds like a little bit more ganache just into that corner section so I can kind of cheat it and have almost too much there to work with rather than risk having too little once you've got your last super smooth code of ganache on you want to pop your two pieces of trap back in the fridge for about another 20 minutes that are really nice and firm when you're ready to take them out sprinkle down a little bit of either cornstarch or you could use icing sugar here or confectioners sugar and then you want to roll out your white fondant to like a nice big flat rectangle shape big enough that it's going to cover the mean large section of your truck something that looks a little bit like this kind of like a big long rectangle pizza dough made out of sugar now we cover the back of our truck so I'm going to lift up my big sheet of fondant move my truck into place hope that I've measured roughly correctly on this side drop it down and over she goes particularly important with square cakes is to secure the top and then your sides and edges first because if your father's going to tear anywhere here it's gonna be your corner I want to make sure that I get any air bubbles that I can out of that top section if you happen to have one of these the fondant smoother they can be a great chill just be able to apply a bit of pressure and it sort of flatten things down smooth them off if you don't have one of those you can very gently and I mean very gently no pressure just kind of use your rolling pin just just sort of roll over the top to get that fondant really nice and flat and also to get any air bubbles out these are like three dollars where I don't like you guys spending too much on your cake tools but the three bucks is a really good investment when you get to the corners again I'm going to secure all the way down my corner and then I'm just going to sort of flatten out you don't want to get elephant skin here so elephant skin is when this kind of thing here sort of sags over when it starts to go creepy the fondant can start to dry out but I'm just going to alleviate that by putting the fondant out and then patting it down so I don't get a real creeps in there I kind of like stretch it out so that everything falls into place and then smooth now before I go and cut around the bottom of this I'm just going to push my fondant in just a little bit all the way around my cake and this is going to help it to secure but it's also going to stop it from pulling out and away from the cake after I cut it when I go to remove my excess yourself to feel it all up and kind of presses it into that cake board as well so that you're not exposing any of your cardboard cake board underneath and then we keep the cutter around the edges and whenever I keep the cutter out Tronics come in on too much of an angle and I go straight up and down as close to the edge of the board as possible but don't come in on an angle like this or you'll end up with like I'd give it under the cake and don't go out like that or you'll stab the top of the cake with your pizza cutter which at this point would be heartbreaking remove check very little bits of chocolate and pull those out because we want this to stay nice and why and then we can reroll it and do the same to cover our smaller piece while ganache in the smaller piece might have actually been considerably harder fondant covering it should be much much easier at this point you can't put that back in the fridge anymore your fondant will get really sticky so from here it can just stay at room temperature that's the end of what I call the boring bits for me baking it carving it stacking it and covering it not so fun but necessary now let's do the fun bit we're going to assemble I'm going to decorate I'm going to use a little bit of melted white candy model any colored candy melt but I'm sticking with white so I don't accidentally see it poking out anywhere and this is going to essentially glue my cake boards onto my truck and use my first board just to hold it in place because we know people are going to drive this and the last thing I want is some kind of a truck cake catastrophe imagine the insurance on that all right a nice generous blob of the white on this board and I've already glued that board down and then on goes my little section they'll have a couple of seconds to move this guy around so it's nice and central and then don't touch it till that candy melts it down goes a little bit more of this candy melt you notice I'm putting it in the middle not too close to the edges because I really don't want to see any milk coming out the side of my truck so there's so many is an offset spatula and I'm just going to come carefully under so that I can lift it up there's very likely going to be an amount of chocolate ganache around the underside edges of your trucks could be very careful after you put it down not to touch it until you've washed your hand but a few guys to get big brown smudges well loads a little unstable loads a little unstable I think we're OK alright before I touch that I'm just going to wash my hands and then we're going to press it into place now that I'm happy with the positioning I'm just going to press down using my smoother and again if you want to move around and really smooth is a great to sort of push it into place it saves you pushing air with your fingers and getting a little fingerprints and finger marks if you must use your hands to use the whole palm now it's time to decorated you guys can get creative here I'm going for kind of simple being best so I'm going to cut strips of white fondant and I'm using a ruler just to get a rough guide to how long I need them for my long strip the long strips going to be the most difficult you can either use an edible silver paint here or you can mix together some silver luster dust with either a clear alcohol like vodka or if the cakes are kids you can use a little lemon extract even though I am using a few drops of vodka here I promise you that there's no chance of small drunk children running around your party after eating a piece of this cake it's literally a couple of drops of vodka and the alcohol portion evaporates which is what allows your silver luster paint to dry a lot faster and if you just use something like a plain water paint them and let them dry for at least thirty minutes because they'll be a lot easier to handle if they're completely dry and if that fondant started to set a little bit like I said those low ones are going to be your toughest so start with those so just brush a little bit of water so that it just makes that sugary fondant surface sticky straight onto the truck I'm going to rest my silver stripe onto the ruler and then I'm going to basically flip the ruler up in place so that the silver stripe doesn't sag or go in the middle and it nice and nice you've got a couple of minutes here and fill that water underneath drive so you can use the ruler to make sure that your edges are really nice and in line and you can also shift it around a little bit if you nuisance if you happen to get any of that pesky silver on the white parts of the cake you can just use a little bit of regular water and a paintbrush to just kind of brush over it until it comes off and then Pat it dry with a piece of paper towel I'm going to repeat that with all of my long strips and then small strips I'm basically creating a border around the Front's the backs and the side of both pieces of my remote control trap cake so Nico another place take a bit of white fondant measure it to size so it sits nicely on your truck and then I'm going to paint it yellow take some black food coloring and just paint on whatever you want to another play to read I'm opting for cake for obvious reasons but there might be a good place to put the birthday boy or girl's name all the name of the person that's going to be receiving this awesome truck cake oh my god you guys truck cake cake truck is there a mashup name there trick cake Kruk I suggest one remote can remote cake troll no it's not working there's no mashup here this is our truck at this point it looks amazing and I've kind of left it as a bit of a blank canvas so I'm going to stick on my CD tiny little number plates caked adorable and if you want to do some more detailing on the side you can you can hand paint it if you feel like you've got a steady hand oh and I'll leave a little link to these I just created these little templates I printed these out on edible image paper if you don't have an edible printer because I get that not everybody does other than me you can actually send these to a lot of places online if you know in advance that you need them send over that template get them to print it they'll post it to you and you can put this edible image directly on the side of your truck sometimes these sheets of edible paper can be a little temperamental so if you have any trouble with it not coming off the backing paper really easily as a tip put it in the freezer for like 30 minutes and then get a really sharp knife and just use it to make the first separation kind of slide the knife underneath I actually prefer to leave my edible images out on the table for at least a day before I want to use them because as they kind of dry out a bit they come off that backing paper much easier I'm going to use a little bit of water to attach my number plates and then a very small amount of water just on the back of my edible images that I'm just going to Pat on with a damp paper towel so that I don't get any kind of watery spots stick on your side logos and your truck cake is we're ready to go the moment of truth you guys I thought I should shoot an outro where I didn't run it just in case I run it off the edge of the bench but then I was like oh don't be silly let's just do it so I'm going to reach underneath and my truck on and I'm just gonna go for it he's got a load whoa [Music] whoa oh my god you guys we made a remote-control truck cake this is the greatest thing I have ever made I think I said that every cake so this is actually the greatest thing I've ever made my kids are going to go absolutely crazy for this I think they have to leave it here and get them in I think I need some opinions of real construction workers to see if I managed to get this cake true to form this is so much fun to make you guys thanks so much for watching [Music] [Music] [Music] 
hey guys it's Elise and welcome back to my cupcake addiction today we're going G incise of something that I use on the channel all the time M&amp;Ms okay so I was in the store the other day and I found these M&amp;Ms they're called giant size M&amp;Ms but really they're not that big I mean they're bigger than usual there's many there's normal this giant and then there's giant that's what we're making today we're going to make a giant M&amp;M cake and of course it's going to be stuffed with M&amp;Ms because that just makes sense the things that you're going to need to make your giant mm cake you're going to need two bowls that are the same size mine are quite shallow they do have a flat base on them and that's going to ensure that my mm is able to stand up I'm using metal bowls because I find them the easiest for chocolate work I've got all of the ingredients to make up a one batch of my classic chocolate cake I've made it on the channel before I'll leave a link to that video down below as well as the recipe so basically I've got flour sugar eggs butter cocoa water oil I've got a little bit of fondant not too much in Y I've got M&amp;Ms to stuff inside my cake and I've got a batch of my chocolate ganache again I'll leave a link to that recipe down below it's just dark chocolate and cream I've got some red candy melts you're going to need about three bags you're also gonna need a fry pan or skillet I've got a spatula a bread knife and a circle cutter and I will link to this down below this is a nicely sized M from an M&amp;M template that we're going to trace around at the detailing to the outside of our giant M&amp;M I'm also going to leave dimensions of those bowls let's get started the first thing you're going to do is mix up your cake batter then you're going to need to thoroughly grease your bowl and place a little round of parchment on just the very base divide your batter evenly into two bowls or in half and big One Bowl at a time and then they want to go into a moderate oven for about 35 to 40 minutes each you'll know that done when a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean and then you just want to rest them in the bowls for 15 minutes before scraping a spatula around the outside edge and then converting them onto a cooling rack once your cakes have completely cooled then we can get carving other than making sure they clean and drivers nothing else you need to do to prepare your two bowls they're metal they're not nonstick they are going to work a treat so I'm going to take my candy melt and I'm going to put about a quarter into each Bowl we'd rather do two thin coats here than one big thick one you can put a little more in on this first coat because we're going to drip out any excess back into the bowl anyway just use your spatula to just coax it up the sides of the bowl try and make sure that it's relatively the same thickness all over and like I said we'd rather do two thin coats here than one super thick one just makes it a lot nicer to eat and a lot more structurally sound out goes any excess and then just use your spatula to come around the top and make sure you've got a really nice clean outer edge repeat with your second half but then they can both go into the fridge all right those two are ready to go off into the fridge they need 15 minutes in the fridge and then we're going to come back and give them a second coat while the different stages of your shells are being made you can start to prepare the cakes so if they're completely cool it's the best time to start carving them I want to take just a little bit off the entire outside edge because I baked that in the exact same bowl that I'm now doing a double coat of candy melt in I need to create a little bit of space otherwise that's going to sit just a little high in the bowl so I'm just gonna take a really small amount off around the outside all the way around all right so with the back kind of shaved down a little bit I'm going to come to the top take a little off here as you need because we don't want to waste any cake and just reserve the top section you may need to use that to build up once we have the actual M&amp;M she'll get that top section as flat and as level as you possibly can perfect now finally I found it easiest to flip the cake over at this stage because it's a bit more stable on its top half and then you just want to divide it into two even layers so you should have a little lid and a little base kind of different sizes once your first coats are set you're going to apply a second coat and again we're going to use the spatula just just smooth it up the sides this one's going to set a little bit faster than the first one cuz it's going on - cold candy melt in there it goes about half of what's remaining try to use it all up because we do want to have about a half a cup to a cup on the outside leftover for joining our M&amp;M cake together I'm going to pay particular attention to getting it nice and high on the sidewalls so that the sides of my mmm chocolate shell are nice and strong out goes any excess and again just neaten up around that top edge the same with our second perfect those guys are ready to go back into the fridge they're going to get 15 minutes in the fridge and then they're going to snap five minutes in the freezer which is going to cause them to chill really rapidly and contract away from the edges of our metal balls this is a fine balance you don't want to freeze them for too long because it will cause them to crack but if you check on them after about five minutes you should even be able to see that they're just started to pull away from the outside edges that is the sweet spot pardon the pun so I just going to pull them out tip it over very gently support and reveal one half of our giant M&amp;M cake particularly while these are super cold be really delicate with them they'll be quite brittle and they are prone to cracking don't worry too much if any of your edges are compromised we're actually going to trim these down so they're a little bit kind of shorter anyway so don't worry too much if any of your edges kind of have a little bit of a chunk or to come loose I've turned both of your halves I'm just resting mine on cake boards one will be a finished cake board the other ones really just so that I've got something to move it around on I don't touch the outsides too much my fry pan has been heating so this is nice and hot rather than turning these over into the fry pan they're a really awkward shape to deal with so make sure going to be the front man down onto the top of each of my halves as I'm watching that I can see the fry pan shrinking down ever so slightly I'm going to lift perfect I'm going to clean that fry pan now because that's going to start to burn very quickly and then repeat that with my other half so I've got beautiful nice flat edges on both you may need to reheat your ganache just a little bit you want this to be horrible but not hot again a fine balance ganache will set quite firm at room temperature and it's too running when it's really fresh and hot but to get it at almost body temperature so that it doesn't feel warm to touch and still have it runny it's a delicate balance there maybe a little bit of waiting to get it right I'm going to pull I mean there's no exact measurement here you've got one solid batch and really we're dividing this in half between the two layers but they've got to go in between the different layers of cake so I'm just going to scoop a little bit into the bottom of that one about that much and the same into the bottom of this guy and this is going to be the coat that I spread up all over the inside of our little molds god I feel like you could just fill this entire thing with ganache when you really would have a giant M&amp;M but I'm pretty confident make you quite ill in each of your cakes once the smothered in ganache you want to turn the rounded section back over so it makes the base of the bowl and slide it in and then more ganache in goes your next layer of cake again flipping it over now you want to take your circle cutter you can see we've still got some space between the cake and the very top of our shell and we don't want to just stuff that full of ganache but we do want M&amp;Ms in the center of our cake so core out the center circle of each of your layers and then we can use a spoon just to pull that piece out don't think you get to eat this we still may need it yet so that's going into my off cuts bowl and I don't really want the base of this to be ganache so I'm gonna go down again into that next layer and just push the cookie cutter about halfway down pull it out and then again we'll use the spoon just to call out that Center mine's a pretty decent sized cookie cutter because this is an M&amp;M cake it needs a lot of M&amp;Ms inside perfect that is basically just a big blob of ganache with cake crumbs in it that will be delicious I'm only going to take the 1 circle core out of this this is going to be my top half because we're already going to have an issue keeping those M&amp;Ms in their place when we join these two halves together all right I'm going to use my spatula and I'm just going to add just a little bit more ganache a thin amount only around the outsides not on the inside of that circle and we're going to build up those outside edges with some of our cake scraps so that they're perfectly level and then add another coat ganache on top this can't be too high but it can't be too low either it has to be like perfectly level now you're going to cut and press all of those little off cuts from all of that chocolate cake in your off cuts Bowl in and around each half of your giant M&amp;M cake you're kind of basically sculpting it to really fill it up so that it's no higher than the top edges but just to bulk it out a little bit more so it's relatively even with the top edges of each of your molds you can scrape a little bit of ganache just a tiny amount inside the center hole of each of your cakes and then you want to refrigerate those for about 15-20 minutes to let that ganache set once your ganache is set we've got M&amp;Ms going all the way through the center of this cake but because we know we need to invert the top half onto the bottom half we don't want all of our M&amp;Ms falling out and going everywhere we kind of want them stuck in that core so I've got a piece of parchment and some of my leftover red candy melt and I'm just going to create a small candy melt disk about the same size for a little bit bigger than that inside circle you can use your cookie cutter here if you want something to measure against so just use the back of your spoon just to spread it out a little bit perfect I'm going to leave that one that is set now the reason I got you guys to refrigerate these is after you've brushed the inside with that bit of ganache you want it to set up a little bit so that you don't end up with ganache all over your M&amp;Ms the whole cool thing about this is when we cut into it they're all going to spill out and if they're covered in brown ganache they're not going to look as cute as we'd like so in goes copious amounts of my M&amp;Ms into each half of my giant M&amp;M cake when your little disc is set you want to just microwave the last of your ganache and we're just going to put it around the top of that top section all over again but again don't come too close to the edges because we don't want this going over the outsides of our red M&amp;M and making like brown streaks so just around the top not over the top of the M&amp;Ms but right up to the edge it's kind of going to hold our little chocolate disc in place and it's also going to help to stick our two cakes together a little on the bottom half as well you can't have too much ganache and then on goes our chocolate discs so this guy here you kind of want it to be sticking to that ganache it's going to hold in place but not for long so when we flip and invert we need to do it pretty quickly I'm going to paint just a tiny bit more ganache around just the very outside edge and then I'm going to refrigerate that layer just for five minutes to make that ganache set nice and firm so it's got the best chance of holding a disc in place just over the very outside edge because again we don't want it putting ganache all over our nice M&amp;Ms in the next core down and then off into the fridge for five well that's in the fridge we're going to start preparing the EM this is what's going to complete our giant M&amp;M cake so I've cut around my little template I'm going to sprinkle down just a little bit of cornflour we could use powdered sugar and I'm going to roll out my white fondant give it a little need first just so that it's nice and pliable before you start rolling place your fondant and your template onto a chopping board so we don't slice the bench and then I'm going to use either a really fine knife or a stanley or exacto knife just to cut around the outsides of my M so once you have cut around your shape remove your little template and then just use your fingers just to kind of neaten up around those outside edges if you've got any little kind of ridges or bumps or any areas where it's pulled out a shape a little bit that's going to go onto my piece of parchment I'm going to double that piece of parchment over so that it's not exposed to the air just while we wait until it's ready to stick on our cake okay coming back from the fridge now I've got my little disc we know that there's a hidden core of M&amp;Ms underneath and this ganache is kind of set and gone tacky so it's holding everything in place and fingers crossed it's going to keep ordering it and place all we join it together just kidding it'll be fine take some of your red candy melt and pop it into a snap seal bag cut a nice tip off the end of your snap seal bag make sure it doesn't fall into your cake and then we're going to put it around the piece that hasn't been in the fridge so the base piece so I'm just going to squeeze it all the way around kind of on the inside edge of that top edge I don't want too much of this overhang on the outside if we can avoid it I'm putting it on the side that hasn't been on the fridge because it's going to set a little bit faster on the side that has been on the fridge so this gives us a couple more seconds to get our top and bottom together working quickly I'm going to pick up the top half of my giant M&amp;M I'm going to support the disk underneath just with my hand and we're going to join them together make sure that it's nice and even and then you just want to run your finger quickly around the front edge to make sure that any of that candy melt that's come out from joining together just get smoothed off you want this to be nice and well stuck together so if there's any sections I've got a little bit here where you feel like there's no candy melt or if you've had any gaps show up just squeeze a little bit in with your snap seal bag and then just use your finger just to smooth it in so it kind of blends in with that other line the very last piece is to take a paintbrush and a little bit of just plain tap water and we're going to fix our M on the top of our giant M&amp;M I'm just so excited by how this is looking so my M I'm just gonna flip it over and then I'm gonna paint just a small amount you don't need too much here really just a little amount on the back believe it or not when you're working with fondant water basically acts like a glue alright now I'm going to carefully pick up my M this is going to be flexible so you do need to make sure that as you're positioning it your position it really nice and neatly I'm going to start with the top of the M and then I'm going to lay it down and just shift it around as needs so that it's in the nice straight M position alright this is it we have made this epic M&amp;M cake there is nothing not to love about a giant M&amp;M cake from the chocolate cake and the rich ganache that we've got going on on the inside to that awesome core of surprise hidden M&amp;Ms and our candy coating shell this guy is going to go down in history as one of my new all-time favorite cakes who's not going to want a giant M&amp;M cake filled with M&amp;Ms for their birthday as an added bonus I made you guys an extra video this week using this same technique because I needed a yellow M&amp;M as well just to even out the color pellet to make an M&amp;M pinata so you guys can make a cake to cut and the cake to smash for your next event I'll leave a link to that video down below I hope you guys have loved those video make sure that

[Music] hey guys welcome back to my cupcake addiction I'm Elise drone and today I'm showing you guys something that is really basic but actually not the easiest thing to do unless you've done that a hundred times before [Music] I'm making this video for a friend of mine who had some trouble with in cream cream has all sorts of different whipping consistencies so I thought I'd make a quick video to go through some of those consistency review so that you know what's the difference between a soft geek and a firmly whipped cream and what it looks like when it's over with and kind of cactus alright guys this is the type of cream that we get here in Australia that I would use I don't go for the fancy name brand I will use any of whatever the home brands are whatever the cheap friends are because it's pretty much all the same thing to the stick and cream you want cream with a 35 percent milk fat and depending on where you're watching from in the world you can have tons of different creams to choose from you want a whipping cream or anything with a 35 percent milk fat they call visit thickened cream because it's got a little bit of gelatin added which actually helps to keep it just that little bit thicker but a normal whipping cream with 35-cent milk fat will within the same way in goes our cream into the bowl a couple of things you may not have known about cream you can whip cream in a mason jar or in a coke bottle or in a soft drink bottle by just shaking it if you shake it for long enough it actually eventually does with I like to use an electric mixer hand mixer is not for me because it's like a 15-minute time investment in its liquid form your cream should be running this is great if you want to like get strawberries in it pour it over your apple pie but most of us want our cream at least a little bit firm for different reasons so let's start with soft cake electric mixer goes on always high always higher Katrina [Applause] that is the bulk of the legwork and you're whipping so your cream should be starting to increase in size so the actual volume that you've got in the bowl should be increasing it's now full of air you're really runny but as soon as you start to see it sticking in the bowl that's when you've got to watch it so it takes a fair bit of time to get here at least a few minutes but then it is very very quickly through the stages of being sandy Webb's Webb family with and then over-whipped which nobody wants all right you guys this is a good semi whipped cream now to the naked eye it doesn't actually look like it's really whipped at all it's still hold off the spoon but it's thick and it's definitely a lot more viscous than that first cream that we had the reason we use semi whipped cream is because you want to put it through something else so maybe a no-bake cheesecake maybe a no churn ice cream if you want to fold that cream for another mixture you whip it to here because just the act of folding and mixing this cream gets it to that web stage so once agree with you go to folding it through something else and over whips and it's split this is what we mean when we say a semi whipped cream thick but still falls off the spoon next stage if you're unsure here slow the beaters down I've been going full pelt on the beaters the whole time you can slow them down too on things to move just a little bit slower from this point I was occupied going balls all right what was that another 15 seconds this is your soft peak stage so you can see the feeders are now leaving their own marks in the cream and that's the first indication that your cream is ready to kind of hold up under its own weight you'll start to get those beat'em ups in there and as you drag the feeder back it will leave them in the cream this is a lovely soft peak softly whipped cream it's really nice for dolloping on pretty much anything still okay to fall for a mixture so if you've gotten to this stage with the cheesecake you can still fold it through just fold gently don't be too vigorous with your mixing motion because it's pretty close to being quit next day this is not a firm whip firm peak stage so this sits up sort of like a light fluffy mousse it's not even falling off the spoon this is about as far as you want to take a cream before it over with I don't recommend going any further than this and if you want to pipe this on something like a cupcake or if you want to pipe it on a normal cake if use around 50 probably okay but it started even just the active piping will continue to whip that cream so you do risk splitting it if you're spreading it like on a switch roll the act is spreading it will continue to whip the cream so I normally always recommend that in between stage where we've got the soft peaks if you want to put it on anything this is great if you want to shut it on top of a pavlova dollop it on top of a finish dessert if you're not going to do much with it it stage this is perfect I'll pop some of that aside because I don't want to waste it on I'm going to show you what over whipped cream looks like so we'll keep taking it past with now your creams kind of castus so what if you get to this stage you can see it I mean it's not even really a bowl anymore it looks super firm and you think are you going to be alright it kind of looks like a bit of an ice cream almost this stage you could still eat it but the mouthfeel is not great so when cream starts to separate it divides the fat and when you actually eat it you can feel that fat sticking to the top of your mouth you can also taste like little tiny grains or granules in it and if you keep whipping cream you actually get butter so your cream starts to get that butter like consistency keep losing it and see what happens all right we are well on our way to making button now so this is it looks like cottage cheese this cream has had it so my sort of cream I mean it might have been possible people aren't going to like the flavor this whip this is where you want it you want it to still have a little bit of its own kind of mind if you give a shake he'll swell around but it's nice and firm you can still add it to your cake you can still add it to your dessert anywhere from semi whips to soft peaks is fine for folding through other recipes so mixing with something else and this guy all the soft peaks is good for piping or spreading just be cautious of how much piping or spreader you're going to do let's take this and pop it on some cupcakes all right I'm going to pop my cream into a piping bag and I'm going to use the star tip I'm confident that I'm going to pipe very gently and very slowly so that I don't cause too much additional whipping gear but I want to show you guys what it looks like pipes on top of a cupcake the only thing you need to remember if you're using fresh cream on a cupcake or on a cake is that you then need to refrigerate that cake or cupcake which sucks the moisture out of the cake base so I like to if I'm using fresh cream make everything keep the cream in the fridge and frost just the front of that to serve keep my cupcakes at room temperature fresh cream cupcake all right you can see here this here is a really great example of cream that's been really well with being pushed through a star piping tip you can see they're just starting to over with I mean it's not terrible but the look that you want the your cream is this beautiful smooth look not just like crinkly kind of ever so slightly chunky look at that said it's still going to taste fine I'm going to add some fresh berries this is a dark chocolate mud cake so with fresh cream and fresh raspberries it's going to be amazing I'm also going to put on passionfruit and I know that a lot of you guys probably haven't seen or tried passionfruit passionfruit a weird fruit and it's super popular here in Australia but it actually takes it best when it looks it's worth so when it gets all ugly and dried and shriveled that's when you start to see the sweetness of the fruit come out really popular on desserts here but you get the opportunity to try it I highly recommend you do part sweet zesty a little bit of a chrome actually with a lot of crunch perfect so I want you to take note of the difference between these two this is the first one that I pipe and it was quite fun so the size of it it's still really nice and smooth this is a second one pipe through a star tip so you can see just the difference in the look of it and how even though this one's still going to taste good it just doesn't look quite as nice as that first one pipe definitely keep that in mind if you are going to pipe under whip a little bit could you get a little extra away from the piping techniques if you're going to add it for something keep it at those first two stages if you're going to pipe it on something go for an open round tip if you do want to just be a little more gentle on it because the star the star is kind of rough on your cruise if this video helped you I'd love it if you left me a comment down below if you'd like to see more just tips like this also let me know I feel like I'm always telling you

versatile guys make us a milliner cake make it a tropical cake make it a tiki cake make it your own the things you're going to need to make your Moana cake I've gone with one of my own recipes the mud cake from the sweet celebrations cookbook but you can use your favorite all up you're going to need 4 8 inch by 1 inch high layers of cake and then another 4 6 inch by 1 inch high layers of cake that's about 4 batches of the mud cake recipe I've got a couple of cake boards you'll need a 10 inch and a 5 inch and I've got an optional super large board I'll be using at the end some crushed white cookies straws make sure they're plastic buttercream and I've colored mine a sandy color and then a light blue and a dark blue you'll need toothpicks a little brown powder food color or a little brown dusting powder flowers decide if you want to use edible flowers here fresh or sugar I've gone with gum paste flowers some ganache and green fondant I've also made you guys two templates you've got your Moana and Maui template and also your kind of tattoo looking template that's going to go around the top layer of cake I'll link to those down below and I'll leave everything you need on the my cupcake addiction comm website as well as in the description box below let's get into it I'm feeling tropical oh sorry we were doing ingredients first up you want to take your six-inch cakes and just trim the very base of them off and then I'm going to use a cake leveler to give myself four nice 1 inch even layers of cake you want to do the same with your 8-inch cakes although I'm going to make mine slightly bigger than an inch about an inch and a quarter again trimming off the bottoms and leveling out the tops starting with my 8-inch cake I'm going to stack that on my baseboard with a little ganache to secure it to the board and then I'm going to lay a cake and then a nice thin layer of ganache cake ganache cake and ganache give that one a nice coating don't worry if it's not too neat here of ganache and pop it off into the fridge repeat that process with your 6-inch cake there's really no need to stick this one to the baseboard just cake ganache cake ganache cake and then cover the whole thing in ganache off into the fridge to set your baseline should be pretty well set now so I'm going to give it another nice coating of that chocolate ganache and then I'm going to roll out my green fondant sprinkle down a little bit of powdered sugar or corn starch or corn flour just to keep your fondant from sticking to the bench don't go too crazy thin here I'm going to do this in about three sections and I'm going to measure my cake and I want my Fonda to be just a little bit longer than the side of my bottom 8-inch cake so it's about 8 inches long in total I'm going to slide that onto a piece of parchment paper which is just going to help me to move it and use a pizza cutter to kind of cut strips like the tassels in a hula skirt and then I'm going to use the parchment to pick it up and it here first the very top section of the fondant to around the top inch of the top of my 8-inch cake once your green is all in place just Pat it down gently across the sides but to cover up any gaps and to kind of give it more of a three-dimensional and flowy type look you want to use your off cuts of green fondant to just cut some additional strips and you can either use a little bit of water or just the sticks and the fondant itself to attach them to cover up any gaps where you can see that brown ganache underneath but also to give a little bit more movement a little bit more flow and a little bit more texture to the skirt repeat that until your cake completely covered you can see from my finished Kay you've got really nice neat green edges but it's kind of got a little movement to it because we've added all of those little extra pieces along the way don't worry off the tops not completely neat we're going to fix that up take your six inch cake out of the fridge and you're going to apply a little bit of that sand-colored buttercream don't go too thick here but this is really just that you don't have any of the dark and ash poking through once you've got a nice coating of buttercream just use an offset spatula to remove it from the baseboard and pop it onto a tray covered with crushed graham cracker I'm going to scoop up those crushed white cookies just with the palms of my hand and just compress them all over that top six inch layer of cake to make this really nice and smooth and to compact my white cookies I'm going to take a little bit of parchment press it up against the sides and on the tops of the cake and just really smooth it out that's going to give me a really nice compressed sand finish which is going to make things easier when we move the cake and also when we add our little details it's looking very very Beach like pop that one off into the fridge so that buttercream layer can set because then it's going to make it really easy for us to move this top layer and stick it onto our bottom layer before we go attaching our two layers together we also need to support the underside so our top six edge doesn't crush the bottom layers of our eight inch I'm going to do that using a board but first of all I'm going to need nap the top of that cake with a little bit more of my green fondant so I'm going to roll out quite a thin disc of green fondant and I want it to be a little bit smaller than the eight inch cake and a little bit bigger than a six inch board but nice and round so I'm going to use my board as a bit of a template and cut around with a pizza cutter I'm not going to stick this down with anything because it really doesn't need it it's on top gravity will do its job and then I'm going to lay it down so it just slightly overlaps that outside layer of my grass skirt looking finish before I put my disc on I need something to hold the disc in place so I like to use milkshake straws or IKEA straws depending on where you live and I'm going to place those straight down four of them inside my cake I like the straws because they're really easy to remove but more importantly because they're really easy to cut with a pair of scissors sometimes if you're using wooden cake dowels or bamboo skewers they're actually really really tough to cut and actually I like to pull them out defraction so they're actually down inside the line of my little fondant desk looking good just to stick everything together I'm just going to put a little bit of ganache on top it's a great thing about stacking cake like this is you actually serve the top cake as a single cake then remove it remove the straws and serve the bottom cake as another separate cake so if you're not having a huge party you can kind of keep one layer and serve one layer pre refrigeration this layer would have been impossible for us to move around but post refrigeration it's actually quite firm so it's not going to press out of shape a little bit more ganache down onto my baseboard again just to hold everything in place and then I'm gonna lift my entire six inch cake layer off that tray and place it on top haha this looks adorable now because I don't want to see any of the joining here where you can kind of see the board in between I'm gonna roll a thin sausage or a long tube of my green fondant and just wrap that around in between the two layers to disguise the new joints for this bit you want to take the template I'll leave a link to it down below and I've just cut out the center of it so it makes almost like a stencil just use an exact or a Stanley knife to do that I'm using a little bit of brown powdered food coloring which you can get from specialty cake stores I also thought you could probably use one of those food coloring sprays in like a gold or a brown maybe but I'm just gonna dab it onto my little stencil and because my buttercream is nice and firm and those graham crackers have been pushed on nice and firmly they're not being removed we're just getting like kind of the faint outline almost like a tattoo pattern something like this very cool and just like that we've created our very own stencil I love this effect and I think it looks just like Dwayne the rock Johnson's tattoos kind of like his tattoos in the movie now there's next parts up to you but I always feel like when you can extend the size of your cake by utilizing the cake boards or the cake serving trays it just makes it look bigger and all much more impressive so I'm going to use a secondary cake board to create some ocean because most of B'Elanna takes place on or around the ocean I've got two different shades of blue buttercream and I'm kind of going to swirl the two of them together but first I'll put down a smear the technical term and we'll put our cake on that's going to hold everything together and a lot of the time I'll actually reuse these cake boards so once I'm done with it I'll wash it off and then I'll use it for another cake nothing is wasted you can hand spread this if you want but I'm going to place two different colors into a single piping bag with no piping tip so my dark blue is roughly in one side make a little opening and then my light blue goes in on the other it's going to give us a two-tone effect without many fancy two-toned piping tips snip off a generous tip and we've made our own piping tip I'm going to pipe that on in nice big round swells and I kind of wanted to look like the waters lapping in our base cake but having those two cake boards also makes it look a little bit like it's kind of raised up a little bit the tide is coming in and I'm literally just swirling this because I want it to look a bit like waves I sometimes like to add either ribbon or this is just like a stick on washi tape just to kind of finish off the edges of my board and now it's time to top so I've given you guys a template where you can mirror image both Maui and Moana all you need to do is cut around them and stick them onto toothpicks it's up to you if you want this to be a double sided cake but if you do then you can use the mirror image to make Maui the same on the back as you use on the front and same with Moana so no matter which way you turn the cake you're still going to get to see both of them all right on goes Maui and Moana straight in and try to stop their feet just at the sand if they go into the buttercream you'll notice that paper or whatever you've printed them all will absorb some of the butter from the buttercream so try to keep them just beat in the sand like so finally flowers these ones are sugar flowers it's up to you if you want to go to the trouble of making them you can also buy premade sugar flowers or you could use a little sprig of real flowers if you're going to use the real flowers I'm going to show you a really fun technique for adding them to the cake so they never actually touch the cake by using a paper straw so I'm going to push the straw down below my centreboard and then snip it off and it's essentially going to create like a little funnel or a little tunnel where my flower stems can go use a fatter straw if you're using more flowers so you've got a bit more space and in go my flowers straight into that little straw where they can be safe perfect our mallanna cake is done I love how this cake turned out whether you look at it from the back the front or besides this has got all of the elements to be an amazing Moana cake but if you're not a Moana fan you could switch out these little characters on top for something like a little printable Tiki to make this the ultimate Hawaiian birthday party cake so if you guys are ever wondering how to cut a tiered cake because we've made two individual cakes we can cut straight down our first one just what you guys see inside this I can't see box I know that this is gonna be by piece Jacob thinks there's a dinosaur inside hey how's that water alright here we go [Music] I got it right but I just gave you a whole piece of cake and you want to lick the water yeah oh we hope you guys enjoy today's video if you're not already subscribe to the channel make sure you do for new videos every week let us know what you loved about this cake and I think you two have both got blue lips and we saw um number please [Music] 
pretty proud of this one you guys think I should post a picture on Instagram hashtag my cupcake addiction hashtag instance we hash tag insta bakers hashtag Instagram [Music] welcome back to my cupcake addiction today I'm going to show you guys how to make a huge Instagram logo Browdy there's no secret that I love Instagram I'm on there all the time hosting and I have made Instagram candy bars before I'll leave a link to that to go down below I've also made an Instagram cake about three and a half minutes before Instagram change their logo so with new logos comes new desserts to make your giant Instagram brownie you're of course going to need some brownie so I'm using a double batch of my basic brownie mix that's anything but basic I'll link to that full recipe down below or you can cheat a little here in your store-bought I faced mine in one large tray but again you can change up the size you can do these minis you can make a massive ones you can do something in between depending on the trays that you've got at home you don't need terribly much other than the brownie for this recipe I've got some candy that I've separated into all different colored bowls I've got a little bit of white fondant and I've got just some chocolate and cream because in my opinion these chocolate brownies are always best with a super rich fudgy chocolate ganache let's get started first up you want to bake your brownie so I've lined my tray with a little bit of parchment and I'm baking my double batch for about 20 to 25 minutes until that brownie just up to get flaky on top once it's cooked cool it and then put it in is it the fridge or the freezer for like 40 minutes it's just going to make it a lot easier if you guys to cut if it's really cold or semi frozen well your brownie is chilling out you can make your ganache so I'm just going to combine my cream and my chocolate pop it into the microwave for 1 minute intervals until it's really nice and smooth after 1 minute you should be able to give it a little stir and I think there going to be one or two minutes just depending start so until it's really nice and smooth in my opinion the only frosting for a chocolate brownie is chocolate ganache is so incredibly rich alright my brownies out of the freezer and that's like pretty solid it's just going to make it a lot easier kind of harder to cut it but a lot easy to move it around so because I want to make this like a little fatter so it's like a double brandy I'm going to cut my brownie in half so yeah then I'm going to kind of guesstimate what a square is going to look like to get it out just kind of like lever up the sides a little bit and you'll see that by freezing it it's actually a lot easier for you to lift up and pull around as opposed to nice fresh brownie which would just crack and crumble the cracks a little bit it's fine we can just stick it back together with chocolaty deliciousness tah-dah you could not do that if this wasn't at least semi frozen I've got just a square platter you could also use like a square cake board so I'm just going to rest it down and then get my other half and we'll stack them up together then you want to trim them off so both of your brownie layers of the same size and round off those edges so they kind of look a bit more like the Instagram logo this is a terribly hard part of our job hmmm semi-frozen is so chewy you know once there's two layers of stacked and you've kind of curved those edges a little bit so it resembles the Instagram logo I just took a very small amount off the top edge so I didn't have like a high ridge now I'm going to separate my two brownies and we're going to cover them and fill them with ganache so one a little ganache in the middle o M G once it's stacked we'll cover the outside in ganache as well so you know should set out pretty quickly if your brain is still frozen which will actually be good because it'll stop it from like flopping over the sides of melting down the edges it'll essentially set as it goes on I'm covering the sides and then with any leftover ganache I'm just going to get a kind of level on top which will level the playing field for all of our candy this is incredibly out of fighting so from here we're going to put that off to the side and roll out our white fondant I'm going to sprinkle down a little powdered sugar or some corn starch or corn flour and roll out my fondant quite thick so a good template and I just found an Instagram image and then size it to about the size of my brownie it's going to depend on your brownie size how big you need your picture to be and then I cut around the inside white sections and use them as a template use a circle cutter for those little round dots and the round circles because it just makes life a bit easier and I actually ended up with a piping tip for my smallest circle now it's time to layer our candy when you're layering your candy think about different shades of different colors and in different sizes of candy this looks best when you've got light blues and dark blues and then light purples and dark purples and try to creep each color just slightly into the next one so a little of your pink goes into your purple a little of your orange goes into your yellows so it really fades nicely and doesn't just look like big blocks of color this part isn't hard but you do want to allow about an hour for your candy placement perfect candy placement is worth it every time when you make a new candy mosaic that's it we are done I'm going to turn this baby around you guys we can do brownie the Instagram logo I love how gorgeous this is I love how easy it was a little time-consuming if you don't already follow me on instagram make sure you do four cool ideas like this ahem

hey guys welcome back to a very festive my cupcake addiction today I'm excited to be teaming up with Hallmark gold crown to create a DIY interactive dessert inspired by one of their keepsake ornaments I got to choose an ornament and I choose the hallmark keepsake ornament the merriest house in town no no no because it's basically a super cute gingerbread cottage but also because it comes with this magic card which means it can light up on my Christmas tree and play music any of the hallmark keepsake ornaments I'm gonna leave a link down below you guys can visit the Hallmark gold crown store or you can order anything your heart desires and receive it in time for Christmas all you guys can always head into a Hallmark store and pick up their decorations there when I was getting inspired for what I was going to create today looking at my merriest house in town I decided to create little DIY gingerbread house stations for a gingerbread house party but because I don't have out with days to spend baking all of my gingerbread I'm gonna show you how to make your little DIY gingerbread houses using nothing but graham crackers white chocolate and a bit of candy actually a lot of candy let's get started first up graham crackers if you can't get these where you are they're basically a long square cookie that snaps really easily you have a couple of options I've done similar versions to these in my cookbook with thin blocks of chocolate which also work you're not in a hot climate for summer or you can use something like at my screen wafer which are really easy to cut you want to start by snapping all of your grams in half and I'm gonna make sure that my neatest flattest edges are gonna be the face of my house I've got a little bit of melted white chocolate so rather than making royal icing yeah I've just melted some white compound chocolate and that's good after that delicious glue take your graham crackers and you want the little perforation to be going up and down and because I want this to look like there's actually snow on the cottage I'm gonna dip just up to this first line of I guess little dots or pin pricks in the ground so that I get like a little bit of an overlap of white chocolate dip both sides of a 1/2 of a graham cracker and both sides of another and then onto a piece of parchment paper you just want to sort of line those up now I should mention here your back wall goes on the inside edge of your side wall so your side walls are on the outside and the back and front walls are tucked in the inside that should balance fairly well by yourself but you can support it for a couple of seconds if you need to and then I'm going to take another graham dip both sides and add it onto that back wall again on the outside so it matches the other wall and then I'm going to take my last piece of graham and I'm gonna use a sharp knife to very very gently cut out a small door you kind of have to do this just cut in a little at a time before popping it out otherwise you'll crack your cracker once my doors popped out I'm gonna dip both of the sides of my front piece of my gingerbread cottage and I'm going to slap them in in between those two sidewalls kind of looks a bit like a little bunker let that completely steps you can make 10 15 of these however many you like let the most set before you do the roofs it'll make it so much easier to attach them once your base is set you want to take your remaining 2 grams and we have the perforations going vertical up and down now we want them horizontal so side-to-side for the top because that's going to make sure that we get a really nice little overhang on all of the edges of our little cottage for this one and get a run a little bit of white chocolate just using a small spoon across the top edge of the two side walls of that cottage and then I'm going to dip just one edge of each of those roof tiles I'm going to rest them together and I'm just gonna support them for probably about two and a half minutes depending on how hot or cold it is where you live this is the most challenging difficult part it's just a waiting game it'll get tacky enough you can leave it and you'll notice it's ready when it stops sliding down as soon as you take your fingers away once my little cottage is a set I want a little bit more of that snow detail so I'm actually just gonna use that spoon again or you can use something like a popsicle stick just to add on a little bit more white chocolate around the edges the front edge of the bottom edge of that roof line I'm gonna drag down a little bit so I kind of get like that icicle effect and that's basically it part of all my gold crowns campaign this yeah is to care enough so there's little acts of kindness that can show another person that you actually care every year we buy the kids teaches little gifts to say thanks very much for teaching them a whole you know login giving me a break so this year I decided the kids are gonna decorate their very own DIY kind of gingerbread houses and we got a pop a gift card right inside so it's something that shows caring is something that shows their own creativity and it's a gift the teachers actually gonna love you could leave it like that but I'm gonna add just a little apple ring on the front that kind of looks a bit like a wreath this is like a 15-minute job max including setting time it is one of the easier for gingerbread houses you make so I'm gonna add those now to my display plate I started originally with all of my candy in this big muffin tin but I realized that's way too much candy for a three and a six year old so I've opted instead to put little containers onto a serving plate and give them their own little station on each candy station we have a finished candy house some Christmasy sprinkles some assorted Christmasy candy and candy canes and then a little tiny pop of melted white chocolate and a couple of either lollipop or popsicle sticks so if you want some decorating inspiration I shaped up that little apple ring and added a few little holly leaf and berry sprinkles with white chocolate and then I'm going to add a couple of candy canes to the top roof line and some tic tacs just running down the middle to kind of cover that scene to make my roof tiles I'm gonna lay on layers of Christmas themed candy corn and I'm gonna finish it off at the front with a little mini candy cane but this video is not about how I decorate my gingerbread house this video is about how everyone gets to get creative and uniquely decorate their own so let's see what the kids come up with I feel like it's gonna be amazing and I'm not allowed to step in and even help them plan creators all right boys get ready take your lollipop sticks dip them in some one chocolate decorate the deployed gingerbread houses turned out way better than I thought with a little handmade card a beautiful edible handmade gift box and a gift badges that teachers are gonna truly love I know that everyone's gonna know that my voice cared enough to go the extra mile this Christmas a huge thanks to Hallmark gold crown by teaming out with me on today's video if you want to get the Mario's task in town as well as hundreds of other amazing hallmark keepsake ornaments you can either visit a Hallmark store or you can head to the Hallmark Gold Crown store online which I'll leave a link to down below have an awesome day you guys thanks very much for watching like where are you person [Music] 
thank you what's better than pumpkin [Music] welcome back to my cupcake addiction today with still Halloween as you can tell by my spooky set and I'm going to show you guys how to make a super simple dessert that feeds a ton of people this is Halloween s'mores pie the things you'll need for your Halloween s'mores pie I'm gonna be using graham crackers and I've crushed mine to have a medium fine crush some cream dark chocolate butter and you want that melted I definitely wanted the little peeps ghost but I also opted for peeps pumpkins because they're adorable if you guys are not in the u.s. you may find it a little harder to access the peeps you can just use regular marshmallows but if you happen to get your hands on them they make for a super spooky pie I'm making mine in a 3 quart rectangle oven proof container today cuz it's gonna have just a little bit of time in the oven I've got my disgusting bat juice which is actually just melted butter and I'm just gonna pour that over my graham cracker crumbs and stir it through I'll leave all of your qualities and conversions on the my cupcake addiction comm website and I'll leave a link to that down below perfect once I'm happy that my graham crackers and butter are completely combined I'm gonna pour them into my large rectangular dish I've got quite a bit of base in this recipe because it is all about those graham crackers in any s'mores recipe feel free to adjust it if you using a smaller tin and I'm pressing those down through bars that are really nice and compacted try and get a little side edges nice and flat because this is a clear dish you're gonna see the lines through and I'd like to be as nice and even as possible this guy's gonna go up into the fridge while I organize my filling so that it starts to set up a little bit if you're feeling I'm gonna make a very simple ganache so cream goes over chocolate I've opted for whipping cream with dark chocolate but you can change this up for milk you could use semi-sweet you could even use white if you're so inclined that's gonna go into the microwave for 1 minute intervals I'm going to stir in between until it's perfectly smooth it should only be two minutes three at the most this is not your traditional smooth and flowing ganache because I know that we want to use it as a pie filling so if it does start off a little grainy or a little chunky keep stirring it it's the vigorous stirring that will actually bring it from looking grainy to almost looking a little greasy and then it'll come together as a beautiful smooth glossy but really thick ganache who needs the gym so after a little elbow grease you'll see that it actually comes together still smooth but nowhere near as followi as a regular ganache this it's like a filling ganache so you can bring your pie base out of the fridge and it should be at least starting to set which helps to avoid get too many crumbs in there then we pull try and pour it fairly evenly because even though your base is starting to set you really don't be dragging those crumbs around and you want it to hit those side walls of the dish about the same height so you end up with nice even layers when you look through the sides especially if you're using a clear container beautiful and now we line up our peeps super super simple I opted for a line of pumpkins then a line of ghosts then another line of pumpkins then another line of ghosts until I was done and I only picked out my best peeps I know I ate the uglier ones and I kept all of the pretty ones for my pie squish them up nice and close together we have made our pie now just before you want to serve that pop it off into the oven for about 15 minutes on a moderate temperature so 350 F or 175 to C watch it though because you just want your ghosts and your pumpkins to puff up slightly and Brown you don't want to make a huge big melted mess so keep your eye on it for reasons we will never know the ghost faces kind of melt away in the oven but the pumpkin faces remain whole I know it doesn't make any sense but I melt it down a little bit more of my dark chocolate popped it into a zip sealed bag and just used it as an opportunity to personalize all of my ghosts regular ghost faces mustache shoe ones angry ones cube ones pipe a few faces onto your Peaks so you've got the whole ghost or leave it is just the outline if you want something a little bit easier so that is how you make a very cute kind of scary but mainly just cute super simple Halloween inspired s'mores pie this is a great idea if you serve a bunch of people and have absolutely no leftovers with as little fuss as possible on the day of who wants some smaller Halloween pumpkin [Music] Holly I'm the one next door this was my ghost you Cougars Peter Peter Peter pumpkin eater good thanks very much for watching [Music] 
hey guys it's a lease and welcome back to my cupcake addiction you guys might notice something slightly different about my surroundings today we have a whole new kitchen the old kitchen is gone I moved house a little while ago and have just finished building this amazing studio kitchen I actually uploaded a vlog style video a couple of days ago of the kitchen tour and kind of a bit about the process but what started is 197 cartons is now this amazing kitchen and I'm so excited it's bright it's fun it's colorful and it's everything MCA alright so today's recipe we're going to be making no big cookies and cream tart so you guys might have seen my no-bake Toblerone tart you might have seen my no-bake chocolate raspberry tart and then we've also got the delicious new baked custard fruit tart today's another no-bake super easy 15 minutes knock it together stick it in the fridge everyone's going to love it because let's face it who doesn't like cookies and cream the things you're going to need for your cookies in cream tart I have a ton of cookies I'm going to leave the full recipe in the description box below but I've got one batch of cookies here that's going to be crushed for my base and then I've got some more large Oreos and some small mini Oreos that are going to be decorations for decorations I've also got little milk bottle lollies you're going to need some white chocolate some whipping cream and some butter alright let's get into it so the first thing that we're going to do is crush our Oreos if I can draw your attention for a second to my incredibly cute tiny brightly colored mini food processor I never really need it I just love it because it's super cute I don't think I'm gonna be able to crush enough Oreos at a time in this I may have to do it in batches but it's completely worth it because it's mini it's small but mighty I'm very impressed with this teeny tiny little food processor on this guy's I don't take the cream out of the Oreos because we know we're using it for a base I actually want the extra moisture in the mix it's more delicious but it also helps hold the mix on the base together a little bit more you want to mail your butter in the microwave for about 30 seconds till it's really nice and runny and then we're going to pour our melted butter over the top of those delicious crushed Oreos this is always the best part the crunchy delicious buttery cookie base so even though it looked like we had a ton of Oreos there you'll see that they kind of reduced so they shrink down a bit once the butter gets into them and soaks in you're looking for the consistency of kind of like wet sand or very wet dirt actually looks a bit like very wet dirt beautiful all right we can take our tin now I'm using a long one you could also use a round and you just want to scoop your mixture into the tin it's going to look like there's a ton but when we flatten it down it will actually be perfect all right this is where you get to get kind of messy so I'm just going to squish it and as I squishing I'm pushing that mixture all the way up so that it's coming over the top of the sides so that it's firmly compacted against those sides the sides are actually more important than the base or the middle and they need to be really really nice and tightly packed make sure that it's super compacted so really tight on that base I like to use a jar or the bottom of a cup or a mug just to really press it down and then you want to take a knife when you use your knife you want to be cutting away from the pan so the cookie actually falls on the outside this will save you breaking any of the wall but it also give you a really nice neat top all right so that one goes off into the fridge for no exact time just until we're ready to put our filling in so off into the fridge it goes well that guy's chilling out we can make our filling so I'm going to pour my whipping cream over my white chocolate it's essentially like the milk component of our milk and cookies tart and then that goes into the microwave I'm going to put it in just on 30-second intervals until that chocolate is completely melted stirring in between each 30-second interval all right so this is what we're looking for you've got like a really nice smooth river of white chocolate and cream to be a little yellow don't worry about that when it sets up it sets white again that's just the cocoa butters and things in the melted white chocolate so I've taken about 10 of my Oreos and broken them roughly in half the rest in my smaller bowl I'm going to break into like kind of little chunks so about that big and they're going straight into this mixture there the cookies in the cream for the cookies and cream we got cookies inside we got cookies on top we got cookies on the bottom ultimate cookie tart I didn't crush these because they're gonna look so much cuter as big chunks of cookie in there if I crush them and stirred them through they would really just look kind of like brown flecks of dirt not as attractive and again I'm gonna leave the recipe down below but if you want more cookies you use more cookies if you want less cookies you can take this down a bit this is as much or as little cookie as you guys want alright perfect so that's kind of stirred through it's looking pretty good now we got to get our top base out of the fridge whenever you're making a no-bake tart also you want to consider you need to have a removable base in it because no bake bases are really fragile so you won't be able to get it out of the pan if you don't have one of those little pop-up kind of removable bases in goes our delicious cookies and cream filling even distribution of cookies we don't want anyone getting ripped off with no cookies in there cookies and cream slice just fill your tart to the very rim or just slightly below the very rim you can see I've got a teeny tiny bit left over that can go off into a cup and refrigerate and that can be for me for later but don't overfill that because we don't want to in that mixture going over the sides and it's going to depend on how many cookies you put in there and how thick your cookie base is how much you compact it so you might have a little too much you certainly don't want to have not enough I'm going to decorate mine with little mini Oreos all over it because they're cute and they kind of look a little bit like Oreo polka dots I'm going to separate them out with some of my milk bottles so with my little dots in place I kind of want those little milk bottles propped up a little bit this is where your broken Oreos come in just take small pieces and if you need to just place them underneath slightly under some of your little milk bottles just to help prop them up so they're kind of half standing looking like they're balancing on the cookies kind of three-dimensional that is our cookies and cream no baked tart you want to put that in the fridge for three hours before you cut and serve when you want to pull it out of the tin once refrigerated all you need to do is grasp the two ends while pressing up with my fingers underneath in that removable base be very delicate with it and I don't recommend taking it off the removable base I would cut it and serve it still on that removable base it just gives it a bit of extra support if you use a really hot knife to cut you'll get beautiful clean lines and you'll see layers of cookie base cookie chunks and beautiful white ganache without delicious toppings on top I hope you guys have enjoyed today's know baked tart I love desserts you can whip up in 15 minutes stick them in the fridge forget about them and serve them when people come around have an awesome day and thanks very much for tuning in to my cupcake addiction 
hey guys it's a lease and welcome back to my cupcake addiction if you follow my channel you'll know that I'm slightly obsessed with Kit Kats I've met everything from giant caramel KitKat junkies all the way through to Kit Kat Christmas tree forests and pretty much everything in between well the team over at Kit Kat Australia noticed just how much I love a KitKat so they've sent me a challenge today to come up with a recipe that celebrates their new range of world flavors so they've bought out a salted caramel world amazing and a coconut world which is my husband's favorite I'm going to show you guys how to make freak shakes today but not just any freak shakes Kit Kat freak shakes these guys are over the top they're decadent they're delicious and I'm going to show you three different flavors salted caramel chopped coconut and chopped mint let's give it a whirl the things you're going to need for your salted caramel freak chic I've got some caramel choose my salted caramel Kit Kat of course I've got 1/4 cup of caramel topping or caramel ice cream syrup a doughnut and then some pretzels in both large and small for make coconut free shake I've got some whipping cream a waffle cone a coconut ruff which is like a chocolate disc that's stuffed full of coconut they're amazing and I've also got some toasted coconut flakes I'm also going to be using a little bit of coconut cream and of course my Kit Kat coconut well for my mint today I'm going to be using my chopped mint world Kit Kats and then I've also got two chocolate mint candy bars I've got a chocolate arrow and then a peppermint crisp which is like covered in chocolate and when you smash it up inside it's kind of got really hard peppermint crunchy stuff inside I've also got two peppermint patties you could substitute those for chocolate cookies if you needed to I've got a little bit of green food coloring and I've got a circle cutter some white chocolate some milk chocolate and some dark chocolate of course you're going to need milk and ice cream my ice creams in the freezer and I have plain vanilla ice cream for both my coconut and my caramel and then I have chopped mint chip ice cream for my mint well some whole milk and I'm serving mine today in mason jars with different colored straws cuz you got to decorate let's get started we're going to start with salted caramel so I've melted my white chocolate and then I'm going to take my caramel syrup on my caramel topping and pour it over those jersey caramels gonna pull one out I knew that for deck raishin the reason that I'm doing this is because I want something thicker than a syrup but not quite as thick as just a straight-out melted caramel and I don't want you guys to have to spend all of your time making your own salted caramel this one's going off into the microwave 30-second intervals it's going to take no more than about a minute and then I'm going to stir and stir until I've got basically a really thick delicious caramel syrup all right my caramels looking amazing fair warning this is going to be like thermonuclear hot so don't put your fingers in it make sure that you're handling with care I'm going to set it off to the side and just let it cool a little bit and then I'm gonna take my salted caramel KitKat and check that out it's such a beautiful pattern I love the world that goes through it it kind of reminds me of a tiger print I'm going to take a sharp knife and I'm going to cut whenever I cut a KitKat I try to cut it straight down in one good movement because that stops it from cracking at different ends or edges and then I'm going to cut each half in half again and lining them up I'm going to slice them apart because I want them to be neat if you just break them then they're kind of going to be a little jagged perfect all of my little pieces of caramel world KitKat I'm gonna take one of my large pretzels that I wanted to hang over the side of the jar which means I need to remove just this little portion here I find us to read it edge knife works best here because you can kind of soar through it we want those nice and neat that's just gonna hang out on the side there so you want to make sure that it fits nicely looking perfect set it off to the side removing my straws now and this part can actually be done in advance I actually like to sort of prepare the jars or the glasses and then make the shake so that they're going in nice and cold now that my caramels had a little bit of time to cool I'm just gonna place a couple of teaspoons about four or so on the inside of my mason jar and just let it luxuriously kind of dribble down the sides mason jars are great for this because the caramel so hot then only made out of tempered glass which means they're not going to break now this is where I get deliciously messy I'm going to take my mason jar turn it upside down and then I'm going to turn it around so that caramel can start to drip down the sides the caramel is essentially what's going to stick on a couple of our things like our large pretzel but I'm also going to use a bit of white chocolate to attach those KitKat pieces so you just want to knock a little bit of the caramel off just around this top edge you could let it dribble down the side and then I'm going to take my little portions of KitKat and so that I've got the cut side up I'm going to just dip in the white chocolate and stick on the front you might want to support them for a second because that chocolates still nice and melted and our caramels still dribbling so if they might want to slide down that caramel slide a little bit so now I'm going to take my donor and you can either make your own or you can cheat and use store-bought and I'm just going to dunk it into my caramel I want that nice and coated lift it up look at that that is epic this guy is going to get threaded onto a straw so I'm going to slide the straw through while I've kind of got it hanging out there and then on it goes hanging off the side of our glass kind of like it to be hanging over a little bit and I don't mind if that drips because I think the droopiness of this is part of what makes it so incredibly indulgent and then you want to give your donuts to really light sprinkling of sea salt for the salted part - our salted caramel my caramels cool it doesn't need to be completely cold but if it's too hot it's just not going to set on your chocolate fast enough so I'm going to take my white chocolate now and pour it onto a tray lined with a bit of parchment and then with the back of the spoon I'm just going to kind of spread it out a little bit give it a little tap off so it gets nice and flat and then I'm gonna take my caramel and I'm just gonna like dollop it on you can dollop it you can streak it it doesn't really matter because we're gonna Marble this anyway I'm gonna take the back of a skewer or just a sharp knife the point of a knife and I'm just going back and forth kind of like a figure eight just marbling through that caramel on that chocolate be careful how much of the caramel you put on because the white chocolate is going to set but that caramel is actually not so you sort of want to blend the two together and have chunks of caramel in there but enough white chocolate to hold everything together taking some of my pretzels now and I'm just going to place a few of them onto my back and then that one can just be set off to the side we're actually going to cut this into a shape before it set so don't refrigerate it in the fridge because we're gonna keep our eye on it we want it to still be a little bit flexible when we cut it now to top my glass which is already looking completely deliciously indulgent I'm gonna take one of my caramels and I'm just gonna chop it up into little chunks you should still have a little bit of carom around the top of your glass so I'm just going to edge it with some little tiny chunks of caramel you can't have too much caramel in a salted caramel milkshake so my little salted caramel bark is not quite set it's kind of getting there it's all firm around the edges but it's still soft enough I'm going to pick it up and it should still be a little bit flexible pop it onto my board and I'm going to chop like a large triangle shape trying to sort of go through and around my little pretzels the best part about this there's always leftovers of this bark perfect now that one can go off into the fridge to set so while our chocolate shark's setting it's time to make our milkshake that's only going to take a couple of minutes to set so we've got time to do all this add it in and then our first freak shake is going to be ready so I'm going to add a generous amount of ice cream you guys can adjust this depending on how thick or how thin you want your milkshake to be but I want mine to be a super thick frig shake I'm gonna add in just a tiny bit of milk just to loosen it up I think I always make the mistake of adding too much milk and not having it thick enough but I want this super thick and it goes once it's kind of mostly mixed I'm gonna add in the rest of my caramel mixture now finally because this is a KitKat freak shake I'm going to take another four finger of the salted caramel and I'm gonna put one finger in my little donut there maybe on a bit of an angle and then I'm going to take my other three Kit Kat fingers and I also had a couple of just little off cups and I'm gonna add them into my milkshake just break them up and on it goes perfect so I have a blitzed up my salted caramel KitKat and my caramel my ice cream on my milk I'm just gonna grab my chocolate shot and then we're going to be done the hardest part about your chocolate shot it's actually going to be fitting it in so I'm just going to move my doughnut to the front and I've got to get milkshake in here at some point so I'm gonna do milkshake first and then chard I'm gonna keep that just a little bit from the top knowing that my chard needs a little bit of room to go in and I don't want it to overflow too much this is the first of its kind a salted caramel will freak shake we've got the chocolate shards the pretzels the massive pretzel the donut the Kit Kat this smoothie the caramel there is so much going on in here I'm definitely I need someone to help you finish it but because I made it I definitely get first tip and it's amazing it's a milkshake that literally tastes like Kit Kats you've seen salted caramel but you need to see them all before you choose your favorites next up is going to be choc coconut well so I'm gonna start this off again with a shard and I'm just going to put milk chocolate onto my parchment paper lined baking tray spread it around using the back of a spoon I'm gonna give it a really solid tap on the bench and then on goes kind of some blobs of our melted white chocolate using my skewer I'm just gonna do my little figure eights all over to make a sort of chop coconutty looking world and then I'm gonna top with some of my toasted coconut flakes not too many perfect now that's going to sit off to the side and we're going to cut that before it completely sets we can just forget about it for a few minutes now my coconut world chocolate block and again it's got that beautiful pattern so the other one I was kind of feeling tiger this one's a little bit zebra they're all a little bit wild I love how they look I'm going to take my coconut well and I'm going to cut off three fingers and then another three so with one of my lots of three fingers I just want to cut out the middle finger this takes a little bit of precision and care because you don't want to break off the two others so just intake the tip of my sharp knife and I'm really just going to sort of slice it down just going a little bit each time so I can gradually cut a nice little groove into that chocolate and then when I feel that it's given on either side I'm just going to stab straight down kind of making like I'd like a little divot or a little gap because that's actually going to go on the side of my glass so for the rim around the cup we're going to do the same as we did with the salted caramel cut in half and then in half again taking my mason jar of my white chocolate now and I'm going to dip that in I'm gonna kind of swirl it around and flip it you can give it a couple of taps just to start that chocolate kind of dripping its way down now working quite quickly before your chocolate sets we're going to just a fix all of our little pieces of KitKat all the way around just supporting them as it sets so they don't slide down now before I finish putting the Kit Kats on while that chocolates still wet I've taken my coconut rough and I've just done the same thing that I do with my Kit Kat so just use a sharp knife to soar through and make almost like a little cup hanging section so I can add it to the front of my mason jar straight on to that melted white chocolate and then I'm going to take my three fingers of coconut well Kit Kat and a little bit more white chocolate just to glue it into place nicely I'll put the white chocolate straight there in the middle and on it goes behind my coconut ruff now finally just to finish off my top edge I'm just gonna spoon kind of messily because freek shakes can be totally messy spoon a little bit of this white chocolate just around that top rim because our other white chocolate is going to have already started to set and then on goes a little bit of my flaked coconut just to add a bit of texture in go a couple of straws and it's time to check on our little piece of coconut chocolate bark so our coconut chocolate bark is starting to set but it's still nice and kind of soft I haven't set that in the fridge and now I'm just going to cut another little triangle kind of like I did with my salted caramel cuz I don't have the pretzels here it actually slices through really nice and easily and I want it to be a really nice long triangle off into the fridge with that one I'm all that one setting we can make the coconut milkshake portion while your shards are chilling out you can take your cream and I am just going to whip that so it's once my creams 90% of the way whipped I'm just gonna add in just a very small amount just a hint of my coconut cream the rest of its going to go into the actual milkshake but I kind of want to give that cream that slight hint of coconut perfect now I'm going to put that cream into a piping bag with a star piping tip attached now the other thing I want to do before I make the milkshake is I'm just going to turn my waffle cone into a miniature waffle cone I couldn't find miniature waffle cones at the store so I'm taking matters into my own hands with my serrated edge knife and I'm just going to carve perfection I now have an improvised mini waffle cone that's going to sit on top of my freak Shack so I'm going to take copious amounts of delicious vanilla ice cream I'm going to add in my little bit of coconut cream so just the remainders of that quarter of a cup it's pretty much all of a quarter of a cup and then just a little milk to loosen off finally I'm gonna add in my three more fingers of KitKat kind of crushed up a little bit let's whiz it all up perfect let's grab our cooled shards and we'll be ready to assemble you should just be able to break those off your little sheet of parchment and we have our nice long shard again I'm going to put the milkshake in first because otherwise I'm just not going to have any room to put it in I'm only going to fill that just to the bottom of where my Kit Kats come to so that I've got room for my shards and then I'm also going to top it with some whipped cream and then my whipped cream so my whipped cream I want to make like a mound of whipped cream and this is designed to look like an ice cream cone has been dropped on top like so on goes my ice cream cone and then I've just got to find a room for my straws that is free chick number two our Kit Kat coconut well freak shake so we've got a little kind of dropped ice cream our toasted coconut flakes all of that coconut cut around the outside edge our shards our coconut rough Isle coconut KitKat there is a whole lot going on in here you'll notice I went with two straws because I'm definitely going to have to share our third and final flavor is going to be choc mint with our chopped mint Worrell so the first thing to do is smash out my peppermint crisp I'm doing it in its packet so I don't send peppermint crisps playing everywhere now we can open that up and put it into a little Bowl perfect you can see all my little sort of shards or crystals of that really nice crystallized peppermint now I'm also gonna take my block and I'm gonna cut off three fingers cut in half and then in half again with this guy I'm going to cut kind of like a long row I want this to go in as the KitKat portion of the decoration on the top you might need a couple of goes at this because it does tend to break we're cutting a very long piece but remember if you can cut straight down it's generally the best way to get through perfect alright my first little road broke but my second road is perfect so you're looking something like that three rows disappear and this is almost like a little stairway to heaven a little chopped mint stairway to heaven now you can take some of your other little pieces here and just chop them into rough sort of chunks and I particularly like the green bits from on top so to separate that from some of those bottom pieces and then finally I'm going to take my this is an arrow chocolate bar so inside it's kind of got like bubbles and things of little mint but really what I want to expose is that really lovely green so that when I put that on my chocolate bark I've got kind of these little flecks of extra green through chopped that up roughly we're good to go first of all you want to ring your mason jar so again into my melted dark chocolate this time lift and straight away turn and then we can give it a few taps that's what I call a decorated mason jar now you just want to line the edges with your little pieces of KitKat again just supporting them because I want to slide just a little bit when you first put them all on now that my little lid area is rimmed I'm just going to poke through here and I'm just going to pull out just a little crunchy shiny kind of peppermint tea bits I don't want to get all that chocolate in there we got enough chocolate going on in this I just want those green accents just around the top and they should stick to that still wet dark chocolate all right we can set that off to the side the jar is ready to go and then I'm going to take just a little bit of my green food colorings you want an oil-based or a candy coloring or even a powdered and I'm just going to tint my white chocolate green down goes my dark chocolate onto a tray lined with a bit of parchment paper and spread it out with a spoon and then on go just some generous blobs of our green all over and then I'm just going to use a skewer just to swirl it around all my little figure eights giving me that beautiful mint world bark to match my mint world Kit Kat then I'm just going to add some little chunks of my a green and brown peppermint candy my KitKat's my arrow and some of that little sprinkled over peppermint crisper that's leftover because we don't want to waste it so this one again needs to set at room temperature so that I can cut it before it's completely set I'm going to leave that to the side have a little tidy up and then we're going to get cracking on the rest of this freak shake so again I'm going to use my really sharp knife on my not quite set peppermint bark and I'm just going to slice along through my bits of KitKat and make another nice long chocolate shard or two or three those one's going into the fridge to completely firm up and then we're going to make our shake I'm using a choc mint or a mint chip ice cream and I've gone with one that's really nice and green in color so before I start scooping I'm going to take a circle cutter I'm going to push it straight down and I'm going to use a knife underneath it to just sort of dig down into that ice cream and just force that disk of ice cream out something a little bit like that my peppermint patties these are going to make and over-the-top Ice Cream Sandwich so I'm going to place my core of ice cream in between two peppermint patties and then I'm going to sandwich the two of them together I'm going to put this one back off into the freezer so that it stays all frozen and the little bits that are melting top and bottom actually stick everything together let's make a shake so I've got just my chocolate ice cream I'm going to break up my remaining pieces of mint world Kit Kat because it's a KitKat shake and then just a little bit of milk just to loosen things up again I want mine really thick and I want it really green too so I don't put in too much milk all right our mint shake is ready so I'm going to put the shake in first with just my straws and then I'm going to take my set chocolate mint chard and place that it and then my little bit of chocolate KitKat so I'm actually going to take a little bit of just melted chocolate and just sort of pop it on the side of my mason jar about here because that's just going to help to keep this in place but it's essentially going to be supported like on the straws and also on the mint shard alright so you can top that one up just a little bit because we don't need to leave as much space on top and then I'm going to grab my ice-cream sandwich and that's going to finish this baby off peppermint pattie ice cream sandwich on top of your Kit Kat freak chic well of course so on goes my peppermint patty ice cream sandwich and he's just going to have to find a spot in there that works I've got two straws in there but I am definitely going to need a third this one is going to need some serious sharing so there you've got your chopped mint World Kit Kat freak shake a big thanks to kick at Australia for teaming up with me

hey guys it's Elise and welcome back to my cupcake addiction today we're going to be combining two delicious things strawberry shortcake and cheesecake to make the ultimate fresh light strawberry shortcake no baked cheesecake the things you're going to need to make your cheesecake I'm starting with some shortbread biscuits so these are buttery and delicious store-bought shortbread biscuits they're gonna make the shortcake portion of our Strawberry Shortcake cheesecake I've got some whipping cream some softened cream cheese and I've got a packet of strawberry either jelly or jello crystals some fresh red ripe and delicious strawberries of course I'm making mine today in a 10 inch wide by about two two and a quarter inch high removable base tart pan I've also got some butter which I'm going to melt and some white chocolate I'll leave all of your quantities and conversions on the my cupcake addiction comm website so check that out if you want to print this recipe off and if you're going to recreate this delicious recipe at home so the first thing you want to do is we're gonna melt our butter I'm just gonna pop it in the microwave for 30 seconds and just keep melting that until it's completely done so while that one's melting I'm going to take my food processor my mini food processor and just blend up my shortbread cookies I want these super nice and fine Crump so if you don't have a food processor you're really gonna have to get your elbows into this to get them ground up really really nice and fun like fine fat that's about the nice fine crumb that you're looking for so it's super soft and super light that's going to give us a really nice firm and deliciously buttery base all right with your cookie crumbs all nice and finely blitzed if you want to tip in all of your butter and then you're just going to stir that around until it resembles it should look like quite wets and you know it's done when you can pick it up and kind of make an imprint of it and the imprint stays where it is all right now for the good bits we're gonna spread it all into our removable base tart pan it always looks like a lot of base but I love a lot of base and it does squish down a lot so you want to get in there and really compact it nicely as I'm compacting I'm also kind of forcing it up the sides of the pan because this one's quite deep we're actually a little more base so that it can get all the way up to our top edge which gives us a really nice look for a fin product once you happy that that's pretty nicely compacted you just want to press it down with the base of a glass or a jar to make sure it's really nice and firm on the bottom and on the sides and then take a sharp knife and you just want to slice away from the pan towards the outside and just knock off any of those kind of Ridge e edges we want that really nice and smooth perfect now that one that can go off into the fridge until our cheesecakes ready to go in now it's time to make our cheesecake batter so you want to grab your white chocolate your cream and your cream cheese I'm not going to put any sugar in this cheesecake mix because I've got the white chocolate and that's kind of sweet and then the strawberries are the jello and everything so we don't need as much sweetness in the actual cheesecake itself so I'm going to take my white chocolate and I've got like 500 mils of cream I'm just going to pour just a little bit over the top so there's a little bit of something in there to melt it with and then I'm going to pop that off into the microwave on 30-second intervals stirring in between as I go until it's really nice and smooth now we're gonna put our cream cheese into one bowl and we're gonna whip that until it's super nice and soft and creamy and the cream goes into another bowl and we're going to whip that until soft peaks form when I talk about soft peaks in cream this is what you're looking for so as you actually lift it up you can see it's lighter and it's fluffier but it does fall really easily off the spatula and it leaves marks but they kind of collapse after a little while so it's certainly not stiff peaks alright so your cream cheese should be beautiful and smooth and you can now should be silky and free of any lumps now you want to pour your white ganache straight in over your cream cheese mixture I'm doing this because I don't want the hot white chocolate going into my cream I'm going to let the cream cheese cool it down a little bit first mix those together until they're really well combined alright this is looking and smelling heavenly I'm just going to put in my cream into the cream cheese mixture and I'm going to fold it through about half at a time folding through in big loose sweeping motions and that's going to add air and a little bit of stability to our cheesecake and it's also going to make it beautiful and creamy and soft and fluffy and delicious in goes the rest so you can remove your base from the fridge and then we're just going to spoon that cheesecake mixture straight in the good thing about refrigerating that tart shell initially is it sort of holds it all together a little bit so that as you're spreading this around you're not dragging crumbs from the wall all the way through your nice white cheesecake I'm just going to smooth it off as best as I can with my spatula but again being careful not to work that cream too hard and then that's going to go back off into the fridge so it can start to set before we put on all of our strawberries and jelly and decorations now I like to grab a couple of bowls for this part because I kind of want to separate my strawberries I kind of want to make my larger ones in One Bowl and then my smaller ones in the other slicing off as little as you can possibly get away with of your greenery and popping them to the side big strawberries in One Bowl small strawberries in the other I'm also not going to wash these strawberries if you like you can wipe them off but I don't wash the strawberries because as soon as you wash berries they start to rot so if you're particularly going to serve this not until the next day or even two days later washing those strawberries is going to make them spoil a lot faster alright all of our strawberries are good to go and now it's time to make up your jelly so I'm just going to make it up as per manufacturer's directions mine tells me to do a cup of boiling water stir until dissolved and then do a cup of cold then if you've got really cold water or even a couple of cubes of ice pop that in at this point because you want that to cool down really rapidly all right I'm gonna put my jelly into the fridge because by the time with strawberries are done on that top I'm gonna want this jelly to be cool cannot be any hotter than room temperature or else it's gonna melt our cheesecake underneath switch out your jelly for your cheesecake and it should be just starting to foam up it's only been in there for about 15 minutes or so and now I'm going to line up strawberries right up against that outside edge and I'm going to start with the biggest fattest ones that I can find so they're really large around the outside edge and they get smaller as we get to the middle the tart is looking gorgeous the jelly is cold but not set so you cannot walk away from this you can't leave it in the fridge because otherwise it will set and then it's not going to work either it has to be chilled and not said it's a fine line you got about a 10 minute window I'm going to use a paper cup or a plastic cup so that I can distribute this jelly nice and evenly so I'm just going to pour that in all around my strawberries and having this little cut means that I can really distribute it nicely with disturbing the cheesecake underneath you may not use all of the jelly it really depends on how tall your tart pan is how big your strawberries were but what you want to do is you want to mostly cover them and have a nice little red pool that they're swimming in and then I'm actually going to brush the very tops of them in a little bit of the remaining jelly this will just add like a little bit of a shine and a gloss and it'll also help to protect the strawberries if you've got a little jelly left and you've still got room in your tart pan you can just leave that refrigerate these for half an hour and then give them another coat so first go to jelly set so then you get another nice lovely shiny coat of jelly on top that one's going to go off into the fridge for three hours so a minimum of three hours longer if you have it so that it's really nice and firm to take your tart out of its pan I found it easiest with these deep-dish tart pans to actually sit it on a bowl that's slightly smaller than the size of the removable base if it's giving you any resistance rather than forcing it I prefer to take a hairdryer and just gently keep the outside edges and then give it another try you'll find it just melts that butter just enough to allow your tart to release I don't recommend taking the Cheesecake off the removable base if you want to put it on a cake stand or a serving plate put the whole base down and then serve it still on that removable base no big cheesecakes aren't quite as strong as the baked ones and you don't want to risk breaking any of that no baked crust hope you guys have enjoyed today's strawberry shortcake no baked cheesecake this is amazing it's great for summer it's great for winter it's great for autumn and spring it's pretty much a year-round winner if

okay hi guys well hi guys hi guys if you were planning which one would you be I would be that burner Venus you'd be Venus yes I would see this is the second clue that run with the Venus flytrap when you like the Venus no yeah yeah yeah okay that's why I like that sure that one welcome back to my cupcake addiction today we are making galaxy cake pops galaxy has been on trend for a while it is currently everywhere and I thought let's capitalize on the galaxy trade by making these adorable galaxy themed cake pops but because we know there's more to the galaxy than just black sky and beautiful stars we're also going to be crafting some planet cake pops to match the things that you're going to need to make your galaxy cake pops our cake pop sticks you'll need some toothpicks for detail work you'll need some colors either oil-based or powder base to color our chocolates some paintbrushes make them nice and fine some luster dust these are beautiful shimmery shiny does you'll need cookie cutters and I'll leave dimensions in the description box below white chocolate some ganache vodka or you can use lemon extract you'll need cake of course I've gone with chocolate some candy melts in black and I'm using a styrofoam or a polystyrene block and I've got some parchment paper plain white it's fine when it comes to star but in my opinion it could always be just a little bit cuter now I'm going to use my cake pop recipe I like to use chocolate cake and ganache because it's a delicious combination you've probably seen my recipe before I will link to it down below or you can grab it in then you may cupcake addiction cookbook which is available for pre-order now first up we're going to start by crumbling our cake so really I mean you can use a processor if you want but the cakes pretty soft I like to do this by hand it's kind of letting your inner child arts and crafts class come out making a mud pie without the mud I feel like kids would be a lot more inclined to remember their planets if they weren't allowed to eat one until they could tell you three facts about it Dali tell me three facts about Uranus this is for the wind okay um Uranus is the seventh from the Sun and it's tilted on its side north and it takes 84 earth years you get yourself a cake pop grab a Uranus cake pop what do you think good so I'm going to take my ganache now and I'm going to pour it over my mix I like to do this about half at a time and that just stops it from making this huge big chunk of ganache in the middle with dry cake around the outside edge just helps it to distribute a little bit more evenly throughout your cake mix if you didn't go to the gym this morning this is all the workout you need there's the mixing there's the rolling limit the eating so I've got a little bit of parchment just sitting on a plate and we're going to roll some of our cake pop balls you kind of have to do this by hand it's the only way to do it try to keep them all to about an inch diameter and no bigger you can do smaller but even if you feel like you might want to eat a little bit more of the cake pop mix if you make them too big they'll fall off the sticks once you've got them all rolled you can pop them off into the fridge for about 20 minutes or so and then we can measure their super round before we insert our pop sticks might have gone a little bit rogue and you can see they're rolling all over the place this is your opportunity to make them really nice and round we don't want to have wonky planets so now they're chilled are a lot easier to work with and I'm just rolling them in between my two hands to make sure that I'm super happy with the roundness before I go putting it any sticks or doing any of my dipping I mean they don't have to be perfect but if they are no one's going to complain if you do get a little bit tired of them rolling around you can either take something like a cupcake case or you can use just an empty cake pop mould just to set them in once they're super round they're not going to sit on a little flat bottom because they're not going to have one so you might find they go a little rogue and start doing their own thing once they're all rolled you're going to start inserting your little sticks so I've got them all nice and supported but they're also quite chilled which means they're not going to go too far out of shape I still like to put them in the palm of my hand because it gives them a nice little support system I'm going to dip my cake pop stick into white chocolate or white candy milk or black or whatever color you like and I'm just going to pop it in so it's about halfway down my cake pop ball twist when you go in it can make it a little bit easier to insert in fact in my little pop stand just to make sure they don't go anywhere I don't want any of my planets coming loose from our solar system look what happened to Pluto don't put away your white chocolate yet we're going to make some rings for some of our planets after a little research we know that four of our planets have rings I'm going to be making rings for both Saturn and I think your rhiness today I'm going to pour some of my white chocolate straight down into my parchment just on one half YUM and then I'm going to spread it out with an offset spatula if you have any little lumps air bubbles or bumps in your chocolate here leave them they're going to make great texture in our rings melt your chocolate in your candy melts and sometimes candy melts can be a little bit thick so I've got a video that shows you guys how to best melt and also some tips on how to thin it your candy melts and your chocolate to make the best cake pop dipping consistency so you want to take your pops and these guys should be chilled but not super cold so don't go leaving them in the fridge for hours because that's going to cause your chocolate to crack my little seam has set at where I've joined it to the stick and I'm going to dip down out into my black candy melts make sure I cover up that little white seal completely and then I'm going to lift and as I lift I'm actually creating my own kind of drag just by it looks like I'm redoing but I'm actually dragging off any excess chocolate and then I'm going to hold it off to the side I'm going to tap my wrist gently so that I don't put too much pressure on the outside of the pot turn the pop as you're tapping so that you get an even distribution of chocolate because we know that these guys are planets and they should be quite round you want to take your finger and just gently just take off any of that black candy melt that's come onto your lollipop stick to make it as round as possible and then we can pop it into our star oblak to set with your star oblak it's sometimes helpful if you start with a little guide hole poked in by a toothpick just to kind of get the block started we're nearly done no we're not we've still got a whole solar system to guys I'm going to get to you three different planets and you're gonna repeat them after me okay okay uh Jupiter Mars is that good mom do a couple of those black ones cuz this is after all all about the galaxies trone once your galaxies are done it's time to start doing our planets but with the planets you kind of want to think about this in a way that's going to make sense for the coloring so I'm going to start with my blue planets one's going to be earth and one's going to be Uranus Uranus that I wanted to be completely blue I kind of wanted to be streaky so here's a fun trick and it's a great technique just to know I'm going to take a little bit of my blue and this is an oil based food coloring I'm going to swirl it through one of my lots of white just like that so I've kind of got like a bit of a blue a white marble effect and then I'm going to take just a little bit more using the other end of my toothpick so I've got some darker swirls and also some lighter spoils of that blue now the magic happens so you take your cake pop and you're going to dip it straight down into the center of our blue marble deliciousness let it come up and cover that seal and then pull it off look at that now that's really nice if you wanted it to be streaked that way but we want our planet to streak kind of sideways just like it would in the solar system in our cake pop solar system so I'm going to continue turning and tapping and as I do that you'll see my little streaks marbled around nicely and kind of create that planetary look to our cake pop just neaten up the face of my planet so that it's super nice and round and this one is going to be Uranus translate that without giggling into our pop stand now that we've already put blue into this one it's your opportunity to make it more blue or less blue so I'm going to eventually turn this into Earth blue I think we can get one more planet out of it before we do I'm going to mix that blue all the way through just using a lollipop stick so that I've got a nice sort of a past early blue colored chocolate alright now I've added in a generous out of my blue you can see there I've now got a pale blue with kind of I mean quite a lot of that dark blue I'm going to use this to dip Neptune here you can pop over next to your anus in amongst our galaxy of cakepops now finally I'm going to mix that blue all the way through to get a really lovely rich dark blue color and that is going to be earth the most important planet in our solar system and what planet would you be if you're a planet I would be earth because it has all of the most amazing nature and wildlife and because you're on it and your honor and you would be with me forever well I wouldn't be on it I would be the planet oh yeah you won't be on it no you would probably be it moving on to some of our brighter and I want to say more fun colors so for Saturn I'm going to make that one kind of our pale white with hints of yellow through it so again I'm going to add a little of that yellow food coloring and we're just going to hop mix it through so we get that nice swirl effect similar to what happened with Uranus so a little of the lighter color and then flip the toothpick and just a little of that darkest well then you can go Saturn Saten no quiet satins not going to be complete without its ring but first now it's time for Venus so for Venus I'm actually going to add into my yellow a little bit of my orange so I want to make this like a yellowish kind of a bang put them with these nice strong streaks of orange through it and it's time to dip behold we have created Venus no women are from now before I add any more food coloring to anything I want to set aside a little of my blue and a little of my yellow so I could make a nice greeny colour put my landmasses on planet earth and then I'm just going to add red into my orange and make a nice kind of a Reddy orangey color so that I can do miles well that's a great color this kind of a technique you can actually often stumble across really cool colors so if you see as well that you like stop there dip it these are planets from the pictures that I've seen online there's pretty much no definitive answer on what each of them really looks like that's pretty red that's kind of Jupiter isn't it but we just need Jupiter pretty sure that looks a lot like Jupiter Jupiter has the strongest magnetic pull I think or feel or pull jupiter has 67 moons how many walls do we have on earth just one but it's a good one now I'm making Mars the other one looked a little bit too much like Jupiter for me not to leave it as Jupiter sir add a little more red pretty much the only guy that missed out on our solar system is Mercury and Pluto but Pluto's not really in anymore Mars and now it's time to decorate so probably the easiest one to decorate at this point it's going to be earth while a green is still nice and melted and our blue has completely set I'm going to use it to fit you use a lollipop stick here but I'm just going to use a toothpick and really just try to make similar earth-like patterns I should be able to get Australia down pat at least let's make some rings for our planets so this is my little piece of chocolate that we've set in the fridge and I am just going to use circular cookie cutters I can leave measurements of these guys below but you really want to measure them up against your individual cake pops so you can see there I know that I want this guy to be my rings of Uranus so I'm picking the cookie cutter that's the closest in size it also coins and nothing works really nice for satin but if satin was a little bit bigger I use a slightly bigger center hole circle cutter I'm going to do thicker rings on Saturn that I do on Uranus and I've got some super hot boiling water metal cookie cutters are great here she can rest them in the boiling water and they'll get nice and warm careful that I get too hot for fingers and then you bring your warm cookie cutter over onto your nice thin cold piece of white chocolate and you can just rest it on top and it will literally melt through the chocolate leaving you with a really nice ring shape I'm barely applying any pressure at all I'm just letting the heat of the cookie cutter do its thing and melt its way through patience and not brawn are pertinent for these guys this one's for me and the rings of Uranus perfect alright we can pop those off to the side now if you need to apply a little bit more melted white chocolate to these you can to have them sit nice and flush or if you're transporting them this guy here could use just a little bit it's a fraction bigger than the top of my cake pop Uranus is a little bit more flexible because you can just pop it sort of off to a bit of a jaunty angle I'm going to melt just a tiny bit of white chocolate so that I can have them sitting just so I don't know they're going to be secured for transportation our ringed planets have come to life and they look amazing you need at least a couple of these anywhere in your little solar system because they just add so much finally it's galaxy pop x we've got our plain old boring black cake pops and now we're going to take all of our different color gloss to dusts a mixture of wet and dry here so I'm going to start we just like a little silver and just wash some of my patterns across and I want combinations of colors so with blue purple there's a little pink because I love pink some green but guys get creative every single galaxy pop could be completely unique now I'm going to mix a little with alcohol so you could either use like a lemon extract here or you can use a straight at alcohol like a vodka or a decorating alcohol I'm going to put a little bit of my silver in and I'm going to do some little silver stars make you some splatters to create your little splatters just grab your paintbrush and flick it this will get a little messy but it's fun and then finally I'm going to use a toothpick just to make looks a little kind of starburst those are our galaxy pops you have an entire solar system at your disposal decorate up all of your galaxy pops make as many or as few of these as you want get creative does the galaxy is pretty much whatever you want it to be we've literally cake popped the universe I hope you guys have enjoyed learning some fun facts along the way in today's delicious solar system of cake pops and let me just say if you can't get the kids interested in outer space with these babies it was probably never going to happen three bags that I've learned about the solar system today the rings of Saturn are bigger than the rings of Uranus Uranus is impossible to say without laughing or at least smiling a little bit and Pluto was kicked unfairly out of the solar system and I feel like should be reinstated let's not talk about mercury I hope you've enjoyed today's video if you're not already subscribed make sure you do for two new videos every week don't forget to order my cookbook sweet celebrations if you haven't already and as always guys thanks very much for watching I don't know this guy I ate it later it used to be Uranus well now it's gone or now it's a young ray you 
oh we've had a bunch blur [Music] welcome back to my cupcake addiction I'm Elise Drona and today I'm going to be showing you how to make these adorable know baked pumpkin spice cheesecake bites that are made even more adorable because they're in tiny little pumpkins [Music] the things you'll need to make your pumpkin spice cheesecake bites you need either orange candy melts or you can color white chocolate using a little oil based food coloring you'll need some brown sugar some whipping cream a little pumpkin puree and I actually just boiled and mashed my own pumpkin because I didn't have access to can pumpkin puree cream cheese at room temperature a little vanilla essence some ground cinnamon boiling water ground nutmeg ground ginger and ground cloves I'm also going to use a little bit of green food coloring and this is actually the same recipe as the one that I use in the pumpkin spice latte parfaits in the sweet celebrations cookbook which came out just a couple of days ago it's basically the exact same recipe except I'm not doing the biscuit base you can see those gorgeous little pathways that we then put into our little fall themed or rustic themed chapter this is where your miniature bunk tin comes in these are about an inch across but you can make these bigger or smaller depending on how big you want your little cheesecake bites to be melt down your orange candy melts your colored white chocolate and then put about a half a teaspoon in each cavity and use the back of the spoon just to drag that candy melt or that chocolate up so it's kind of a little thicker around the top edges pop those ones off into the fridge to set once they've set they should pop out nicely but if for any reason they don't you can snap freeze them for five minutes just pop them straight in the freezer and that will help them to release really easily and then pop them out and take a warm skillet or fry pan I'm using a mini and just use here that to heat up the top edge of two pumpkins then join them together that's going to essentially make your little pumpkin I'm using one of my little beet out ends because it's about the right size again just heat it up in a little bit of boiling water and I'm just going to poke that through the top of one of my little bumps so that my pumpkin is essentially whole with a hole in the top they're kind of adorable so you should have something like this a joint together hallo pumpkin with a little peeking hole in the top we can set those off to the side and we got to first of all put our brown sugar into your boiling water and let it sit for about 15 minutes I kind of love brown sugar I love the flavors that it adds to a recipe caramely rich that's going to dissolve all of your brown sugar so you don't get any grains or anything crunchy and our smooth cheesecake and then I'm going to add in all of my spices and my vanilla so pumpkin spice is not a big thing in Australia and honestly until I'd spent so much time in the States I didn't realize how good it could be but because of that pumpkin puree is not something that we can find year-round it's not readily available so for anyone that's not in the States in the fall seasons I just took regular pumpkin chopped it up and steamed it so that it was a little bit softened and then mashed it you have pumpkin puree and we didn't need to use anything out of a can so all of my spices are in I'm going to use my electric mixer and I'm going to whip that together on a high speed until it's really nice and creamed mix that for about five minutes and then I'm going to start slowly adding in my brown sugar syrup while my mixes are going so that it distributes evenly this doesn't need to be cooled or anything the sweetness YUM all right this smells amazing it's all cinnamony and delicious you can pop that one off to the side and then we get a semi whip our cream when you semi whipped cream you want to make sure that it is just thickened but it's not leaving better marks in the actual cream so when you pick it up with a spoon it should essentially fall off the spoon and you shouldn't be able to see the trace of your beat up after it's been whipping through two semi with not a full whip this is a perfectly semi whipped cream so you can see there it's thick and it's full but it still essentially drips off the spoon that's what you want it's not yet leaving beta marks even as we mix this through it's going to keep on whipping in the folding process and the last thing we won here is over whipped cream so in goes my cream to my pumpkin mixture and then fold it through using big sweeping motions which means you can scrape down the sides of your bowl and you don't put too much pressure on that cream and risk over whipping it you want to fold that through until you don't see any more white streaks if you're using fresh pumpkin you are going to have a slightly different consistency too if you do use the canned pumpkin because it's fresh and we've made it ourselves it is a little more natural and we're sneaking vegetables into our dessert but it just doesn't have that super process smoothness of a can of pumpkin puree so I've got a piping bag and I've just got any piping tip that's round but it has to be smaller than those little holes it has to be able to fit inside or else she can end up with a mess on your hands so fill your pumpkin spice cheesecake mixture into your bag and then we're just going to pipe it in till we fill each of our little pumpkin bumps as you're filling these we want to make sure that we get cheesecake in that top section so put the nozzle right inside the cheesecake and put a bit of pressure on it until it just starts to come out the top even after it starts to come out the top we kind of want to force it up into the top of our little bumps that batter is going to make 24 of those little cheesecake bites with a tiny bit left over you can obviously make half of you on only 12 but normally these are good things to make for parties so I figure 24 is a good number I mean to put the last of my battle whatever's leftover into a bowl and I'm gonna color it with a little bit of my green food color paste I've also got a leaf piping tips you can use any sides here this one's quite a large one it's essentially a piping tip with an opening and just like a V in it this is going to make a little leaf shape put your green cheesecake mixture into your piping bag because I want this to set a little bit I'm gonna twist my piping tip here and also here kind of trap that cheesecake inside I'm gonna put the whole lot into the fridge this mixture and my pumpkin spiced cheesecakes for one hour that's going to let everything firm up make this Piper ball and have those pumpkin spice cheesecakes at optimum temperature to serve once you've patiently waited your hour for your pumpkin spice cheesecakes to set and that cheesecake mixture to firm up a little bit you can pipe a small leaf on the top of each of your cheesecake bites the tips going to do most of the work here for you so literally just squeeze it out and then taper it off to a point to look like a little tiny leaf or a little stalk if you don't have a leaf piping tip a snaps your bags fine here just a little greenery helps serve those chill to your guests and watch everybody gets super excited when they realize that pumpkin cheesecake bites are actual pumpkins these are adorable they're easy to make they're no big and they're absolutely perfect if you love pumpkin spice if you've never given it a go like I hadn't try it it's actually really delicious if you're not already subscribed to the channel make sure you do for two new videos every week and as always thanks very much for watching [Music] you 
[Music] welcome back to my cupcake addiction I'm Elise trodden today I'm going to be sharing with you my foolproof amazingly delicious basic sugar cookie recipe this is actually the same recipe from my new cookbook sweet celebration so if you have a copy of that you can actually bake along that one's in stores now I'll leave a link down below but if you guys have been looking for those sugar cookies that you see online that are super easy to decorate they have a long shelf life and they don't stretch expand or grow out of shape in the oven this is the recipe for you to make your sugar cookies you will need plain or all-purpose flour a little baking soda some salt some butter that should be softened not melted not cold granulated or caster sugar as far as you can get it without being powdered one extra-large egg a little bit of vanilla extract as always I'm going to leave the printable recipe and all of your quantities and conversions on the my cupcake addiction comm website I'll leave a link to that post down below let's get started first thing we got to do is add our softened butter that was very well done that was like a cooking show and then our sugar you want to beat those together on high speed for at least five minutes until they're super light and fluffy once your mix is nice and light and fluffy you can add in your vanilla and also your egg yes I am actually cooking along with my cookbook it's actually kind of nice not to have to go and print my own recipes out coz while I know them all I do always have them on hand in case I forget along the way there's a lot feel like I wrote this cookbook for me as much as I wrote it for you guys we're gonna whisk the egg and vanilla through for about 30 seconds until it's really well combined and make sure you're scraping down the sides here I'm gonna whisk my baking soda not baking powder or you will get spread and then also most salt into my flour I mean it sift over one-third of my flour mixture there we go like powdery flowery mixture I'm gonna mix that through with my electric mixer just got a low speed to start so it's gonna give me a little dust storm everywhere I'm going to mix through a second third of my flour mixture and mix that throttle low-speed can hear my beaters starting to struggle even now in the book I'll sometimes refer to a stand mixer as opposed to an electric mixer it's because I recommend you use this tone mixer when it's like this thick it's a little hard on the electric mixes but it can still be done just be nice to them I kind of let them go just in midair for a minute so that I can get as much of that batter as I can off those beaters and then in goes my final third beat that until it's just combined and then you want to just scrape off anything that's still on your beaters we don't to lose any of our batter it's going to look like kind of crumbling sand that it all comes together in the kneading so don't stress if you're thinking it's looking a little dry I'm going to dump my mixture onto the bench always the messiest part so make sure the bench is clean and prepare to get kind of messy so you just want to bring this together and we're gonna need it so especially at the beginning I sort of need if I just bring it all into the center and then folding it over itself bringing it in folding it over bring it in folding it over and it should end up looking like a really nice caramel colored play-doh depending on where you live the climate when you're making this and the type of ingredients you use some of them will perform slightly differently it can even me down to the size egg so really you're going both feel here but if you feel you need to moisten your door but I'll just a little bit of extra softened butter will do the job I'm gonna need this until it's all holding together really nicely and I can't see any streaks of any of my ingredients so it should look like one solid caramely colored bowl of delicious cookie dough kind of looks like a pizza dough but it tastes better this needs to chill for a minimum of twenty minutes and I recommend anywhere up to an hour to speed up the chilling process I always divide my dough into two halves just kind of squish it out like a bit of an oval Pat it down and slice it in off this does a couple of things this actually makes the rollout process a lot easier because I'm not defrosting or warming up the whole batch at once but it also stops my door from having to cool this huge big chunk and it allows to cool through the center a lot faster it'll save your wait time now you want to wrap that very very firmly in plastic wrap so I wrap it once in one direction and then once in the other direction and off into the fridge it goes this dough actually also freezes up really nicely so if you want to pop it in the freezer if you don't use it all you can just bring it back to room temperature by leaving it on the bench for about an hour before you want to use it this is one of my basic recipes where I show you guys the fundamentals that you need to recreate some of my crazy over-the-top creations when I do these videos I like to help troubleshoot the process a little bit with this one the biggest mistakes that people make is a not using baking soda and using baking powder which causes cookies to spread be not chilling that dough both before they roll it and before it goes into the oven the rolling and cutting process here can warm the dough up so if in doubt with the entire tray of cup shaped cookies back into the fridge for 15 minutes before they go into the oven these guys are going off into the fridge for at least 30 minutes where they can chill out once your dough is completely chilled it should be nice and solid you want to take a little bit more of that plain flour all-purpose flour sprinkle down a generous amount and roll out your dough make sure you keep this moving by sliding your hands underneath picking it up and just turning it around that helps you get a really even roll but it also prevents it from sticking to the bench I like to slide mine onto a piece of parchment and then throw the whole piece of parchment onto a tray and cut out shapes I'm going to do circles but you guys can use cookie cutters or you can freehand I have made some amazing creations using cookies both as individual cookies surprise pinata cookies and as part of cakes to add structure and support once you've cut out your shapes remove the excess and try not to move the shape around too much after it's been cut again cut as many as you can out of that first roll and try to only re-roll this dough or we need this dough as few times as possible as you'll get a tougher cookie each time before these go into the oven I am going to chill them for 15 minutes so they're really nice and cold so that my dough doesn't spread and my cookies don't lose their shape they're going to go off into a moderate oven so three d/f or 175 celsius for seven to ten minutes until they just start to color around the outside edges when your cookies come out of the oven leave them on the tray for about 10 minutes and then you can remove them or pop them onto a cooling rack those ones you now want to let completely cool before you do any decoration they will get hotter as they cool and once they do there are a really nice solid firm cookie you can bake these up to a week in advance and leave them in an airtight container don't refrigerate them you can decorate them with fondant you can decorate them with royal icing you can decorate them with melted chocolate or candy melts or add some sprinkles on a little bit of store-bought frosting and eat them as they are I love basic recipes but more than anything I love turning them into amazing creations if you guys want to check out some of the really cool things that I've used this very same basic sugar cookie dough for I'll leave a link down below to some of my all-time favorites like my paint illusion cake or my skittles rainbow cake where the rainbow is a cookie or some of my all-time favorite pinata surprise inside cookie creations if you're not already subscribed to the channel make sure you do for new

hey guys it's Elise and welcome back to my cupcake addiction today I'm going to show you guys how to make a delicious deconstructed tiramisu that tastes every bit as good as it looks and it looks amazing I'm really excited to have partnered with Starbucks coffee on their starbucks at-home range so I'm going to show you guys how to make a restaurant-quality dessert that you can do from the comfort of your own home to pair with a delicious cup of coffee that you can also brew at home it's awesome being able to get the same taste and quality as I would from a Starbucks cafe from the comfort of my own kitchen let's get started you're going to need 250 mils of heavy cream I've got a 200ml portion and a 50ml portion I've also got 225 grams of good-quality dark chocolate 12 ladyfinger sponge finger biscuits I've got a little bit of cocoa or chocolate powder and of course coffee I'm using Starbucks Pike Place fresh beans I love grinding my own beans so they're freshly ground when I make my cup of coffee and I'm going to use the French press method today because it's my favorite I've also got to take away cups kind of weird since we're not taking coffee away but I'll be showing you how to use those in a dessert let's get started so the first thing I want to do is I'm not going to bring my cup of coffee until my desserts nearly ready but I'm gonna make a really strong coffee mixture which is gonna go into the mousse portion of a dessert I'm gonna take two tablespoons of my freshly ground coffee and pour over just a half a cup of boiling hot water I'm gonna let that sit in my press for a couple of minutes until I press it so that it can infuse nicely and give me a beautiful strong coffee flavor so while that's doing its thing I've got my divided portion of cream so just my 50 milliliters and then 75 grams of my 225 grams of dark chocolate I'm going to pour that cream directly over the dark chocolate and we're going to microwave that on 30-second intervals until it is completely smooth and glossy and there are no lumps or bumps so you should have a really nice smooth flowing chocolate syrup and now that our coffees had about 10 minutes or so to stand I'm going to plunge it and then I'm going to pour it into one of my coffee mugs and I'm going to put it in the freezer to let it rapidly cool this one's going off into the freezer until it's completely cool to touch and I'm also going to let my chocolate mixture just did it room temperature again until it's cool to touch coffee and chocolate are both cooling so I've got my melted plain chocolate this is another chocolate with cream in it this is the other 175 grams of just melted dark chocolate I'm going to take my to take where cups and you can see I've picked relatively small sized cups and I'm going to pour about half of my chocolate into each cup all right now you want to take your chocolate and just tilt it around the outside edges now you don't want these to be too thick so I like to kind of drip out a lot of my excess chocolate so that I've got a really nice sort of a fine thin edge and then just an eaten off the top I'm just going to run a knife right around these ones are going to set in the freezer I want to set them in the freezer a so that I get to my dessert quicker but also so they're really nicely set and that chocolate can tracks away from those takeaway cups making them really easy to get out without cracking the key part for this dessert apart from our delicious chocolate cups and our lady finger biscuits is going to hinge on our coffee infused chocolate mousse so I'm going to take my heavy cream or whipping cream and I'm gonna whip it to soft peaks so a soft peak is when your beam is just start to leave their beater mark in the cream you can see there it's definitely got a lot more body but it's still just running or falling straight off my spatula this is because we're going to continue to whip it as we add in our other ingredients so I'm going to take this chocolate mixture now we're going to fold all of that into our cream and the reason that you mix the chocolate with the cream to begin with it's so that as your melted chocolate hits that cold cream it doesn't all turn into like little hardened chunks of chocolate along the way a nice vigorous mix and even doing this it's continuing to whip that cream I'm going to take my cold coffee mixture and I'm gonna put in three tablespoons this is going to take it from a chocolate mousse to an espresso coffee mousse if your coffees at all warm at this stage it's actually gonna split the cream in your mousse so you want to make sure it's really nice and cool I'm gonna pop my completed mousse into the fridge that'll start to set in a little firmer and it's also going to wait until my cups are ready to be moussed now it's time to brew my coffee to complete the perfect pairing not only is this going to be drunk with the dessert it's also going to form part of the dessert it's the ultimate relationship made in heaven so I'm going to make enough for two cups of coffee and I'm just making mine as per the packet directions French Press style again and then I'm going to let that sit and infuse for about ten minutes before I plunge for maximum flavor we can start getting ready to put our dessert together now and of course presentation is everything we want to go to all this trouble to make the perfect cup of coffee and the perfect dessert and then just serve it on any old plate so the first thing that I'm going to do is take a few of my coffee beans and just kind of put them in one corner of the plate now I'm going to take a little sift up this is where it always gets a little bit messy so I like to put my cocoa in over the sink first to get that initial little puff of cocoa out of the way and I'm just going to spread cocoa very gently or chocolate powder just over the tops of my beans so I'm just tapping it ever so gently and I wanted a little bit darker on the corner of my plate then as it gets sort of closer to the mid sort of like it's fading in and out I always think with any dessert presentation is the thing that gets missed we go to all this trouble to prepare perfect delicious desserts with amazing quality ingredients but really a couple of simple things can make the presentation really pop this is always my favorite part of any baked is bringing it all together so I'm gonna take my little sponge fingers and I'm just gonna line them up and these are the classic tiramisu biscuit or cookie but normally they're layered inside the tiramisu not today I'm stacking them kind of like a really cute little game of Jenga and I want to put those in the middle of the plate so they could dip in coffee or mousse whichever they choose and we'll just check on our chocolate cups these ones are straight out of the freezer so you may even hear them contracting slightly using these paper cups means that I can just gently push the base and slide out your gorgeous little chocolate Cup one of the things that I love about this recipe is normally I don't either temper high quality chocolate or use compound chocolate but because we're going to keep these chilled right up until serving because they've got that mousse inside you can use a super high quality beautiful dark chocolate and not worry about tempering it so you get those great high quality ingredients to pair with your high quality dessert and high quality coffee but you don't have to worry about the extra effort of the trouble of tempering now I popped my mousse into a piping bag just with an open round piping tip you can also just spoon it in but I think it's a little bit neater if you've got access to either a piping bag with a tip or even something like a snap seal bag just to help with the distribution and make it a little bit less messy make sure you divide evenly here we don't want anyone missing out on any of that mousse beautiful those are our chocolate cups filled with that beautiful espresso mousse a couple of cute little gold spoons you can use any spirit I'm just trying to team with the theme here and then the very final thing we're going to do is take that freshly brewed coffee I'm going to press through the French press tiramisu and coffee is literally the best combination in the world be careful not to get any coffee drips on your beautifully presented plate and we've made deconstructed tiramisu you've got espresso mousse in an edible beautiful dark chocolate Cup you've got your ladyfingers there that we can dip into the coffee and then into the mousse you've got the beautiful crunchy chocolate around the outside that you can break off as you're eating and of course you've got your fresh brewed cup of coffee that cup of coffee is going to be enjoyed with the dessert and also as the dessert because we're kind of going to be dipping and eating and drinking and dipping and eating and tasting as we go this is the ultimate dessert coffee pairing if you guys like me love a coffee with dessert you can head to Starbucks calm forward-slash at home for other desserts that pair perfectly with that cup of coffee I hope you've enjoyed today's video and thanks so much to Starbucks for teaming up with me on it as always guys thanks very much for watching and enjoy your deconstructed durum

getting this is peanut butter yeah you think it's real peanut butter oh can you open it [Music] oh hey you guys my notice of being in America and I've kind of gotten used to shopping at Costco we're out of peanut butter do you guys think I went too far this is cake this is an epic relatively easy to achieve gigantic jar of peanut butter cake before we get started I have some really exciting news to share over the past several months I've been working on a new show with the Food Network called sweet smarts sweet smarts is premiering tomorrow morning on the 30th of October and then there's an encore episode on the 5th of November check your local guides to see what time it's on near you but it's going to be in the morning on October 30 and I'm so excited to see what you guys think if you use the hashtag sweet smart on any of my social media platforms or let me know in the comments below I would love to hear what you guys thought of my very first Food Network show all right let's get into this cake to make your giant peanut butter jar cake you're going to need some white chocolate and milk chocolate make sure this is a compound chocolate and doesn't contain the ingredient cocoa butter I've got a double batch of my vanilla cake mix and I've baked that in a regular baking tray this one's 18 inches by 13 inches and you can get that recipe in the sweet celebrations cookbook or I'll leave a link to it down below I've got a batch of my buttercream frosting some smooth peanut butter I've got a fine craft knife and then I've got a heavy-duty set of cutters a little fondant colored yellow and peanut butter cups lots of Fino butter cups to make my peanut butter cake I'm actually going to be casting the mold in a giant fruit filled container that I found at Costco this is from the San Francisco pretzel company I'll leave a link to this one down below and as an added bonus you get to eat a ton of pretzels before you start making your cake that one's completely clean and completely dry first we're gonna make a chocolate mixture that's about the same color as peanut butter so I'm gonna take my white chocolate and then my milk chocolate and that's that 3/4 white chocolate to about 1/4 milk chocolate we're gonna melt those down then add a fair amount of yellow oil based food coloring or candy coloring to really bring out that creamy peanut butter hue so it's a little bit less dirty brown and more beautiful peanutty brown if it's actually smelled like peanut butter I would serious I think that it was like super runny peanut butter it's the perfect color now we prepare our pretzel container not something you thought you'd hear in cake decorating you want to cut that down so that it kind of meets up with the top edge it's going to help us pull it apart once everything set and then I'm going to take my exacto knife and I'm just going to slice all the way through the middle be really careful here these things are crazy sharp without big container halves and our chocolate melted you're going to pour pour about half into each half and then I'm just going to tip my chocolate so that it coats all of the sides you can use your spatula if you need a bit of help here I lent tip out any excess I want two thin coats here rather than one thick coat don't worry if you can see some little transparent gaps in your peanut butter pop that off into the fridge because we're going to give it a second coat anyway into the fridge those are only going to take about ten minutes to set when you come back pull your remaining chocolate into each half separate it evenly and use the spatula just to pull it off the sides again so you've got two thin coats which should give you a nice stable almost peanut butter jar almost while that one's chilling out we're going to make our frosting so I've got a double batch of my vanilla buttercream frosting and I'm going to add about a pound or 500 grams of smooth peanut butter and then just mix it through simple as that you have peanut butter frosting take your two sheet cakes now and I'm going to use an eighth inch tin kind of as a template just to cut around two whole circles and then a half and then I'm going to use the half just stacked on top of the tin to use those off cuts to make almost a third circle this'll be pieced together a little bit but it saves you wasting cake and because we've got that really nice chocolate shell it's going to hold everything together just beautifully once you've got essentially six circles you want to level them all off so they're all the same height and then just trim away any caramelization from the bottom I'm going to brush all six of those layers with a little sugar syrup which is just one part sugar and one part water microwaved or brought to the boil until that sugar completely it's just going to help us retain a fair bit of moisture and our cake once that completely set you can remove your two containers from the fridge and I'm going to use my super fine craft knife to make four slits do this on an angle so that you're not scratching the chocolate and you should be able to through the plastic already pulling away from the outside edges of your giant peanut butter jar slide all the way down be very careful of fingers and then you can just peel back the four sections they won't peel like an orange but they'll just pull away enough that you can then turn your container over and press the base it should pop straight out for the top half very similar remove the lid make those same four incisions and then you can actually use where all the chocolates filled in the lid section to push that out as well I've got my two halves of my peanut butter cup but as you can see they're a little uneven they're a little jagged because we had to cut a huge pretzel container and a half with a craft knife so we're going to neaten it up I'm just going to take a hot frypan or a hot skillet and I'm just going to place it over the top and just let it flatten level and neaten don't go too crazy I don't lose too much height on this peanut butter cake you don't just have to use the inside of the frypan you can use the outside as well if you just need to even off just a small portion once you've got that out of the container I swear that is the most stressful part done it's not hard but that's where you'll get the most nervous after that we are cruising so I'm going to take my peanut butter frosting and I'm just going to use a spatula to just really coat the inside in a thin coating which is going to cause the cake to stick to those outside edges so when we cut it the chocolate doesn't fall away it's actually going to be served with each piece of cake once you've got a really nice coating of your peanut butter frosting on the inside of both halves of your peanut butter cake you want to stack in a layer of cake that I'm going to pipe in a nice amount of frosting and smooth it off and then I'm going to layer peanut butter cups a little more frosting just to fill in any gaps and a quick smooth before another layer of cake so when you cut this you are going to get cake frosting peanut butter cup frosting cake frosting peanut butter cup frosting remember on your top half to put the peanut butter cups upside down because by the time we've joined this together that whole half will be turned over cake is stacked and frosted you can pop that off into the free for about 30 minutes just to let everything solidify and get nice and firm and then we going to add some support because there's so much cake going on in here the last thing we want is for our top cake to crush our bottom cake crushed under amount of peanut butter is what a way to go I'm going to use milkshake straws or fat straws here you can also use something like skewers or dowel but these are a lot easier to cut you will need to apply a bit of force to get them through that layer of peanut butter cup I'm going to use a pair of scissors just to cut those off so they're all nice and level and then I'm going to use just a covered thin cake board just to sit in the middle a little more frosting I love the fact I've made a cake that has a layer of peanut butter cup and looks like a peanut butter jar now some paw will you can tend to get a little nervous but this is actually a pretty robust it's heavy but it's a very robust cake so I'm going to again just melt the very very edges just a tiny bit this time so they get a little tacky and then we're going to join them together on goes my hot skillet just for a second and the other side and then we join pick it up flip it over support and align you got a couple of seconds to slide it around and just get it nice and lined up there and then just run your fingers around the outside edge a little bit of that leftover melted chocolate I've just popped mine into a snap seal bag and I'm just going to squeeze it around that gap and use it just to make sure that my cake is really securely joined in the middle don't worry this is not super super neat because we've got a label that's going to cover pretty much all mistakes roll out yellow fondant and then I'm going to use my actual pretzel lid as a bit of a template to make my little indentations I'm using an actual jar lid Nutella peanut butter whatever you like but that's going to give you that nice Ridge edge I'm going to use a small amount of water to attach first to the side strip and then a little bit more water on top it's going to attach that lid in place use your fingers just to make sure the two meet up together really nicely so close to being done I've taken my template and stuck it together you'll notice it's in a couple of pieces so the size of your jar is going to depend how many of your template pieces you need but just take them together using a little tape and then I'm going to wrap it around the center making sure I know where the not-so-pretty back of my cake is at all times and then a fix it with a little bit of tape does Olli want some cake yeah Jake you want some cake yeah all right let's go to cut your cake getting a superhot knife here we go the hot knife you need to get through that chocolate and you should be able to cut it all the way down to the first board let's take a look inside our cake whoa what do you see in there guys hello you see a dinosaur you see dinosaurs everywhere lately this thing literally weighs like 10 kilos or 20 pounds it's my morning workout I'm burning off my peanut butter cups it's a layers of fluffy vanilla cake with peanut butter

hey everyone its Elise and welcome back to my cupcake addiction today I'm going to be doing one of my famous illusion cakes or gravity-defying cakes and this one's suitable for pretty much anybody that loves art crafts rainbows painting or cake so it's pretty multi-use we're going to be making a rainbow paint illusion cake or a painting rainbow illusion cake the things you're going to need to make your paint illusion cake I put a triple batch of my perfectly pipeable buttercream frosting I'll link to the recipe down below basically I've taken the triple batch divided it in half as a half white and then I've colored the other half in six different colors of the rainbow so red orange yellow green blue and purple I've got a ton of white chocolate so I'm using a white compound chocolate which is chocolate that doesn't contain the ingredient cocoa butter over candy melts here because I know that I need like 200 grams or 7 ounces of six different colors I didn't want to buy six different bags of candy melts I've got a great video that shows you how to color and tint your chocolate which I'll also link to down below but I'm basically tinting all of my chocolate using these oil candy colors these ones are from a merry color I only have three I have red yellow and navy blue and I make all of my colors using combinations of those so have a think about whether or not you actually need purple or whether you can mix red and blue together to make your own shade of purple I've got a little bit of whipping cream and I've got a bat of my sugar cookie dough I'll link to that recipe down below as well I pretty much put everything you need down below I'm using five layers of either vanilla cake or white chocolate mud cake here minus seven inches wide by about two two and a half inches high of course you need a cake board to rest your cake on and as for my tools I've got a serrated knife a cake leveler I've got an offset spatula and a scraper which you can also substitute out with a metal ruler I've got a pizza cutter some snaps your bags and a baking tray lined with baking paper and I've also got a brand new very cool paintbrush like pastry brush opted for a pastry brush because I know it's going to be food safe and I'm not going to lose all these little hairs in my dessert the first thing that you want to do and you can do this event is make your sugar cookie so you want to spread down a generous amount of flour and you're going to roll your cookie out to about a quarter of an inch to a half an inch thickness don't make this too thin I then used your pizza cutter to size up against my pastry brush and make sure the cookie is just a little bit wider at the top than my actual width of my pastry brush and then I took it as long as I could fit on my tray so as long as you possibly can you want to come a little bit wider in the bottom and then you can just use your fingers to kind of add in almost a couple of little grooves or dips to give it the illusion of sort of a following pain pop that off into a modern oven for 10 to 15 minutes you'll know it's done what it just slightly starts to brown around the edges and you better let this one go a little too long than not long enough because we want it to be really firm and crunchy once it's cooked bring it out and allow it to sit on the cookie sheet for about 10 minutes before transferring it onto a wire rack now you want to take your cake layers and we're going to level each one and remove any of that Brown top and bottom and once I'm happy that the tops are good then I'm just going to use my serrated knife just take a very very thin amount off the bottom of my cake so I've got none of that Brown peeking through you can leave the edges as they are you want to repeat that with all of your cake layers with a lot of the messy work done now and I cakes all level and looking nice and even I'm gonna take just a little smear of my white buttercream place it down on my cake board and that's essentially going to glue my cake in place so I'm gonna start at the bottom layer pop that one down make sure it's centered I've made that mistake before and you'll notice that I've got all of my frosting in different piping bags paired with either open round piping tips because I have four of them but if you don't have four you can just basically do the exact same thing and just snip a tip off the end it'll give you essentially the same result as an open round piping tip so don't feel like you've got to go out and buy a lot of equipment here I'm just going to cut off the end about the same size as one of those tips roughly it doesn't matter if it's not perfect and I'm going to start with a blob in the middle like so then I'm going to move on to blue basically this is going to give us a vanilla cake with a really cool rainbow of color when you cut in each slice around the outside with the blue the green and then finally red I made the most red because I know that's going to be my outside color and the left because that's going to be my inside color on goes my next layer of cake and we build like that alright we're done we're stacked we've got our rainbow hidden inside and I've got my cookie cooling on the bench now normally I would trim off these brown edges because I don't really want to see those but I don't want to upset the integrity of this cake it's a pretty soft sponge so I'm going to leave those as they are and we're going to put a crumb coat all the way around the outside this is to catch any of the crumbs and also to catch any of that pesky red frosting so that when we do our top coat it's completely white once you're happy with your crumb coat that one goes off into the fridge for about 20 minutes to let that crumb coat set so I've melted and colored all of my white chocolate and if you guys have any trouble particularly candy melts and getting a really nice sort of a pourable consistency I do say in my melting and coloring video that I would send it with a little shortening but I've since started using coconut oil which tastes a lot better and does the same thing so you can sit it out like that and check out that video if you having any issues I've got all of mine in individual snap seal bags and once I've got all six colors in and my cookie cooled and ready to go we're going to paint the rainbow I haven't put all of my chocolate or all of my melted candy into each bag because some of it we're going to use for the ganache I've got 200 grams or 7 ounces of each color and we only are going to use around 50 grams or so for each of these stripes but you want more than less it just makes your job a little bit easier so I'm putting my cookie on the back of a cookie tray or a cookie sheet on a piece of parchment paper and I've got my pastry brush of course that's food grade so I'm going to have it on the cookie so it's about an inch or so on the cookie but I can still see some of that brush poking at the top I'm just going to support the back of it just on I've got a little container here to kind of keep the brush pretty straight so that it's not on an angle when we finish I'm gonna start with my middle colors here because otherwise you tend to find that you have a ton of room for red orange yellow and then poor blue and purple miss out at the end so I would like to start in the middle I'm going to cut just a nice sort of a fine tip not too fun off my snaps your bag with the yellow candy inside of the yellow chocolate and I'm just going to paint a squiggle something to stick the back of my brush in place my pastry brush actually says petit Sierra friends which I really like because it's like the cake artist archaic so now you want to come down and we're going to start roughly in the middle of the cookie and create a striped line you can get a little bit fatter as you get to the bottom fill that line in and then as you get towards the top to the paintbrush kind of smoosh some into the bristles of the brush but then you want to come up on the brush each of your colors so that it looks like the brush is basically dipped inside a count of rambo paint and all that rainbow frosting going inside our big cake it's going to look kind of like a can of rainbow cake as you get to the outside edges you want to make sure that your chocolates covering right down the side edges so we can't see any of that cookie poking through you'll also need to paint the back of your cookie with a little white chocolate or one of your colored candy melts just to cover it lightly so that it's airtight and doesn't absorb the moisture from the frosting in your cake now that we're done with our rainbow paint illusion we can set that one off to the side and let's check on our cake to see if it's ready for its final coat of frosting alright your crumb coat should be nice and set so quite firm to touch and now you can apply another generous coat or your final generous coat of frosting if you find this frosting is pulling away from the cake at all just thin it out with you threw a little milk or a little water because you want it to be really really nice soft and spreadable put a ton of this frosting on the cake more than you think you're going to need because as we scrape it back we don't wanna see any of this pink poking through we just want a white paint can once you're happy you've got plenty of frosting on the outside of that cake you want to use a scraper or a ruler and just scrape back smoothing as you go use your scraper you're really kind of like a cement leveler on top to try and get really nice crisp sharp edges and then that cake is going to go back off into the fridge for 20 minutes to allow it to crust and to set before we do any of our drip or illusion effects with the cake in the fridge in my paint illusion setting it's time to make a cure Nash's so you'll notice I'm using the leftovers of all of my chocolate you're better off to make too much here than not enough because you don't want to have to try and match those colors so for each bowl of ganache you want to add 1/3 cup of cream don't worry if they've started to set again because we're going to microwave this anyway in goes the cream and then we're going to microwave each of those probably going to need about 30 seconds a minute most stirring in between so that we end up with six different colors of delicious ganache perfect in the microwave they go now as you stir that cream through each of your colors you'll notice it with my red it looks like it's separating it goes grainy and it looks terrible and then it kind of goes oily and looks terrible but keep stirring and it thickens up and goes beautiful glossy and smooth don't abandon it because it doesn't look great to begin with with my cake now completely set and out of the fridge it's really nice and firm and it's quite chilled so I'm going to pick my best side to face forward and I have my rainbow painting illusion ready to go I pop that in the fridge just for five minutes so that it's really nice and firm and that chocolates not at all melty you'd see there where I've painted the back white just to protect it from any moisture in the cake be really careful handling this it is heartbreaking if one of these snaps and I don't normally show you guys this but I speak from experience very sad very sad to see my first attempt fail but I have trouble shot and this one definitely better so I'm gonna take a big sharp knife and we are going to get deadly with our cake I want this paint illusion to go right in the middle and showing no mercy I'm going to drive down I'm going to move my knife from side to side because what I'm doing is I'm creating a guide hole for my paint illusion to go down in to be really careful pulling that out because you'll see that rainbow or frosting I mean not that we're not going to have a ton of color on the top of this cake anyway being very very gentle with my cake in the way that I'm handling it I'm going to place my paint illusion down through that guide hole and you'll see that I'm pushing straight down you don't have to push that all the way to the bottom because we do want a fair bit of height but make sure you give it a good that much into the cake so that you've got plenty of kind of base and support going on with any drip cake the worst and I mean the worst part is always the drip because honestly until you put that on you never know how it's going to go the key is consistency if you guys want a tip for getting your ganache sort of ready to do a drip I like to take something that I can put on a bit of an angle because I know that it'll pool on the top place it on and then you can kind of let it run down that's it decent drip this cakes cold so it's going to stop it a little earlier than something like my scraper but you don't want it roots like literally going to run off the side of the cake give it a test first because it's mortifying to have it over drip once it gets on there when you put on your ganache is you want to correspond your colors to where the color is on your rainbow so my Reds going to go over this side and then I'm going to match my orange on the back in the front so all the way around it's a rainbow of color I don't want that to over drip but I don't mind this is supposed to look kind of like a spilt can of rainbow paint so let it drip away all right so on goes my first color and because my offset spatula is not really going to work here you can see I'm just going to let it sort of pull to the sides a little bit and then I'm just gonna push it in a very slight drip don't over drip here because gravity will take its force alright that's my red all right now with each of your ganache is even after just a couple minutes on the bench you'll see there's a little bit of kind of crusting going on make sure you give them a great stir before you put them onto your cake because you don't wanna see any of those little lumps and bumps in your nice smooth ganache onto my orange now with my orange I want it to kind of pull into that red a little bit almost overlapping but not quite and I really want it to meet up with that orange that I can see going on on my paintbrush I'm so happy with this if you've tried a drip cake before you'll know dripping is kind of a bit of an art form the consistency of your ganache is everything so if you are having any doubts on a drip make sure that you test it first so you can see how far and how quickly your drips are going to travel this is gorgeous I've got a really nice variation in lengths and sizes I haven't made a huge mess at the bottom of my board this is a pink cake it would be okay if we did so finally have just got three little brushes and if you wanted to make these out of fondant or caramel cheese you absolutely could but I'm just going to use real brushes today because no one's actually going to eat these I'm going to dip them into my favorite color ganaches and on opposite sides of the cake so the blues and the purples on the red side and the Reds and the yellows on the blue side I'm just going to add them to the board for a little bit of color you can put a couple of little droplets of strategically spilled paint there as well what do you guys think I mean we baked a cookie we stuck on a pastry brush and we made this amazing illusion in really not too much time with absolutely no fondant or fancy tools and equipment I love gravity-defying cakes I will leave a link down below to my playlist which is all about different easy techniques that you can use to make your own gravity-defying cakes I hope you guys like today's video and as always thanks very much for watching 
hey guys it's Alisa welcome back to my cupcake addiction so I'm not in my usual kitchen today I am in the YouTube space kitchen in Los Angeles and I bumped into fellow Aussie a good friend Nick from scrambler oh hey so good to be with you today I'm so excited to be here I'm excited to have your expertise in the kitchen with me we are going to bring you guys some amazing baking hacks but first if you don't know Nick he has a YouTube channel a Facebook page and an Instagram page that I'm in love with and obsessed with called this grin line Nick what do you do on this grin line well over the top cupcakes is the easiest way to explain my channel it is over top cupcakes I make any flavor of cupcakes and they wasn't collectibles they are amazing one of my favorites that you've done has to be Rainbow Brite I love that one I would love that one what's been your favorite um I'd probably say my red velvet cupcakes are to die for so Nick does the decoration and the recipes and he has tons of recipes and I think you're like you're a veteran of cupcakes yes he has worked with cupcakes he has filled with cupcakes I guarantee you have seen a scran line video somewhere if not on Facebook if not on YouTube if not on Instagram they find you I see cupcakes in my sleep I feel I feel your pain I think we all feel you okay so Nick what inspired you to start this grand line um I guess I just wanted to share my design skills in my baking skills screen is navy terminology for food and when you stand in line for food you stand in the screen one very nice it's very nice so this is like this is like an organized process it's like a line up get your cupcake decorator move along eat that cupcake and line up again for another cupcake absolutely hit up this grand line you guys are gonna love it Facebook Instagram YouTube I'm gonna leave all of Nick's links down below and today we are showing you how to do a bunch of really cool baking hacks how often do you use hacks every day all day Liz mm-hmm as they cuz we both baked a lot we film a lot and there are always times when you run out of something where you need to troubleshoot and when you come up with inventive solutions for common everyday problems so we wanted to share some of our personal ones with you guys and also put some that we've seen on Pinterest and Facebook to the test we're gonna test those out am I going to show you which one's work and which ones that bacon hack success or broken failure we're going to be the judge I don't know about you but a lot of the comments that I get on my youtube channel say what do I do if I don't have a mixer I get that so much as well so much now I've never had to do this before and a couple of weeks ago I was at one of my best friend's houses she just had a baby we wanted whipped cream on top of our chocolate fudge sundaes but we weren't allowed to turn on the mixers because it would wake the baby right I'm not letting a baby stand in between me and cream on my sundae I'm just saying cream and a bottle fill carefully and you can use a mason jar here but I prefer a bottle and I will show you why soon you want to take it to about a third between a quarter and a third of the size of whatever bottle you're using you can go less if you like don't go more what am i reck'n I picked up the burning off generous that I also like the really sort of light thin bottles yeah they're easy to squeeze shake it you'll see that I've found myself a shake assistant but you'll know what it's done because you'll actually stop hearing it sound like liquid you're pretty much stop hearing it move around very much at all that's how you know it's getting thicker and firmer and ready to pipe hear that normal squashing no more splashing okay once you stop hearing it sound like liquid it's time to go sir remove lid take cupcakes which we prepared earlier and you're going to just blob on your now whip quick look at that but it's so cool isn't that cool don't even need a piping bag you don't even need a piping bag because we've used a drink bottle we're just going to blob on one two a little bit more and three some sprinkles Nick absolutely so incredibly cute really easy and it won't wake the baby and these are gonna taste delicious cuz they absolutely are come on we get to snack we've done like so many baking hacks right now hmm mm-hmm I feel like when you want fresh cream on a cupcake but you need to keep it refrigerated until the party you could just like keep it in the bottle take the cupcakes to the party and dollop don't dollop sprinkles done easy easy baking hack success that was really well timed I love that our second baking hack this one I've seen but I'm not confident it's gonna work so I've never even tried this we're trying it for the first time awesome yes I love it when you try things for the first time on camera right nothing can possibly go wrong right I have one cake so if we mess it up we have no going back dental floss to cut a cake perfectly so that your wedges are even I think this one's gonna work I think it is we gonna call this one the dental floss slice the floss cut the floss cut so dental floss a generous amount I'm going to put my thumbs either side I've got it wrapped tightly around my fingers I'm going to come straight down in the middle the idea here is that we should get perfect even sized wedges quite a bit of pressure I feel it I feel like we're bowing in the middle as your dentist would say once it's in slide slide slide I mean it feels good I think you look nice clean-cut now here's the question do I bring the dental floss back up or do I slide it out one side I think sliding it out would be the safest option I feel like a magician pulling out the tablecloth dental floss comes out clean free rap and straight across my god this is also do awesome isn't it and if this is the only way to cut a cake look how neat and sharp those slices are there's no nice imprint there's no dragging of the frosting I wonder how this would go on like a six layer mud cake and this is so quick and easy guys it takes no effort at all like it's just a slide and nobody is going to be complaining that Suzie next to me got a bigger slice than I got they're all perfectly even bro lucky Suzie I see the final slice and this will be the moment of truth because we've either done a great job or I haven't gone down far enough in the middle and the whole middle of the cake is not yet cut I'm pretty comfortable you're pretty confident thank you you have thing I do I'm gonna do this part all right I'm gonna do the honors let's see how good a job it doesn't work Nick's fault okay feels pretty good it looks great on top it's so smooth that is beautiful that is flawless what are we writing the floss cut I'm gonna say turnover time a ten out of ten I'm going to agree I have never seen such a beautiful neatly sliced piece of cake outside of a restaurant I'm giving the floss cut a ten out of ten our third breaking her okay guys so if you're at home and you don't have a cupcake tray you can use these emergency cupcake pans so they're basically just mason jar lids and we're going to pop that cupcake liners in the center and they'll come out perfect every time wait I would have never thought to do that it's so cool isn't it that's awesome and sometimes you have those mixes that like they don't do 12 but you also don't need 24 so you can just kind of do like 15 or services yeah so easy done and you have these beautiful cupcakes perfect that is an awesome hack and it means you can bake an extra couple for you and no one actually knows that got missing yes great idea now for our fourth bag you have this ones are super easy hack using a paper plate to keep yourself and your kitchen clean it from mixer splatter at least I feel like this is an excuse for you to use even what a melon plate you have been raving about it all day all right you know how I feel about watermelons and yes I found the cutest watermelon paper plates in the world so they are pretty cute this is basically just an excuse for that so we have keep mix with all of its ingredients we have a watermelon plate or any plates fine but if you can find watermelon you absolutely should with a very sharp knife and our electric mixes so I'm going to very carefully just drive a little hole kind of about the same distance apart roughly as my mixers be careful and then you want to take your mixers off your machine I think I see where you're going with it you do you do I'm making them a little watermelon catcher hood is so cute in goes or one mix-up kind of like that and it goes the next it's a muscle into it and then you can fit them back onto the betta if you need to make either of the holes a little bit bigger you can but I actually judged pretty accurately I know if I do say so myself the watermelon guided me push them in until they click and then you've created your very own splatter guard this is genius this is genius and it's watermelon I'll give you guys a peek hey crank it up besides you want no just storm no voice just splatter okay lease there is zero evidence we've been in the kitchen there is almost zero evidence but the watermelon plate tells a different story that's the mess we saved warm our shirts from our benches and from our kitchen baking hack success and use of watermelon plate also success of course that's what it was really all about baking hack number five you got to love this one awesome so our cupcakes are baked and we're ready to frost them I'm going to show you guys the easiest way to fill up your piping bag without making a huge mess so we're going to grab a cup and this is the best way to fill up your piping bag hang on by the best way do you mean other than just like holding it and then trying to spatula in frosting and then having it slop over the sides better than that okay so you just put your bag in there it holds it up for you while you put your frosting in so we're going to put some lovely purple frosting in there nice purple this is no hands loose this is no hands yeah so I like to put my thumb's here as I bring the bag up get a bit of a shake no mess guys frost away show us a beautiful design nick is the cupcake master so if you follow the scran line you will know that this guy there is nothing he can't do with a cupcake and a frosting bag good crazy oh look at that oh look at that I can hear the sound of the frosting crackling through the tip so be is there a better sound know the river all right outstanding at baking hack look next hack baking hack number six so I had a room huh how about me know about frosting why I always advocate making your own cuz it's delicious sometimes you're out of time you need to cheat a little store-bought frosting isn't the worst thing in the world no no so I have heard and I have never put to the test that if you whip this with an electric beater it will actually double in yield you know what that means doubling your money exactly more buck for your baking so we're going to put this to the test we are going to flop up our frosting according to I don't even know where I saw this Pinterest now in theory not only is this going to be lighter and fluffier but it's also going to be better for us how is it going to be better for us double size half the calories half the fat half the sugar plus as many I like the way you do math Elise kind of do too all right here goes nothing double or nothing no one says how long you're supposed to do this for I think we might be done oh my god at least that looks so fluffy it looks fluffy and it looks like it doesn't look double let's put it to the test alright we're gonna scoop it back into its jaw so that we can test this theory check out the color change though I actually just prefer the color it looks like chocolate mousse it totally those I'm just about set up great mom's okay it's super light it's super fluffy we're gonna put it all the way back in I know this defeats the purpose but if you're gonna have double as much you're gonna have to store it well it's about a third mono not seeing a double alright I don't think we can call that double I'm pretty sure that we can call that adds about four percent to the yield of your can of four well it doesn't look like it's double ace but it looks like it's double the youngness it does alright it's lighter and it's fluffier and it's an all-around better color it actually looks a bit more Piper ball but that is it baking that fail whoever said that this worked shame on you now if you guys have done this and you have doubled it let us know in the comment section below what you actually did to double your frosting did I not beat it long enough like wrong brand vanilla versus chocolate because a ton of people have told me that this works and I mean I was all geared up to have two cupcakes after dinner instead of just one but I don't think I can guys cheer Elise up in the conversation my cupcake diet dreams have been shattered we're on baking hack number seven guys whenever you guys see me here I'm always super organized but when I'm home by myself baking I am never ever ever capable of remembering to take my ingredients out of the fridge and bring them all to room temperature I think I'm guilty of that it's incredibly important to cook with room-temperature ingredients and eggs one time I tried to microwave an egg to bring it to room temperature it was possibly the stupidest thing I've ever done so if you guys want to bring eggs from cold in the fridge to room temperature you want to take a bowl of hot water not boiling boiling water will crack your egg hot water more than warm place your eggs into the water in a little bath they look like they're having such a beautiful time it's for you there's a salts some salts a little snorkel give those about 5 minutes the warm waters going to gently not so many you can literally warm them all the way through to the middle and they're ready to bank with and guys it's really important to make sure that you're using room-temperature ingredients when you're making cake it just helps your cake come out so much nicer if the recipe doesn't say it should be called everything should be room temperature everydayness hmm unless the rooms really cold think body temperature think average temperature what is room temperature when it's snowing outside it's cold it could be like when you test to see if a baby's bottle is ready just like test it test it on the wrist it like will you stick your finger on it and it doesn't feel hot or cold yeah that makes sense does anyone have a degrees like a sill C esperen height degrees you know what room temperature actually whether you test them how do you test that cuz I just moved to a new house and I did room temperature the other day I had to microwave my butter because it was room temperature but it was freezing yeah yeah this is a problem we need to sort this out leave a comment down below guys warming up your eggs without the use of a microwave complete baking hardship baking hack success ok guys so if you're deciding to bake something special on the weekend and you run out of cupcake liners which has happened to me so many times what do you do you make your own so I've got some parchment paper here which I've just cut out into a circle doesn't have to be perfect we've got a small glass here which I'm just going to use to shape my little cupcake liners and I'm going to put a slightly bigger glass over the top or a top you can pretty much use anything you find in the kitchen we're just going to help shape it in there take it out I want to see how this is gonna turn out oh my god it's actually a little cupcake cake

oh these are the greatest pieces these are the greatest is in the world [Music] hey guys welcome back a couple of weeks ago I posted a video on these really weird piping tips called Russian piping tips and you guys went crazy for it I think over a million people watched it in the course of a couple of weeks which is a lot so I asked you guys if you want to me to you some of the other Russian piping tips because there are several and you all said yes these are the ones that we used in the last video you can check that video out if you want to see all of the flowers and tulips but today we're using bold tips yeah that's what they call Russian bold tips if you guys have missed some of my updates you might not know that I've recently launched a second channel for old crafts DIY and really fun home ideas as well as a few sway streets with some of my friends you can check out the sweeter side it's relatively new and it's a little bit different to what we do here at my cupcake addiction but if you guys love all of this stuff I'm sure you're gonna love everything over there I've got a batch of my buttercream frosting and I've colored mine all sorts of colors I've got some purple some yellow some blue and some pink and I've also just got some pre-made cupcake I'm going with a chocolate cupcake recipe if you have my sweet celebrations cookbook you can get both the frosting and cake recipes from there otherwise I'll link to my youtube videos for those down below I ordered vite online and they came in this very sexy snap steel bag no instructions nothing else really with them so you and I are going to learn as we go this is literally the first time I've opened them let's take a look and see what we get in the bag so in this kit I get 11 piping tips which is just an annoying number for a baker because everything should either be 12 or 13 and I also get a couple of I'm not going to do all of these I'm just going to find a good cross section because I find there's basically two or three different types and then just different sizes in others so we're going to pick oh this guy this guy he looks kind of now we'll do this guy this guy and this guy it's like choosing my favorite children these ones here I'm going to put aside because they just look like variations on those other guys but if you want me to make a video with those I feel like it's going to be much the same as this one but let me know and I'm happy to the couple of it came with these guys is actually like a little tricolor coupler if you don't have that do not worry it works just the same with a regular couple or even just with a clean piping bag so I'm going to pick my first victim this guy stick it on the end and add my coupler over top screwing it on to make multicolored frosting I actually prefer without these weird little frosting dividers because I think you get a really nice marbled effect if you don't keep the colors totally separate so I've got my piping tip in my piping bag and I'm just going to take a scoop of yellow and you'll see that I just kind of like wipe it off against my hand so that it stays on that side of the bag then we'll tilt the bag next to my yellow I'm going to put my blue because yellow and blue make green so I should get a nice little combination of marbled color there and it goes as far down as I can the last colors the hardest if anyone out there has OCD you'll notice that all of my spatula colors are completely wrong for the colors of frosting I apologize push that down a little so with all these frostings you want to try and keep them at about the same distance down the bag and finally my pink if you last color it's sometimes easier to still lay it on the bench skew this one down so now I'm going to take those colors and I'm just going to kind of Pat them around and not too much so they start to blend into each other a little bit and then I'm going to pipe a little bit out into this bowl so that I can a do a little bit of spoil practice but B get rid of any single colors till I've got all of those colors coming through piping tip number one is going to be this guy so if I could describe it as like one of the widest openings but it's the wavy one not the straight one I'm going to take my cupcake and apparently with these all you need to do is squeeze and twist back and then forward and then fast and then forward to create almost like this really cool ruffled rippled high-flow have it all this is a flaw in the design or if it's just a bonus opportunity for us but they have like a hole in the end when you pull the piping tip away I'm going to add some mini M&amp;Ms into my crusting cavity in-case-of-emergency fill hole with gumball so my next well instead of rocking back and forth I mean to see what happens if I attach to the cupcake and then just swirl twisting the cupcakes just one way into kind of a high swirl what we end up with is like a little tie-dyed single swirl effect and it almost closes up that hole in the middle if you have any issues with those little holes immunity is a paintbrush to kind of cope the frosting into place and I think that one needs anything on top and then finally I'm going to try like a really low swirl so for this guy again always resting the ball of the piping tip in the center of the cupcake I'm going to twist it one way kick back one and then go back that first way again but that's why I'm going to stop I'm not going to lift I'm going to keep it nice and low this looks super cute too again with that little hole in the middle so let's top it with an M&amp;M there's always room for M&amp;M piping tip number one's awesome I really like the different designs we got out of that but I think it looks so cute with the rainbow frosting effect let's try this guy in the coupler so this one here is a slightly narrow and it doesn't have the wave I presume it's going to do a very similar result but it's only going to have the three colors so let's give a difference in marbling that frosting as opposed to having it come out separately you have three little compartments for our coupler how many three colors in there so I'm going with purple pink and blue again with the ball from the piping tip in the center of the cupcake and I'm going to rock back and forth and back and forth but keep this one quite nice and low this is a pretty skinny opening in the end of this piping kit so the leaves are really fine but this looks a lot like a little flower I'm going to put another M&amp;M over that hole in the middle some people might see a hole in the middle of cupcakes as a floor but I just see it as an opportunity to add candy all right number three this is the beauty of using it top plate you just hop off the first piping tip and stick in the second piping tip at all of your frostings ready to go so this piping keeps pretty similar to the last one but it's got a slightly fatter opening on the sides and it's got like a little star sort of opening for the frosting to come at the middle so wondering if this one won't have the hole in the center when we're done again it's starting in the center of the cupcake but don't press it into the cupcake or you'll get cupcake in the end of that tip and it won't let the frosting out cut I'm going to rock back and forward and back and forward while also lifting the piping bag to get kind of a higher twirl getting the frosting on these it's not the problem getting the piping tip out without making a mess of the frosting in the middle seems to be the issue I still see the hole in the middle so I'm not sure what a purpose for that little extra opening at the end of that piping tip is but I like this style and I think that the slightly flatter opening is just a nicer result I'm going to top that one with a little bit of rock candy and for this I want to try out similar to the first lot of Russian piping tip what happens if we just try to do like a dollop on a cupcake no rockin no swirling it doesn't work Dola being on a cupcake does not work this is not the best result so I guess these ones are more for like the ruffle little things well we tried right the piping tip number four also has like a little star opening at the end but it's got little ridges or ripples in the side opening so it should give us a really nice textured design for my frosting I want this to be sort of a different effect so I'm starting by just scraping blue frosting a thin layering on the outside of the entire bag using my spatula and then I'm going to take some yellow and I'm kind of going to apply that so essentially I'm like painting the inside of the bags but leaving the center free then you can take I'm going to use pink and just dollop it in the middle so this is going to be like mainly pink but with those hints of blue and yellow which will actually graduate to a greeny color on the outside let's see how this looks all right first up I'm going to try the high swirl I'm super interested to see how this turns out so I'm going to rock back and forward back and forward back and forth and again I'm lifting my piping tip as I go that's what's going to give us a high I'm going to try this again with the low as well and see how it looks but instead of going back and forth this time I start in the middle of the cupcake and I'm just going to sort of twist the whole cupcake in the one direction also while lifting my piping tip which is kind of like patting your head and rubbing your stomach at the same time but we can manage this one I'm not such a fan of I think it looks a little messy but that could also just be the frosting colors honestly not the nicest well I've seen but I'm going to top it with a gumball emoji anyway again I want to attempt to just do a straight squeeze dollop with this piping tip just to see everywhere no no it does not work all right the straight dollop with the Russian ball tips is nowhere near as cute as the straight dollop with the flat Russian piping tip this is the last tip that I'm going to try in this video and this is similar to the last one so it's got the ripples all around the outside edges but the outside edge openings are a little bit bigger and there's not a star at the end I'm going all in for rainbow with this so I'm just going to put in blobs of each of my color and you'll notice that I sort of wiped them up against each side of the piping bag and then push them all down so they all get down to that piping tip at about at the same time give it a little squeeze at the end to make sure you can see all the colors of your rainbow and I'm going to try a couple of designs with this so first up I'm going to do a really low twist but I'm just going to twist it once and I'm not going to go too crazy like I did with that last well well this looks really nice where the frosting pulls away we've actually got these almost little nobody called like overlapping wave type designs you can use a paintbrush to make that up if you need to and I'm going to put a bit of pink rocks candy in the middle of that one that's actually really pretty and really unusual but for my second one I'm going to do a low back and forward so similar to the first one that I did with the first tip you just want to attach in the middle and then rock back and forth and back and forth this one's really pretty this one's actually really pretty I'm still getting a hole in the middle so I'm going to put just a purple mm in that but this is actually possibly my favorite design of all of these Russian Bowl piping tips and of it is the color but it's gorgeous finally I'm going to try the high-back in forward frosting again so again I'm just going to attach it the middle and then I'm going to rock back and forward back and forth as the same time as I'm lifting that piping tip away from the cupcake to get high well this is pretty - oh yeah this is this one is my favorite piping tip the ripoli one with very star in the end is absolutely gorgeous I'm going to use the paintbrush just to neaten up the top sweater have to put anything on top of from but these three designs this piping tip is hands-down my absolute favorite that's the end of the ball tips and just between you and I in my opinion compared to those flower ones I think all of these are necessarily worth the investment as a whole extra set but I guess they do to a slightly different effect let me know what you thought down below let me know if you're thinking about purchasing the ball tips and I believe is also a set of super sharp pointy ruffle tips in this set so I'm going to film something with those give you my honest opinion and we'll see if they're worth the effort definitely Russian piping tips at number one the flat ones on the ball tips and who knows about those pointy ones make sure you subscribe to the channel if you're not already we upload new videos every week if you haven't already checked out my second channel this way decide I do tons of crafts over there and would love to see you guys stop by have an awesome day guys and thanks very much for watching [Music] you 
hey guys it's alysom welcome back to my cupcake addiction today waiting inspired by nature cacti are trending everywhere they're on par with watermelons and pineapples so I thought hey let's get on this trend and we're gonna DIY our very own cactus cupcakes alright the things you're going to need to make your cactus cupcakes I have got long thick pretzel rods I've also got some little terracotta pots so these guys I bought they're about a dollar each but you can reuse them and I've just baked regular cupcakes in regular cupcake liners and you just pop them straight in I've also got some melted green candy melts some little tiny flower sprinkles or you can make your own I've got a little bit of a pink buttercream frosting and I've got that in a disposable piping bag with just a really small star piping tip I'll leave a link to my buttercream frosting recipe down below in case you haven't made it before I've also got some large sized pretzels and I tried to pick some that are about the same thickness as my pretzel rods I think these ones might be Snyder's you're gonna need a paintbrush you need some scissors and a piece of parchment let's get started the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to break up one of our large pretzels now this guy you kind of want this little side and this little side I don't even know how to describe which shapes they are so go off this alright I'm going to break off just the side and the other side then you want to grab one of your pretzel rods try to find a reasonably straight one and we're going to use the whole rod we're going to break it at the end so we've kind of got a bit of a handle to work with so with your pretzel pieces you've got a slightly more kind of a curved edge and then sort of a straighter edge it's the straighter edge that's going to go against your pretzel stick sort of like that but we need to trim it off a little bit all right I'm gonna trim this side so that it's nice and flat I'm going to use scissors for this that's going to help us get a nice stick to the main pretzel rod and I'm going to trim this top guy off just a little bit at a time yes I'm using scissors here and we're just going to size it up against the pretzel still a little bit too curved we can do better another little chunk off don't trim all of the curve because you kind of want a little bit of it something like that is looking pretty good we're going to do that with both of those pieces now you just want to lay them I like to put one a little bit higher and one a little bit lower so they're not perfectly even or it'll look a bit like a trident and lay them down beside if you need to you can just sort of shave off a little bit of the sides just to get kind of a nice angle so place them down beside you want a really nice flush fit between the long pretzel and the little curved pretzel pieces all right now it's time to candy melt so get your parchment paper at the ready and I'm going to get the end that's going to go against my piece of parchment dip it in a generous amount of candy and then lay both of those pieces together as they're going to form on my piece of parchment this guy's a little bit lower one and this guy's a little bit higher one don't be stingy on the candy here guys we need a fair bit to glue this in place all right you want to let that one there completely set so give that at least five minutes you can pop it in the fridge if it's on a tray but I wouldn't recommend moving it too much because you don't want to break those little candy pieces off once your little cactus is all nice and set we're actually going to paint it we're not going to dip it for two reasons one because it's going to be more stable and two because then we're going to get some nice texture like on a real cactus so I'm going to dip a nice wide paintbrush and it's kind of got like a flat bristled brush and it's pretty wide I'm going to dip that into my candy melts give it a little stir to make sure they're nice and fluid and then I'm going to carefully paint over my cactus be really careful as you go over these two side pieces they do have a tendency to break if they do just paint them anyway and you can reattach them and then paint over any of your mistakes after the fact I like to do one nice kind of a just a light rough coat of this and you can go over and give it a second coat and I'm going to paint all the way down the pretzel rod so that I've got just enough room to kind of hold on to you want about that much to go into the cupcake I'm probably going to break it about here but then it also has to be quite tall above the cupcake so it needs to be about double the height of your cupcake or a little more perfect that's my little first coat but I can still see pretzel through so that first coat will have started to set and then I'm just going to go and give it another coat so I can't see any pretzel poking through my little pretzel cactus try to take special care and attention just around these little under joins so that it kind of looks like it's flowing you don't have like a really rigid kind of a poking outside so you sort of smooth it off a bit and then before it sets I'm going to take one little flower for my little cacti flower and I'm going to place it just on one of my sides perfect you can lay that on parchment to set but if you lay it on parchment you're going to get a slightly flat back you can just paint over that a little bit later once it sets if you're pressed for time but I'm just going to hold mine so that it stays perfect and round and I get that texture all the way around both the front and the back of my cactus will be a couple of minutes alright my cactus is really nice and set front and back really nice and round and textured so now I'm going to take the cupcake out of the terra cotta pot tip it out and I'm just going to use a pretzel stick and I'm just going to drive a little hole in the center of my cupcake so I've got like a little guide hole alright once you've got your little guide hole because my cupcakes just slightly shallower than my pot and I want to make sure that my whole things not too top-heavy I'm just going to take my scissors and just kind of stab through the very bottom of my cupcake case carefully test is going to allow the cactus to go all the way to the bottom of the pot and it's just going to weigh and balance everything properly you want to take your cactus now and you're going to size it up so I know that I want my cactus to be about that tall off the top so I've done I think a pretty good job of working out where to break it carefully break it alright you've got your little end of cactus and now you can just place it through your cupcake I think that looks pretty good I'm happy with the height of my cactus now I'm going to use my star piping tip and I mean you guys you can crush up some white cookies do a bit of frosting make it look like an actual desert but I want to might be a bit brighter more fun and more colorful because that's just how I roll so then I'm just going to take my star piping tip and my bright pink frosting and I'm just going to pipe tiny little stars all over kind of a little bit spiky I want them to look I mean spiky and cactus see I guess so as I squeezed I'm just joining onto the cupcake and then pull up quickly so I get kind of a nice little pointed top have you done we have made cactus cupcakes without having to spend $20 on these very cute but kind of expensive little cactus candles and it's adding some salted crunchy pretzel into a delicious frosting covered cupcake I love these guys cactuses are everywhere right now get on this trend as only my cupcake addiction knows how and make yourself some cactus cupcakes today if you're not already subscribed to the channel make sure you do for two new videos every week let me know in the comments below what you'd like to see me make next and as always guys thanks very much for watching you 
if my my cha fish can i mom I see a fish [Music] when I was nine I used to swim in my pool with my legs tied together which actually is not very safe and seeing every single song from The Little Mermaid first cartoon I ever learned all the words to all of the songs as well as the movie to today's mermaid cake is inspired by the beautiful Ariel and one of my all-time favorite Disney movies when I first started my youtube channel my niece challi was five years old and she started a YouTube channel too if you guys want to go and check out charli's crafty kitchen then out 11 and 9 they're going to show you guys how to make amazing super cute mermaid tail cupcakes to perfectly complement the mermaid tail cake this is pretty cakey there's a candy well yeah they actually in question yeah I'm gonna leave a link to that video down below or you can click to watch the video so make sure you check it out and hit them up with Ally chef pretty awesome kids and they're kind of amazing little bakers alright the things you're gonna need to make your way over the top mermaid tail cake I've got a double batch of my buttercream frosting I'll leave a link to that recipe down below if you don't have a good frosting recipe but I don't recommend store-bought frosting for this case I've colored mine in four different mermaid e-type colors so I went with a lighter blue and a darker blue a purple and a green but it also left about a half a cup of frosting uncoloured because I need just a little bit of white for this cake I've got three six-inch chocolate mud cake so this is just under a double batch of the mud cake recipe from the sweet celebrations cookbook otherwise it's also up here on my youtube channel again I will leave a link to that recipe down below you're going to have now to do three of these 16 smoke cake and that it doesn't also cupcake one you'll need for the cake and the rest you'll need to make the cupcakes from the charli's crafty kitchen channel so we've got you covered you guys have the option here so I've got some browned piping tips if you have four of these definitely go ahead and it doesn't matter what size but I'm actually gonna make this cake without them so you can know how to do it either way I've also made you guys a mermaid tail template so you're going to need two copies of those some scissors a bamboo skewer and a little glue first up you want to start with nice chilled cakes so once they're baked and you've let them cool on the bench pop them off into either the fridge or the freezer for about an hour so you're working with quite a cool chillz cake trust me it'll carve a lot easier for you I'm going to use a serrated edge knife and I'm just going to trim off the very top of my cake so I kind of make it flat on top but don't discard that top layer at the moment and then you can either use the cake leveler here or just go by I I'm going to divide my cake in half I'm going to repeat that for all three of my cakes so that I have six layers that are six inches round and about an inch or so high and I'm not discarding any of those tops because you kind of need to add those on just to round out the very top of your mermaid tail plus one cupcake I'm building my cake on a cake board but you could also use a plate or something here and I'm going to start by just putting down a little schmear of buttercream frosting that's just going to stick our cake in place so pop your first layer of cake down and then a really nice thin crumb coat this just picks up any of those chocolaty crumbs so that you can add a nicer coat of frosting on top so when you cut the cake it's a little cleaner to look at in the middle and you don't have crumbs in these pretty colors of frosting stack up all of the rest of your cakes repeating that process and I chose to put different colors of mermaidy colored frosting in between each of my layers that's going to make sure that I have about an even amount of frosting left over to actually ask the outside of the cake but it also just looks cute when you cut it when you get to the top you want to add a little more frosting to stick your little like cake scrap so goes on top and then take your cupcake out of cupcake liner a little frosting on top and pop it upside down your cake should look like a weird tall cone pop that off into the fridge for about 15 minutes or so just to let your buttercream two steps as always with these cakes the cooler they are the easier they are for you to carve and frost especially because we didn't use any center support in the middle of this cake normally I would on a six layer cake but because I'm using mud cake which I know is firmer and more stable and because my cake papers at the top so much I'm confident that I don't need it if you're transporting this a long distance you might want to check out maybe my Tinker Bell cake where I've actually showed you guys how to stack and support cakes before using straws and a little centre board I don't think we need it for this one using a serrated knife because it's easier to carve I'm just going to cut away any like kind of sharpish edges so the base of the cupcake and then kind of the top edges of that last cake layer but don't go too crazy here you want it to be kind of a cone shape with the frosting technique that we're going to use leaves a lot of room for error I'm going to crumb coat my cake so using an offset spatula I'm just going to press a really thin layer of frosting almost into the cake so back and forward and back and forth picking up any of those crumbs and encasing my cake in delicious frosting I'm using my teal frosting here you could also use your purple but don't use either of your blues because you're going to need those to make a little bit of a water effect put your chrome coated cake into the fridge for about 15 minutes because cold cake is always a little bit easier to work on and while you're doing that you can fill all of your piping bags I've got four disposable piping bags and like I said you can use a round piping tip but because I know that a lot of you guys aren't going to have four Brown piping tips all in the same size you can actually do this without a piping tip I'm going to cut the end off my first piping bag and then I'm going to use that end as a bit of a template so that I cut the exact same amount of each of my four piping bags you don't want to have different size scales here so doing this just make sure that all of your piping bag openings are the same size with frosting in all four of your five in bags and your cake semi chilled it's time to do this scale technique you guys might have seen me do this technique on my Beauty and the Beast cupcakes video not so long ago or you might have also seen it on my Sleeping Beauty cake basically you're placing like a dot or a blob the technical term and then you want to dry through that dot to sort of create like a long tail on it so essentially you squeeze the frosting onto the cake and then you drag the bag upwards you can see it gives you like this effect of almost like a little streak or frosting with a slightly fatter rounded bottom that's going to be a scale effect I'm just going to alternate between all of my colors so some blue some purple some lighter blue a little bit of that tle color and these don't have to be in any particular order it actually looks better if they're a little random if your frosting streaks about an inch long you want to start that next row about half an inch from the bottom I'm going to keep piping that technique all the way around the outsides of my cake you can go in just to all of your dark blue scales in a row and then all of your light blue scales but I would suggest picking row to row and making sure that you're keeping those rows pretty even so they're to be perfect but you don't your scales to be too far out of alignment I actually used purple as my least dominant color because I think it ended up looking really nice just peeking through all of those greens blues and teals when you get to the very top you'll need length of those little petal frosting dots as you go but when you get to the very very top you just want to neaten it up so I'm just going to pipe some very small petals and I'm dragging that piping bag right into the middle so they almost make like a little pinwheel effect and overlap each other slightly bear in mind the width of the top of your mermaid tail template here if you need to trim it trim it but you don't want that frosting at the top to be remarkably fatter than the mermaid tail itself you kind of want it to flow nicely before the tail I'm going to show you guys with super simple technique for water so I'm just going to use my spatula to really just smear like patches of white buttercream frosting in no particular order and then because they're already in piping bags I'm going to pop on some long streaks of my lighter blue frosting and then just some haphazard kind of streets of my darker blue frosting again with the offset spatula I'm just going to kind of work it back and forth and you want to make sure that you're getting like that nice sort of rippling wavy effect this is also a great spot if you've got to need spaces at the bottom of your cake that you want to cover up add a little water to the side of that thing like it's splashing up the side of the mermaid tail it can cover any number of I'm going to take this guy and stick it straight down it's beautiful this is an awesome cake to make because it's actually really simple and because it's curved it around using fondant for the tail it really is a fuss free option if you guys are looking for a really cool little mermaid inspired cake can help you're like sushi a wonderful watch is cake that I like sushi and fish fingers Wow let's taste delicious my man take a listen although maybe the chocolate one 
hey guys it's Elise and welcome back to my cupcake addiction so a year ago when I had a hundred thousand followers on Instagram one of my best friends bought me this shirt and she made me promise that I would wear it when and if I had a million followers I was like yeah sure no problems as if that's ever gonna happen but as it turns out it just did so we think in a million followers it's okay to wear a shirt that says I'm kind of a big deal on Instagram I'm super excited thank you to everyone that follows me over there it's amazing being able to have somewhere that I can just literally share fun photos of sweet treats from all around the place and thanks to all of you guys tag me in your photos cuz I love seeing the things that you guys bake now Instagram also changed their logo Instagram when you change your logo it affects us all my surprise inside rainbow Instagram cake is now completely obsolete and we needed to update the Instagram offering so today I'm going to show you how to make little Instagram candy bars I'm going to show you how to get that kind of cool marbled rainbow logo in a little chocolate Instagram candy bar package let's get started so you're going to need candy bars choose your favorites I've gone with Kinder Bueno Snickers and Twix bars you're also going to need white chocolate I don't recommend candy melts here purely because there's quite a lot going on and white chocolate just tastes a bit better and I've colored mine myself using oil or powder based food colorings so I've got pink orange purple yellow and blue if you're wondering why they're all sitting over here to tray this tray is actually filled with boiling water and that's just helping to keep everything at temperature so I don't have to keep on microwaving them but I'm also going to show you a cool trick with that as we get started on our little Instagram logos I've got some white fondant a fondant roller and a little bit of corn flour to roll out and I've got a few different tools so I've got two different sized square cutters one small circle cutter and as my other super small circle cutters I'm using piping tips I can leave dimensions of those down below I've also got this square brownie tin I've had this for ages and I had no idea that it was going to come in so handy for doing things like Instagram and Facebook and Apple logos so we're gonna be using that today let's get into it first thing you want to do is prepare your candy bars so for my buenos they always have a tendency to kind of break in the middle anyway I'm gonna push them to the side you want each of them in sections of two so basically where they would normally break and then just trim them so they're really nice and flat whenever you're doing this you want to size it up against your pan it has to not only fit inside the pan it actually has to have room on either side of all four edges so that you can drag the outsides of your Instagram logo and you don't have chocolate poking through the sides your Beunos are going to go in sets of two so that's one finger of guano per Instagram candy bar and then your Snickers bar I think I worked out you've got to cut it just slightly less than half now looking at those two I found they were just a little bit too wide so they're sort of the right length but they're a bit too wide and I want them to be joined together nicely so I'm going to take I don't even know how much that is it's a delicious amount just a thin little side of each of my halves of Snickers and if you ask me the Snickers is actually your best value so if you're going to choose which one of these you eat I would go the Snickers because you're only getting half of winner and you're only getting half of Twix but you're getting a whole Snickers almost a whole Snickers and then for the Twix the same as the burner you just want to slice your two halves in half so you end up with four pieces and again just sizing them up to make sure they're going to fit perfect now one thing that's problematic can always be your chocolate setting at the worst possible moments so I invented this strategy yesterday as I was prepping these and it works brilliantly boiling water into a tray do not attempt to move the tray at all while that water is still boiling because trays this size full of boiling water are almost impossible to move without scalding yourself in goes my metal tin that's going to keep the base of my metal tin nice and hot while I go through my process and it's going to keep all of my chocolate melted for these we need the chocolate to kind of blend together so it's imperative that they stay melted I recommend having your phone nearby because it does pay to be able to reference the actual Instagram logo while you're doing this so I'm going to just put spoonfuls of my colors in and around my tray and around the same spaces that they are on the logo but opposite so you need to remember when we tip these out there's going to be a Image effect happening so if you put the blue exactly where it is on the logo in the pan like this it's going to be on the opposite side when we turn them out I'm going to start with blue in my top right corner because I know I want it to be top left and just about a half quarter to a half of a teaspoon just in the top corner try not to let it dribble onto other areas I mean doesn't matter if a little bit does but try not to let it go out of its little zone too much my next color is going to be purple in the top opposite side and I'm going to making six today because I only need six I found it easiest to then go to the bottom half and then you can kind of fill the middle in with the pink once you've got all your fault corners accounted for and then the orange kind of goes like in a bit of a long line I'm going to say a long line if that's the technical term around that yellow kind of a streak and then finally you can fill it in with the pink if you have any areas like this guy where there's actually quite a bit of the orange use a toothpick or something just to tidy that orange up a bit my husband wanted me to say out loud in this video that these were his idea but I won't not quite the Instagram logo yet I'm going to carefully pull that tin out and the tops are warm they're not super hot and I'm just gonna wipe the base with a towel so it ended up getting water everywhere I'm making a big mess I'm done with my tray so to move it I'm just gonna carefully slide it very carefully water in a tray has a life of its own okay now the first thing you want to do is shake it all about we want to try and sort of mesh those guys in together a little bit and then I'm going to take just a skewer toothpick and you're just going to you want to make sure that you get all the way down to the bottom but kind of do just a few figure eights through it'll look super marbled on top but it won't look that marbled underneath beautiful let's get to candy stuffing so you want all of the flat sides of your candy going against the top of your Instagram so effectively your candy bar is going to be upside down candy bars but that's so that you don't have any of these peaks and risers poked through that on top section of your little Instagram candy bars keep them as close together as possible for the sides on the top it doesn't matter so much if it's not the exact colors so I'm just going to take any two and just put two colors of chocolate together in a bag and kind of use all of that up and then move on to the next two I like to do the two colors because it kind of completes that tie-dyed II kind of look cut off a generous tip and pipe it in nice and firm amount of pressure around those outside edges because you want to make sure that you don't have any gaps or air bubbles in between the top of your Instagram logo and the sidewalls and then just fill it in try to keep it just below the line of the outside of the little candy mold alright give that one a couple of taps on the bench just gently and pop it off into the fridge for at least 30 minutes to set while those are up in the fridge setting there's no need to wait for them to be finished before we make all of our little Instagram details so sprinkle down a little bit of corn flour or corn starch and I think you could also just pipe around a template and make these out of white chocolate but the fun that's going to be neater smoother and whiter roll that fondant as thin as you can really don't want it too thick or else it's going to look all chunky on top of our logos and then I've got my two square cutters I'll leave dimensions of fees down below but you want them really really close together so you can kind of see the differentiation in size on those two I'm going to cut a small square and then I'm going to cut a large square around the outside edge so with the small square you can remove it and that enables you to be able to look overhead and actually see that you're getting it nice and square so all of your sides are even I rub my cookie cutter gently back and forward and then I'm just going to release and leave it where it is on the little piece of board try not to move it around too much out of the center piece you're going to use your small circle cutter cut out one little Shutter circle and then the larger of my piping tips is going to go on the center and cut out the middle and this one here it's pretty easy to get it back into shape but you want to make sure that it's nice and not ridgey around the edges and then finally press at that square so you've got a really thin piece and then use your little tiny round cutout to cut out that little shutter that goes in the very top section you'll probably need something to pop it at the end because those ones tend to get stuck taking that and again just neaten off the edges so it's really nice and round and pop it over with your larger circle after about thirty minutes you should have all of your decorations setting and ready to go for let's see how a little Instagram logo candy bars have turned out always the most exciting and nerve-wracking part so I'm just going to press gently underneath ah they're so close to being done so you can see you've got kind of that marbled edge on the sides it's not perfect but it's close enough these guys are all about the top I love the little rounded edge that that pan gives them just like the actual Instagram logo but let's stick our shutters on and finish off our Instagram candy bars I've got a paintbrush and just a little bit of water so I'm just going to paint just a small amount of water on the back all four sides when you put on that little shutter circle make sure that you're leaving enough space on the side so that you can fit in your little flash and when you do put on the little flash circle that's actually what defines the orientation so make sure that you're looking at these are so incredibly cute I can't even stand it one of the things that I love most is that you could actually color code the backs of them to the candy bars that they are this was an awesome way of celebrating a million of you guys on Instagram thank you guys for watching if you don't already subscribe to the channel make sure you do for two new videos every week and as always thanks very much for watching you and now the moment of truth we taste you got a taste which one will I get Snickers 
who's this Jacob Chrisman ah daddy it's Santa it's you you're Santa poor old Ed's got a couple of grace but I don't think he's quite Santa wallet welcome back to another my cupcake addiction I'm Elise straw and today we're going to be making an edible advent calendar why count down the days with paper and cardboard when you could count down the days with cookies and candy I know those things first as we go into the new year if you guys are not subscribe to the channel you won't see videos for me and if you want to see all of my videos make sure you click on the little bell beside the subscribe button and opt to get notifications YouTube shows you guys videos in different ways and less and less people are able to see my videos so if you guys want to make sure you keep seeing them make sure you click on that notification email and you'll never miss a single one now of course I have Christmas pretty much covered in my new cookbook so if you haven't already ordered a copy it is the perfect Christmas gift idea but for now let's start our countdown in a very sweet way let's move on to our edible advent calendar to make your calendar you're going to need cookie dough this is the recipe from my book but I'll also leave a link to it down below I'm using a 12 piece regular size muffin or cupcake pan some snaps your bags a round cookie cutter white candy melts or melted white chocolate I'm using Jolly Ranchers you can use any hard candy and some smaller Christmas cookie cutters matter about an inch big each as well as candy to stuff inside your delicious advent calendar I've said this before you should always work with chilled cookie dough you might need to just knead it a little bit so it's soft and pliable when it comes out of the refrigerator sprinkle down a little bit of plain flour or all-purpose flour and roll it out and you'll notice that I give it a couple of rolls then kind of move it around a little bit that's just to stop it from sticking to the bench but it also make sure I get a really nice even roll when it's still pretty thick I'm going to slide a piece of parchment straight underneath and I'm going to roll the rest of it out on the parchment this is what's moving around now I don't recommend using a scungy old baked in burnt on tray I got a nice red one red green white pink colors of Christmas literally go for one that's really clean I've got a circle cutter look mine's the perfect size to go on the top if you've got a set of circle cutters you can measure it out but every muffin tent or cupcake tray is going to be a little bit different you can even do this with minis I'm going to cut out 12 circles and I'm cutting them on the tray on the parchment so that I can remove the excess rather than having to pick up each of my little individual circles once they're cut saves them stretching out of shape so for this recipe my 12 with a bit of scraps is 1/2 of a batch of the cookie dough recipe from my book so it's up to you if you want to make a few of these extra as gifts or if you want to mix up a whole batch and just stick the other half in the freezer it's Christmas time there's baking to be done now I'm going to take my smaller cookie cutters and I'm going to cut little shapes all sorts of little shapes out of the center of each of my round cookies I'm going to bake those because more cookies is always better now these guys need to be nice and cold and because I've spent a bit of time rolling and cutting I'm going to refrigerate them for 15 minutes before they go off into a moderate oven 175 Celsius or 350 Fahrenheit for 5 minutes they won't be completely cooked but that's when we can add our stained-glass effect all right so they're not fully baked here and you want to move relatively quickly and don't touch the pan it is hot I've got crushed up Jolly Ranchers you want to crush them up not too long before you want to use them because they have a tendency to stick together and now I'm just going to fill each of my little holes with Jolly Rancher crushing Linder's helps them distribute a little bit better so when they melt they just melt down a little bit more evenly you're going to pop those back off into the oven for about three to five minutes but definitely no longer than five flew Jolly Rancher will start to burn amazing gorgeous Jolly Rancher infused stained-glass cookies of course these are great by themselves if you just want to hand them out or even use them as ornaments but we're going to take it one step further and use them to make our edible advent calendar while these guys are cooling down I can definitely get to work stuffing my tray with all of my favorite candies or gifts but don't overstuff them because we want the cookies to sit in nice and flush now I chilled my cookies in the freezer because I'm impatient they only took about five minutes and now I'm going to add a little bit of melted white chocolate or white candy melt into a zip sealed bag and just snip off the ends make a bit of a piping to put them in you want to pipe your white chocolate all the way around the outside of the room and don't worry if it's a little messy because then you're going to run your finger around just to clean up the outer edges place the cookie gently in so that it's pretty straight and it should stick nicely within the confines of each of your little muffin cups I finish mine off by just adding a cute little bow to the top that I attached with a little bit of glue and there are I hear something jiggling I hear treasure jiggling here are our advent calendar cookies in there is all kinds of candy this is a super fun thing to make bake and give away at Christmas time but I can't wait for my kids to come and have a look because I feel like they're going to be smashing little stained-glass windows left right and center the only windows that I'm okay with them smashing do you guys know how to get to the candy inside yes punch it yes well I'm not maybe we smash it yes shake one hmm you take one now you should yeah would it just smashed through just the little glass window see Jake you want to smash one smash the starfish then like this bang bang I'm gonna give him a little you're the big brother give him up shall we see what candies inside yeah but minty one well we hope you guys enjoyed today's video as much as we loved making it if you not already subscribe to the channel make sure you do for new videos every week and as always guys thanks very much for watching did anyone save me one huh 
we're making one huge Samoa with a singular beer tomorrow we're making a big one [Music] I'm a little new to this whole us thing so the other day when a couple of girls started chasing me down the street begging me to buy cookies I got a little freaked out but I did follow them and buy cookies Girl Scout cookies you guys I don't know if these are a worldwide thing but they're definitely a staple in the u.s. at this time of year I often force Samoas because they sounded delicious and they absolutely were shortbread coconut caramel chocolate like how could they get any better this is how they could get that up I'm going to show you guys how to make your own stem always at home I want to make it a bunch of them we're making one huge Samoa with a singular beer semi we're making a big one of those I'm going to make my giant Samoa in a bundt pin but if you had one of those giant donut mold that would work really well sir I've got some plain flour some butter a little baking powder some salt sugar caramel choose these the soft ones and we're going to melt them to milk dark chocolate and some shredded coconut first up you got to make a shortbread so this is a really nice classic shortbread if you don't have a good recipe I'm going to take my butter and sugar pop them into my bowl and then beat them until they're light and fluffy light and fluffy so when I say cream I'm talking like buttercream frosting creams it should be light and white and fluffy so now you will take a salt and your baking powder and pop them into your flour like so and I'll just stir those monsters perfect into the creamed mixture so you're wet and dry go together and you can just dump the whole lot in this is going to be really hard on your mixer so just mix it until your mixer starts to struggle a little bit and then we'll handy the rest Savan all those Vidia or you'll have a flower explosion sounds kind of pretty the choir explosion it's not I'm just going to mix that through a little bit more with my spatula and then I'm going to turn around on to the bench and just give it a need don't overwork this so you just want to bring it together till it's not crumbly you should be able to get it into a nice ball once it's bagged you're not over need it or else you shop where it's not going to be nice and crumbly I've used the bunt in to make so many more things than bunts I've got that made like my surprise inside but what about the like Halloween pinata now we're making a gigantic cookie who says bumps are just known as bundt cake all right that is how you make the basis for your giant sumela that shortbread is going to go off into the oven at 320 or 170 for 20 to 25 minutes you're not done when it starts to brown around the edges and just lightly Browns on top let's bake this sucker up it smells amazing so you want to let that sit in the pan for like five minutes and then we're going to really gently tip it out onto a wire rack like really gently shortbreads a little fragile so I'm just going to support it with my fingers well this guy's cooling we're going to toast our coconut so coconut raw I mean it's okay it's not very pleasant in baked goods I'm just going to tip it onto a tray lined with some parchment it's going to throw it out pretty evenly so it's going to go up into a moderate oven form look anywhere between like five and eight minutes be careful because coconut does toast really quickly so as soon as you start to smell the delicious smell of toasting coconut pop it out give it a really quick kind of a stir around to make sure it's getting ground all over and then back in for no more than another minute that's what you should be looking at lovely browned crunchy toasted coconut I think this is the best part of a similar no and chocolate and caramels the best part of a summer even if you don't like coconut toast your coconuts a whole new thing you guys spend you mind they're kind of caramel you could definitely make your own if you have a great recipe but we can attack terrible by using caramel shoes and a little milk the milk stops them from hardening up super hard straight after they've been heated I'm going to pour the milk over and then getting off into the microwave just for 30 seconds don't be fooled these melt quickly and they get so most nuclear hot so be very very careful whenever you're dealing with super hot melted caramel into the microwave they go oh my god you guys don't make an epic sundae topping all right we need to make the foot of the Samoa so I'm going to use it's a regular Panama for my shortbread cookie on a piece of parchment gently gently then I'm going to take a regular pencil and I'm just going to draw around for summer perfect to remove your cookie if the cookie should break at any point you're going to basically hold it all together with caramel and chocolate anyway so just proceed with it in two hours because I don't really want that lead pencil on the bottom of my thumb wha I'm going to flip it and I can still see my outline through the parchment we're going to spoon the chocolate so I'm kind of like I guess drizzle it just around that outside ring and you just want to spoon it roughly into that template section and spread it out kind of looks like a massive chocolate donor and then gently pick up your thumb bowler cookie and place it on top all right that one's going to go up into the freezer just like five minutes or the fridge you just want to let that chocolate set the chocolate base is set so now you want to mix some of your coconut through your Caramon like I said you can decide how much or how little you want here but I wouldn't go too heavy on the coconut in the caramel or you'll have trouble with your caramel sticking to your cooking so I'm going to start with like a generous handful mix it through another generous handful I wouldn't add any more coconut than that you can see how it's like starting to clump together and you kind of want to work quite quickly here because that caramel starts to set up it'll be harder to get on top of your giant normal summer lows we were debating there's some mowers but is a single thermal is a thermo ah or is it just one similar so they're getting in my students kind of press the mixture on it should be quite thick on some of those five you might just need to coax it a little bit just to make sure that it sticks really thoroughly to your shop right cookie mix spread it in smooth it in there may be a little leftover terrible for you I kind of designed it that way alright covered in our caramel but you want to take the rest of your melted chocolate and we're just going to make our little Samoas dress I'm just going to use the spoon and drizzle them on I'm going to gently shift that onto a wire rack before the chocolate set so they don't get any of these like little pools or puddles and my Samoa is perfectly round that one's going to go into the fridge to set and then we're going to be done now the ultimate does it actually taste like it's Mulsim or I have to do this it's my job coconutty crunchy chocolaty this is better than the original the shop roads amazing but that caramel is like thick and sticky I mean you're probably not just going to pick it up and eat the whole thing you might want to cut it into servings but it is absolutely delicious maybe guys enjoyed today's giant thermo up what Samoas so I know where I'm going with that subscribe to the channel if you're not already for new videos every single week make sure to get my giant size playlist if you want to see some of our giant side-streets have an awesome day you guys thanks for watching I'm gonna take my Samoa just over here I'll be back [Music] 
all right I'm done with the claw the claw is garbage I don't read it I don't like it if you get the opportunity to use this one that's someone else to show you how to use expect clearly have no idea [Music] welcome back to my cupcake addiction I'm million-strong and today we are exploring more Russian piping tips because you guys loved the flower piping tips that I did and you also loved to ball Russian piping tips that I did I'll leave the links down below to those videos if you want to check them out today we're looking at Russian ruffle piping tips they're long they're pointy they kind of have these weird little I guess splits in them and on the play just between you and I I have no idea what these things do but we're going to find out together before we get started I'm super excited to be featured alongside such names as beyonce and places like Disneyland on parade magazines the best part the best part of my cupcake addiction which let's face it is almost everything how are they going to find the actual best part pretty sure they good at their job cut it over to parade subscribe to the channel if you guys want to see the best parts of all sorts of things and go and check out the best parts of my cupcake addiction leave a comment down below and let them know you care from here I'm sure they'd love to see you stop by back to the topic at hand Russian piping tip alright I'm going to start with five different colored frostings and I'm not going to use couplers I'm just going to snip the tip of disposable piping bags and throw in my piping tip making sure that the entire side or the split in the piping tip is exposed so my bags not covering any of it I'm going to add a different color frosting into each of my bags but a couple of them I'm going to go a dual color frosting because sometimes in my experience these tips would set up with more than one color per individual bag or do a little pink and blue and a little pink and green and number one packing tip and I'm not even going to try to name these because I'll come up with awesome names like weird-looking Aero with kind of a crook Singh at the bottom of it which is not going to be a technical term so this is our first piping tip so for this one here what you want to do is you want to position that long split in the side of the piping tip and I find it easiest to kind of put this alongside the seam of the bag positioner so that basically parallel or laying directly on top of the cupcake with the frosting pointing straight down to the cupcake I'm just going to flick my wrist really gently backwards and forwards as I squeeze with an even pressure and I love this one because if you wanted to make like a little tutu or ballerina dress of some sort it actually finishes off both the outer edge and the inside waist edge at the same time as your piping I'm going to do two layers of this purple frosting there's actually a really cute little ruffle really simple and pretty easy to achieve let's finish that one off with a teeny tiny little printable ballerina top so you can really get the full little tutu kind of image here so the last one was going to be known as weird arrow shape with like so hook at the bottom of it this is just weird arrow shapes technical terms but this guy again and in a position this clip directly down on top of my cupcake and I'm just going to squeeze this is so fine that you actually don't even really need to wiggle your wrist back and forth for that little ruffle effect to essentially be seen it finishes the middle really nicely but I found that I ended up with a bit of a hole in the center so this really is I don't know it kind of looks like the color of a clown so I'm going to stick an emoji gum ball in the middle I don't think this would look as nice in double and triple layers because that center section is so stick I think that this this is a single layer ruffle tip number three is kind of a short pointy arrow and this is the one that I've gone with both the pink and green together in so instead of laying this alongside the cupcake I make sure you going to stab it straight down so it's almost in the cupcake but not quite and then I'm just going to twist my wrist back and forth back and forth you can kind of pick up the piping bag and reattach and continue or you can just sort of walk it across the top of the cupcake back and forward and back and forward I like this with the double colors I almost think the pink looks like flowers and the green look like little bits of greenery or leaves underneath and all in all this is actually a really quick way to achieve a really pretty delicate floral effect on top of your cupcake this guy is the wiggle tip because it kind of just looks like a wiggle so the wiggle tip I've got pink and blue in I don't know try a couple of different techniques with this the first one I am going to lay the tip down parallel to that cupcake again with the frosting pointing down and I'm just going to kind of let the frosting fall out like we did with our yellow clown mochi guy the first thing you have falls out really nice and fine and it gets almost like a little bit of a natural ruffle to it but nowhere near is together and tight as that emoji rustle I'm going to a second layer on top of the first layer I think either looks really nice and I feel like this would be really cute with more than two colors for a rainbow tied a cupcake alright because I want to experiment with this guy a little bit I think it could be my favorite then take another cupcake and I'm going to use a similar technique to what we just used on the pink and green so I'm going to stab in that piping tip almost into the cupcake and I'm just going to go back and forth back and forth in small sections kind of allowing a fair bit of frosting to come out so that as I go back on creating these little sections of ruffle all over the top of the cupcake but eventually joined together to completely cover it this in the pink and blue I love this is actually better than the last one we did with this tip I think these guys both look great but from the same tip just holding it a different way we've got two very different results but equally have a place somewhere in my cupcakes decorating number five I'm going to go with green and this is very similar to that last piping tip except that the wiggly bit is much thinner and much finer so I'm guessing we're going to get a much thinner finer ruffle again just laying it down parallel with the cupcake so the frosting falls directly down into the cupcake and I'm just going to let it fall because again this is thin enough and fine enough they're just the pressure of the frosting being squeezed out and falling on the cupcake actually gives it this really nice ripple all of its own I'm going to do not one not two but three layers on top of this cupcake and I feel like this has got such as to to like look to it this is actually going to be Tinkerbell skirt tink me too delicious this one I'm going to call it the claw because it kind of looks like it cool and I've absolutely no idea what to do with it I've some practices I have no idea what it's for I don't even know why they included it and if anyone has more information on that please let me know all right first up I'm going to try pushing it in and kind of twisting side to side and that looks terrible all right so now I'm going to try a little bit more with like their grand sweep nope that looks terrible so I did a little trial in some paper towel and it almost looked like it was supposed to leave like two lines of ruffle with like a center spot kind of looks a bit like a brain I'm going to know it looks like a really ugly brain or just really ugly frosting all right I'm done with the claw claw is garbage I don't read it I don't like it if you get the opportunity to use this one that's someone else to show you how to use except clearly have no idea it just seems impractical I couldn't get it to work and it's the first piping tip I've ever picked up the tips didn't have some kind of a common use if you've had luck with the claw let me know no luck with the cloth if I could evict one piping tip I'm going to evict the cloth and then in a very close second I'm probably going to get rid of the weird arrow with the hook didn't really like it finally I have my eggs Aggie kind of Sharptooth looking piping tip so for this guy I'm gonna start again just parallel to the top of the cupcake and really using my wrist to go kind of up and down or just slightly back and forward while turning the cupcake to create this big kind of a ruffled skirt this one's actually much cooler because it's good all the texture caused by those teeth so it makes it look I don't know just a lot more kind of flamenco dancer if we were looking for the right term for the bottom of someone's dress I'm going to do a couple of layers here when I get to the very top so I don't see that hole in the middle I'm just going to sort of push it the point and twist it back and forward and hope that when I pull it out oh yeah how should I think that looks too bad all right now another trick I want to try with this to give it a ton of height without being entirely frosting is to take my cupcake and again just resting that piping tip parallel making my first but then I'm going to take a nice strawberry trim the base off it and stick it under the frosting this is going to give us kind of like the base for a really nice skirt if you wanted to make a princess cupcake but without having just a solid lump of frosting don't there's anything wrong with it so a lot of frosting they've actually found out quite cute and I'm going to turn this line into Princess Elsa so it's what else are you going to do with a cupcake with a strawberry inside in winter blue that kind of looks like a princess dress you can alter it makes sense that's it seven different styles that you can do with six because I hate the claw different Russian five things in so how do we feel about Russian piping tips on the whole I really like the ruffles I found some great techniques a little similar some of them but I've found that throughout all of the Russian piping tip videos that I've made make sure you check out my flower piping tips if you guys want to check out how to make these one squeeze flowers and make sure you check out my Russian bull piping tips video if you want to see how I use these weird bull piping tips to make all kinds of crazy designs hope you enjoyed today's video and let me know

that's a good one not when it tastes like a vegetable [Music] welcome back to my cupcake addiction Emily Estrada and today I'm showing you yet another Halloween recipe this one is a glowing pumpkin patch brownie I know kind of like a normal brownie but not because it glows and it's covered in tiny pumpkins the things you're going to need to make your pumpkin patch brownie I've got a batch of my amazing brownie recipe some melted black candy melts some battery-operated tea light candles circle cutters piping tips I'm using a grass and a leaf orange candy melts and green buttercream I'm also using a teeny tiny Bunton mold this makes really little buns that are about one in three-quarter inches across the top as always I'll leave the recipes for the brownie and also the buttercream on the my cupcake addiction comm website I'll link to that down below let's get started I baked my batch of brownie mixture in a 10 inch by 15 inch tray I've let that completely cool and I'm actually gonna serve this in the tray so there's no need to take it out just yet I've got my nice melted orange candy melts and I'm going to put just under a teaspoon maybe just over a half a teaspoon into each of my little bundt molds give that a couple of good hard taps on the bench so we get into all of those little crevices and then just use the back of the spoon just to drag that chocolate up and try to keep it about the same thickness all the way around we don't want to double coat of these because we want them to be nice and thin so we can see the glowing effect through them I've put my green frosting into a piping bag and this is a grass piping tip this is quite a large one a grass piping tip is essentially anything that looks like it has a ton of little holes drilled on the end of it and they come in all different sizes I've also got a circle cutter and my circle cutter is just slightly larger than the size of my tea light candles not smaller not the same slightly larger so I'm going to start by cutting 12 holes in my brownie for my pumpkin patch don't go too close to the outside edges here some of the many reasons where I love my job seriously the best brownie recipe in the world a little more work than a packet mix but it's amazing those off cuts can be eaten if you wish and now I'm going to frost up a grass style frosting effect all around the outside but not in my holes when you're using a grass piping tip try not to press down too hard you kind of want to press and attach and then lift it up so the grass is able to fall freely especially in a pumpkin patch something like that bringing your little shells out of the fridge now they should just slide right out don't be too worried if they're a little jacket around the bottoms or if you crack a couple cuz we're gonna join them together and we'll neat them off anyway all of our little orange mini bumps they're cute but they get cuter I'm just heating my fry pan here you can heat it up on the stove otherwise I've just got mine in a little bit of boiling water and let's just take a moment to appreciate the cuteness of the tiny miniature fry pan get rid of any of that excess water and you're going to use the heat from the fry pan to join together your two halves so grab one of your little bundt halves place it down give it a little spin around and lift and then take another one do the same line them up so your little detail lines on the sides of your bun match up you can run your finger around the edge just to neaten them up perfectly and you have teeny tiny hollow chocolate pumpkins these are great as whole pumpkins but I need a hole in my whole pumpkin so I'm thinking something that's about the same size as the top you could use something like a piping tip here but I actually found that the end of one of my beaters is the perfect tool that's been soaking in a bit of hot water and again I just want to make sure that it's not wet and then I'm just going to let it melt through the very top of one of my pumpkins so one side as a whole and the other side does not something like that this is what you need to remember to flip all of your pumpkins flip them over because you want those holes to be in the bottom and trust me once you start painting faces you'll forget to flip and you'll end up with upside-down little jack-o'-lanterns a little bit of black melted candy and I'm going to paint a little tiny jack-o'-lantern face on each of my pumpkins just using a toothpick feel free not to paint your jack-o'-lantern based on all of them could just paint it on a couple or a few but I want a really spooky pumpkin patch so I'm gonna paint it on all of them we're at assembly stage and this is where it gets really fun I've got some little tea light candles these are battery-operated fake tea light candles because obviously we don't want the melting through our little chocolate shells do you want to activate them and pop them inside each of your little holes and you guys will notice that I actually chose the flickering candles because they add tons more effect and these ones are really long and skinny so you can see I mean there are some that have like short fat little wicks these ones I got the nice long skinny flickering wicks you guys see where we're going with this you want to take each of your little jack-o'-lanterns now and that little hole at the bottom should sit nicely on top of each of your little candles so I'm just using a leaf tip now just a pipe like a little stalk the top of each of my jack-o'-lanterns honestly you could even use a snaps your bag for this we made ourselves a little glowing pumpkin patch but let's turn the lights off and see what it looks like when we dim things down a bit so spooky so incredibly cute but above all delicious let's bring those little boys in and see what they think I'm so like I guess write all of your page mom you guys are both pretty lucky do you feel like you Jake yeah do you even know what Lucky's what is lucky is grass yeah if you're not already subscribed to the channel make sure you do for two new videos every week and as always thanks very much for watching and happy Halloween you [Music]

over-the-top Nutella cake then a télécharger chocolate the cake is chocolate everything's covered in Nutella and filled with candy and it's actually really easy to make at home to make your Nutella cake you're going to need cake and of course you should probably start with Nutella you're gonna need a really heavy duty knife or a pair of shears and a thinner knife like an exacto dark candy melts gold luster dust egg candy bars loads of candy bars I've also made you guys a printable template which I'll leave a link to down below I get a couple of these mini dogs they're just extra decoration

want to empty and then clean and dry your Nutella jars I've melted my candy melts and now I'm gonna take my two halves of my clean and dry Nutella jar or Nutella depending on where you're from and I'm just gonna fill it full of chocolate to make a chocolate shell make sure that your chocolate here goes right up those sides so that you're not eligible to get and it's still got the same proportions we want a skinny Nutella jar that's not Tower so you need two halves of these for each Nutella jar I'm going to make two jars I'm going to need four halves and once you're happy that you've got a nice coda you can't see any plastic through pop it off into the fridge for about 10 minutes to set I've got a single batch of my chocolate cake recipe that I baked in two 6-inch tins so what I've got is two 6-inch cakes but what I want is enough cake to fill one of my Nutella jars at a nice tall skinny cake to actually decorate like a cake trim your cakes I'm just going to start by trimming the top off so that it's kind of nice and flat and I'm not going to take off the sides of my chocolate cake here because I wanted to have a little bit structure and trimming the sides takes away a little bit of the cakes support system once you've flattened each of your 6-inch cakes you want to cut them in half and you can trim just the very base off to get rid of any caramelization so you should have four around one inch high six inch round cake layers hang on to your little top bits of cake we're actually going to use those take your cake layers now and you're going to stack them I'm using a rectangle board and I'm stacking all the way over to one side and then I'm going to slather Nutella in between the layers and cover the outside of the cake completely in Nutella its Nutella it's delicious small but mighty mighty delicious I'm gonna stick that one up into the fridge don't put too much Nutella between your layers here because Nutella is so soft it's not going to hold like a frosting or ganache and you don't want too much bulge we're gonna cover all this up with deliciousness very food out of the fridge come our two halves of our Nutella jar so you should be able to see on the back there that it's actually pulled away if you have any little spaces like see this little guy just here push that and you'll see it just pull away completely that's how you know that your Nutella jar is completely set all the way through I find pulling it by the lid is the best option it's the bottom that's gonna get stuck and if the lid cracks a little it doesn't matter because we're going to cover that up almost perfect the only crack I got was just there on the lid which is really not too bad it's getting a lid on the lid again just releasing the sides and then pulling mother lid perfect two halves of our now chocolate Nutella jar I'm going to lay down a little paper towel so we don't get marks on the outside of my jar and just rest it on its little back and we're going to fill this one with cake the other one we're gonna fill with candy this is my Nutella spoon I could go bigger though I'm going to use a spoon here rather than the offset and I'm just going to spoon in a generous amount of Nutella this is easiest to do when you're little Nutella jar is still cold because that way it's nice and stable and sturdy anytime I want to touch the jars I'm just going to use that paper towel or touch the bottom and the top mmm you're gonna slice my cake I'm just going to trim off the top because I kind of want these slices to be as neat as possible and actually leaving that curved domed top on top makes it perfect to be able to lay in because it kind of curves to the jar of the Nutella it's like a small Nutella puzzle has there ever been a better way to use up cake offcuts than this potentially not I'm just going to put a little bit more Nutella on top to seal it all in and then you want to repeat that on both halves of your first jar my second jar is gonna be filled with M&amp;Ms so we get the best of both worlds while delicious the Nutella cake is looking a little yeah so I'm gonna cover it in candy bars but not whole candy bars because I want to show what's going on inside I've got milky way's Twix and a Baby Ruth which is kind of also known if you're in Australia as like a picnic bar I think it's the closest thing we have to baby Ruth and the Milky Way's here are very similar to our Mars bars I'm going to slice them in half and reveal those amazing layers in between check out the inside of Twix it's such a cute pattern I'm just going to slice all of mine in half so you can see everything that's going on inside now I'm going to add them on to my cake in different levels I want to see nuts I want to see new guard I want to see caramel I want to see KitKat I want to see it all I'm gonna take a little bit of gold luster dust this is optional but it adds a really nice classy effect to the cake and I'm just gonna brush it over not all of my candy bars just some of them I'm just using that luster dust dry with a nice soft paintbrush you can put that whole cake in the fridge to chill it and while that's happening take your chilled Nutella jar cake out of the fridge and we're going to join it together I've got a fry pan heating just here and I'm going to do a hot-melt technique it's really nice and neat and easy so I'm going to lift up my Nutella jar and I'm going to press it into the inside of my saucepan pay particular attention to the two sides and try not to pick up any of that cake so if you need to angle your Nutella jar just a little bit so that you're kind of just getting either side so you'll notice I'm still handling with my paper towels I'm going to press the two halves of my jar together before that melty nurse starts to set and to become one when your cakes joined together I'm gonna take another one that's just completely hollow cast it and join it in the same way so I've got two big Nutella jars you make five you make ten you make three whatever you like I've got a little gap in between the cake where my Nutella jars joined up so more Nutella snaps your bag and pipe it in this guy here I'm gonna fill with candy try to alternate between candy that weighs a little more and candy that weighs a little less bigger and smaller so that your Nutella jar doesn't end up being too heavy you get a really nice spill effect from all those little small M&amp;Ms and things oh my goodness how are we gonna close those up you asked with our lids every jar of Nutella needs a lid I'm just gonna rest them on top you can fix them with a little bit of melted chocolate if you like we made chocolate Nutella Jose of course I've left you guys a template I'll link to it down below and i just cut mine out in two separate pieces because it's a little long to go on one sheet of a4 I'm gonna wrap it around and tape it on the side so I've got a fully completed and labeled Nutella jar apart for a very slight difference in color it's really hard to tell our chocolate and candy filled Nutella jars the real thing each have their merits there are all my babies I love them all equally cake time now I presented mine on a rectangle board because I want this to be a ridiculous overstatement cake but still a small size everyone's gonna get loads of chocolate everyone's gonna get tons of Nutella but I'm going to build up the actual size of the cake by adding my Nutella jars to the top and the side the larger of my two jars is my candy filled Nutella jar so that's going to sit on top of my cake the heavier is the cake so that's going to sit beside oh my goodness the jar on top of the cake should just sit in place the Nutella is going to stick it there but for other guys so that it doesn't slide around on the board I'm going to add just a little bit of dark candy melt to the board and I found baby Nutella just so I'm also going to add those on as a little bit of decoration real Nutella fake Nutella chocolate Nutella chocolate Nutella is Nutella you get the drift you guys can decide which of your favorite candy bars you want to add on to this but more is more here goes more is definitely more if this is not enough Nutella pew then I'm sorry but I'm pretty confident your taste for Nutella can never be satisfied this is way over the top but actually really pretty easy to throw together I hope you guys have enjoyed today's cake for the Nutella lover in us all if you're not already subscribed to the channel make sure you do for two new videos every week you can check me out on Facebook for new videos every day and if you use the hashtag my cupcake addiction on Instagram I'll be able to see everything you guys make and bake and share some of my favorites thanks very much for watching you 
whoa I did not know that was gonna be shy [Music] welcome back to my cupcake addiction I don't normally go this far into character but today we are paying tribute to all things Willy Wonka the great gene Wilder passed away and I thought it only fitting to do a serious tribute where I went a little above and beyond in the costume department to all things Willy Wonka it was one of my absolute favorite childhood movies and I think it may have shaped my love of candy today I'm going to show you guys how to make an or inspiring over-the-top illusion effect double-sided rainbow surprise inside Willy Wonka cake brace yourselves it's about to get very sweet in here all right I'm back to normal things are you gonna need to make your Wonka cake you'll need some buttercream some ganache a serrated knife an offset spatula I've got fondant in white light purple brown and dark purple a rolling pin a pizza cutter a ruler some simple syrup powdered sugar dark candy melts a sharp knife a thin lightweight candy bar some fun lollipops a little parchment paper and hope use amounts of candy there's a few templates in this videos I will leave links to them all down below and I've also got my cake boards I'll leave all the dimensions again down below instead of dowel for the center of my cake I'm using fat straws or milkshake straws so much easier to cut and of course you're going to need cake I colored vanilla cake in nine different shades of the rainbow but feel free to get creative here I baked in 8-inch round tins and each of my layers is about 1 inch high probably a little taller that I need but I've got a really creative way to use up all those leftovers so make sure you subscribe to the channel if you want to check out pretty unique way to use cake scraps first up we want to carve our cakes and I always find chilling them for about an hour in the fridge or even the freezer before I carve makes them a lot easier to deal with you want to level off the top of the cake and then turn it over and using a serrated edge knife just gently trim away any of the browned bottom section again with a serrated knife just come around the outside edge take off as little as you possibly need to but as much as you have to to get rid of any of those Brown edges you want to repeat that with all 9 of your cake layers then we're going to brush them with simple syrup this is one part water one part sugar and you want to heat it either on the stove or in the microwave until that sugar is completely dissolved and I just brush mine on using a pastry brush paying special attention to the outside edges so my cake doesn't dry out next it's time to take our white buttercream frosting and add a very thin crumb coat to catch any of those pesky colored crumbs all right it's time to stack we're actually stacking this cake upside down so I'm going to take my 10 inch round cake board and I'm going to start at the bottom with the color that I want to be the top of my cake which is red place that down don't stick it to the board with anything and then apply a little bit more buttercream spreading it out being sure not to get any of those colored crumbs through and then on goes the next color orange and then more orange I took a couple of smaller cardboard cake boards and just wrapped them in some foil I've got one that's six inches and then one that's four I'm going to apply the cake board frost it in and then go with my next three colors of cake frosting with buttercream in between because I'm doing nine layers here in between each three layers I'm going to support my cake using four fat straws place them straight down into the cake and then lift them slightly snip them off so they're all the same length and pop them back down that will just help bear the weight and then on go my final three colors again with four more straws for extra support and then pop that one off into the fridge for at least an hour if you can do longer do longer because it's going to make carving it so much easier no you don't get to have a snooze there's still plenty to be done while the cakes chilling out so instead of using a cake board for underneath this cake we're going to use a regular dinner plate it's got the raised edges which means it's actually going to give us that really cute little kind of curled up broom of the Hat take a dark purple fondant sprinkle down some powdered sugar and roll it out nice and thin here I just used a napkin dipped in water just to wet the plate or you can brush it with that simple syrup it's just going to give your fondant something to stick to and then lay the fondant carefully over the plate be very careful not to disturb the edge of the plate because that's going to be the brim of your hat and it's going to look kind of weird if this finger marks in it smooth the fondant down and market over the edges and so that we can neaten up behind the plate because you want this to curl down underneath I just rested a bowl in the very center and then flipped my plate over this helps to protect those edges and no one's going to see the mark the bowl leaves in the fondant because it's going to be cake on top of it I chose to display my whole cake on quite a large cake board because it really allows me to increase the size of the cake and it gives me more decorating space sprinkle down some more of your powdered sugar roll out that green fondant as thin as you like brush the board with some water or simple syrup and then just lay the fondant over trim around the edges to make it nice and neat and you've got yourself I'm going to call it Willy Wonka's candy garden or the base for it taking your white fondant now we're going to make our W so I've just cut around my Wonka template using a sharp knife and then I'm going to sprinkle down a little bit of that powdered sugar roll my white fondant out nice and thin and using my exacto or super sharp Stanley knife I'm going to cut right around that template once your cakes nice and firm in that buttercream step use a serrated edge knife to carve around you want to create like a tapered top coming down to a wider base so I just grabbed a little dish or a small bowl and use that as a bit of a guide so I got a nice round top and it's about an inch inch and a half smaller than the circumference of my top cake something like this once you help you with your shape you want to take some of your chocolate ganache now and if it's set super firm feel free to give it a microwave for 15 seconds at a time and stir it vigorously so it's nice and soft and doesn't pull it that cake it's a pretty tall cake I chose chocolate ganache because this is ode to Willy Wonka and it feels like it would be completely wrong to do any other flavor with your thicker coat of ganache in place I'm using a long metal ruler or you could also use a cake scraper here but I feel like rulers are something that we all have using your ruler really shape that ganache so that your cake kind of looks like a cone but without the point on it make sure that you get down at eye level and spin your cake around so that it is nice and neat and even on all sides as possible once you're happy with the shape I like to take a long jug of boiling hot water and I rest my ruler in there be careful these get kind of hot but they're super long so in my opinion it's a good trade-off I like to use a little bit of paper towels I don't burn my fingers and then you'll see as I smooth I'm literally just shaving off the very very top layer of chocolate but I'm revealing a perfectly beautifully smooth layer of firm chocolate ganache underneath once you're happy with the shape pop that off into the fridge for 30 minutes I wouldn't go any longer it'll make your fondant sweat but thirty minutes will be a nice amount of time to set up that ganache and make it easier to put fondant on so I made you guys these little Wonka bar templates which I will leave a link to down below but I like to take mine off my candy bar until I'm sure that I'm not gonna leave any fingerprints on so that's not going to go back on until last minute I covered my candy bars in a little bit of silver foil and then because I kind of wanted a super gold golden ticket and I couldn't get that on a home printer I just got some gold foil paper and kind of cut it you're really only going to see the tip of it poking out underneath that Wonka bar I applied it with a little bit of tape but I'm going to flip that back now so that I can make the illusion part lay your Walkabout on your piece of parchment just slightly on an angle and then I put my dark candy melts into a snap seal bag and just snipped off kind of a generous tip I'm going to trace the outline of what looks a little bit like a chocolate waterfall to make a chocolate waterfall just do this - I I kind of made these nice big blobby sides but I left the bottom of it quite straight because that's going to go into my cake make this pretty thick it's got to hold up under its own weight and as you're filling in the outline really go crazy I'm making like big swirls and drip kind of looking textures because we really want this to resemble an actual waterfall set that one at room temperature rather than in the fridge because the fridge will cause the chocolate to contract and you'll end up with a wonky lean on your Wonka waterfall once it's set you can flip your waterfall over on that piece of parchment the waterfall side is fine just as it is but the back it's kind of boring and you're going to have these little air pockets in it so I took copious amounts of Wonka inspired candy and the brightest colors I can find and I'm just going to dab a little tiny bit of that dark candy melt on the back of each and use them to cover up any blemishes in much chocolate and B create an absolutely dazzling Kennedy effect for the other side of my illusion so no matter which way you look at this cake it's going to be absolutely adorable with your illusion done our boards covered our cake chilled it's time to cover don't freak out here we've done it upside-down so it's going to be a much easier shape than you think to cover sprinkle down a generous amount of powdered sugar or cornstarch and roll that fondant out don't go too crazy thin here oh you'll see any lumps and bumps underneath if you want to measure the circumference at the bottom of your cake it's a good idea even if you just use a piece of string to make sure that your piece is long enough there is nothing worse than having a too short piece of fondant once it's already on the cake trim at the very bottom edge and the two sides as best as you can so at least they're neat and then wrap the fondant around a long rolling pin once your cake is shining with sugar syrup you want to take your rolling pin and lift it up onto the side of your cake carefully but quickly and this can be a little bit of an awkward maneuver so feel free to ask someone for help wrap it around the outside of the cake as soon as you've got the fondant on just run your hands up and down the outside edges to smooth it off and I'm just going to take a sharp knife and slice all the way down cutting those two layers at the one time you can pull away any excess here and they should join up quite nicely once you've joined it up you can trim off any excess on both the top and bottom and then I'm going to use just a cake smoother here just to really smooth out and push any air bubbles out of the way so my coat of fondant is super nice and really beautiful and smooth put a little bit of ganache on the top of your cake which is actually about to become the bottom of your cake and just make sure it's super thin and not too close to the outside edges so it doesn't sphere take your covered plate and flip it upside down again be really mindful of finger prints here and gently place it straight down in the center or the top bottom of your cake because I know I don't want to handle my plate very much at all I'm also going to apply a generous amount of ganache to the bottom of the plate and then I'm going to place my green covered final presentation board on top kind of making this weird upside down stack and this is going to be heavy but we are going to flip together three two one so we flipped and nothing terrible happened you want to take a sharp knife now and you're going to just slide it to remove the suction that's been caused by the fondant and ganache around that red layer of cake once you're happy that you've released the board simply pull it off now for the top section of our cake I'm gonna roll quite a thick piece of fondant here again with the powdered sugar I'm going to clear off my bench and then flip it so that I don't have any cornflour on the side that's going to be the top but I'm going to use this plate to kind of be my template and I know it's going to dig into the fondant so I want it on the bottom side I need to use a pizza cutter just to cut very neatly and it's straight up and down as I possibly can ever so slightly larger than my place because I know my plates a tiny bit smaller than the top of my cake a little thin layer of ganache and keep it as thin and as flat as possible on top of that red layer again do not go too close to the outside edges of your cake or you're going to end up with like ganache peeking through between your two purple layers and we definitely don't want that pick up your circular disk and treat it carefully you don't wanna stretch it out of shape place it on top and then just run your hands around the outside edge to make sure that it's as nice smooth and flush with the top line of the cake as possible you can use a cake smoother at any time here to really smooth down that fondant get rid of any air bubbles and make that top piece really become one with the rest of the Hat in my opinion this is always the best part all the hard stressful work is done apart for applying the illusion but now we're ready to do all of the fun decorations on our beautiful Wonka Hat cake it's not just gonna be a Wonka hat though this one's got Flair spring go down a bit of powdered sugar and roll out your light purple fondant really nice and thin and long thin and long we're gonna make the band make this piece a little bit thicker than you actually want the band to be because we're kind of gonna ripple it so that it looks like a fabric then I'm gonna take my ruler and I'm just gonna slice off so I've got really nice straight edges on both sides on a cutting board or my husband will kill me one thing to bear in mind of this cake and honestly it's something about it that I really love is that one side is going to be a beautiful nice purple Wonka hat and the other side is going to be almost entirely covered with a chocolate waterfall so if you have one side I mean I guarantee you'll have one side that you like slightly better than the rest not that we play favorites but my seam is going to go under that chocolate waterfall as is anywhere that I think is less than perfect on my cake and I'm going to try and put my best side forward I always do I'm just pinching my fondant and a couple of little ripples to give it a little bit of texture before I stick that on I want a position at my W like I said I cut mine out slightly in advance and because of that it's actually really nice and firm which is going to enable me to be able to kind of kick that little curl of the warm cut off a little bit and also makes it a bit easier to position also think about where you want to stick your W I had a tiny little bit of cracking in my fondant so my W is going to cover that there's no such thing as a mistake just a well covered piece of cake so a little bit of water on the back of my W completely stuck down is totally fine but you can see by letting my W set overnight I've actually ended up with the ability to kind of make it look like it's not actually stuck on the sides of the cake it's kind of three-dimensional a little bit taking a little bit more water here I'm going to press it around the bottom being careful not to drip it onto my plate at all just around this bottom edge and that's going to be used to stick on my band picking up my drape from the center at the back I'm just going to trim off being careful not to cut my plate fondant I kind of lied when we said all the stressful stuff is done this is the most stressful part because we're adding the illusion but don't freak out if it happens to break if anything goes wrong you are literally like five minutes away from making a new one Gide whole massive knife in Wonka purple I don't know how I managed that so I am going to try and find about the middle of my cake and I'm gonna come down ah this feels so wrong what this does is it really just paves the way for my illusion to go in so that my illusion doesn't have to have so much pressure on it I like to make sure that I've made it a little bit of space so my waterfall side is going to face back my fun candy side is going to face forward and I'm going to try to just kind of touch it on this side so I don't leave big finger prints and work quickly here so that I don't melt through slowly does it coax it in it already looks so cute we have more candy to add so for the back half and like I said this is my not-so-great half so I've got my big seam I've got one my little ribbon for my hat joint and I've got is there the good side of my Wonka bar illusion we're gonna now roll out some Brown fondant so I'm going to start with a shape that's kind of a little bit like a triangle or a bell because I know that I want fat at the bottom and thin at the top so I might as well start with that shape and I may save myself having to cut it as I roll my shape out I'm really coaxing the fondant where I want it to go so you can get your hands underneath and you can just kind of pull it and stretch it a little bit while it's still quite thick don't do that once it's thin and then just rolling with ways where I want it to get wider and lengths where I want to get longer once I've got the basic shape I'm gonna clean up any excess powdered sugar and that way I'm gonna get any on my nice dark colored fondant all right we want to add a little bit of texture so I'm just gonna use just the top end of my pizza cutter you can use anything just make sure it's kind of blunt and I'm just gonna create like a little drippy waterfall effects I'll go once at the narrow side and then I'll come back and go with the fat side kind of add some streaks and things that seen were all Gustus gloop falls into the chocolate waterfall you know I was sad for his parents that I couldn't help but thinking what an amazing way to go I mean if you got to go right I'm not gonna trim the sides I'm not gonna trim the base I'm sticking it on like that so working quickly I want to remove my cake from its turntable because I don't want it moving around for this I'm going to paint a little bit of water and then I'm going to attach my fondant I'm going to trim off just a nice straight top because that's where it's going to meet up with my actual water illusion and I want to make sure that it's no wider or narrower really than the top immediately secure your top and then also this side section and then you can kind of let it fall away again securing to the plate everywhere that you secure this fondant just takes the pressure off the layer above it so it doesn't rip there is nowhere for me to stand where I can actually see you guys behind this cake its massive and I kind of like that in a cake from here you can decorate however you like I've given you the blank canvas but of course I'll give you a couple of suggestions so I found some little oompa-loompas that I printed out on kind of a thicker cardstock and I'm just going to glue them together so if you need some craft glue but I'm also going to give them two little stilts just up in their feet so that I can make them stand up in something I also need to do a small standing area for umpah so I'm just get a roller straight out lump of fondant and then I'm just going to add some grassy like texture by just kind of snipping at it be careful not to snip your hands here I have done that it is quite painful simple easy little grassy knoll my fondants pretty sticky so I'm just going to stick it straight onto the board and my Oompa Loompas made out of paper and they're sure so he's not that heavy in goes my little Loompa I'm gonna call him Bob a simple lollipop on the other side to balance things out couple little candies but I don't want to go too crazy on this cuz I think there's so much going on with this cake that we really don't need to whichever way you look at this cake it's utterly adorable the Wonka side or you want to go to lumple and I love how much we have going on in this cake you've got your illusion you've got your rainbow you've got your Wonka you've got your own balloon pearl and there is everything Wonka even a golden ticket if you guys love this video make sure you subscribe for two new videos every week if you

and I especially love it when you make things from my videos have an awesome day guys and as always thanks very much for watching Jacob do you like the cake [Music] that you've already pre-ordered to a copy of sweet celebrations gumpa lumpa 
hey guys it's Elise and welcome back to my cupcake addiction today I'm going to show you guys how to make a simple no big chocolate box that holds candy and chocolates but it's also made out of candy and chocolates you can literally eat the whole thing this is my kind of gift box for this one I'm going to use three whole blocks of chocolate when you're choosing your chocolate blocks it's a lot easier to measure if you go with one that's divided into squares rather than those kind of rectangle pieces and try and choose a nice thin block it just makes for neater edges and easier joining I've got some fresh strawberries and I've got my chosen candy truffles like I said you can put absolutely anything in this box I've got one gumball and I've also got some melted dark candy melts I've matched my candy melts to the color of my chocolate because I'm using dark chocolate blocks but if you're using milk or white make sure that you match your candy melt so they're the same color as the block of chocolate that you're using I've also got a ziploc bag and I've got enough let's get started you want to work with room-temperature chocolate here so don't have your blocks of chocolate refrigerated otherwise they'll be a bit too brittle the first thing I've done is I've actually poured some boiling hot water into a tray be very careful here I do not try to move this tray once the waters in it until the water is completely cooled down I'm resting my knife in there because that's going to heat it up and it's going to help me to melt through my chocolate and really I'm just resting the blade so I'm going to take my first flock of chocolate and for me mines made up of ten squares so five along and two across I'm just going to wipe any excess water off my knife and then I'm going to let the heat from the knife essentially kind of melt its way through just the last row so two squares or 1/5 of my first chocolate block so really I'm just applying a little even pressure I'm not trying to cut it I'm just allowing the heat of that knife to kind of do its work and throw it goes you want to repeat that with a second block again heating the knife in between and letting it melt through until that chocolate kind of releases itself not only does that method stop the chocolate from cracking but it also gives you really nice sharp smooth edges which makes your box with needle when it's all stuck back together so here in my knife again with my third block I'm again going to cut off the two end pieces because I want to make sure that it's the same length as what's essentially going to be my lid in my base and then I'm also going to cut lengthwise across that I've got two long rows but I'm going to heat my knife in between because I want that knife to be really nice and hot to get through that chocolate this cut here is probably your most precarious so if you're going to be super gentle in any of them make sure it's this long one you want to take your two short ends now and you're just going to cut the same thickness is the chocolate of either side this is to allow us to get a really nice seamless fit when we put our box together how does the cool thing about this box is that it's made out of blocks of chocolate so rather than hiding those chocolate blocks I've opted to have them showing on the outside so everybody knows exactly what we've done here I've got my two long sides on either side of my base my base is brick up and my long sides of my two short ends are brick down in chocolate brick kind of terminology I've got my melted dark chocolate in a ziplock bag and I'm just going to snip off a very fine little corner which is going to create a piping bag I'm going to run the dark chocolate around just the inside lip of that big chocolate base I mean I take my two end pieces first and I'm going to balance them you might just need to balance them for a second just while that chocolate becomes a little tacky but don't wait too long and you want to make sure they're lined up nicely with that base piece of chocolate before you attach your two sides you're going to run just a little bit of chocolate along the inside edge of each so I'm going to do one and on it goes you'll notice I'm grabbing my chocolate block by the sides so I don't end up with big fingerprints this is kind of the messy part of the job and I really don't want to get messy fingerprints on the outside of my really nice neat chocolate box you've got a couple of minutes here while that chocolate sets just to go around the outside edges and you can just run your finger up them make sure that you've got a really nice flush finish and then everything's kind of even so you don't have any overhang on any of your sides I'm happy my box is looking really nice and neat and because I've been really careful to handle it with the sides my chocolates still really shiny with no kind of messy fingerprints on it I'm gonna take my melted chocolate and my gumball and I'm going to put a handle because we need to be able to get the lid off our chocolate box once it's all sealed so just a decent-sized blob of chocolate and the gumball before you start stuffing your box with candy strawberries gifts whatever you want make sure that it's really nice and set and don't set these ones in the fridge because it can discolor your chocolate and make it sweat so I'm just going to go and I'm going to add fresh strawberries and then my chosen candies before we stick the lid on my little candy gift box is now completely set it's full of some fresh strawberries to balance out my fruit requirements as well as some of my favorite candies now all that's left to do is to pop the lid on if you're going to transport this one any kind of distance I'd recommend putting just a little dot of dark chocolate just underneath each corner of the lid to hold it in place this one's going straight to my husband for Valentine's Day so I'm gonna put the lid just on a slightly jaunty angle so you can get a peek of what's inside I hope you guys have enjoyed today's really novel way to use standard blocks of chocolate to make something that's anything other than standard without having to turn on the oven if you're not already subscribed to the channel make sure you do two new videos every week and as always guys thanks very much for watching 
we've got rainbows we've got gold and treasure and of course we've got some delicious cupcakes [Music] Penny's days nearly here and as if I need an excuse to pull out something rainbow but I did need an excuse to wear this shirt kind of thought I was buying a unicorn shirt turns out it's a llama corn a llama unicorn I don't know it arrived I can't send it back so today I'm in a llama corn shirt showing you guys how to make a lucky rainbow cupcakes two ways I'm usually how to make buried treasure so I have pockets and I'm gonna show you how to make must be shamrock subjects to make your cupcakes I make you guys a little shamrock template which I'll link to down below and you also need some green candy melts and some white buttercream frosting if you guys don't have an awesome buttercream frosting recipe I'll link to mine down below you don't want to use store-bought here if you need it nice and firm a bit of little gold luster dust some flat round confetti style sprinkles and I've got some rainbow cupcakes it's been a while since I've showed you guys how those cupcakes are made but I'll link to that video down below it's basically vanilla cupcake batter call it into six different colors and then lay it in cupcake pans and baked super simple but if you want to learn what help make sure you check out that video for the high other cupcakes I'm going to use some dark chocolate and some coconut oil and we're essentially going to make our own magic shell ice cream topping la McCarney ready I'm ready you guys ready plumber corns ready we should start the first thing we're going to make is a custom sprinkle mix so I'm using those little round sprinkles but I'm also going to add in some candies here I've got a bunch of a sort of sprinkles I've got many mmm I've got little chocolate wafer ball pretty much anything you like I'm going to pop those into a little mason jar and I'm going to use just under a teaspoon of my gold luster dust shake it around shake it all about and that's essentially going to coat all of that Canyon all of those sprinkles in a gold powder the things you don't have to use those horribly hard firm little gold balls inside your cupcakes you can actually have delicious Candida we've just made gold ourselves take your rainbow cupcakes and I'm just using a round open piping tip to call out the Centers but Dora needs a cause yet I know it's tempting fill them with a little shovel full of sprinkles yeah I have a mini shovel and make sure that you push the sprinkles all the way down so you get like a lot of candy inside your cupcakes because a lot of candy is just better than a little you want to trim just a very very top off your little cupcake cause and then like squish them down on top so you've got a nice flat surface again and then I've got some of my vanilla buttercream frosting in a piping bag with that same open round piping tip pipe nice high proud tall cupcake swirls on top of each of your cupcakes and then pop those off into the freezer to set then it'll reach 15 20 minutes in the freezer so that that buttercream is not too soft when we go to dip it to make our DIY Magic Shell you're just going to take your coconut oil and your chocolate and I'll leave all of your measurements on the my cupcake addiction website I'll link to that post down below microwave that for about a minute at a time stirring in between until you have a super smooth super thin slightly coconut chocolate coating my cupcakes are steady frozen and I'm going to dip them upside down into that nice smooth liquefied Magic Shell let the excess drip off for just a second or two and then flip them up the right way and you've got chocolate coated high-hat cupcakes I'm going to finish mine off with a nice little sprinkle of that golden treasure candy and on the outside these look just like a lovely golden chocolate cupcake when we cut into them we know there's a rainbow and a hidden corner of treasure inside chocolate on the outside rainbow on the inside and filled with berry treasure I'm pretty sure cupcakes don't actually get better than this so I Lucky rainbow high-hat cupcakes are done and now it's time to move on through our simple shamrock cupcakes you want to take your template and place a piece of parchment over the top and then I've got green candy melts and I'm just putting them into a snap sealed bag and snipping off kind of like a smallest tip to make a bit of a makeshift piping bag I'm going to trace around the shamrock template and you'll notice they've got quite elongated little stalks on them so that we've got kind of a base to stick inside our cupcakes let's go set at room temperature and still they're looking pretty firm before putting them into the fridge for five minutes before you stick them on the cupcakes setting them at room temperature just means they dry nice and flat and they don't curl up which is generally what happens when you some straight in the fridge all right the cupcakes I'm going to use my rainbow cupcakes again and you'll notice that affect them in gold cupcake wrappers because gold treasure and rainbow all seem to go together I've got my same piping bag again with the round open piping tip and I'm just get apart this time quite a low fat swirl but I'm also being careful to come out to the outside edges of the soil so it kind of creates a bit of a nice high side wall instead of using our multitude of treasure coated in gold for the sprinkles on this one I'm just going to stick to those flat confetti sprinkles but using the exact same technique to get them from bright colors to gold gently roll just the size of the buttercream frosting on your rainbow cupcakes so you end up with some of those golden coin treasures sprinkles but just around the outside edges and the top of your cupcakes are still nice and white then you can pull your shamrocks out of the fridge and they should be nice and firm if you need to break up a little bit just to get them to size you can and these are quite large I'm placing them directly into the center of the frosting but you'll notice I've got them at a slight angle and that's actually going to help support the size and the weight of the shamrock so it's got support at the base and then a little support to lean on on the right hand side when you bite into these ones you've got the coins the white frosting and the shamrock of course but inside we've got the rainbow literally everything st. Patty's Day stands for if for some reason these two ideas aren't quite enough to round out you're safe at ease o celebrations make sure you check out my surprise inside rainbow cupcakes from last year and I've got a ton of amazing rainbow cake cupcakes dessert and cookie recipes over on my channel if you want to check them out as for this video not one but two really fun st.

hey guys it's Elise and welcome back to my cupcake addiction today we're going to combine two of my all-time favorite things donuts and cake and we're going to make this amazing over-the-top donut drip cake to make your donut cake of course you're going to need cake so I've got a double batch of my favorite chocolate cake recipe I'm going to leave it down below and I've baked that in 3/8 inch tins in each layers about an inch inch and a half high for my vanilla cake oh she used a packet cake recipe today I did this because my vanilla sponge recipes a little too light and fluffy this is going to be a pretty decent cake so I want to make sure it can hold up under the weight of all that chocolate cake I added a little bit of strawberry extract and pink food coloring to my vanilla layers so that I've got strawberry frosting kind of pink colored cake layers to interchange with my Brown I've got a cake board and a turntable I'm using a triple batch of my perfectly pipeable buttercream frosting I'll link to the recipe down below I took all three batches together then divided them in half and tinted half pink and left the other half white you can change this color scheme up to suit the occasion you're making it for I've got some dark chocolate and some cream I've chosen quite thinner chocolate blocks I'm just using milk chocolate but again choose your favorite I'm also using some melted pink candy melts or you can turn your own white chocolates a couple of pre-made Donuts make your own get them store-bought and a ton of sprinkles I've got a batch of my vanilla sugar cookie dough I'm going to leave all of your dough recipes cake recipes and ganache quantities in the description box below so make sure you check that out if you're going to recreate this cake as far as tools go we've got an offset spatula a serrated edge knife and a cake leveler some zip seal bags and a tray lined with a bit of parchment you're also going to need a rolling pin and just a little bit of additional flour to roll your cookies out with let's get started with our outrageous doughnut cake the first thing we're going to do is make our donut cookies because they need to cook and then they need to cool and we've got to decorate them you can also do this bit the day before so you notice my cookie dough it's always wrapped in plastic wrap and less I'm actually physically using it so it doesn't dry out it's also always refrigerated because if your cookie dough isn't cool when it goes in the oven your cookies to get a spread and they're not going to look like Donuts anymore so sprinkle down a generous amount of flour and you want this to be quite thick we don't want to have a sugar cookie here because it's got to hold its own way now you take a little bit of plastic wrap and just lay it over my cookie dough and this is going to give us kind of like the edge of the doughnut hello kind of rounded side edge of the doughnut I used a bowl because I didn't have a circle cookie cutter this large I'm gonna place it onto my cookie dough and then I'm gonna press down with all of my muscles lifting up now you can see by using that plastic wrap what we've got is a really really nice rounded edge just like a doughnut for my center hole I'm gonna use the back edge of my cookie cutter not the sharp edge because again kind of want it to be a little bit more rounded I'm just gonna slide my offset spatula just underneath the cookie making sure he's not stuck to the bench at all and then carefully lifting that's gonna go over here onto my piece of parchment and then I'm gonna take my popsicle sticks from right in to the bottom section this is going to be what sort of holds it onto the cake can actually cook the popsicle sticks in the oven keep going and so you've used all of your cookie dough it doesn't matter how many doughnuts you have here I think more is always better but I did a really large one a medium sized one and then I've got a smaller one and I'm going to use my scraps to make some really small ones so don't leave any cookie dough unused if these ones are still chilled and feel cold to touch from the rolling process you can put them straight in the oven if you're not sure if they feel a little warm put them in the fridge for 10 minutes first so they go in nice and cold these ones are going to go into a moderate oven for 10 to 15 minutes and I'll know they're done when they just slightly start to brown around the outside edges once your cookies are cooked you want to let them sit on the baking tray for about 5 to 10 minutes before transferring them to a cooling rack where they can completely cool we're going to level out cakes so I've just invested in a 13 dollar cake leveler normally I'd use a serrated knife but this does give me a more even result and I don't want to take too much height off my cakes so I'm really only taking as little as possible to keep them all about the same height check out the color of this gorgeous pink cake underneath it's always a little bit more muted on the outside but check that out it's absolutely stunning if you guys are following my facebook lives you would have seen me turn this into like leftover cake parfait no waste this is going to be my mom's birthday cake so I have to make it today but I actually don't get to eat it today and I'm not going to go over day without cake once you've got the top leveled off you can turn it upside down take your serrated knife now and then just trim the smallest amount off the bottom this is really only pertinent for the pink cakes because I don't wanna see any of that brown with the lovely white frosting in between the layers you want to repeat that with all of your pink layers and all of your brown chocolate layers so that you've got six lovely similar-sized trimmed ready to go cake layers now if we go word association there are very few words that pair quite as beautifully with Donuts than sprinkles we depart from coffee coffee also pay as well so I'm going to make like a funfetti sprinkle mix frosting straight out vanilla frosting and then quite a few of my sort of long funfetti sprinkles and I'm just going to stir those through this way the sprinkles on my donut cake are on the inside super cute funfetti frosting all right so now you want to take your cake board and we're going to stack our cake layers it doesn't matter if you want to start with pink or brown I'm going to go with brown and you need a little bit of frosting down on that board just to stick it in place now with my frosting between the layers I'm going to do a really thin coat especially on these chocolate cakes just to catch any chocolate crumbs because I want those funfetti sprinkles to be able to sort of shine through the frosting once you've got a nice thin coat then you can come and add in like a bit more frosting and it'll be nice and white so as you cut it you'll get a really nice kind of a white sprinkly line in between each layer whenever you do this you want to make sure that your frosting comes out over the outside of the layers so push it right out so it's just slightly overlapping with the edge of your cake and that way when we go to smooth it off we run of any gaps or lumps on the inside of our cake the defrosting free what about pink layers I love the addition of strawberry into this cake because for me strawberry donuts I mean chocolate donuts are good but strawberry donuts are where it's at when I go to the donut store once your cakes looking stacked I always like to trim the outside edges of my cake provided I'm working with a fairly solid cake so I'm just going to use my serrated edge knife and I'm just going to trim down so that I've got a completely even cake all the way down and I expose all that gorgeous color underneath kinda looks a bit like a Neapolitan cake at the moment I made a massive mess so I had to tidy up but my cake is ready for its crumb cart you just want to add just a very very thin bit of frosting all the way around the outside edges it's going to catch all the crumbs from those freshly cut sides of the cake just kind of trap them all in place and give it really nice firm base to put our next coat of frosting over so don't be too fussy with your crumb coat once you're happy that you've got a decent sort of a layer of frosting and all of your crumbs are trapped below we're going to pop it off into the fridge for 20 minutes while that goes in the fridge we're going to make our ganache so you want to take your chocolate and also your whipping cream or thickened cream and I'm going to pour my cream over the top I want this to be a relatively thick ganache but I also don't want it to be hot so I'm going to make it now and then just let it sit at room temperature for at least 20 minutes before I even attempt to put it on the cake you want to microwave that on for 30 second intervals stirring in between until it's completely smooth so with your ganache made and it should have no lumps for a drip cake you really don't want any lumps I always like to cover mine with a bit of plastic wrap but you want to make sure that when you cover that the plastic wraps like almost well actually touching the ganache that's just going to stop it from forming a crust so we don't get any little chunks and lumps in our perfectly smooth drip off to the side now your donut cookies should be cooked and kind of looking a little bit like popsicles it's time to decorate so I've melted my pink candy melts and also my dark candy melts or dark chocolate and I'm just going to put them into a ziplock bag and snip off a very fine tip starting with the pink one I'm going to trace an outline all the way around the outside but leaving some of those little peeks of brown cookie poking through and then once your outlines in place you want to just line around the center hole and then fill it in with all those candy melts on the cooling rack you want to give it a couple of good taps on the bench so that your candy melt or your chocolate distributes and kind of smoothes out and then I use some larger sprinkles just to sprinkle gently on top of my pink donor for the next one I opted for dark chocolate and again the same technique but for this one I opted for hundreds and thousands our small sprinkles all over the one side of the doughnut because when I order donut I kind of like to get almost sprinkles in one bite decorate all of your little Donuts and then use that same technique to decorate your store-bought or your fresh cinnamon doughnuts that's going to give us a mixture of sort of small large medium real and cookie doughnuts so we can really pile those doughnuts high on top of this cake now so far everything on this cake is looking pretty round from the round cake itself to all of our donor shapes those real donuts it's round round round so I want to add some kind of angles into it and also add as much height as I possibly can you guys can create your own chocolate shards but I'm just going to use a regular milk chocolate block I've picked quite a thin one now I want to make sure here that this is not cold or it's going to crack when I try to cut it so using a sharp knife I'm going to cut it on an angle all the way across and you'll see that I'm kind of just almost creating or carving a bit of a line because it's not refrigerated it will melt a little bit quick as there you do have to be a little bit more careful and then you should just be able to carve straight down perfect you'll notice that I'm doing all of my touching on this side that's because I want the other side to be my good side I don't want to be leaving fingerprints all over it placing my pink candy melts or your pink chocolate into a snaps your bag push it all the way down to one end of the bag and then snip off a nice sort of a fine corner take your ziplock bag with your pink candy melts now and we're just going to create like a drizzle effect or a drip effect so I'm going to come around the top and making sure that I overlap the sides a little bit create a very strategic almost cartoon like looking drip I'm not so concerned about the back because the back of the cake is the back of the cake but I do want the front to look really really cute and almost cartoonish filling in with that zips your bag and then I'm going to take some sprinkles and then go too crazy on the sprinkles I like just like alright you can go a little crazy on the sprinkles perfect let that completely set if you make those on a tray you can actually put them off into the fridge you want those shards to be super nice and refrigerated set before we try to put them in the cake so not cold when we start decorating them but definitely is that when we stab them in so your cake should have it's nice little crumb coat set and it should be pretty nice and firm to touch so we've got our shards chilling out all of our donuts are done now I'm going to put on my final coat of frosting or my good coat of frosting so you can apply a really generous amount of frosting all over the cake always make more frosting than you think you're going to need once all of your frostings on and it should be a nice thick coat I'm going to use this this is actually like a cake scraper that I bought at a decorating class one day but a metal ruler will do virtually the same thing so I always like to start with the tops that I can make sure make a is nice and level all the way over and then scrape off any excess frosting and smooth out the sides of your cake once you're happy that all of your sides are smooth with a clean scraper again you just want to come and just kind of drag back almost like a cement leveler so that you've got nice sharp edges something like that I'm just going to tidy up the base of my board because I don't want it to be too messy you want to work quite quickly here because we need to act on our sprinkling before that buttercream starts to crust now when it comes to the sprinkles around this cake you may not want to place them quite as precisely as I am but I'm actually going to use tweezers and evenly spaced out my long sprinkles and then I also found just some sort of smaller and larger round sprinkles to break it up I put quite a few sprinkles around the very very bottom section of the cake but I wanted to look like there was a ton of the bottom and they kind of got thinner as they went up so it doesn't look messy it kind of looked I'm going to say strategically placed I don't often use tweezers in my decorating but today I think the effects worth it once your sprinkles are all done your cake goes back into the fridge for 20 minutes to allow that buttercream coat to set and for it to get nice and cool before we apply our drip coming back from the fridge and our cakes looking amazing I actually kind of like how it looks against my purple top it's quite a nice color combination so I've got my ganache and I want to show you guys just a little tip for your ganache I've made quite a future of cakes with varying results and the consistency of the ganache for the drip is everything you get the wrong consistency it's either going to slide down the cake and pull at the bottom or it's going to sit at the top and not go down far enough so I always like to test it out and I mean you can see that I sat it for 20 minutes then I microwaved it for 10 seconds just to bring it back a little bit running up but if you want to test it take a teaspoon full of ganache I'm putting mine on my scraper but you could just use something like a cake board and then you want to tilt it basically straight that's going to tell you how quickly how far and how fast your ganache is going to travel mine's going to go a little slower because I know that my cakes cold but for me that's pretty cool it hasn't gone straight off the end just yet it's traveling at a slow enough speed that I know I'm going to get some nice lengths and sizes of drip without having everything just kind of like stripes down the side of the cake pulling messily at the bottom in my sprinkles I'm going to work quite quickly here because I don't want my ganache to start to set and I'm only going to add just over half of it to begin with you can always add more but you can't take it away on to the top of the cake alright so just over half I've added now you can see that I'm you can kind of control it at this point if it starts to go too much on one side just use the spoon to bring it back and then I'm going to use that spatula I'm going to very gently cake turntables are fantastic here turn that around I'm just evenly pushing it out to the edges and then I'm going to just sort of just encourage it to go over the sides little intervals all the way around try to make these two even and our drip is looking amazing now I have two teeny tiny little sugar cookies I told you to use all of your cookie dough and that does not matter how small they get so I'm actually going to put these guys on the front of my cake I found a little gap and I think they're going to look adorable so I'm going to use just a little of my can - because my buttercream is already frosted and I'm just going to put just a little on the back of each don't put too much because you really don't want to like poking out the sides onto that pink frosting we don't want to see the brown ganache anywhere but on top and then on goes my teeny tiny one that's also a really good trick if you've got any little bits of frosting that you're not particularly happy with her if any of your drips have gone rogue cover them up this is always the fun part so you want to start just piling up all of your doughnuts and candy shards now I always start with the biggest piece the biggest and the heaviest whenever you've got a heavy piece make sure it's not too close to the back of the cake or it will start to pull the cake downwards then in goes my next little donut cookie in the very back here I'm going to put some of my chocolate shards that are all really nice and chilled with my chocolate shards I like to make just a little kind of a knife imprint just where I want them to go because I never want to put too much pressure on especially those fine points of chocolate and in it goes off on a bit of an angle and then you just want to keep piling on all of your little Donuts your decorated donuts donuts and shards and I actually thought it was kind of cute just to stack the little Donuts so I just grabbed a skewer and just pushed it through so that they're all in kind of a stack but do make sure that you bring that skewer out of the cake before or during the eating so I'll let the guests know that it's in there so that no one accidentally eats it I've gone with my a couple of big shards at the back and your smaller cookies will just stand up in that ganache by themselves the last thing I want to do is just stick this final stack on top push down my skewer make sure I can't see the top of it what do you guys reckon did I overdo it it's a donut ribcage it's meant to be overdone everything about this screams more crazy wild and over-the-top which is exactly how I like it I hope you guys have enjoyed today's pretty cool donut drip cake video if you're not already subscribe to the channel make sure you do two new videos every week and as always guys thanks very much for watching you 
hey guys it's Elise and welcome back to my cupcake addiction so you guys know that I love coming up with different ways that you guys can use the tins and things that you've already got laying around at home so I was looking at my left in the other day and I thought kind of looks like it's the same shape as a Lego brick so today I'm going to be using a regular loaf tin and a mini cupcake tray and we're going to be making a Lego brick pinata that's basically a Lego brick that you can smash and it's going to be full of teeny tiny candy Lego bricks Oh whatever candy you like funnily enough I also decided to shoot for you guys a Lego brick cake so I'm going to link to that video down below it's a bonus video this week you get two for one the things you're going to need to make your Lego brick pinata of course you'll need a loaf tin I'm using an Ikea loaf tin I'm going to leave dimensions down below but try to get one that's quite kind of square on the edges and not too round at either end I've also got a cake board or you'll need a firm piece of cardboard and I've tightly wrapped that in some parchment paper I'll show you why as we get along I've got a mini cupcake tray I've got two packets of red candy melts because I wanted this one to be red otherwise you can tint and color your own chocolate or do it in white chocolate dark chocolate whatever you like I've got my Lego brick candy and this guy's I mean this is just cool in itself you can actually build like there's the right little Lego brick pieces that I could make a house out of Lego candy and live in it and then eat my way out I'm going to mix that in with some little mini M&amp;Ms just for a bit of differentiation in size and with some little mini Oreos and some scissors spatula and a snack seal bag let's get started before I go getting it all dirty I'm going to trace around the top edge of my loaf tin I'm going to use a pen just to trace around the outside edge so that I know the size of the top of my loaf tin perfectly beautiful you can pop that off to the side we won't need it till later take some of your candy melts now and you want to pop them into your zip seal bag and then we give a snippet generous tip off the end kind of like a piping tip but a pretty big one okay I'm going to do ten little dots of candy melt straight in the bottom of ten little muffin cases I'm using a metal nonstick today and I'm not using any cupcake cases or anything in there I'm going straight into the muffin pan in goes 10 Oreos on top of that little dot of red chocolate I'm doing 10 here I only want 8 but I definitely want to spares because some of them are going to look better than others when they're all finished working pretty quickly because we don't really want that bottom section to be setting before we add in the rest I'm going to use a zip sealed bag and I'm going to squeeze with quite a bit of pressure to force more candy melt or chocolate in around the outside edge of each of my little Oreo cookies each of your muffin tins should be about 3/4 full you don't want to take them all the way to the top you want to just cover your Oreo I mean you could just make these out of solid chocolate but I feel like if there's a way to squeeze in mini Oreo into this dish somehow we should definitely take advantage of it I'm going to give that one a couple of really good taps on the bench to make sure that all of that candy is all the way down the sides of my cookies and then they're going to go off into the fridge to set don't worry if the tops are not perfectly smooth we're gonna fix that when these guys are ready while they're in the fridge doing their thing we're going to take the loaf tin and that has to be very dry and completely clean anything that in that loaf tin is going to end up in the top of your Lego brick so make sure there's no cake or any dirt or anything in there so you want to take down half of your candy melt mix or even a little bit more than half pour it into your loaf tin I'm pretty sure that this is not even a nonstick loaf tin it's kind of got like a bit of a coating but it doesn't have like that Teflon coating and it works just fine I also love this idea if you've got little square cake tins or smaller cake tins you could make these are going to be eight bricks to make four bricks you make two bricks long bricks I'm using my spatula just to pull that candy melt all the way up the sides if you're going to use colored chocolate here it's not going to be quite as thick the candy melts are really quite thick so they require a bit of dragging and they actually stick to the sides a little bit better than chocolate but in my opinion chocolate tastes a little bit better but it's up to you alright making sure that it's all in the corners I'm just going to give it a quick tap on the bench and because I don't want a super thick top that's going to be impossible to smash I'm actually going to pull quite a bit of that out again just giving it another go around the Edge's making sure that it completely coats those sidewalls but you're better off to do two thin coats here than one big thick one it just makes for a better coverage and it also makes it a bit easier to smash so what you look before there is nice neat even coverage and then I'm just going to take my spatula come around those top edges to make sure that I've got a really nice neat edge which in turn is going to give us a nice neat base on our completed LEGO brick this one goes off into the fridge for 15 minutes and then we're going to come back and do a second coat of the candy melt once top coat set and that's just set to touch you want to pour in enough of your remaining candy melt but you need to keep aside one cup because that's going to be to make our base so pour it all the rest but just keep a couple side again use the spatula to spread it out scoop it up the sides this time making sure that your top edge is really nice and thick and then I'm just going to level off the insides and scrape out any excess and again coming around that top edge and making sure that it is really nice and neat back off into the fridge this one goes that's going to go to the fridge for 15 minutes and then I'm going to put it in the freezer for five minutes putting it in the freezer is going to make the chocolate snap chill and it's going to contract away from the insides of our metal loaf tin you want to take a fry pan or a skillet and you want to heat it up so it's nice and hot and by this time your little buttons should be pretty much done turn them over someone will likely just fall out but you can give them a couple of encouraging taps one might fall out and if they don't come out straight away just press gently on the base of some of those little cupcake tins and they will come out I promise you so you can see why did those couple of extras we've got a couple here where we just didn't meet up the chocolate quite enough and you can see the Oreo poking through of course you could patch them up by just kind of squeezing in a little bit more candy milk but I figure this way we've got eight perfect ones and a couple of testers to get you through the making process so you don't have to go hungry so I've got my fryer pad I'm gonna take it off heat because the heats gonna last in there for a while and we're just going to take each of our little buttons and give them their own little bit of personal space cuz the chocolate will actually start to burn you just want to rest them on the heat until they're nice and flat and then quick pull them off and straight down onto your piece of parchment repeating with all ten of your little buttons this is going to make them really nice and flat and all a bit of a similar size but it means that when they all go on to the Lego brick there's going to be no like kind of wonkiness they should all sit nice and flush so when that comes out of the freezer I can already see that mines releasing from all of those edges and I can actually kind of feel it just wiggling around it's gonna come out super easy I'm still gonna be gentle though and just make sure perfect there's the basis for our LEGO brick put it back in the container because that's just gonna help keep everything nice and supported and then you can fill it with candy this is always the best part of any pinata I mean apart from smashing it and eating it be really gentle when you're putting your candy and don't just throw it all in there and don't leave that in the freezer for more than five minutes you want the contraction but you don't want it to be frozen solid because otherwise it has a tendency to crack when it comes back down to room temperature it's a fine balance don't fill that all the way to the top you want to leave about that much about a half an inch to an inch gap because we need to still stick a base on it and I don't really want candy sticking all over the base I want that candy to be free all right this is where a little board and a template comes in remember we've traced around the outside and we only need it to be the same size as the inside edge but we do need it to stick nicely to that base so I'm going to take my melted candy melts and you might need to remelt these if you do just pop them in the microwave and I'm just going to scoop like I said about a cup onto my board make sure this base is pretty thick you definitely don't want this to be too thin because it's got to hold all of the weight of all of that candy and if your birthday boys gonna be anything like mine it's gonna be rattling around he's going to be shaking it and it's kind of a pretty decent job to do holding everything together now I'm going to use just a ruler because I want this to be pretty neat on that base we can trim it a little but you don't have to trim it too much so I'm gonna come in about where I think my pen line is and just take away any of that excess come down just inside of that pen line on all four sides all right this is how we get the base on our pinata because we need the candy to free but then we need the base to stick to this outside edge so I'm going to take it and I am going to get right down at eye level and stick it straight on the reason we've got the board is to support our candy melt so that it doesn't all flop inside nice and eye level with me I was going to say cake but with my pinata make sure that it's meeting up on all four sides and when it gets that I'm just going to press it gently not too hard I want it to stick but I don't want all the candy melt to go out all four sides perfect now that one goes into the fridge as is don't be tempted to turn it just at the moment if you want to you can run your finger around the edge while it's upside down you can't flip it so you kind of have to just do this bow feeling but you can run your finger all the way around this gets a little messy but it is a really simple way to neaten up those edges without having to do it after it's all set just be very careful not to shift your board on top one thing you definitely don't wanna risk doing and I did do this on one of my prototypes is under refrigerating this base it cools a little bit slower than the metal outside of the tin because it's on that wooden backing board so give it at least thirty minutes I'm going to take just a knife and I'm just going to cut through that tape so that I can remove the piece of parchment all right remove your board and this does two things it makes it a little bit easier to pull off the parchment from the base but it also allows you to check that that base is super nice and set before you go and make the same mistake that I did earlier all right I'm happy that it's chilled enough now so I'm gonna peel back my parchment to reveal my base now you will have a little bit of overhang around these outside edges so I'm just gonna use a knife just to very gently just shave them away I'm gonna flip my board upside down so that I'm not putting any added pressure and I'm gonna flip my tin we're gonna lift see if it comes out how I'm hoping it will it looks amazing but not quite like a Lego brick yet you want to take your little buttons now and you just position them on top position them before you stick them just in case because you need them really nice and evenly spaced and you don't start gluing and realize you've kind of spaced them out a bit weird all right I'm happy with my positioning so I'm going to stick a tiny amount like a quarter teaspoon you don't want this seeping out the bottom edges of your little Oreos because otherwise it's going to make everything look messy and we've gone to so much trouble to keep it neat so just a really tiny little blob on the back and down they go into your pre-assigned position this thing is adorable it's our gigantic Lego pinata I always think Lego looks better when it comes in a couple of different colors so I did the red pinata I made a yellow Lego cake which is your bonus video for the week and I'm going to link to that down below if you want to see how I made this one and then I also made a third exactly the same as the Lego pinata but instead of filling it with candy I stuffed it with a surprise gift it's kind of like an edible gift box now the moment of truth let's smash a Lego pinata look at all that candy there's LEGO bricks this M&amp;Ms this is Lego lovers heaven so once the kids have smashed that and had their fill of candy the birthday boy or girl gets to smash their own present out of their own chocolate Lego brick I'm going to smash on the end because I kind of wrap this like a bit of a bonbon so it was long and thin enough to be able to get out reveal the present within alright it's a small gift but it's served in a Lego chocolate block pretty awesome and then finally the cake so you can kind of see why I had to make the bonus video this week the Lego pinata is amazing turning it into a gift box is just a fun idea and then adding a cake and having a block in all three of those colors brings this idea to life I hope you guys have enjoyed this awesome lego idea I do have other Lego videos on the channel I think maybe even enough to make a Lego playlist so I'm going to link to that down below make sure you subscribe to the channel for two new videos every week and as always guys thanks very much for watching you 
welcome back my name is Elise and I'm a compulsive online shopper over the weekend I went down a bit of a rabbit hole and ended up with five random kitchen slices that you've probably never even knew you needed actually I don't know if any of you need I'm going to put these guys to the test to see if these slices actually improve your life or if they can all just be done with a regular kitchen knife watermelon slice a kiwi fruit flavor egg slice our hot dog slicer and a pineapple slicer so apart for the egg slicer I've actually not used any of these before this is the first time I'm seeing them this is pretty intense is our watermelon slicer but looking at the packet it appears supposed to cut the watermelon in half my opinion this is always the worst part of a watermelon cut and the place driving most likely to slice my arm off so we really need a slicer if we still need enough not as bad as a pumpkin but pretty close alright I have my two tubs of a watermelon let's see now looking at the box apparently they go in this way and I think I just grabbed it out but doesn't lift it out so then I guess whoo easier than a knife let's put it to the test let's time it alright alright I'm going to use a knife to slice a piece of watermelon and then I mean you just applied for this last piece of watermelon first up the knife I don't want a nice like a pretty nice piece start the timer now done piece of watermelon still tastes good alright now next time up ready set go wait on hold on get it out come out come out it's broken oh it's not as cute I don't know I didn't think I like the watermelon slice ah I don't feel like we need it people watermelon slice up I mean it's up to you didn't really make my life any easier I'm still a miss pace so it seems like these also act as a tone so if we come in and make a fresh slice we slice all the way through then you go back in oh that makes more sense all right that is actually marginally easier still I don't know if I want this in my drawers at home in what grab whatever long I don't like the watermelon slicer not my thing snack slice up for those times when you need a bulk amount of Kiwi slices done very quickly the Kiwi slicer is apparently you'll go to gadget so it comes with a tiny little knife inside which I'm going to pull out don't need a knife already winning over the watermelon slice up and then I'm going to slice this in half with my very close knife now I know it works it works Kiwi the not too hot my fitting huh all right so me a small knife okay for the kids now apparently I shove this in the center and then twist and I should have oh if I didn't drop them on the table for our perfect slices of Kiwi oh I like the Kiwi cutter this is actually cutting my kids could and would do by themselves on the slices of Kiwi a perfect I just want to show you guys that twist and remove action one more time like a real infomercial the Kiwi slicer is perfect for all of your Kiwi slicing needs simply insert to the center of your Kiwi give it a quick twist like so and a pop perfectly sliced Kiwi every time I actually raise a Kiwi slicer I think it's good as far as random kitchen slices go I actually feel like I would have a use for a Kiwi slicer and with a little plastic knife it means the kids can do it themselves so can we pass out as a win the egg slicer possibly one of the coolest and most versatile and most widely found slices that you might have in your kitchen so I've got a boiled egg which is peeled no shell you pop it inside our little monsters mouth and then these little strings go down and cut into ready for the perfect little slices ah perfectly even egg sandwich egg on toast I love this I think it's brilliant and I literally if you are only going to get one slice up through the egg slicer and make it a monster one because he's cute now the other thing that I discovered about the egg slicer is it's not just for eggs you can use up a mushroom you can use it for strawberries so I'm going to egg slicer strawberry jam we go with the egg slicer and a little bit of help getting it out and perfectly sliced strawberries or mushrooms kind of soft fruits nothing too hard I love the egg slice of the egg slicer is a win every time you should be able to pick these up for less than five bucks but you will use these so much it's ridiculous let's face it nobody needs a hotdog slicer but I bet you're all gonna well one could use adorable the hotdog slice that comes with this little tiny ketchup container at the front so let's add some ketchup I already love to and then in goes our hotdog my hotdogs a little long what's going to happen here the standard sized hotdog I didn't go for an extra large let's see I'm gonna push really quite odd wait really I'm finding the hotdog place or a little hard really oh just got to put a bit of muscle behind it alright the hotdog has sliced the ketchup is in now we'll see what kind of pieces we get would be better if this is a tiny fork in we go ah why not these are the free car hotdogs give them in the sauce this one is awesome so when we take the hot dog off the slicer oh all of the pieces stay inside so you can remove it maybe slice multiple don't do that just leave it in the dog leave it in a dog but the hotdog slice are not incredibly practical nobody actually needs it but it's lots of fun if you set of a lot almost dogs at home I might be eating mine out of the hotdog slicer from now on hands up if you hate slicing pineapple two hands pineapple is the worst thing to slice so I'm hoping the pineapple slicer is going to give me not only awesome slices but also spend my pineapple into a bit of a cool bowl you've got fruit salad in there you could put a cocktail in there and I know that at some places I think SeaWorld makes you pull a pineapple flavored ice cream in there it's an edible Bowl what's not to love so I'm going to start by cutting off the top using that as a trendy hat now I'm not really supposed decide again this one does need a knife but I feel like with pineapple we waste a lot trying to get all of those little black flecks and things off the outside so I'm hoping this is going to be the solution now my pineapple place that has like these little teeth here and then more little keep it looks a bit hectic actually I'm going to put the tea around the center core and then I'm going to twist fold the climber I have done no googling or watched any tutorials on how to use any of these things and go in with like the easiest common approach whoa okay twist is your lift gets it out it whoa we have pineapple slices alright now this guy comes off I think so that I can get the pineapple off the top it's like a pineapple back ah it's a pineapple spiral we made a couple pearls I'm so excited by this yes you can turn them into slices or a spiral this is like those potatoes that won't okay no don't lift it so high super cute I love this end there's a little juice in the bottom so we can drink the juice and added bonus and then it turns it into basically a cup you could serve cocktails in this I should have got a little bit deeper I still got probably three or four slices I'm gonna try and get them out this is awesome this one that stays in we go alright grab me those last few slices of pineapple so we don't waste anything Oh hit the bottom okay you'll know when you hit the bottom and give it a little twist I know the spiral how quickly we got bored with that alright that's it we made a pineapple cup and pineapple swirls and spirals and slices the pineapple slice you guys awesome so out of five random kitchen slices I'm actually going to end up keeping fall which is going to cause a huge amount of clutter but a ton of fun in my kitchen I love them all except the watermelon flavor it was kind of crap just sliced your own watermelon hope you guys enjoyed seeing some fun slices if there's anything else you want me to buy and try let me know in the comments down below and as always thanks for much for watching the Kiwi clashers perfect for a little Kiwi slicing needs simply insert to the center of your Kiwi give it a quick twist like so and ask for perfectly sliced Kiwi every time 
hey everyone its Elise and welcome back to my cupcake addiction ever since I did my little fully edible watermelon ice cream bowls I've been wanting to do something else watermelon but what sorry today I'm going to show you guys how to make super simple no beg watermelon chocolate Oreos watermelon Oreos chocolate there's a whole lot going on here but they're really simple the things you'll need to make your watermelon Oreos I'm using an Oreo mold so if you're going to do de toros this is by far and away the easiest and the best way to get a good result but you can also use just a regular muffin tin with no muffin liner in it I've got a circle cutter at a toothpick and my circle cutter is just about the same size as the bottom of my mold not a must it's just going to help us neat things up my Oreos of course and then I've got miniature chocolate chips and I've got melted either chocolate or candy melts in white green and then bright vibrant pink a little paintbrush and a snaps your bag so the first thing we have to do is we're going to set just a small teaspoon of the pink in the center of each of our little Oreo sections just the center you want to make sure you leave about this much around the edges because that's kind of going to make the the rind of our watermelon perfect once your Pink's done you want to take your white now and you're just going to add just a small amount of that green into the white to make like a really really pale green that should just about do it perfect that's what we're looking for so you want it to be quite a nice contrast in between the really light green and that really dark green for our watermelon skin so now I'm going to take my paintbrush and just dip it in and it's quite a flat sort of a paintbrush essentially I'm just going to do a little kind of a squid 'old line going up all the way around my little Oreos this is going to make like the little kind of pattern or the stripes on the watermelon skin you're like seven or eight of those just around each of your little Oreo molds kind of evenly spaced apart once you're finished and you know that that's all of the areas that you want to make you can actually put that green back into the darker green and it will just all get absorbed so that you've got more to work with to coat your Oreos I'm going to put those into the fridge just for a couple of minutes to allow that pink to set and then we're going to be ready to start stuffing them full of Oreo goodness whenever I'm doing Oreos like this I like to use snap seal bag to put the chocolate in because I just find that it helps me get it a little bit neater it stops me from over filling them it's just more precise so I'm going to snip off pretty generous little tip off the end there and with my REO is at the ready I'm going to squeeze in around the top section and just a teeny tiny bit over that pink and then in goes an Oreo pressing it down nice and firmly I'm just going to do two at a time I'm going to come in with that snaps your bag and make sure that I'm applying a bit of pressure it also helps to force that chocolate right down into the Oreo mold generous amount on top once they're all full let me to give them a couple of good hard taps on the bench and that can sometimes make your Oreos kind of come back up to the top again so I'm just going to use my spatula just to push them down make sure everybody's snug in their little space and because I want really nice neat backs on them I'm just going to use my spatula and just scrape along the top straight into my weeding bowl perfect another good tap and they're off into the free coming back from the fridge and you should be able to see all of your little watermelon Oreos inside their little house so you just want to pop them out there should be really nice and well set and out comes our almost completed teeny tiny little watermelon Oreos now I've got that circle cutter so that you can actually neaten them off without having to handle them too much by just coming around the outside and just cutting it just helps you to sort of get rid of any little overlap that may have been around from where the offset spatula kind of edged over the edges a little bit the last step is and remelt them if you need to just taking a little bit more of your remaining pink candy melts and affixing our little tiny mini chop chips now I like to do this with a bit of precision just because I think it really pays off over like five or six and I tried to make them sort of symmetrical but not too perfect so we're done we've got our gorgeous little watermelon chop dipped Oreos I love these guys they're so simple to make they're no-bake and they're perfect if like me you're kind of a little obsessed with watermelons and pineapples I hope you guys have enjoyed today's tutorial make sure you check out my channel my cupcake addiction if you haven't already subscribe to new videos every week and as always I very much for one day 
[Music] welcome back to my cupcake addiction I'm Elise strode and today I am sharing with you my best ever basic chocolate brownie but there is nothing basic about this brownie I am tipping this as the world's best brownie it's not from a packet there's a couple of steps to it but I absolutely guarantee it is worth the effort this thing is fudgy it's delicious it's light its moist its chewy its flaky it's everything a good brownie should be I've showed you guys a couple of fun ways to decorate brownies but I thought look let's go back to basics here and let's just bake the thing to make your brownies you're going to need some unsweetened cocoa powder some unsalted butter fine sugar good-quality dark chocolate eggs and plain or all-purpose flour start by preheating your oven to either 160 degrees Celsius or 320 Fahrenheit this is a little lower than a regular cake temperature I'm gonna take my butter and put that into a bowl you can also do this in the saucepan if you want to do the saucepan method heat your butter until it's boiling in a saucepan over a medium heat and then add the chocolate but I'm gonna do microwave method so I'm putting the butter and the chocolate in together popping it into the microwave for a minute at a time stirring in between until it's beautiful and smooth your chocolate mixture can just sit off to the side so it starts to cool down a little bit and then you want to crack your three eggs into a mixing bowl I love cracking eggs then I'm going to add my sugar and you're going to mix this on high speed for at least five minutes you want this super light and fluffy here we go this should almost be starting to look like a very lightly whipped cream but it should be super light and super fluffy that's what gives our brownies air you can put those two off to the side and now we're going to do some sifting we're actually the double sift because that's what's going to give even more air lightness and fluffiness while still keeping the richness and fuzziness of a brownie so I'm going to take my flour and then my cocoa and just sift them together into a bowl this is a very professional sifting action in honed over years and years of sifting you want to take your three bowls dry ingredients fluffy egg ingredients delicious chocolatey ingredients in that order we're going to mix our delicious chocolatey ingredients through the egg mixture quickly start mixing them together using big sweeping motions using that really big mixing technique helps to mix everything together without losing any of the air that we worked so hard to get into our egg and sugar mixture I'm going to mix it till it's almost completely combined and then we're going to Reese if our cocoa and flour mixture over the top again using those lovely big round sweeping motions and you want to mix this through until you just can't see any more of the white streaks you don't want to over mix your brownie again we're trying to preserve the air that's within oh my god I know I know I'm using a 10 by 15 baking tray here and I'm just going to give it a spray and then line it with a little bit of parchment I kind of spray it to keep the parchment in place it's a little bit of an extra but it just stops it from flopping around when you put your brownie mixture in here we go the slope all [Music] we're using the back of either a spatula I'm just going to use my wooden spoon push it out into the corners don't be too rough on your brownie again you want to make sure you're not knocking too much air out of it now you're going to take that tray of chocolatey deliciousness and pop it off into your preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes you'll know it's done because it'll be just starting to flake on top and it should spring back when you touch it really lightly in the middle let that one cool in the tin for at least 15 minutes if you want to flip it out to make a big brownie like my Rainbow love heart brownie just pop a cooling rack on the front and then flip it all together if you want to serve this as individual brownies I recommend leaving it in the tray this is your basic brownie recipe and it's delicious but you didn't think I was going to leave you hanging with an old brown brownie we can add something to the top you guys can turn this into pretty much whatever you like I'm opting for the easiest brownie decoration option I can possibly think of unless you have a nut allergy Nutella mm-hmm and sprinkles if you don't like Nutella or if you're allergic you can also make a very simple chocolate ganache by just adding one part cream and three parts chocolate put them in the microwave and stir them together and then you can either pour it straight over or you can let it get a little thicker and you can spread it like this there is something so therapeutic about spreading chocolate on chocolate I'm going to have so many friends when I finish this round I have any advice for you here I would leave the very very edge of the brownie with no Nutella on it because what's better than the crispy crunchy edge of the brownie and I don't think it need anything to make it just perfect as it is now we sprinkle I know this is complicated oh so many friends I didn't even plan this decoration I just came up with it just now on the fly I'm gonna add hops so we roll here at market pick addiction we're done the greatest brownie recipe ever known to man you should definitely share this recipe if you know anybody that likes to eat because this has got to be for them I've used this in my rainbow low-fat brownie I've also used in my glowing pumpkin patch brownies we get creative this is your brownie recipe now when you want to serve this one just slice it I like to just slice it in the tray I was supposed to wait for the kids to get home but that's like three hours away and that's just not going to happen so I like to just take it off settles up things slide in underneath and it should separate away from your parchment really easily and we have the most delightful dense fudgy but still kind of light fluffy brownie ever this one's for you guys god I wish you could taste on camera I hope you guys enjoyed today's video if you're not already subscribed to the channel make sure you do for new videos every week and as always thanks very much for watching [Music] you

hey guys it's Alisa welcome back to my cupcake addiction if you follow my channel you know that I am a sucker for food in disguise so sweets disguised as savory or desserts disguised as things that they're actually not it's kind of fun and today I'm going to show you guys how to make tiny edible ramen bowls I love ramen but ramen made out of chocolate and jello and candy I think I love even more let's get started the things are you going to need for your ramen bowls I've got some white chocolate or white candy melts and then just a couple of either dark or milk ones we're just going to use that to color up our white chocolate a little bit I've got some jelly or jello crystals I'm going with a mango but try and choose something that's kind of yellow so a lemon a passion fruit something that resembles that kind of yellowish ramen broth I've also got some pink Fruit Chews some little caramels I used a packet of Haribo star Mix candies which incorporated literally almost everything I needed for these they've got these tiny little gummy fried eggs which are adorable I'm also using some green gummy bears and they've got these little candy rings so I'm using those in pink and then also in yellow or like a whitey color if you don't have access to those the little fried eggs are going to be your hardest thing to replicate so you can make those using just a dollop of white chocolate and a yellow M&amp;M stuck on top I'm also using some Pocky today and I went with pink because why not I've got to use a circle mold today so it doesn't have to be these plastic ones but if you can find them they give you a really nice shiny ramen bowl a little bit of boiling water to make up my jello some snaps your bags a pair of scissors and a spoon let's get into it the first thing that you want to do is make up your jelly or your jello now my packet tells me that I need to add 200 mils of boiling water and then another 200 mils of cold water but I'm only gonna add the boiling water because I want this to be slightly firmer than your regular cup of jelly you want to stir that around into your jelly crystals have completely dissolved and then set it onto the side of the bench to cool you can add a couple of Ice Cube's if you want to cool it quicker but this needs to be not set but not hot for it to be able to go into our little chocolate bowls so we need to call that one sprinkled a little bit I decided to put it into a snap seal bag which is gonna make it easier to get into my bowls in a neat way but it's also gonna help it to cool a bit quicker so that's going off into the fridge for about 15 minutes till my bowls are done I've melted my white chocolate to a really nice consistency and if you're having any issues with melting chocolate or getting it to a great consistency you can check out my chocolate melting techniques video I'll leave a link down below and then I'm going to use just the larger of my little bowl molds and I'm going to put in a decent tablespoon of my white chocolate and then I'm just going to use the spoon to kind of just run it up the edges you want it to get all the way to the top and then you can actually tip out a little bit of that excess carefully as they're both going to want to go at about the same time and then pop that one off into the fridge to set the reason I'm tipping out the excess is just because I don't want it to be too crazy thick down the bottom this is all about the jello and the candy you can see as I just swirl that around a little bit it actually just helps to distribute that chocolate just a little bit better around those edges making sure that my top sides are nice and thick well do another coat on those bowls once that first little coat set but we can start making all the decorations for our ramen now so I'm going to take my little pink Fruit Chews and you can microwave these for about 10 seconds just to make them a bit more pliable if they're a little bit firm to work with each of these is going to make a shrimp or a prawn so you just want to stretch it out kind of like working with fondant but sweeter and more delicious and I like to leave one end kind of just square because it's going to go down into the jello and then pull the other one out into a bit of a tip something like this and then with your little tip end you can take a pair of scissors and just snip that makes our little broad tail so cute then you just want to take a knife or something sharp and I'm just going to make little lines all up my prawn tail all right there's my little makeshift craw and you can kind of get curled around a little bit and sit off to the side now your little ring candies I thought these ones here were great they look like little rings of onion so there's a few different shades and a few different colors and all you need to do to make them look like little onion rings it's just snip off the little Center square ring bit and that's kind of eating candy so you're in luck and then use the sticky ends to join them together perfect there's our little tiny onion rings for my little gummy bears I'm going to use those to look like they're shallots or the spring onions that go on top so I kind of just trimmed off these little pores at the front sorry mr. gummy bear and then really just cut along the great thing with the gummi bears is that they're kind of a little transparent inside so what you get is these lovely little sort of circular almost translucent pieces of what looks kind of like spring onion or shalat and it tastes like gummy bear so win-win I thought these little pink rings and this could also work with pink gummy bears look like pickled ginger so I'm just going to cut some little sort of long strips and again they're a little translucent so as you cut them off they kind of look a little bit like pickled gingers super cute and of course my little Haribo eggs these guys super simple they're already done for you or like I said you can make your own using a little white chocolate and a yellow M&amp;M finally I'm going to use my caramels these are jersey caramels but like a Kraft caramel would work fine and I'm just going to cut off one side because I've got this white bit in the middle of mine and I don't want to see that and then you just want to take it and you're just going to stretch it out so it's kind of like that long tofu like shape and when you cut this with scissors it actually kind of gets that effect of being tofu so I'm going to cut two pieces of tofu out of each half caramel that is essentially all of the little bits and pieces that will go into my ramen bowl as well as two of my little pink Pocky sticks so we've got all that ready and then we can check in our bowls and do our second coat the first thin little coat of your Bowl should be nice and set so in goes another tablespoon of that white and again we're just going to scoop it up all the way around those side edges because we really want to make sure that the edges the top edges of our bowls are not too thin or they'll crack so you just want to take a knife now and just run around the top edge because that's going to give you a really nice smooth neat edge for your ramen bowl and it's not going to look like it's chipped or cracked back off into the fridge and then they'll be ready to start filling with all of our delicious ramen mix the most important part of any ramen is of course the noodle so I'm going to take my remaining melted white chocolate and I'm just going to add a tiny bit of melted Brown just add this too I so I only melted like three or four of those little brown candy melts and then I'm just going to stir it through just a little at a time to give me a really nice light pale Brown you're looking for that really really sort of like a pale creamy type color set that off to the side we may need to remark wave it before we put it in because now it's time to get our Bowl and fill them with jello so my bowls have come out of the fridge and they should nice and set I'm just going to slide them out and you can see by using that plastic mode how shiny they are two little bowls because we don't want them rocking around you want to grab your two little individual melts and we're just going to put a tiny little dollop of this chocolate onto each melt and stick them together kind of like a bit of a delicious glue get down at eye level with your ramen bowls so you can make sure that they're not lopsided and just support them for just a second until they're a little bit tacky and they can hold their own weight they shouldn't take very long at all to set because your chocolate that's going on top is already cold so now I'm going to take my jelly and it's in its little ziplock bag and that's cool to touch but it's not cold enough to be set because it's in a ziplock bag it's going to be really nice and easy for me to pour into my little ramen bowls snipping off a little tip at the end for easy dispensing and then I just want to fill - less than halfway up or just on halfway up of my ramen bolts these guys need to go off into the fridge for about 15 minutes just to semi set and then we could do our noodling and all of our decorations my little jello bowls are set enough that it be completely firm but so long as that top layer of kind of skin is set that's perfect I'm going to take my light brown melt I'm going to put them into just a snap tool bag and I haven't even remelted mine I've just let them sit on the bed so what I've got is a slightly thicker melted chocolate there you kind of want it to be slightly thicker because we want to make noodles out of this so if it's too thin they're all going to blend together we're ready to assemble so I'm going to cut a teeny tiny little tip a noodle size tip off the end of my snap your bag and then this is where you can have a bit of fun think about finger painting as a kid or just going crazy with a paintbrush I'm literally just gonna swirl and squirrel on top let it come up over the sides a little bit and essentially cover that first layer of jelly just with noodles chocolate noodles now while those noodles are still set I'm going to pop in one of my shrimp and that way this little section of shrimp will actually stick into that noodle glue and then I'm going to break off my Pocky so by pacquiao only want to see just these top little biscuit pieces poking out the top of the bowl I don't want to see any of that pink so I'm just going to break it off leftovers again about there and then I'll see how much I need to snap off to make sure that I can't see them over the top straight down you into the jello and then if you've got any of this pink that you can still see just cover it up with a little noodle a little more noodle just to make sure everything's in place that noodle is actually going to set pretty quickly because we've got the cold jello going on underneath once my noodles set I'm going to get my snap seal bag of jello again and I'm just going to gently just float some more of that jello on top not filling all the way you need a little bit of space because as you add in your different candies you don't want to overflow the bowl now we can add our final decorations so the tofu I'm going to put over here next to my chopsticks and you can just rest them in because as this top layer of jelly sets it's actually going to hold everything in place my egg a couple of little onion rings and then last but not least I'm going to do my pickled ginger and I'm gonna try and do that on the opposite side to my little pink shrimp just to balance out the color a little bit and my shallots I'm ready for my ramen dinner or my ramen dessert I think that might be a first or ramen dessert if you guys are not already subscribed to the channel make sure you do for more videos like these adorably gorgeous teeny tiny candy ramen bowls if you've got

hey guys it's Alisa welcome back to my cupcake addiction today we're going to be making popsicle pinata cookie pops so there's a hidden surprise inside hence the pinata they're popsicles they're made out of cookie dough and they're on a pop stick there's a whole lot going on here the things that you're going to need to make your popsicle pinata cookies I've got some of my delicious vanilla sugar cookie dough now this is actually only a half bat and it's quite firm it's just come out of the fridge but I always refrigerate my cookie dough in-house I've got some sprinkles I've also got some melted dark chocolate or candy melts I have two circle cutters this one here is about three and a half inches and the other one I think is about three quarters of an inch some popsicle sticks I've got a paintbrush and a snap seal bag and I've also got just a couple of colorings I'm gonna show you a unique way to color your popsicles after we've baked them a little flour for rolling out my cookie dough a baking tray and knife and a rolling pin let's get started so the first thing you want to do is roll out your cookie dough you need a generous amount of your plain flour down and I'm gonna roll these quite thin because sorry cookies mix up one single pinata pop so we want to make sure that they're kind of in proportion with what a real popsicle would look like you'll notice they keep on picking up my cookie dough and moving it around just to make sure I get a really nice even roll and to stop it from sticking to the bench in any one particular spot all right so that's about I think I've gone it's not super thin but it's certainly not a big thick cookie so if each I'm going to need three circles cut out so six circles is going to get me two finished pops we're gonna trim some of the sides off so don't worry if you're ever so slightly over some of your little edges so long as your tops are nice and round perfect now for each of these I've got these little sides here that I definitely want to trim but I'm gonna stack these three on top of each other because I want each of these to be exactly the same as their little partners or their little pairs so three go on top and then another three go on top and if I've got to need that need a little edge trimmed off that's gonna go on the very top so that I can make sure that I get it all using a knife I'm gonna trim off side the other side and then the bottom go a little wider than you think first just in case you cut off a little too much we can always take it a little skinnier but it's hard to add more on something like that is perfect and try and keep your little sets together here because we've really gone to trouble to cut them so that they're all perfectly sized and rounding off our little edges so they're more popsicle like now bring over your beef entree and your main pieces of popsicle come both go right on top of each other and then your center pieces kind of leave a little space because we're gonna put a pop stick in them take two pop sticks now and don't try to stick them into the cookie we can have fixed these a little bit better with some chocolate at the end we really just want to make the nice indentation for it so that it doesn't add an extra bulk to our cooked cookies as you push that down you may notice your cookie spreads ever so slightly just where the popsicle stick kind of like widens it out by pushing some of that dough out so I'm just gonna trim the tiniest bit off each side now I waited to true my little center hole out and till they're all on the tray because I don't want anything stretching out of shape and once you do trim the little center hole out what you end up with is kind of a bit of a flimsy mess to move around so you need is my circle cutter because it's the easiest way not to have any drag and just cut a series of little circles only in the very top half of my popsicle perfect now I've worked pretty quickly so my door is still quite cool to touch I'm gonna pop those straight in the oven but if your dough is not cool anymore you need to put it in the fridge for about five or ten minutes before so that it goes into the oven nice and chilled those guys are gonna bake for about seven to ten minutes and keep an eye on the center ones because they'll start to brown around the edges just a little bit earlier but you'll know they're done when they're all starting to just slightly color around the edges once those ones are cooked you just want to take them out you can leave them on the tray for a few minutes till they're touchable and then transfer them onto a wire cooling rack until they're completely cool once your cookies are cool now you have a couple of options here you can leave them all-natural and they can stay in their lovely light cookie color but I wanted to color mine separate colors without having to go and die individual portions of cookie dough so I tested and it worked actually painting it I've got a little bit of food coloring in two tablespoons of water and I'm just gonna put a drop of food coloring into each of my little bowls and stir it through I'm literally gonna paint these cookies with the food colorings right on the cookie I think this is a really cool kind of a cheat to save you hours of coloring and dyed ends so I've got my pack will make and I'm gonna paint directly on that cookie and it'll go a little damp for a few minutes but it'll dry right out again alright so maybe Nisha was not the right word to describe that but certainly less labor-intensive so I've got some of my chocolate now in a snaps your bag or candy melts you either need a compound chocolate or a candy melt something that's gonna set at room temperature so I'm gonna snip up a very very small tip cuz I only want to join these together with a really small amount of chocolate so I'm going to flip one of my little back sections for each of my colors I'm gonna paint a very fine line just about a mil or two in from the edge and then I'm goes my middle joining piece now you notice one of my sticks didn't stick and the other one has regardless of whether it sticks or not I'm still gonna add just a little bit of chocolate in there just to sort of join it all together because they have a tendency to come a bit loose and this guy here I'm just gonna fix back on with a little more chocolate no one's gonna be disappointed with unexpected chocolate in the middle of their cookie I'm gonna fill my little pinata holes with sprinkles and then another fine line around that outside edge and it on go the tops our two little popsicles once you happy a little popsicle set I'm just gonna dip the very very top section into my melted chocolate but I've also got my snap steal bag at the ready because I want to make this look like a dripping popsicle but with a really neat orchestrated drip so in goes my top to give it a nice coating right across those three layers bring it down give it a couple of taps just to even it out and then I'm actually gonna take my snap sealed bag and I'm just going to draw kind of a cartoon-esque drip and fill it in don't forget the sides once you've got your little orchestrated drips I'm just gonna tap my wrist and then we're gonna give them a sprinkle cuz all good popsicles come with sprinkles look at our little perfect popsicle pinata and only we know that there's a hidden surprise inside just waiting to bite into I would suggest serving those with a bowl of ice cream so your guests get cookies and ice cream and they can sprinkle their own ice cream with the sprinkles from inside their little surprise cookie pops I hope you guys have enjoyed today's if you want to see Tom's more really cool ideas fit things that have surprises inside I'll leave a link to my cigars inside playlist down below thanks very much for watching 
I'm going to choose the white rabbit that's perfect because you're always late [Music] [Music] welcome back to my cupcake addiction I'm Elise strong and today I'm taking you guys down the rabbit hole and we are going to be up against the clock for a very important date we are cake popping Alice in Wonderland [Music] pops you're going to need cake I chose chocolate also some ganache you'll need red candy melts white candy melts some decorative straws some cake pop sticks some toothpicks candy colors these are either oil-based or powder based colors that we can use for coloring chocolate luster dust some paintbrushes a little vodka or you can use pure lemon extract here an edible pen snaps your bags parchment paper scissors black candy melts white fondant a couple of cookie cutters and a little tape you'll also need some pictures of your different Alice characters and you guys can choose if you want to make all of these if you just want to make a few I'll leave a link to that template down below first up you'll want to crumble all of your cake just by hand into a bowl I'm using my chocolate cake pop recipe I will leave that one down below and I've got a bunch of different cake pop recipe options in the my cupcake addiction cookbook sweet celebrations which I'll link to down below add in your ganache and then stir and stir until it comes together in a really nice chocolaty cake pop door you do need to get pretty hands on as you get to the final stages of mixing and really once you're done your cake pop dough should resemble almost like a cookie dough let's start rolling our shapes I'm going to do two just straight out balls they're going to be for our Cheshire Cat so just to stand it about an inch round ball Alice is going to be a slightly different shape I'm going to take my regular cake pop ball and then I'm going to smoosh it and just kind of shape it so it's a bit of a teardrop but with a slightly flattened waist this is going to be a waist and that's the bottom of our skirts the white rabbit is not going to be a ball so I'm taking quite a bit of my cake pop dough and I'm just going to kind of compact it and then fallout it out and cut out my circles which is going to give me a nice but with a super nice flat edge perfect for a clock so starting with a ball again I'm going to kind of flatten it down I want like a round base and then just using my fingers I'm just going to shape like the top of a teacup so kind of flattening out the top of keeping that nice round bottom to make a cute little teacup sheet for Tweedledum and Tweedledee and tweedledumber depending on what you think of them again I'm going to do the little round cake pop ball but I mean I sort of take this one out to a bit of an oval and flatten it and what I want to make here is almost like the bottom half of a very round person - any feet so I'm making like a like a half circle that's flat on top then finally for my Queen of Hearts I'm gonna do a very similar shape to that rounded bottom of Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee then I'm going to come in with a knife and just cut like a little V so that I can give her like it's kind of gonna make the bloomers that she wears underneath her little skirts or dresses something like this all of my little Wonderland shapes a roll but I want to put those into the fridge for at least 20 minutes before I try to dip them or put them on stick once you're happy that your little pops are sufficiently chilled they should feel cool but still slightly be able to press out of shape it's time to put in all of our lollipop sticks so i've pre-colored my candy melts the red ones were already red and the white one's already white then I added a little green candy color a little blue candy color a little pink candy color and a little bit of purple only a really little bit of purple because he's just for decoration I'm going to take my various colors of candy now and I'm going to dip my little pops starting with my little clocks which are going to be using my white so I just dip in about 1/2 to 3/4 of an inch into my white candy melt and then place it straight into the top and with these guys I'm going to keep them laying flat because I want to retain all the shapes that we work so hard to achieve blue for my little Alice's pink for my Cheshire Cat this one's actually the one that I think is the cutest my little teacups gonna be green but because Mad Hatter is completely and utterly bonkers it's also going to be upside down and then read on the bottoms of may Tweedledee and Tweedledum and of my Queen of Hearts into the flat tops of the round bottoms one thing to play careful attention to on all of these is to make sure that your cake pop sticks are as straight as possible just so that they're not leaning when we finish off because we're laying these down and not standing them up it can be kind of hard to tell perfect off into the fridge just for five minutes so that we can chill all of those seals and then they're ready to death it's time to dip I've also got some little decorative straws and in my opinion these add a ton to your finished product so I'm going to start with my little clocks or stopwatches and while I'm laying them all down to let them set like that when I actually go to dip them I'm going to stand them up so they're all straight dipping into my white with my little clock making sure that I cover that seal getting rid of any excess and then I'm going to place it down so it sort of forms a little foot underneath onto my parchment paper well that one's still wet I'm just going to dip the tiniest little bit of the end of my straw in that candy melt and I'm going to drop it down over the cake pop stick and it's going to stick into that freshly dipped little pop next we're going to dip Alice so we take our little blue ones making these seals colour-coded actually really kind of helps remember which shape goes with which character she's going to be my little blue and dark blue stripes draw my little Cheshire cats will be pink green for my little teacups and then my little red buts Red's always for some reason a bit thicker than all the other ones so notice I like to give it either a little tap on the bench or a good stir before I start my dipping dipping the first of my butt's I decide to do Tweedledum and Tweedledee different colors because then at least I'll be able to tell them apart then the Queen's bloomers there's a first as you set the Queen's bloomers you'll actually be making like a little set of kind of like little feet for the bloomers that really make it look like it is a pair of bloomers all of my pops are dipped so I've put a little bit of my green as well as my purple and then a little pink in two snaps your bags so that I can pipe a few of our details with the green you're going to pipe some little handles for our teacups so I'm just going to snip off a very small little corner I'm just going to pipe a few kind of like curly questionmark shapes pipe a few of these because some are going to fit different cups a little bit better and if any of them break you've got spares and then I'm going to do the same with my pink and we're going to pipe like some very thin knitting needles that are going to go into the ball of twine that our Cheshire cats playing with it's not really from the movie but cats and twine just kind of work together so I'm going to take my cake pop and over my little piece of parchment here I'm basically going to go back and forth really really quickly streaking in all different directions to make my cake pot look like it's a ball of twine if you guys have a choice as to which cake pop you're actually going to choose take this one it's got like three times as much chocolate on it something like that we're starting to finish off some of these guys so I'm going to start by painting some details on my Queen's bloomers with an edible marker I'm just going to paint some little black hearts I like that I think it adds a little bit of comedic value and then cut around your little template and we will stick the top half of the Queen onto her bloomers and Queenie's done for tweedledum and tweedledee we're going to take one black candy melt literally just one and slice through it and then slice through it again we're gonna make little feet for our Tweedledum and Tweedledee I'm just gonna dip each foot into a tiny bit of candy melt just the edge and slide it up against our little characters feet and then sticking on my little templates with a little bit of tape Tweedledum and tweedledumber I mean 20 what are you done what is this is this the you're done you finish with that what about moron Tweedledum I'm not gonna stand up with no legs is he okay now it's just like new yeah he's all better like a ball of twine sentencer have our little knitting needles so I'm gonna use just a teeny tiny bit of my pink and stick my knitting needles into my bowl of twine and then my chair shake out on top just using a little bit of tape there little Cheshire Cat oh those guys are gonna be some of your easiest ones and now we need a little bit of fondant to work on our others so I'm just gonna roll my phone and out the first thing a minute cut is a nice circle and then I'm just gonna use my knife to take like a couple of little chips out of the sides of the saucer and then I'm going to use the back of my smaller circle cutter and that's just gonna be pushed in to kind of make the indent of where the teacup is held in this also you take a little Bowl or something and just set that little sauce up upside down and ideally you'd leave this for like 12 hours to 24 hours and it would sit quite firm with that really nice little raised saucer edge on it if you don't have time to sleep in flat and still be fine next up we're gonna roll out Alice's skirt she basically just gets one piece of fondant and kind of like a bit of a triangle shape to make it a little skirt because Disney Princesses or Disney characters have impossibly small waists I've got my little template handy so that I'm kind of getting it about the same size it's still miles too big eat something Alice God have a bit of cake I mean use a little water on the back of the skirt just to attach it I want to trim that just below a little bottom line of our skirt and then we can pop Alice straight on top using a little bit of tape judging by the size of our waist a very little bit of tape ah her legs Jake about her legs evil leg eating baby oh it can't be finished for though you can't just eat everybody legs and then be finished literally just eating the legs okay she won't stand up oh poor Alice she'll never walk like she did before our final fondant roll for this guy I'm gonna create like a long white strip of fondant which is going to make the nice rigid edge that will actually get a paint gold for the outside of our clock a little bit more water on the back of our white fondant I like to cut like a little angle of each of the ends so that I can curl it around when I get to the top place my pop in the middle and perfect so there's my little round clock with its little edging I'm gonna add some little black edible marker numbers and then a tiny bit of that red candy melt for the hands finally I take a little bit of luster dust and mix it with that tiny bit of vodka and then paint the outside and edible gold I'm gonna let that one dry before I do anything else or add my little rabbit but that's essentially finished and then finally we can just finish off a little mad had a teacup so I've got my teacup I've got a little bit of the melted candy melt and I'm choosing one of my handles that I think is the cutest and then I'm just going to apply the hand we're using a tiny bit of the candy melt and then stick on my mad Heather and then on to his little pre-prepared saucer if you want to add a bit of candy melt so that it sticks feel free her little water which in you a very merry unbirthday is our Mad Hatter finally we can stick our white rabbit on top of our little stopwatch and that completes our little set of Alice in Wonderland cake pops we've cake popped one of my all-time favorite childhood movies despite the fact that I'm not really fond of the Cheshire Cat and I think the bunny's obnoxious this is still one of the coolest movies that I ever saw growing up and it stalls a very special place in my heart the very last thing that I want to do is just trim off the straws because all of your stores may or may not be a different heights different sizes depending on what brands layer we're done we have literally cake popped Alice Wonderland and all of the friends and foes that she makes along the way I hope you guys enjoyed

you do the two new videos every week we are almost at three million followers so no Teresa hit that button and help me get this have an awesome day guys and as always keep its way [Music] no no the sampler [Music] 
whoa I did not know that was gonna be shy [Music] welcome back to my cupcake addiction I don't normally go this far into character but today we are paying tribute to all things Willy Wonka the great gene Wilder passed away and I thought it only fitting to do a serious tribute where I went a little above and beyond in the costume department to all things Willy Wonka it was one of my absolute favorite childhood movies and I think it may have shaped my love of candy today I'm going to show you guys how to make an or inspiring over-the-top illusion effect double-sided rainbow surprise inside Willy Wonka cake brace yourselves it's about to get very sweet in here all right I'm back to normal things are you gonna need to make your Wonka cake you'll need some buttercream some ganache a serrated knife an offset spatula I've got fondant in white light purple brown and dark purple a rolling pin a pizza cutter a ruler some simple syrup powdered sugar dark candy melts a sharp knife a thin lightweight candy bar some fun lollipops a little parchment paper and hope use amounts of candy there's a few templates in this videos I will leave links to them all down below and I've also got my cake boards I'll leave all the dimensions again down below instead of dowel for the center of my cake I'm using fat straws or milkshake straws so much easier to cut and of course you're going to need cake I colored vanilla cake in nine different shades of the rainbow but feel free to get creative here I baked in 8-inch round tins and each of my layers is about 1 inch high probably a little taller that I need but I've got a really creative way to use up all those leftovers so make sure you subscribe to the channel if you want to check out pretty unique way to use cake scraps first up we want to carve our cakes and I always find chilling them for about an hour in the fridge or even the freezer before I carve makes them a lot easier to deal with you want to level off the top of the cake and then turn it over and using a serrated edge knife just gently trim away any of the browned bottom section again with a serrated knife just come around the outside edge take off as little as you possibly need to but as much as you have to to get rid of any of those Brown edges you want to repeat that with all 9 of your cake layers then we're going to brush them with simple syrup this is one part water one part sugar and you want to heat it either on the stove or in the microwave until that sugar is completely dissolved and I just brush mine on using a pastry brush paying special attention to the outside edges so my cake doesn't dry out next it's time to take our white buttercream frosting and add a very thin crumb coat to catch any of those pesky colored crumbs all right it's time to stack we're actually stacking this cake upside down so I'm going to take my 10 inch round cake board and I'm going to start at the bottom with the color that I want to be the top of my cake which is red place that down don't stick it to the board with anything and then apply a little bit more buttercream spreading it out being sure not to get any of those colored crumbs through and then on goes the next color orange and then more orange I took a couple of smaller cardboard cake boards and just wrapped them in some foil I've got one that's six inches and then one that's four I'm going to apply the cake board frost it in and then go with my next three colors of cake frosting with buttercream in between because I'm doing nine layers here in between each three layers I'm going to support my cake using four fat straws place them straight down into the cake and then lift them slightly snip them off so they're all the same length and pop them back down that will just help bear the weight and then on go my final three colors again with four more straws for extra support and then pop that one off into the fridge for at least an hour if you can do longer do longer because it's going to make carving it so much easier no you don't get to have a snooze there's still plenty to be done while the cakes chilling out so instead of using a cake board for underneath this cake we're going to use a regular dinner plate it's got the raised edges which means it's actually going to give us that really cute little kind of curled up broom of the Hat take a dark purple fondant sprinkle down some powdered sugar and roll it out nice and thin here I just used a napkin dipped in water just to wet the plate or you can brush it with that simple syrup it's just going to give your fondant something to stick to and then lay the fondant carefully over the plate be very careful not to disturb the edge of the plate because that's going to be the brim of your hat and it's going to look kind of weird if this finger marks in it smooth the fondant down and market over the edges and so that we can neaten up behind the plate because you want this to curl down underneath I just rested a bowl in the very center and then flipped my plate over this helps to protect those edges and no one's going to see the mark the bowl leaves in the fondant because it's going to be cake on top of it I chose to display my whole cake on quite a large cake board because it really allows me to increase the size of the cake and it gives me more decorating space sprinkle down some more of your powdered sugar roll out that green fondant as thin as you like brush the board with some water or simple syrup and then just lay the fondant over trim around the edges to make it nice and neat and you've got yourself I'm going to call it Willy Wonka's candy garden or the base for it taking your white fondant now we're going to make our W so I've just cut around my Wonka template using a sharp knife and then I'm going to sprinkle down a little bit of that powdered sugar roll my white fondant out nice and thin and using my exacto or super sharp Stanley knife I'm going to cut right around that template once your cakes nice and firm in that buttercream step use a serrated edge knife to carve around you want to create like a tapered top coming down to a wider base so I just grabbed a little dish or a small bowl and use that as a bit of a guide so I got a nice round top and it's about an inch inch and a half smaller than the circumference of my top cake something like this once you help you with your shape you want to take some of your chocolate ganache now and if it's set super firm feel free to give it a microwave for 15 seconds at a time and stir it vigorously so it's nice and soft and doesn't pull it that cake it's a pretty tall cake I chose chocolate ganache because this is ode to Willy Wonka and it feels like it would be completely wrong to do any other flavor with your thicker coat of ganache in place I'm using a long metal ruler or you could also use a cake scraper here but I feel like rulers are something that we all have using your ruler really shape that ganache so that your cake kind of looks like a cone but without the point on it make sure that you get down at eye level and spin your cake around so that it is nice and neat and even on all sides as possible once you're happy with the shape I like to take a long jug of boiling hot water and I rest my ruler in there be careful these get kind of hot but they're super long so in my opinion it's a good trade-off I like to use a little bit of paper towels I don't burn my fingers and then you'll see as I smooth I'm literally just shaving off the very very top layer of chocolate but I'm revealing a perfectly beautifully smooth layer of firm chocolate ganache underneath once you're happy with the shape pop that off into the fridge for 30 minutes I wouldn't go any longer it'll make your fondant sweat but thirty minutes will be a nice amount of time to set up that ganache and make it easier to put fondant on so I made you guys these little Wonka bar templates which I will leave a link to down below but I like to take mine off my candy bar until I'm sure that I'm not gonna leave any fingerprints on so that's not going to go back on until last minute I covered my candy bars in a little bit of silver foil and then because I kind of wanted a super gold golden ticket and I couldn't get that on a home printer I just got some gold foil paper and kind of cut it you're really only going to see the tip of it poking out underneath that Wonka bar I applied it with a little bit of tape but I'm going to flip that back now so that I can make the illusion part lay your Walkabout on your piece of parchment just slightly on an angle and then I put my dark candy melts into a snap seal bag and just snipped off kind of a generous tip I'm going to trace the outline of what looks a little bit like a chocolate waterfall to make a chocolate waterfall just do this - I I kind of made these nice big blobby sides but I left the bottom of it quite straight because that's going to go into my cake make this pretty thick it's got to hold up under its own weight and as you're filling in the outline really go crazy I'm making like big swirls and drip kind of looking textures because we really want this to resemble an actual waterfall set that one at room temperature rather than in the fridge because the fridge will cause the chocolate to contract and you'll end up with a wonky lean on your Wonka waterfall once it's set you can flip your waterfall over on that piece of parchment the waterfall side is fine just as it is but the back it's kind of boring and you're going to have these little air pockets in it so I took copious amounts of Wonka inspired candy and the brightest colors I can find and I'm just going to dab a little tiny bit of that dark candy melt on the back of each and use them to cover up any blemishes in much chocolate and B create an absolutely dazzling Kennedy effect for the other side of my illusion so no matter which way you look at this cake it's going to be absolutely adorable with your illusion done our boards covered our cake chilled it's time to cover don't freak out here we've done it upside-down so it's going to be a much easier shape than you think to cover sprinkle down a generous amount of powdered sugar or cornstarch and roll that fondant out don't go too crazy thin here oh you'll see any lumps and bumps underneath if you want to measure the circumference at the bottom of your cake it's a good idea even if you just use a piece of string to make sure that your piece is long enough there is nothing worse than having a too short piece of fondant once it's already on the cake trim at the very bottom edge and the two sides as best as you can so at least they're neat and then wrap the fondant around a long rolling pin once your cake is shining with sugar syrup you want to take your rolling pin and lift it up onto the side of your cake carefully but quickly and this can be a little bit of an awkward maneuver so feel free to ask someone for help wrap it around the outside of the cake as soon as you've got the fondant on just run your hands up and down the outside edges to smooth it off and I'm just going to take a sharp knife and slice all the way down cutting those two layers at the one time you can pull away any excess here and they should join up quite nicely once you've joined it up you can trim off any excess on both the top and bottom and then I'm going to use just a cake smoother here just to really smooth out and push any air bubbles out of the way so my coat of fondant is super nice and really beautiful and smooth put a little bit of ganache on the top of your cake which is actually about to become the bottom of your cake and just make sure it's super thin and not too close to the outside edges so it doesn't sphere take your covered plate and flip it upside down again be really mindful of finger prints here and gently place it straight down in the center or the top bottom of your cake because I know I don't want to handle my plate very much at all I'm also going to apply a generous amount of ganache to the bottom of the plate and then I'm going to place my green covered final presentation board on top kind of making this weird upside down stack and this is going to be heavy but we are going to flip together three two one so we flipped and nothing terrible happened you want to take a sharp knife now and you're going to just slide it to remove the suction that's been caused by the fondant and ganache around that red layer of cake once you're happy that you've released the board simply pull it off now for the top section of our cake I'm gonna roll quite a thick piece of fondant here again with the powdered sugar I'm going to clear off my bench and then flip it so that I don't have any cornflour on the side that's going to be the top but I'm going to use this plate to kind of be my template and I know it's going to dig into the fondant so I want it on the bottom side I need to use a pizza cutter just to cut very neatly and it's straight up and down as I possibly can ever so slightly larger than my place because I know my plates a tiny bit smaller than the top of my cake a little thin layer of ganache and keep it as thin and as flat as possible on top of that red layer again do not go too close to the outside edges of your cake or you're going to end up with like ganache peeking through between your two purple layers and we definitely don't want that pick up your circular disk and treat it carefully you don't wanna stretch it out of shape place it on top and then just run your hands around the outside edge to make sure that it's as nice smooth and flush with the top line of the cake as possible you can use a cake smoother at any time here to really smooth down that fondant get rid of any air bubbles and make that top piece really become one with the rest of the Hat in my opinion this is always the best part all the hard stressful work is done apart for applying the illusion but now we're ready to do all of the fun decorations on our beautiful Wonka Hat cake it's not just gonna be a Wonka hat though this one's got Flair spring go down a bit of powdered sugar and roll out your light purple fondant really nice and thin and long thin and long we're gonna make the band make this piece a little bit thicker than you actually want the band to be because we're kind of gonna ripple it so that it looks like a fabric then I'm gonna take my ruler and I'm just gonna slice off so I've got really nice straight edges on both sides on a cutting board or my husband will kill me one thing to bear in mind of this cake and honestly it's something about it that I really love is that one side is going to be a beautiful nice purple Wonka hat and the other side is going to be almost entirely covered with a chocolate waterfall so if you have one side I mean I guarantee you'll have one side that you like slightly better than the rest not that we play favorites but my seam is going to go under that chocolate waterfall as is anywhere that I think is less than perfect on my cake and I'm going to try and put my best side forward I always do I'm just pinching my fondant and a couple of little ripples to give it a little bit of texture before I stick that on I want a position at my W like I said I cut mine out slightly in advance and because of that it's actually really nice and firm which is going to enable me to be able to kind of kick that little curl of the warm cut off a little bit and also makes it a bit easier to position also think about where you want to stick your W I had a tiny little bit of cracking in my fondant so my W is going to cover that there's no such thing as a mistake just a well covered piece of cake so a little bit of water on the back of my W completely stuck down is totally fine but you can see by letting my W set overnight I've actually ended up with the ability to kind of make it look like it's not actually stuck on the sides of the cake it's kind of three-dimensional a little bit taking a little bit more water here I'm going to press it around the bottom being careful not to drip it onto my plate at all just around this bottom edge and that's going to be used to stick on my band picking up my drape from the center at the back I'm just going to trim off being careful not to cut my plate fondant I kind of lied when we said all the stressful stuff is done this is the most stressful part because we're adding the illusion but don't freak out if it happens to break if anything goes wrong you are literally like five minutes away from making a new one Gide whole massive knife in Wonka purple I don't know how I managed that so I am going to try and find about the middle of my cake and I'm gonna come down ah this feels so wrong what this does is it really just paves the way for my illusion to go in so that my illusion doesn't have to have so much pressure on it I like to make sure that I've made it a little bit of space so my waterfall side is going to face back my fun candy side is going to face forward and I'm going to try to just kind of touch it on this side so I don't leave big finger prints and work quickly here so that I don't melt through slowly does it coax it in it already looks so cute we have more candy to add so for the back half and like I said this is my not-so-great half so I've got my big seam I've got one my little ribbon for my hat joint and I've got is there the good side of my Wonka bar illusion we're gonna now roll out some Brown fondant so I'm going to start with a shape that's kind of a little bit like a triangle or a bell because I know that I want fat at the bottom and thin at the top so I might as well start with that shape and I may save myself having to cut it as I roll my shape out I'm really coaxing the fondant where I want it to go so you can get your hands underneath and you can just kind of pull it and stretch it a little bit while it's still quite thick don't do that once it's thin and then just rolling with ways where I want it to get wider and lengths where I want to get longer once I've got the basic shape I'm gonna clean up any excess powdered sugar and that way I'm gonna get any on my nice dark colored fondant all right we want to add a little bit of texture so I'm just gonna use just the top end of my pizza cutter you can use anything just make sure it's kind of blunt and I'm just gonna create like a little drippy waterfall effects I'll go once at the narrow side and then I'll come back and go with the fat side kind of add some streaks and things that seen were all Gustus gloop falls into the chocolate waterfall you know I was sad for his parents that I couldn't help but thinking what an amazing way to go I mean if you got to go right I'm not gonna trim the sides I'm not gonna trim the base I'm sticking it on like that so working quickly I want to remove my cake from its turntable because I don't want it moving around for this I'm going to paint a little bit of water and then I'm going to attach my fondant I'm going to trim off just a nice straight top because that's where it's going to meet up with my actual water illusion and I want to make sure that it's no wider or narrower really than the top immediately secure your top and then also this side section and then you can kind of let it fall away again securing to the plate everywhere that you secure this fondant just takes the pressure off the layer above it so it doesn't rip there is nowhere for me to stand where I can actually see you guys behind this cake its massive and I kind of like that in a cake from here you can decorate however you like I've given you the blank canvas but of course I'll give you a couple of suggestions so I found some little oompa-loompas that I printed out on kind of a thicker cardstock and I'm just going to glue them together so if you need some craft glue but I'm also going to give them two little stilts just up in their feet so that I can make them stand up in something I also need to do a small standing area for umpah so I'm just get a roller straight out lump of fondant and then I'm just going to add some grassy like texture by just kind of snipping at it be careful not to snip your hands here I have done that it is quite painful simple easy little grassy knoll my fondants pretty sticky so I'm just going to stick it straight onto the board and my Oompa Loompas made out of paper and they're sure so he's not that heavy in goes my little Loompa I'm gonna call him Bob a simple lollipop on the other side to balance things out couple little candies but I don't want to go too crazy on this cuz I think there's so much going on with this cake that we really don't need to whichever way you look at this cake it's utterly adorable the Wonka side or you want to go to lumple and I love how much we have going on in this cake you've got your illusion you've got your rainbow you've got your Wonka you've got your own balloon pearl and there is everything Wonka even a golden ticket if you guys love this video make sure you subscribe for two new videos every week if you

hey guys it's Elise and welcome back to my cupcake addiction today we're going way back to my childhood and I'm going to show you how to take a regular Easter egg and turn it into a mr. Potato Head I grew up with mr. and mrs. Potato Head and all of their various outfits so I'm super excited to show you guys today how to make your own chocolate mr. Potato Head Easter eggs in store at the moment so it's the perfect time if you want to skip a couple of steps to stock up on your mr. Potato Head bodies but if you're watching this out of season check online because Easter Egg molds are available year-round and you can just make your own eggs for my candy today I've got a dark chocolate I'm using a limp ball dark chocolate truffle I've got jelly beans so I've got them in pink red and black some small solid Easter eggs which I keep eating I got a set of lips because I'm going to show you how to make a mrs. Potato Head as well because mr. Potato Head needs mrs. Potato Head I've got a few Oreo cookies or chocolate sandwich cookies I've got some white candy melts and some dark candy melts both of those melted a few toothpicks a small piece of parchment and a snap seal bag you also gonna need a really sharp knife we're not operating on mr. Potato Head he's going to be just fine let's get started now each of your potato heads are going to need two eyes and two arms and if you doing mr. Potato Head he also needs a little set of teeth mrs. Potato Head has lips so I'm just going to do a nice little round circle and I recommend doing a few of these so that you've got a few different ones to choose from and you can pick even eyes so for the arms I really just kind of fudged this but just make sure this part of the arms a little bit longer than you want it because you can always break it shorter but if you find they're too short you can't make it longer after the fact so I've started with a little upwards pointing arm a thumb and then for kind of just really short fingers or three I don't think it really matters so now that I've got my arms that go like that I'm going to do two that go like this so basically the same but opposite then for your mr. potato heads teeth you just want to paint like a really small kind of a Halfmoon shape or a semicircle and I just used toothpick to add a couple of little ridges to sort of look like teeth please don't have to be perfect and then finally I'm going to use an Oreo cookie for mr. potato Tapp but mrs. Potato Head doesn't have a white cookie so I'm gonna pipe just a little disk and I'm going to use a white limb fall to make the top of her hat but I'll pipe the disk first so about the same size as an Oreo I don't want her to miss out on sun protection and we can pop those off to the side I'm also going to cut in half the white lint ball and we can sit that just on top as that chocolate starts to set mrs. Potato Head has a hat mr. Potato Head is going to have his hat made by cutting out dark limp ball in half and I'm going to attach that one with a little bit of white chocolate so we have hats arms and eyes moving on to the feet so for mr. Potato Head I'm only going to use blue little Easter eggs for mrs. Potato Head I was going to do his shoes blue but I thought she needs to make a statement how's it going to be yellow so I'm gonna take my foil covered Easter eggs and I'm going to cut them length ways I'm cutting them with the foil on and as I get to the bottom I'm going to run the knife along so I get a nice deep cut now all I want to see is this little blue section at the front so I'm also going to take my knife and I'm just going to cut away anything else so that I've got chocolate at the back and none of the foil is actually touching any of my mr. Potato Head chocolate make a nice little line and remove this excess foil like the little tip of a little tap shoe keep those little guys foil covered take one unwrapped one and cut that in half as well because it's going to help to stabilize the back so that your potato people are not too back-heavy we're getting closer we're going to get our toothpicks ready now and I've got my melted either dark or milk chocolate and I am going to put a little blob on the back of each of the feet not touching that foil and then also on that extra little half of an Easter egg at the back there grab your eggs make sure that if there's any seams in the egg you're kind of having those on either side so they're not on the front of your mr. or mrs. Potato Head and then I'm going to pop it straight down on top you've got a couple of minutes to get around the front and make sure that you're happy put a little feet are in position nicely and that the egg is really nice and straight on there mr. Potato Head goes on next we're starting to build little potato people chocolate potato people all right well you've got your chocolate out we can just add some little eyeballs and details to the eyes because they should be starting to set leave these guys alone to set for five or so minutes and I wouldn't recommend setting them in the fridge because it can make your chocolate go a little bit funny when it goes in and out of the fridge too many times so I'm just going to put a couple of little dots of milk chocolate in for the eyeballs for mrs. potato heads eyes I'm just going to go kind of across the top a little bit just to give her more of like a hooded eye I'm going to slide a knife underneath and I'm just going to move those two eyes onto a clean piece of parchment just because I don't want to have any mess around the top of the eye to make it less circular before giving her a couple of eyeballs I also found some little pink sprinkles that I had that were shaped like flowers so I popped one of them just front-row Center on mrs. potato heads hat so for mr. potato heads mustache he's just got two black jelly beans and for his eyebrows he has one black jelly bean I'm going to cut that one in half he's also got his red nose and his two pink is you kind of almost see him starting to come together there a little bit mrs. Potato Head I'm gonna give a pink nose too cuz I don't want it to clash with her beautiful red lips she's gonna have her red lips here she's also going to have two pink ears and I'm gonna give her black eyebrows but I want these to be really thin that I need to be all Groucho Marx like mr. Potato Head so I'm going to cut the jelly bean in half take one half of it and just cut the very very top so I've kind of got just a really nice sort of a fine eyebrow let's stick them together I mean who's my melted milk chocolate rather than my white for everything that I'm sticking onto the eggs just because the eggs in milk chocolate and I don't want to see any white peeking out around the edges so we'll start with mr. Potato Head first his hat and on it goes and then I like to do his ears because that kind of gives me that central point in the head and then I know where to put the eyes and everything else you want a position he is just slightly higher than halfway up so in top third somewhere and then the eyes should be almost in line with the ears maybe just a little fraction taller with the eyebrows going on third above the eyes next goes his red nose and you may need to support some of these just for a minute or two just while that chocolate becomes tacky so that it slide down the egg now on go the teeth make sure that you're leaving enough room for his moustache above but you want to let those teeth completely set because they'll kind of little region they'll help support the weight of the mustache when it goes in place who's almost finished he just needs to be stashed so now you can add all of your themed accessories to mrs. Potato Head in the exact same way just using your melted chocolate to attach first the Hat then the ears the eyes the eyebrows the nose and those beautiful big red lips the last thing to do with your potato heads is to attach the arms this is probably the trickiest part because they're made out of chocolate your finger warmth can tend to melt them a little bit you want to just break off a very very small amounts you've kind of got like a flat side you want to put just a little bit of your melted white chocolate and don't go too crazy it because we wanted to set pretty quickly and these aren't that heavy and go just under the ear and just support it for about 10 to 20 seconds until it goes tacky really try to go too light on how much finger you've got you can see I'm only resting just the very very tip of my finger on there so I don't go risking melting his hand or melting his arm I kind of wish I'd had a small sugar hand bag to hang over mrs. Potato Head arm once that one can support its own weight you can let it go it will continue to dry though so make sure you just give them a few minutes before you start moving them around these are our potato heads in hindsight mrs. Potato has lips might be a little bit too big for her face I know she's good overstated lips but I think she's also had some serious work done mr. Potato Head is my favorite as far as I'm concerned he's the classic but you've got your two options for a mr. and mrs. Potato Head made out of some Easter eggs and some store-bought candy if you're not already subscribed to the channel make sure you do for two new videos every week there are literally hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of photo tears on there for all sorts of things that you can bake not bake make a create using cakes candies and dessert thanks very much for watching 
hey guys it's Elise and welcome back to a bonus episode of my cupcake addiction so I just finished making the red Lego brick smash pinata and I thought how is it with the speed of turn into a cake so I thought I'd whip up a bonus video and show you guys how to make a Lego cake to complement the Lego pinata so you've got one that you can smash and one that you can share to make your Lego cake you're going to need a loaf tin I'm gonna leave dimensions of mine down below but honestly so long as it's kind of a Lego brick like in shape and size it really doesn't matter or you could go all out and mix squares and different sizes I'm using a Nokia loaf tin and it is nonstick I'm going to do one batch of my classic vanilla cake it's up to you if you want to use your own recipe but I know the vanilla cake is the perfect size to do one good size loaf I've also got some mini Oreos a batch of my perfectly pipeable buttercream frosting that I've tinted yellow and some candy melts I will leave the entire recipe and method for my vanilla cake on the my cupcake addiction comm website I'll link to the post down below as well as the recipe for my buttercream and you'll need two bags of candy melts or you can tint your own white chocolate with candy colors or oil based food coloring you'll also need a mini muffin tin alright let's get into it so I've made up my vanilla cake mix and as mentioned the method the ingredients everything you need is in the description box below you want to take some cooking spray and spray the inside of your loaf tin really well and then take a rectangle of parchment paper and line just the base with parchment put all of that cake mix in you want this loaf tin filled to about 2/3 to 3/4 and then pop that off into a moderate oven so that's 175 Celsius or 350 Fahrenheit that's going to take about 45 minutes to bake and you'll know it's done when a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean and the top Springs back when you touch it once your loaves cooked let it sit on the bench for about 15 minutes so that it can kind of steam away from the edges and then just take a knife you should just be able to slide around those four edges and because we've used parchment on the bottom it'll pop right out alright it's time to make the buttons for our piece of Lego so you want your mini muffin tin and you're gonna take 1 TSP of Mel yellow candy and place it at the base of ten of your little cavities if you need to do this a couple at a time feel free so that your candy doesn't set then you replace one Oreo on top of the still melted teaspoon of chocolate in each hole once your Oreos are in place take some of the yellow candy bar pop it into a snap seal bag cut off a generous tip and then you're just going to squeeze that melted candy melt in down around the sides of the Oreos and just cover the top give them a good solid tap on the bench and you don't want those little muffin tins to be completely full about three-quarters is fine put those ones off into the fridge and they can stay in there until we're ready to pop them out all right now for the good bit the Lego you want to make sure that your loaf tin is completely clean and incredibly dry I'm talking completely clean because if there's any little crumbs on the inside of that they're going to show up on the outside of your Lego brick and it's not going to be as cute you can put the rest of your melted candy from the snaps your bag back into the main bowl and then you want to pour just over half of it into the loaf tin you can sort of tilt it so that it covers all sides or you can use a spatula to scrape it up around the sides for this first coat but make sure it's not too thick here tip out any excess and pop that off into the fridge for about 15 minutes so once your first coat set you want to apply a second coat you might need to remelt the rest of your yellow candy you want to pour almost all of it keep out about three-quarters of a cup of the remaining yellow candy the rest goes back into the loaf tin and you want to use a spatula to scrape it up the sides scrape around the tops again because you want to make sure you've got really nice neat lines around the top of your loaf tin what will essentially be the bottom of your Lego that one goes back off into the fridge for 15 minutes and then into the freezer for five minutes to snap freeze before we try to remove it from the tin once your life's completely cooled you're going to cut off any browned edges and you want to cut off a decent amount here because remember we've got to fit this inside this same sized loaf tin that we've baked it in so it needs a bit of the edging cut away then you want to cut into two nice pretty even layers because your loaves baked well like a loaf it's going to be a little bit more raised in the middle just trim away the cooked edges and reserve any of your off cut because we'll use that to build up just some of the sides when we actually stuff it into our Lego mold when you take your chocolate loaf tin molds out of the freezer you should already be able to see it starting to contract away from the edges that's because we've shopped it with that cold cold freezing and it's contracted the chocolate away from the outside of our tin hopefully it's just going to slide right out all right there is our Lego block and the basis for our Lego cake so it's time to stack and layer our cake the first thing you want to do is take some of that yellow frosting and you're just going to use your spatula and just put a really thin coat all over the inside of your chocolate shell you want to take your off cuts and just stuff them into the corners of your chocolate shell that's just going to help to alleviate the rounding of the edges that happens when you bake in a loaf tin now you want to take that top piece of cake it's the top piece of the loaf but it's going to be the bottom piece of this cake if that makes sense and then you want to force frosting you can use a snap seal bag to help here right down into the edges and into all the gaps around I'm going to apply a really generous coat of frosting now all over that layer and I'm actually not going to frost the very base of the cake there's already frosting in the middle and frosting in the sides you do however want to make sure that your frosting comes all the way up all four of your sides of your chocolate block once your frostings in we're going to take our base layer of cake and put it in the base of a Lego brick and then you want to force frosting into all the gaps around I'm putting quite a bit of pressure here because I don't really want any gaps in there that's going to cause my cake to dry out and I want lots of frosting with every piece the one thing that you want to remember here is everything the cake the frosting has to be at least a couple of mil lower than the highest point of the case of your cake otherwise you're not going to get a really nice flat surface will be pour over our bottom so it's time to finish our Lego cake we are nearly there guys I've got me a yellow chocolate or yellow candy melt and I've just melted those down again because they're probably set by now and I'm going to pour over the top of my cake it's better to have a little too much here everyone's cake is going to be slightly different height and you're all going to have slightly different amounts left to fill in so you're better to have too much than not enough at this point I'm going to use my spatula just to really smooth it out and get it into all of those corners and crevices now before that one starts to set I'm gonna lift it I've got a baking tray just lined with a bit of parchment because I don't want to waste any of those leftover candy melts and this is about to get messy I'm gonna take my ruler channel my inner cement mixer and we're going to level try to just drag that over once if you possibly can and then I'm going to use my finger just to come around the very outside edge and again make sure that I've got no candy melt on the actual outside edge of my loaf tin this is going to make sure I've got really nice smooth clean lines around the outside of my Lego brick we're basically done all that we have to do now is wait for it to set so this guy is going to go back off into the fridge for 20 minutes and that's just going to let everything set up nicely it's going to be beautiful solid firm and set and ready for us to pop out of our loaf tin so once you're happy that your little Oreos are well and truly set and these definitely cannot be under set you're going to flip that over some of them may just fall out try not to handle them too much because they'll be nice and glossy if they don't just fall out you can just press gently on the bottoms and that should encourage them to pop out of their little spots or you can whack them perfect all right now these guys do look like little buttons but you always make extra just in case you get any of these little air pockets or you can see some of the cookie poking through the top there also not completely even yet so you need to heat up a fry pan or a skillet and grab some parchment paper so we can even them out alright Davian your skillet I'm taking mine off the heat because it doesn't need to be super hot we're only melting a bit of chocolate I am just going to carefully hold my little buttons and I'm going to do them all so that I can pick my best ones and just run them around and then stick them straight down onto some parchment don't worry if you have a little bit of overrun on the base it's better to stick them straight down to the parchment so the cookie doesn't fall out then you can pick the best ones at the end and you can trim off any of that overlap there's the top of our logo block coming back from the fridge you should be able to see that it's automatically starting to contract away from those edges if it's not you can stick it in the freezer for five minutes just to snap chill it now I've got a cake board or a serving plate and in interest of Brazil the delicacy there's a lot of weight going on inside our chocolate shell I'm actually going to flip it like this and lift off there you've got almost your finished Lego cake if you were going to transport this I would actually recommend gluing it to the board with a little bit of candy melt or a little bit of frosting but if you're not it's kind of fun for the birthday boy or girl to be able to pick it up and play with it like an actual Lego brick so now I've picked my 8 best little buttons and I'm going to position them by eye before I stick anything down so that they're all in the right spot and they're all nice and even it looks just like a gigantic chocolate Lego brick because we've seen tons of those before alright I'm going to take a quarter of a teaspoon of my melted yellow chocolate and being careful not to get any around the outsides or the glossy shiny outer edge I'm gonna glue all of my little buttons in place alright that's it I'm moving I'm moving into a house made entirely of Lego brick cakes and Lego brick pinatas two really cool versatile ideas for your loaf tin that any Lego love is going to absolutely go crazy for I also thought it'd be really fun if you wanted to do a cake at a pinata and then maybe even make a third brick in a different color and use that to hide the birthday girl or boys gift inside I hope you guys enjoyed today's video make sure you check out the pinata if you haven't already seen it subscribe to the channel for two new videos every week and as always guys thanks very much for watching and then I've got to rejected buttons it's kind of my ulterior motive in making these because choc d'addario's are amazing the good part about being a cook leftovers again just filling in around all of those side edges with a bit of frosting I'm out of frosting today has been the worst day 
[Music] there's not much we can do in this job without frosting of some thoughts I've showed you guys how to make ganache three ways for a delicious decadent chocolatey fudgy frosting you also of course know how to make my super light fluffy perfectly pipeable buttercream frosting which is awesome and holds up really well in the heat and then at long ago I showed you how to make it two ingredient chocolate fudge frosting there's a lot of frosting going on here today I'm going to show you guys how to make a 7-minute frosting this is a super light almost marshmallow fluff like frosting and it's great for when you need a really white frosting or something that's completely free of grains you can sometimes get a tiny bit of graininess in a traditional buttercream if you have the sweet celebrations cookbook this is actually the recipe on page 217 for my favorite 7-minute frosting and I'm going to be using this frosting inside a giant hostess cupcake so if you're not already subscribed to the channel might be a good idea if you want to make sure you don't miss that video the things that you need to make your 7-minute frosting I've got two large egg whites a tablespoon of light corn syrup or you can also use glucose 1/3 of a cup of water just at room temperature and a cup and a half of sugar you don't want powdered sugar here but you want to superfine sugar so either a caster or the finest green and granulated sugar that you can find there's not a lot to this recipe but you're going to need a minimum of 7 minutes as the recipe name suggests first up you want to bring a pot of water to the boil so get it to a nice sort of a rolling boil and then reduce it down to a simmer you can use either a glass or a metal heat proof Bowl and rest it over the top of your saucepan so that it never actually comes in touch with the water it's just kind of getting that heat from the steam within your saucepan into the bowl you want to put your water your corn syrup or your glucose your egg white and then your sugar and give them a little bit of a hand mix just to get fingers moving and then you want to take your electric beaters here and you're going to beat on high speed for seven minutes around seven minutes depending on the speed and strength of your mixer you might need eight nine ten it might be done at five as you mixer you'll see it at a couple of different stages both is going to go quite white but it's still going to be quite soft and kind of drizzle off your spoon then you're going to see it start to firm up but still it's not going to hold its own shape so seriously you're looking for is when you get soft to medium firm steep so this basically means that when you lift up those feeders your frosting kind of ribbons at the top and reads its own little peak or your beaters actually leave their own mark in the frosting as they're working through rather than having the frosting fold in on itself you're looking for a texture very similar to like a marshmallow fluff or a marshmallow cream this recipe also colors beautifully I love a paste or a gel color here and you can see how well it colored up in the pizza waffles for my book that bright red for a thing is this exact seven minute frosting I don't love this frosting for piping really high swell or for holding up in between cake layers because it's a really light soft smooth frosting but it's not designed to keep its shape in the same way as a traditional buttercream or a firmly set ganache it's great for piping low swells spreading all over the top of cakes and cupcakes and of course filling the center of its giant hostess cupcake just in case you happen to be making one of those this weekend make sure you subscribe to the channel because you just might be making a giant Osos cupcake this week make sure you check out some of my other videos if you want to see some of those basic frosting recipes and some of this giant cake and candy bar ideas have an awesome day you guys and as always thanks very much for watching [Music] Oh [Music] you
