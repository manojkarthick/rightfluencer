a design lovefest we are all about ideas whether it's a blog post a workshop a job we're working on I need to get my idea from my head and out into the world quickly let's say we have a flower class coming up and we want a concept what flowers we'll be using for the workshop so I could easily just bring a bunch of flowers to my studio cut them up lamb on the sprout and scan them really fast I could so easily send an email which is an idea written out in text but it's so much better to send a visual representation of what I'm thinking sprout allows me to scan items make little notes and drawings and make my ideas come to life 
guys I'm free from design love fest and we are here with Thomas who is a master of the cocktails we are hosting a backyard mixology party together so today we're gonna be making two of the drinks that will be served that evening let's take it away Thomas let's make this drink all right let's start with the basics we're gonna start with a vodka drink everybody likes vodka do we and unfortunately so then we're going to add four mook vermouth is basically why didn't know that it's a roma tized mine mr. means is soaked with herbs and different things to give it different flavors so we're gonna do a little splash of dry vermouth and then this is a white sweet vermouth little cleaner a little crisper so two kinds of our move yes what really makes this cocktail is this creme de violette this is a liqueur from the 1930s so this is really the PS de resistance for this drink now we're going to use this lemon to give it a really great zest right and gives it a real forward pneus of the citrus which I think it makes everything a little more palatable and just to make sure i'm going to use some lemon bitters so if you would be so kind as to pass me a coupe the one bit of excising a conical shape that's yes exactly on top of the stem so this is a coupe that is a champagne coupe though they are ubiquitous now for cocktails and rightly so they make the cocktail look beautiful and they're elegant to drink out of amazing color I'm just squeezing and expressing the oils and fresh lemon scent down to the cocktail beautiful yeah violent color landscape it's early but why not hmm so the lemons right away yes and then violet and then violet that's amazing yeah my notes make sure our next drink is gin and I'm gonna be totally honest with you I never ordered it because they don't know how yes a lot of people are afraid of Jen I think everyone had a bad experience from their dad's liquor cabinet and they were teenagers but it is really the best cocktail alcohol this is planet this is a good old-fashioned gin this drink is very finely the gin itself is you're doing peppers exactly i have another one of my housemates herbs this one's made three different kinds of a pers really spicy but sweet too I like drinks with spicy it's also got a little fresh squeezed lemon juice in it here's the final sort of coup de Gras for this we're gonna put some absinthe in this cocktail oh but because absent has that really big flavor it can hijack your cocktail and you can forget that anything else is in it so I'm going to control how much I'm putting in here it's got a lot of drops I'm gonna give it to me hallucinating on set yes hopefully if the drink works beautiful kind of gay or fiery color then let's put a little hot pepper in their laptop oh ok immediately I taste i think the absent that's very very gym yeah like right now yeah well it comes in waves you know you get that licorice flavor then you get yeah I'm emotion thank you so much for joining us today and helping us make these beautiful dreams yeah my pleasure i had a lot of fun I can't wait to see however in reacts not the party yes I hit I think I think they're gonna love them all let's see who chooses what I think I now be well we should may get hurt and pick a favorite yes we should as we already picked my favorite so this is our spread that will be serving at the party and check back in the seat you
