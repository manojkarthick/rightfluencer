We went monochromatic with the smoky turquoise paint on all the walls  ceiling and moulding and a mix of geometric and playful accessories to add even more personality. 😍🔮💡#creativeweirdos #OMGWACO x #laurex #mrkate #interiordesign #decorate #paint #becausewhynot #accessorize #OMGWeAreComingOver.

Our Hers & His office transformation for the ineffable LaurDIY and Alex Wassabi! https://youtu.be/LvC8VzCcI88 I broke a lot of design rules in this room 😰 by going with a two-tone color palette which only worked because of the symmetry in the room and the mirror image layout of the furniture ...#juxtaposition baby! This design helped reinforce my belief in really committing to a bold choice - you can’t be half-assed about a half and half room!

I'm wearing my clothes reversed to help #reverserett which is a devastating neurological disorder affecting over 350 000 girls. It takes away their ability to talk and control their bodies  breathe and eat while they remain completely aware but unable to express themselves. I personally know an amazing 7 year old girl named Magnolia (Maggie) with this disorder. Maggie loves princess dresses and dancing but can only tell you this with her eyes because Rett has taken her words. @joeyzehr and I are committed to helping Maggie's parents @jennytesler and @ajtesler in their fight to find a cure. The good news  there is very promising research that shows that with the right funding  there may be a cure. You can help by donating to reverserett.org and sharing your own reversed clothes photos! #reverserett #magnoliashope. One of these stands out from the pack because it's... wearable!

Geiger I trusted mr. Kay I've trusted mr. Kane yeah although I designed both sides of the room but still yeah shake your hand this is an Alex and Joey world are you guys are new but the mr. Kane laurdiy world like there's just like turkey get our letter [Music] yeah why don't even get there Wow not even think noona broom are so much more efficient Oh excellent this he said I could alex is got some creative techniques you know I I think I'm deaf Annie Joey's got this and I have two projects do with Lauren Lauren let's go yes I can paint while you go DIY can you do a little bit more paint before you leave the baby yeah now it's boyfriend first boyfriend ohh no I mean like were their boyfriends I mean I technically I'm Kate's husband tactically they're already lovers well this is great they can paint together well Lauren and I go do some DIY okay yeah it's happening I can't believe we've never DIY it's taken too long for us to get to this point we both have done DIY thing on YouTube for many years so this is a magical day that we are finally coming together to collab and DIY together I can't believe it haven't happen before I'm so excited to see what she comes up with I'm pretty sure that mr. Kate's my spirit animal she's like design Queen and I'm like like glue Queen she's what you're gonna evolve into she's mine yeah she's my next pokemon evolution oh all right so this is actually one of the things we're gonna do why there's a beautiful cousin throw and then so I found this amazing ceramic cactus it's a very muted kind of greenish tone and that is just not what we're going for in here we really want fun and pops of color so I have some paints on hand here a bunch of different colors so the idea is paint this mm-hmm like I have a ton of colors here we could paint it all solid then do like poke it off or whatever literally up to you this is where you can just be your creative queen cells and then we have these fun faux flowers on hand which you know catches and have flowers and so yeah we could put it you know one big wherever and then this guy I thought it would be really fun to have the element of splatter paint oh my god yeah from that so I thought we could just lay this down and then then take all the colors and just splatter it up okay I've definitely splatter painted I definitely had a phase where there was actually my favorite pair of jeans that I had splatter painted lime green blue and white in grade 9 and I feel like splatter painting is back and it's cool again I'm so excited about it junkie oh man I haven't done a splatter in a really long time and we're like standing far away I know I'm lucky you don't get fluttered the long arm splatter technique cute oh my gosh I love I'm a huge fan I love their blue this is a great project you could upcycle a throw blanket that you're sick of or you could get an inexpensive one so we just have to let it dry and we'll do the other side and splatter paint throw blanket check so let's let this dry and bring a cactus back on I feel like I actually put a cactus in my mood board like it was so specific I was like cactuses are cool and I want don't you have multiple campuses at your old apartment yeah yeah and have you been DIY since you were a wee one oh yeah I came out of the womb with like a paintbrush and like a it's like I'm here in a DIY cacti have a kind of southwestern Flair but if you look at the bohemian style nowadays you really see a lot of those elements so we are combining styles to give it a bohemian look and this cactus is perfect for that because we can do whatever we want with the color palette [Music] oh okay so the coat of pink paint is dry and she wants to do like a triangle on the bottom which I love that idea again it's kind of playing with the southwestern vibe what's your favorite like medium to work with that's a more advanced question not what's your favorite hiding question I say watercolor paints or Mod Podge I'm gonna do a little I know I guess so what you can do with my bugs you can do so much with Mod Podge that's crazy the yellow looks amazing we'll definitely need another coax it is a pale yellow going over that really bright pink but we'll let that dry we'll do another coat and now we're gluing on the flowers I think big guy goes here right so let's just do that let's just glue that what now that commit to it it looks so cute it's like a little hat it's like a cactus going to the Kentucky Derby that is an advanced move right there I would like everyone to note the same just inverted the bottom of the perfect one elastic flower so that it will nestle around the top advanced move advanced d.i.y move you so cute we should go I forgot about the boys the boyfriends are like the boys in their own oh my gosh I'm I'm a little bit scared I really am I'm a little nervous yeah okay wait yes did you paint it on the ceiling [Music] Alex you said paint this half of the room so I did what you said so technically this is our fault I can't control where my artistic abilities take me I feel like it's probably going that's not be the ceiling I mean here's the great thing we were already planning on painting the ceiling but now I've sort of turned it on to him like it's his fault that he painted a ceiling so they don't like how the ceiling painting looks it's fall well it looks like Alex kind of made the decision for us to beat the ceiling now we're fully committed because there's blue paint already on the ceiling I feel like you guys are making me look like I don't know anything about interior design oh my gosh alex is eating paint [Applause] tell me how it happens every time there's some kind of like toxic liquid or instant in the room it's not my fault they chose the color that's the color of cotton candy they should have thought ahead I've already been stressed out about this project and now someone's ingested paint OMG tip guys don't eat paint they kicked us out yeah it's like 50% torture 50% nervousness but a hundred percent excitedness oh that's gender % I made him think that he messed up on the ceiling I didn't tell him that that was actually what we're doing yeah we're committed to it now because there's actually paint on the ceiling yeah well we have a lot lifted get that tape line so perfect we got to get down to business now we've kicked him out let's get that tape line super straight okay so the key here because we have the symmetry of door door you know this room can be split literally down the middle yeah that's what we're doing so we need a really clean tape line down this wall cross the ceiling and then down over that door so the key with doing this two-tone room is making sure that we first paint the pink kind of overlapping that line so that we know that it's fully covered because we need to be able to tape on to the pink to then do the blue and then we can use the laser level to get a perfectly clean line with some really high-quality painters tape and we're also gonna do the trick where we paint over the painters tape with the pink color so in case any bleeds we have that nice clean line ultimate Joey rolls [Music] okay Joey to rolls has met his match it's called a sealing alright so on the pink wall we left the insides of the molding bare because we're actually gonna do a really cool thing where we're putting wallpaper on those squares so because we have these molding panels we're going to paint Alex's side all the way over it's gonna be a much more monochromatic look it's really gonna highlight the color of the paint and then on Laurens side we're embracing those molding panels and we're going to put all people on the inside of them she doesn't know yet it looks so good and it's watercolor and I painted it and then we blew it up anyway so we made it to come over okay you guys see it's good oh my gosh I love that we did textured paper cuz it's likely yeah it looks like watercolor paper so believe we did this is I painted on a big piece of paper watercolor the different colors the orange the yellow the pinks and then Joey scanned it in and we made it into a mural that we ordered from a custom wallpaper company so there's no repeats it's all gonna be a completely unique look between the panels I basically would be a giant wall mural we're just dividing it up between the panel we're just over achieving gonna be so cool okay we need to get the wallpaper blue all right so basically how you the wallpaper on the wall is be primed the squares because you're not really gluing it to the wall you're gluing it to the primer you get the wallpaper nice and soaked with the glue put it on the wall you take your squeegee get it all flat and into the corners and then we're gonna go with the razor blade and get it trimmed perfectly alright guys it is time to find out if our straight-line technique worked or failed [Music] it's straight it's clean there's no bleeds that trick works oh well if you need to ever split a room in half with do colors this is the way to do it so the light fixture that's already in this room is not gonna work for the design it's actually kind of scary it's a little gothic so we're gonna take down the chandelier and replace it with a beautiful brass chandelier the element of gold and brass is totally up Laurens alley and I'm sure Alex will like it too since it's not pink and you have these giant glass globes that go on it and there are all different sizes it just kind of looks like a treasure we're just gonna figure out the various heights for these big globes and small globes and there's no right way to do this so we'll just get them how we want them and then see how it looks this chandelier is so much better than the light fixture that they had in here before this one screams Lauren it's got balls globes all right so Lauren had at her own neon sign before so what we did is we got a custom-made sign for Alex the way we're mounting these neon signs is they're on stand off you just drill into the wall with your anchor drill to stand off on and they need to screw the neon sign on the standoffs and let's see how they look [Music] so we mounted these neon signs the laurdiy the wasabi and of course like any neon sign it needs a power source because it is a light alright so the options are cord through the wall cord cover like running over here cord cover paint it paint cord cover weeds be nervous just cuz it's like with the Moonbeam so it's gonna be like cord cover a break let's get the chairs in see how the black cord looks cuz it might look cool Kate is a bigger fan of like the hanging wire than I am but usually I trust her and I think we're probably just gonna let these hang guys this was actually quite large so I had to get a big rug for this room I wanted it to unify the space I wasn't gonna split it up and have one rug for him why not for her because even though we are playing the two sides off of each other they still have to meet in the middle and be one so the rug is the perfect thing to do it this rug is insane this area rug has so many areas there's the left corner the right corner the the southwest corner and Joe and I are taking a cuddle tour okay [Music] [Music] so for Alex's side the wasabi sign is a little bit bigger just because of the way his logo is with the W I wanted to go a little bit more simple with the chair and I found this gorgeous combo of leather with wood so you guys I have been wanting to use a peacock chair for ever it looks so cool under the sign this is perfect like this is going to be her throne so next to the chairs we need to place a side table because when you're sitting in a throne sometimes you need to have a drink next to your throne so even though we're split down the middle and we're doing Lauren on one side and Alex on the other we need some symmetry in here as well just for the eye to kind of have moments of like oh those two are the same things even though this room is being in two different colors I see some symmetry one of the things we're doing is we're giving them at the same desk chair but in different colors subtle affective and the key here is giving them pieces of furniture that are concealed storage because I want to put the desks in the middle the desks are floating and airy they don't have drawers so these credenzas are really key for them for all of their desks storage papers etc over on the other side of the room but the doors that lead outside I wanted to do plans Lauren requested fake plants because she said she would kill any real plans I'm sure paralysis requests to you something tells me she does not know how to water plants so I found these two really beautiful high-quality birds of paradise they're the same exact plans but it looks really cool again playing with the kind of mirror image I am obsessed with those flamingos tattoos they are actually meant for your lawn but they're so fun so look I think the don't they like clean there but you not there but whatever preen themselves okay so the other items I'm styling on top of the credenza this beautiful orange base inside I am placing a succulent branch of course it is fake it will stay like that forever Alex decided is a little more monochromatic with the tones of blue but I want to add some pops of yellow I did you like yellow is a great color for him he has such a sunshiny happy personality so when Alex's credenza I want to style it make it fun manly playful but obviously not so over style that it looks like too kitschy I found these really cool acrylic blue cubes and so I'm placing three of them on the credenza and then I'm using the other one as his pen holder but he also really wants candy so I'm just gonna chuck a lot of candy in there and couple pens it's a good ratio alright guys it's that time we're pulling down the tarp this was such a big risk that we took what I am so happy with how it looks but it doesn't matter what I think because this isn't my room so let's get lauric in here what's happening we just didn't people yeah it's been hard we haven't peaked but we almost accidentally peaked a few times but they're very on it they're like and were like oh sorry I didn't see anything it was an accident okay alright wait till it take a moment to just imagine it in behind your closed eyes with the room look like you guys want it 50/50 split down the middle Alex Bobby hop laurdiy me only funds bohemian colorful [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] many people oh yeah this is definitely mainly playful right Lou is like the perfect well sit nice and then I've been wanting to decorate with a good owner ever I'm never going to use one like this have like a room that works and your bohemian Brown are these real glass with water them know you have someone introduce things that y'all had and you know can those are all cubes you can store something you could just play things inside those on talking on whatever thank you I want some in your chair oh is it a chair oh I feel really playful I feel like no other room is gonna be as nice as that room that's a nice like stressed about other rooms not looking as good as this room I feel

K 1 million we are so getting so darn close you guys so thank you so much to all the og subscribers out there and welcome newbies just click that button and welcome to the family let's get into the DIY dresser I miss Kate and here it is the unfinished raw wood dresser and by raw wood I just mean it's sanded nice smooth wood this dresser comes with just little tiny raw wood knobs but I want to do something special with the tops of course so let me walk you through the supplies you got your dresser we're gonna paint it and I have this beautiful dark blue color same color that we are painting the walls in sleazies layer if you watch office bowls you know what I'm talking about [Music] so after I paint it I'm not just gonna leave it a painted dresser with just some regular old knobs oh no no I've got couples that is what these are called because they look like little cup you put them on your dresser or wherever and cup your hand underneath to pull out the drawer so those are our beautiful kind of burnished brass holes and then I'm going to add another brass element flat corner braces basically they are little l-shaped pieces of brass with screw holes in them and I'm going to use these on the corners of the drawer to give it a kind of more like a vintage piece and you're going to be able to see the screws it's going to give it a little bit of an industrial edge so that's the plan it's pretty simple just got a nail paint with a nice thick custard like paint oh my gosh it's about to get all over my nail it's okay so now I've got my paint handy dandy in a tray and I'm going to use one of these foam Pat's to apply the paint what I love about these is it's a nice large surface area and you can get a really smooth stroke over this wood green so I'm just going to use this on all of the larger areas and then probably go in with a brush on the small area ready so I'm going to get this entire body of the dresser painted and then I've also laid out all the drawers here because it just makes it so much easier to paint them when they're not inside the dresser and then let's dry it and get to the brass you okay so we are all dry the drawers are dry the body of the dresser is dry and now it's time to attach our beautiful brass accents so I have these corner brackets that are l-shaped and they're flat which is the key and I really like how they're imperfect you know it has that very industrial look in the face of the metal I'm going to screw some bigger holes to put these cupfuls in so there's these little areas that kind of extend past the flat plane of the back and those want to nestle in to the wood so I have my drill bit here nicely suited with a bit that's about the same size as this area here and I'm going to drill on either side of this pre-drilled hole that's here because I want to cover that up [Music] okay do I have sawdust in my hair DIY or is dandruff okay I've got this couple now fitted into those holes and I'm going to secure it to the drawer with the screws that come with couple but look at how nice that looks you guys now let's get some of those L brackets secured here Marky Mark [Music] and now it's time to take the four little screws that come with the bracket and I am just going to screw them into the pre-drilled hole you love it amazing okay so now I just have to repeat this whole process with the cup pulled and the corner brackets to all the drawers and I'll be ten oh my gosh I love it so much it looks so cool it's so industrial but chic it's a perfect combo [Music] guys that beautiful dark blue color is just so elegant and I love those aged brass accents obviously I'm sure you guys can tell how versatile this project is like you could do it on a bedside table you could do it on whatever dress or you have a smaller dress or a tall dress or a high boy you know those had boys it's just a tall dresser I mean I don't know why they're called that and just anyone know something I'll tell me in the comments please comment and also thumbs up the video and subscribe guys if you haven't if you didn't while I was telling you in the beginning now I'm telling you again at the end so before you leave just click that button thanks so much and it was so much fun hanging out with you and if you do this project I would love to see so post your pictures using hashtag mr. heat and I can bask in your creativity thanks so much for hanging out and I will see you next time [Music] like I love it what the Iowa I can't do both Center oh okay 
look what savor savor your kibble yeah it's a great reminder for dogs everywhere and humans well if TV kibble do you kibble and we go Oh sometimes hi guys welcome okay so this is another shopping blog for you guys it's a little bit different though I brought here obviously going me instead of my shaky and holding camera I love the end of grad a my lit--okay oh my god you look great and sure yeah you raked all you think here we go hi little man wish me an iPod cameras and although I am working with Marshall Marshalls is actually sponsoring this video or doing this really cool program called the pen pal program and basically they're letting people across the country have their Pinterest dreams come true by realizing their Pinterest boards in the physical form but I really find it out because it means I get to surprise one of you lovely creative weirdos with a Marshalls Pinterest inspired makeover and I pin a lot because you guys know that's how I build all of these mood boards and rooms and how I decorate rooms I get inspiration on Pinterest like every day so I get to go through my followers which if you guys don't follow me on Pinterest yet huh god I went through my followers found someone local here in LA I'm just obsessed with her style so I messaged her on Pinterest like a creeper I know like hey can you send me some pictures of your studio and until her anything else skis are the photo she said oh so we got the broken blinds here so like she has a couch right pretty minimal the studio apartment she's got like a dark blue and white going on she's got like some like side tables with plans but other than that there's not a lot of style going on here okay so you wanted to see some some like pictures and I'm pulling real quick before we go so you guys know the map that's important I know she loves interior style based off of her pins so like bohemian like mixed metals you know neutral beautiful colors obsessed with this little lineup of pillows because it has the blue and white the blue and white thing that I saw going on already like very minimally in her pictures and I love like the mix of patterns okay we're gonna have to find some blue and white stuff okay get these old like plans in things so I'm totally inspired and I'm gonna go to Marshalls and I'm gonna do a one-stop shop and get all kinds of stuff to just pull eat duck burgers hey I'm gonna flip right I'll meet you in the car okay I'm really inspired to do this piece I'm really inspired by the pins I'm inspired by who I think my pin palettes I mean at least I'm inspired by what I think that this whole experience of designing her place bringing in these new awesome inspiring elements is going to open up for her like I really want her to be open to possibilities from here on out and I'm hoping that this transformation will do that I mean it's amazing what like having inspiring elements around you can really do for your perspective on life I need to get a mix of things right I need to get like curtains and rugs and bedding okay pedestrians please ladies [Music] hello okay where's the home section oh it's in the back I see frying pans I mean I don't need frying pans but I see them oh look our favorite color Hey whoa put it right in front of your face ah what happened on it no I'm laughing oh and look that's cool like very like boho like this with a little succulent juxtaposition stop this oh my god this is bolus Wow I don't know what that says but I think it's from Poland hand-painted in Poland artisanal oh is that is that the word artisanal artisanal yes yes since we want to go boho with the vibe since I was really kind of where her Pinterest board was leaning textiles are where that's at right so like pillows and layered blankets and rugs and curtains like that's where you really build that kind of coziness is in the textiles in the fabric so we're right here viola curtains she has like what looks like really tall ceilings so we should definitely go with a 96 inch panel 96 inch is sometimes hard to find Marshalls thankfully stocks a ton of 96 inch curtains and I will tell you guys if you can really go for a longer panel in your space I say to it because it will make such an elegant difference if you go that much higher above your window with your curtain rod and get those really panels of fabric it just looks so beautiful we call it a puddle yeah you can puddle it you can graze it I mean up to you there Muhsin that style you know there's a mirror down here I'm just taking advantage doing some squats and it's actually a really pretty mirror and all that I'm looking at it wow I mean I was just looking at myself right now I'm looking at the mirror like the governing son of Bohemia yeah okay so maybe let's just I feel like it was meant to me yeah Mac that this live lovely lady helped me fix my hair no I was just wrong you can deal with you can you kinda have to identify what is like the main feature of your design desires and it seems from your Pinterest board that she wants cozy inviting you know it's her apartment in the middle of La an asphalt jungle let's give her some coziness let's give her some softness Brad what look at this stool don't you want to put your toe she on that oh yes I want to get sofa all over my tushy and it's a textile take it cuz it's upholstered I mean I'm Chi I'm kind of do you break it I know let's just so you know okay alright let me teach your toe she doesn't lie oh it's heavy it's solid solid wood look at that Wow classy how shy you sit on it just wiggle you have to know like this chair chooses the human oh this is great because we need to create a little conversation area for her could have this little stool but because it's like a studio apartment and it needs to have open sight lines a stool is a great option because it doesn't have a back to it right my joy she says yeah can we do one of these why don't you put on the bottom just upturn it flip it and reverse it hmm like this one this way like where it's on its back what Oh like this the opposite of that Brad I'm obsessed I'm seeing this - look at this table like this is like a tray table to tell the truth and I love this height because this will look really good next to her couch or next to her bed I love this hammer top the element of metals - you know I love to bring in mixed metals I'm tough now how the hell did Brad this is our dark blue right and are like globally inspired this would be this would be like a Turkish modeled after I'm sure a Turkish rug I mean I'm not gonna just get er this pillow but a moody Turkish bohemian a moody Turkish bohemian feather storm feather storm there's nothing you do that on their server though fire storm works - took the pill if they're made up okay so you guys know that I love to do this I just pick a surface in the store and I build a story of the items that I'm gonna take with me and it just makes it easier to like see all the elements together before they get into the cart and they're all piled on top of each other so I love this as our base I love that this has a thread of this lighter white color through it so we can really bring in those white tones so this is our grounding you know slightly more masculine color and then we've got some I mean there's so many like there's there's so many options what do we think about these are these too dark this is how we experiment solid is obsessed because this has pattern right so we're bringing in the blue and that is also okay guys like playing with tones of color I feel like sometimes people get paralyzed by trying to find the exact shade of blue and I'm telling you don't bother because blue is blue you can go light and go dark they all like each other I've decided I'm not gonna help you have registered hey the pillows are falling the middle okay I'll help you now hello hi I'm great I did and I actually have more stuff can I hold this up here to view oh my gosh I mean what's your name my name is Eve Eva ja ja p e thank you so much oh my gosh all right we're doing decorative objects gold and copper and what oh my gosh hang on ah what look at this whoa kind of metal is a school I'm also like a copper copper copper rose gold dig it yeah sure okay wait rod I feel like I need more from the silver section oh look at this look at this oh my gosh [Music] she lives in la-la gets hot right I mean functional decora is always a class and if it's just like cool it's like vintage-inspired right like look how cool it is with this stuff mmm you know it's like it's like those unexpected items but an eclectic look pairs different eras together right you know so like that's kind of more global this is a little more mid-century modern but together they will be friends you just make them friends by putting them next together then they have to learn kind of like when you go to kindergarten they just have to learn to like each other in our color palette well globe you guys know that I talked about shopping is so much a part of the decorating process because I can look at Pinterest and I can get inspired but the actual design takes shape through the shopping because I don't know what's gonna be out there you know for the discovery process is what you really have to be open to you have to come into this drawer with eyes wide open having inspiration having a color palette in mind but then being so open to those surprises like this like I didn't know I was gonna like this and yet it's perfect oh my gosh what is this either dried grape Mandrake it's so cool yeah we'll get it get it she could put her rings it gets to be good for like her I don't know jewelry section foods you likely remain breathless yeah so I need two lights cuz the way her bed is position right now I think it's actually in a good spot in the room based off the pictures so I want to give her two lights on either side of the bed but because we're going for that bohemian look I don't think I want them to be matching you know obviously there's a lot of matching lights so you could totally get that look if you want it which is great like we did that in Andrews plays you know should we do one of these and then maybe one like crystally why yeah totally I don't see what those look like together and I also like that the shades are different colors look how pretty sort of like your opposites away like that the toxin bottom yeah it's totally compliment each other oh my god I love that yes amazing that was easy right done oh my God look at the little talk it's little branch - oh it's so cute maybe we should get a third lamp like look how cool oh wow that's cool right yeah that's a study lamp mixed metals with a crystal different styles eclectic bohemian love it doggies oh my gosh we what is it vanilla a banana smooth it's always a video my gosh look at him he's rocking at sure oh my god I want to wear this I found my Halloween costume only I was the size of a husky let me let's go run cocktailing okay get this oh my gosh there's so many different texts oh my god I love look at that just a beautiful linen like that is gorgeous with the subtle floral pattern on it and then I'll grab maybe this one too oh yeah yeah you like this to me well the ball logo texture lasagna yeah Brad what look at this oh this is like a marble robot or is it granite quartz or something yes I tear all so what about these baskets like I want to bring in some stance for her like maybe that like a plan very cool love [Music] she was just living like the like marble look - totally so

what Oh breathe you can breathe I see the light at the end of the tunnel yes my gosh you were finding us on such a much better day because it is the last day of renovating in our house we're like 75% done yeah like maybe like 79 a half percent I got one day to finish 21% to be at a hundred percent you glad you did that math thank you oh it's gonna be crazy make sure and subscribe we're giving away at ten thousand dollar room transformation oh my god you can't miss out guys and thank you to everyone who's already subscribed and thank you so much to people who are just gonna subscribe right now yeah now it's time for another episode of oMG we bought a house okay I'm sorry for that but yes strip in three oh my gosh hey Joey why pay attention this is physical labor hi mom go okay you got it yeah I mean you could just hand them to me okay seriously I'm gonna scrape up your beautiful put em right for you for what hood oh it's Yiddish for face I think hoodie put up look dumb none put on put on I don't know gonna spell it how many of you glass ones are there I didn't realize we had so many glass cabinets are we gonna miss the glass no I'm missing the glass am i missing the glass do you miss it I kind of miss it are you kidding me no we're not gonna have it anymore good one of the big products we're doing is replacing all of our kitchen cabinets there's gonna be like 14 grand or something for custom cabinets f that I found a place that actually you can just order cabinet bases so we just ordered these plain wood cabinet faces for a fraction of what it would cost to actually replace all of our cabinets I think there's like 80 cabinet so I'm taking all the cabinet's to the studio lay them all out paint them one by freaking one we wanted to use an oil-based paint because cabinets get a lot of wear and tear plus the paint that's on our cabinet bodies is oil-based paints we're trying to match it as well as possible like if you get prefinished cabinets it has a really like baked on sheen which is nice it's a little bit more of a modern look but because this house is so vintage and I'm trying to preserve a bit of that vintage Elora I want the cabinets to look hand-painted so we're using a brush and it's taking a while all right so we got all of our cabinets painted it was a two-day process we've got one layer in this car cabinet front freshly painted another layer or two layers in here the paint job on these cabinets look pretty good if I do say so myself it's kind of this weird processes you install a kitchen in a bathroom because you have to put the countertop in before the backsplash but then you have to cover up the countertops with like foam or something protective because then you have to put the backsplash in and obviously you don't want to like get the countertop all gunky so we're kind of in that mode installing the now dry cabinet doors which looks amazing we got these gorgeous door handles with Kohler it's like a brush gold oh my god you just like love love these goes along with our theme sort of ties in the bathroom everything sort of tied together well this isn't level than I need your help because a stepladder oh geez oh my gosh don't what cries me with a fluorescent is the one thing that we left in the cab oh my god it we have a peeler this peeler is a little precarious yeah cute though all right so we're installing the cabinet's I got these really cool soft clothes hinges okay did you see how good these hinges are I got well are so good what are they soft clothes sure you do the rest of the work Kaplan oh wow jaqen it's time I guess they're slow closing hinges but they're very slow did you hear me that slow Kate what's wrong with things being slow in life sometimes you're too fast okay relax breathe ready and when it takes longer so deep breath it takes longer than a deeper so thank you for putting so much work still closing just close it I'm just gonna like peek at this cuz it has been a second since I've seen a new beautiful countertop wait key wait to it no no don't take the tape off what why as we stoped the grout here well okay so um can you peel it if you want to look at it I gotta cast the cap I got over there oh wow oh good good you got that porcelain marble slab it's not real marble it's fake marble but it looks just like real marble again at a fraction of the cost this is the future of countertops look at this head look how thick that is the lip on the sink looks really good to gain we don't want to see more of a vein I can't believe it's not marble it's Calcutta porcelain like look at that vein with the different colors the subtle hues the gray picking up the gray of the backflash oh my gosh can you pick out some more handles careful you go back to sleep hungry to come out yet talking in talking it in the plan with the master bathroom in order to create a wall big enough for the double vanity we closed up that little small door that led into the guest room because really we didn't need the master bathroom to be like a Jack and Jill with the guest room because there's another bathroom that our guests use obviously filling in that guest room door means we have to paint so we're doing a fresh coat of that same pretty blue color that we have in the guest room oh my gosh I'm stretching my oblique to left on this side hey Joey how come the shuttles doing the top stuff oh because Kate don't hear me what club Joey I will seriously I will never mill it down your nose that's not yeah I'm Kerry sure yeah first off there's paint on that okay well the wall looks good it's pretty amazing that there used to be a door there like there is no trace of that old door they filled in with drywall you would never know that there was ever a portal to the master bathroom and now we have a whole like entire wall in this further than half before I know we're gonna have to rethink this layout in this room yeah maybe we finally put the bed center on the wall I was like that was the issue as we were never never able to because the window set us went on this wall we could shoot mmm no babies no baby no baby possibly uh no he can finish this I have more important things to do [Music] [Music] Joey case being weird we are weird you interrupted my imagination shower I was just soaking in I mean is this not like the coolest I lover I love it it's such a bold moment we went full ah I know it may not be everybody's taste to go bold I'm okay with bold black and white I didn't want to have colorful tile in here because I'm around so much color and stuff going on in my daily life I want to come home or I want to wake up in the morning and just be around neutral tones and to me black and white is in neutral the tile on the shower is done it looks incredible or just soaping off the grout I am obsessed with that tile it's just like such a cool pattern I love that it kind of mimics the hexagon tile that's going on on the floor of the bathroom we gotta get the shower doors and the final plumbing in we're good or these two medicine cabinets they came yeah like you've got to be realistic about the type of person you are and I need storage and I don't want it cluttering up any surfaces I want the surfaces clean so medicine cabinets were a must Freddie ah what the oh you okay that's your medicine cabinet Wow oh they're huge yeah everything there's actually I know I know this one oh my gosh there's only one in here yeah well we got to there's another boss right that is the heaviest medicine cabinet I've ever carried if that's one have you ever carried a medicine him anymore I mean it's a figure of speech [Music] never heard that figure to be war all right let's check out the countertop oh my gosh and there's a little holes for the pump we still lucked out with finding that porcelain slab because we were able to get enough to do the laundry room countertop and the bathroom vanity top and it just looks so good storage storage storage storage mine mine mine mine yours no uh-huh it's a double sink so now I finally get to have my own sink so I don't have to have all of Kate's makeup and hairspray and just all that stuff I'm gonna have a clean Joey zone all right so this is like the final thing needs to go in there right all the shower doors wow this is gonna be heavy to move in there huh you have to do it all yourself okay so we got to get new cabinet pulls knobs I might want to do poles and knobs and then do I want any soap dish I mean definitely I'm gonna get the soap dispenser and then towels and then I've got to get like bath mat oh my god okay and then if I want to do like that the coffee display like I'm going to have oh my God we're so close oh I am so obsessed with all that stuff you guys I hope you guys love it to put your countertops

Previously on OMG we bought a house We're going to create a really cool conversation area around the fire place Yeah, a couch, Chairs A cozy rug I cannot wait to decorate in here. The movers are on their way right now with all of our stuff Alright where would you like this item? Back on the truck, oh my god So you got it? Do you have it? Do you have it?

Who knows, it's continuing last season, new season, who knows it's 2008 guys Happy New Year Happy new year. This is our first video of 2018. What did I say? I said it's 2008. It's 2018, it's our first video of 2018. Hi guys We missed you. 2017 was amazing. It was amazing. It was a wild. It was crazy and this year is gonna Be just as wild and crazy, we have so many cool videos planned and we're also like finishing our house Yeah, we've been in the house for four years. Today we are doing a little bit of redecorating actually, because Black Friday just happened let's be honest I couldn't resist the sales But it was also perfect timing because we've been decorating for other people for four years now so of course our Style has kind of changed Matured and we want to have that reflected in our house as well Guys make sure to subscribe you can see us put all that Black Friday stuff in Like today, I have a New Year's cold. Sorry I sound a little Under the weather, but you are New Year's cool. Oh, hey New Year's cool and snotty mm-hmm. Shall we start? Let's do this. Let's do it so this one I Kind of think I like the lighter grey My issue with this one is that it's like too timid we want this to be like a dark anchoring, So maybe, maybe the bottom one because it's like I like a touch of brown and tint I thought you didn't like that. Alright We are back in the living room you guys remember all the way back in the day this room was like painted a weird like kind of baby puke almost like a diarrhea-y Poopy brown color, and it was just really atrocious and we cleaned it all up. We painted it all white We brought in some furniture everything was looking good, but now that we've been living here I look at that wall all the time because that's where we watch TV So I'm literally sitting on the couch staring at that wall. I'm like we need something on this wall. What do you want? I, like this one. Oh, the one that you did the bigger square on you're leading, you're leading the witness You love the off black Choose the off black Asking my opinion on these things is pointless because I know that Kate has a better vision for Aesthetics so she should just do it which I guess She kind of just did why you asked me you probably already bought one of those. What's what did you buy? Did you buy one of those? You already got one of those colors, I quit. But Joey! But that was just for back-up, just in case. It was a test Don't you like that one? Where is it? So? Here's the deal? I went to go buy samples of these colors and One of the colors off black that I really wanted they didn't have a sample size of So I was just like fine, I'll buy the gallon of it because if we don't use it in our house We'll use it in a future project you guys know we go through paint like buttah so yeah, I pick the black color We got our drop cloths laid down we got our corners taped up we Applied a coat of the original white color to the tape That's a trick so that once you go over with the darker color you get a clean tape line all right? Why are you going through cooking Really sure, I'm holding back. That's how advanced move wow It's actually kinda have to like Go over pretty. Well.

No wheel what we are Decorating we love deciding colors and stuff Ok so you guys remember those big shells that we brought in they're basically an iron frame They're modeled after a French library shelves obviously more towards the turn of the century industrial era iron rah-rah But they have wood shelves and they've been beautiful But because we're bringing in some more wood furniture plus the paint on the wall is so dark We really want those shelf snow stand off of it, so what better to stand off of black then wait I Love this car I'm so excited a comfy couch You know we didn't totally get rid of our old couch, and we now have that wall painted the color of the couch. Oh, yeah So we're treating out our old couch, which Joey just didn't like the couch I loved the look of it, but I agree with him that it was just not very comfortable, so don't worry guys Yes, we're getting rid of some of our furniture, which you only had for four years, but we are either selling it or Reusing it in other rooms or in other designs. Don't worry. We respect the life of furniture. Let's all get up All right, well you got to do it last time My turn please be my guest cue the heavy metal Kickert my fake watch says you're taking a little long on the plastic wrap Yeah, well I need a scissor We can do it together you get that side. I'll get this side okay, Betty. You can play at this game So it's a little shorter than our old couch You didn't get the size that you can touch on what does that feel like does it kind of be like you have a permanent? Footrest no. It's it's actually uncomfortable, and it's very Tightest I can't bid on any furniture guys. You know I'm a small my femurs are short They don't make furniture my sides don't mean you take the legs off It's actually very bad for your back to just have your feet floating in the air. Thank you for asking ten years later Okay, so I have this which is furniture protector this whole redesign is informed by our life And what do we deal with often cat barf right? They barf on the furniture, it's just a reality we live with our two kids which are two furry Lovely beasts that love to puke everywhere Because they're cats and that's what cats do which means that I want to treat this new couch with a furniture protector kind of like an oil that repels water And I am just smoothing this all over the couch using a soft cloth So Kate's gonna apply that and I'm probably just gonna sit and watch you're going to apply in Vertical motion, it's scary because it does look like It changes the color a lot, but it will dry and you won't be able to tell the difference But we'll be able to clean up the cat work a lot easier Okay, well you are doing zilch There what spoil is a coffee table you gotta put the legs on okay cue the legs alright Well Kate finished is that I'm gonna grab the legs with a coffee table So if you guys remember in our dining room we were on this really hefty solid wood dining Joey had this idea. I had the genius idea of why don't we just make the world's largest coffee table? And I was like normally wouldn't put that big of a coffee table in this size room But then I thought about our lifestyle again, and we eat off of it we work off of it I'll spread out like art projects. I'll paint on it so why not have it be a big expansive surface I am approving this idea so we are gonna take that mirror out take the legs off We're gonna hang that in the other room, and I took out my circular saw, and I just started chopping at the legs Okay, what can I just go all the way around it. I'm just gonna give it a little bit of a rounded corner Okay That's up, what coming in wait. Let me help you I got it. Oh scuse your but Allowed it used to be this table is so heavy Solid Russian oak, I don't know if you guys have ever picked up a Russian oak tree But they are very heavy So I'm going to put down the solid Russian oak table if I can have Kate assist me upon turning Australian or something I don't know what I am Alright ready. Yep here. I'll let you direct What if it flattens me don't let it flatten you I Do all that I can oh you don't have it Okay, I think look at that Solid Russian oh guys it looks so good wait this is so Do this on it, it's longer than you are it's like you know if we have guests over We could put a blanket on this that could be someone's bed there should be a guest bed guys Joey We didn't get to do a row cuddle is where you get this rug - we do a coffee table cuddle I think the solid Russian dog can handle all of our You know it's not as cozy them being honest. It's a little hard We were you oh Thank you so emotional Alright so the wall has dried. It's got two nice coats on it, so we're putting the metal Surrounds for the bookshelves back in and we are putting the original hutch back in because we like that piece I wanted to keep that one wood tone because it is a bit lighter than what the shelves were let's pull this wall together shall we white show white shows From which way so the idea with this is we have a couple different wood tones in here What are we putting this bad boy in here this YouTube what a million black? But don't you think we should put the YouTube plaque over there up top of course we have to place our 1 million YouTube subscribers And we're so proud of it So of course you want to put it up on the top shelf Where the light from the sconce can shine down on it? And we can really show that off and also just appreciate it every day and appreciate you guys every day And then I kind of like the idea of doing her Over here like she's like looking. She's like damn You ways did that a million subscribers? Oh, what's on TV. You know and then I'll put like plants around and stuff, so she's like not like super creepy Just like a little creepy like peeking creepy, okay So I really wanted to bring some plants over on the shelves I love nothing more than plants against black and white it Just is such a beautiful contrast So I'm placing the two really long post those plants on the top shelves and then I'm placing various decor items like vases and just Objects and you guys know I love crystals and just really bringing in a layered look This wall is awesome this wall so but I'm so happy with it It's like a perfect combo kind of chic but vintage Eclectic so because we have the barrel ceiling and we've created the symmetry with the shelves we need something over the TV which obviously When we moved in we did three animal heads Then we took down two of them and just had The Rhino so question is are we put in Old Faithful backup so since we're ready to revamp We have some other options beside the rhinoceros, but let's try him I feel like he might be a little too much now Let's just see I mean he looks pretty grand you want to take a photo you can show me He'll Work it Rhino the Rhino is freaking cool. Like I like him I could do that Rhino work, you are showing me a whole new glow our new number two is this macrame Since she was shining. I like that It's asymmetrical because we have so much symmetry with the shells kind of nice having that it's pretty boho I'm not really feeling the yarn thing. It's like a little too bohemian Yarny, I don't know I don't know I'm just not really feeling that and I think it's just a little too flimsy Because those shelves are so heavy and anchored it. Just looks a little too airy We need something a little bit heavier, so not feeling this one Finally option number three big Susie the clock Big Susie this clock is pretty dope it's like a minimalist, but like sturdy bold Young cousin curious I take the photo oh that is chic, that's Come on Joey hold it up there big Susie isn't that heavy my fall into the TV, okay, okay? I mean probably big Susie right. We've had Rhino We've had Rhino big Susie's super. Chic it has the black background big Susie Great, I mean whatever you're just putting one nail up there everything Changes all the years. Oh, you'll heart is the fever faded black six inches for big Susie In me her and he still dwells Yeah Well looks great big Suzy you Rockin because the shelves have so much going on. I really want to simplify So I found this rad slice of a crystal And it comes like a stand and the stand was the perfect height for this alcove over by the window we wanted to simplify again And I just wanted to do two larger plants in some nice simple planters They're white with a little bit of wood And I think that just highlights the curtains that we have going on which again are the curtains that we've hung For years ago the velvet curtains on the outside, and then the linen sheers that hang on the inside And it's very complementary to the busyness. That's then going over on the shelves we only want one moment of busyness and Placing a gold toned metal basket in the corner by the couch and then placing this Really cozy throw blanket that has like tassels on the end because I love having a throw blanket nearby when we're on the couch Watching a movie or something and you want to get cozy under a throw blanket, it is a must Alright, final pieces So these go like yeah, and then the little side table. Let's do it for this chair alright so in this living room We're gonna continue with the same layout the same conversation area we had those older chairs It was a thrift store chair and a vintage chair that we got recovered so they were obviously Mismatched in our talks about what kind of style we wanted to do we both really wanted to kind of simplify and streamline So in an effort to make sure that happened I chose two matching accent chairs love it! take a seat yeah, Can I get you some thing? How cool is this detailing? Because these two chairs are matching I want to kind of throw them off a little bit and give one of them a side table It's ceramic. There's some cool like black designs on it. It's just a really cool look next to this very composed looking chair cool so You didn't get the ones that touch either. I'm telling you this is it's an epidemic. They do not respect the people with Short femurs They don't respect smalls oh My knight in shining poof Thank you sir No, but these chairs are so gorgeous.  We're just kind of like refining the design These are definitely way more mid-century in line right yeah, but we're super eclectic in here We have like the industrial shelving. We've got the mid-century chairs My favorite thing is this coffee table like that. Oh, my gosh this was Such a good idea. I give credit. When credit is deserved. It was all your idea You were like well actually It was like your inkling you were like what if we use a dining table as a coffee table, and I was like approved Giving credit, where deserve guys there's no place like home? I'm clicking my millennial pink Sneaky's together, and it's not taking me anywhere because guess what I am home And I gave you credit, I gave you credit for the coffee table I think it looks really think I'm not feeling like I'm getting the credit. I really go partial at better today The wall looks amazing I picked out the perfect color It's such an evolution of style from four years ago Yeah, I think that we I love that we were able to let the four years of our life in this house Inform the design like it's rare that I get to do that you know a lot of times I'm decorating for people that are just moving in so it's like making a room that they like Want the room to look like but then sometimes the functionality of things changes the design so I feel like We're fully Functional now with the biggest coffee table you've ever seen in your life. Oh now that that is no longer our dining table That means we got two Dining room yep Because you're gonna see the dining room And thank you guys so much for watching always we love you Remember stay creative see wonderful stay weird and we'll see you on the next Episode love you create weirdo so much 2018 rah rah rah Oh It's so echo in here no rug down whoa Right so this will anchor the wall, and then we have our house is a Copy right if I change the lyrics.

[Music] hey everybody welcome another DIY and this one is something I like to do all the time which is sprucing up something in your own closet right it's great to reimagine the things you already own it's sustainable it's budget-friendly it means you got to go out and buy a ton of new shoes all the time so this is a really cool DIY guitar strap that we are using as a purse strap or a camera strap I love the idea of having a cute strap that actually acts as an accessory anyways if you like me and you like this video please give it a thumbs up and also subscribe because we want you as part of our creative weirdo family all right cool so let's get into the tutorial by the way I have a cold sorry I sound like Foghorn but bear with me the supplies for the ciy are minimal you'll need your camera or purse on hand a guitar strap the which can be one with a pattern like the one we used or it could be a plain one and you can make up your own pattern and you'll also need some round carabiners or you could also use some brass key rings sew-on rhinestones which I prefer the ones in the silver settings I just think they're prettier and a needle and thread first lend your layout on your strap you can let the pattern dictate where to place the stones or you can make up your own pattern we really liked how the marquise cut stones look like petals over the existing petals in the pattern now it's time to get to sewing you're just going to thread the needle through the strap and then through one of the holes in the rhinestone setting and then back through the guitar strap and up over on the other side of the rhinestones and then we on to the next one etc etc yes my party people this DIY requires some actual sewing so pull yourself up to a good YouTube binge and get ready a thimble may also help depending on how sick the fabric is on your strap because blood really isn't in this year be careful of those digits keep in mind you only need to sew the rhinestones on one side of the strap because you won't want them rubbing on your shoulder when you wear the bag or camera however we did put rhinestones a little way up on the underside near the clip so you could see them from the back oh my gosh I love it's so pretty I love how it's like a beautiful 3d accent to the pattern and I mean come on anything is better with length am i right now attach your strap to your camera or your bag using the hinge carabiners or the big key rings I like the carabiners because they're easy to detach so I can use it on multiple items and tada I am ready to rock my new guitar strap [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so rocker chic right I love that I love that I can change it out put it on whatever purse or camera I'm using at the moment so I hope that you guys love this video of course subscribe and comment and let me know what you think and also I really want to see what you do post your pictures with hashtag mr. key and I will see you in the next video we're decorating your blog or oh my gosh we're doing something day for you guys and it's so much fun so thanks so much for watching all the time I love you love mr. gates [Music]

it's natural like it's not something to be ashamed of okay telling me what I should or should not be team down with this contraption he's gonna be able to have three different color backgrounds to shoot on he's gonna be able to lower them and raise them so he can shoot whatever color whatever mood he's feeling that day we leave it I wanted to put that you have Mineola balance you can convert any straight rod into a bent rod storage the closet in this room is just not functional for Patrick as it so we need to change that I think that those doors are just not functional because I really want to give Patrick drawer storage [Music] what we did with this closet is we painted it a solid bright pink in the background so we really want to make a pop and then we put in this custom organization system which fits perfectly it looks great a lot of drawers yeah well he needs a lot of storage and beauty products Joey hair oh are you obsessed with this pink color setting yes wait I just have to touch something oh just great okay I don't want that one believe that you pink is your favorite color can I be one nail I'm gonna get all over the closet well don't do that well if I do it's your fault no it's your fault because you're not an experienced dry clean can you hit me another drawer [Music] it's almost went to my eyeball hey oh my god and all the other than that drawer that was amazing is like a magic tray that was like some very Poppins right there you drop the screws they landed in the drawer finger hats [Music] so with this new organization system we are gonna add some custom knobs and some custom labels we're just gonna drill some holes much better than storing stuff in cardboard boxes on the floor a lot of IKEA furniture comes pretty plain and you know I love an Ikea half the hack is really where we're establishing the style and the way that we're doing that is using these really cool brass poles they're brass poles with labels built in and they're small so those are perfect for the small side drawers but I didn't want to give Patrick a center pull tab for the long drawers on longer drawers it's way easier to have two handles on either side to pull the drawer in and out so I thought huh perfect opportunity for some beautiful handles so I got the labels on Amazon and I hit up anthropology for some beautiful knob and I love the ones that move like these poles they have a mechanism a hinge mechanism on them which just really looks vintage so let's bring out a big rug to anchor this space we're pulling off the clouds arap and revealing gorgeous yellow this is a statement sofa got something for you that's the way yeah [Music] I found this amazing glass top adjustable coffee table you press on this button and it raises up the table height another great convertible option is this rolling bar cart that's kind of acting as a side table I'm placing some more beautiful storage containers [Music] and then I'm also styling with some very select items these are just elements to establish the tone I got these different shapes glass vases from Amazon and I also got colorful beads in the wider center area of the closet were specifically positioning the shelves so that we have a nice gap he has a line of nail polish and he had these awesome images nail polish bottles so we had those custom framed a mirror on the wall is essential of course he's a beauty guru after all he may just want to check himself out fix his turban or his wig whatever he's wearing that day [Music] oh yeah so the time has come okay one two three [Music] [Music] look at those huge background oh my gosh you guys kill me this is so good this is I'm coming for this rug is it it is amazing there's every colors yellow oh my god oh my gosh and these chairs swivel these are authentic chairs no 60s of tulip chairs so you can move these around and sitting up for your tutorial or actually did a really good job with our [Music] we have to go a little thin taken in over here on the your other stand step on that puddle so you just stopped and then you left in case you wanted to do a standing you can use one of those chairs because there are table height and this is functional yeah this is functional and colorful I give you take it off right until cute I was like these are so cute I know the discreet yeah it's me Peter and calm I'm just hanging out here -

coming over open up we're here okay you're yelling like so loud welcome to oMG we're coming over you guys have been dying for more episodes and we've been dying to bring you them they are really involved in hard for us to do so let's go toddy Westbrook glam life guru oh my oh my gosh she uploads five days a week so we are really honored to be doing her beauty studio room where she's gonna shoot she's gonna take meetings she's gonna edit her videos like she's literally gonna spend a foeman hour so many things do so important we gotta go so let's go yes I worship oh wait what hey guys I'm talk to you my youtube channel is glam life guru it's pretty self-explanatory I do a lot of makeup tutorials Beauty reviews I try on product do first impressions that's kind of my thing and I've been making videos for six years we recently bought a home it's my first home it's like the pride and joy of my life and I wanted to make my beauty office beauty studio does the whole room be really really special and truly honored that toddy asked Joey and I to come cuz hey this is her first home be she is a beauty guru who uploads five days a week so it better be good got my unicorn rosin and I am ready to be created weirdo in this giant empty space this room has to be glamorous quintessential things about glamour is obviously not going to overboard with a color palette it's one big giant room she needs to shoot videos in their office space to be able to edit her videos she runs her business with James her husband just like Joey and I work together it was just a shell of a room there were no built-ins there was nothing it was just our collective imagination to put the room together spoke to them about the importance of makeup storage you guys remember Patrick Starr's beauty room and how we put in that big closet system it was a modular closet system since audiotapes bought this house we all thought that it means sense to do a custom built-in using a custom closet company to really make the built-in work perfectly to the size of the space give Tottie's depth of drawers that you can fit as much makeup as possible we went to the showroom we picked out the finishes picked out how things were going to be lit it was a whole process we made it to the showroom I definitely want wait yeah this one right oh this one is the smoother and yeah it's like a baked on almost like an animal feel sort of like you but this is the overhead right so this is the corner shoe shoe yeah we have this nailed down the dimensions the design we know we're gonna do those custom slim drawers and we're gonna do a ton of them here on the makeup side I'm so happy with all of things that we picked a beautiful white finish the glass shells the super thin drawers it's gonna be so chic it's gonna be like a custom piece ever you just have to now get what is on paper into the room the room on the wall the built-ins are done they look gorgeous but the room is empty it's in need of a lot of TLC Wow thing like ever so many drawers so many hard I'm so happy I've been waiting for this I feel like my whole life you officially have the most epic totally beauty storage system I think I've ever seen because not only is it gonna be vewy search was gonna be like fashion storage - which is so cool it's like you look a boutique in your home I know the function of this space is mainly beauty I wanna hang out here I want to you know bring people to my girl cave and like have this be a special kind of you know chill-out zone where I spend a lot of my time yeah get inspired and like some working happening back here or some editing maybe stuff like that I need a little space to kind of you know get those five-day-a-week videos please I know how long have you been releasing five days a week three years who have you missed anything like over holidays I've missed here and there but we've been pretty smooth sailing but I'm hoping to be more organized that's been a really big goal because right now I literally have makeup and boxes and bins and I try to stay really inspired and just feel like I could be so much more creative and I could raise the bar if I had everything in the right spot where it made sense all right well obviously this was a massive undertaking getting this closet in I mean having a custom built in in a home that you own like make so much sense you know I wanted it to not just be a temporary thing this is our first home by the way congratulations on your marriage it's amazing it's been a big year so this is like the icing on the cake ya know no pressure so here's what I've been getting that done this was the undertaking right we got it in now we have a day to do all this yeah this is a big space why we brought something so big you're doing first you're the double-wide I don't really know how to do this kind of stuff so I'm trusting them I mean I I definitely wanted some experts to make the space just right so what are we doing first oh that's plants you suppose have this planned up sort of bringing the vibes of the project is to come in this room we're gonna jump off with a really cool DIY come over here Tati are you ready I'm ready oh yeah girl drop it like it's hot the first time ever in OMG we're coming over history we are not painting a wall I know you can fall on over like you fell over fall no no I don't know Kay I love the way it blends in really nicely with the built-in I totally think I know what we're doing it we're gonna do really artistic like body painting we have to do an art project of course because I want Tati to get our hands dirty but her stamp on this space well this room is really big but you don't actually have like huge blank walls you just have this one and this one there so we want to create areas right and art is a great way to kind of designate spaces and obviously bring the eye up you know I love my DIYs meet to you I really wanted to do something obviously that speaks to her profession as a makeup artist as a makeup guru and the brushes that she uses are very important my god it is this is the coolest isn't it cute so if they make up application brushes blueprint we just hand sketched the brushes scan them in used illustrator laid them out on like a graph paper setup and wrote the names of the brushes and I put in like little measurement and then you just go to like a FedEx or any copy shop and just print on the blue print printers so we printed the biggest size possible in the blue ink the piece that we are going to decoupage on a canvas so this is our decoupage glue it's like a white glue but I have some water in this tray before we put a bunch of blood I can measure the frame really quickly three feet it's not probably 3d box glue on I'm gonna mark the wood so you know where to cut we're gonna use a wood canvas instead of a canvas because it's more sturdy and I really want this artwork to hold up rame it out with a custom wood frame that Joey is building we're just painting a layer of decoupage glue on to the wood and then laying down the piece over top it will wrinkle a little bit and it makes it look a little more aged are you ready for how do you help you cut because we're done with our first layer of glue yeah sure I'm ready for my new it yeah so your cut is going to be three three quarters of an inch all right you know get off that easy Tati you got a saw I kind of got like an old soul it's not that good sorry I hope you're ready to work your biceps this is a whole brand new thing for me and I didn't chip a nail so [Music] [Applause] let's see how these fit together now are you done no we're done with the first joint hey Julie seeing these you all cut you can stay at all so I brought some different stain colors to choose from and talk to you chose the ebony color which I'm really glad that she did because I think black and white together is just quintessentially glamorous super classic combinations that will never go out of style I'm definitely playing with a lot of black and white in this room Joey are you do we have a fourth piece um that better be a really important email it's not he's playing candy crush justine in the inside of the wood for a word not this is the side of the wood you definitely need to see in the side of the wood sir oh yeah I'm sorry you have to be a part of this argument dodgy place can't wait let me come here I come here I come here I come nope not with the opener is that on the cheek so four pieces done great then we'll let this dry Joey we'll just nail them together I'm over this well it's good be alright this may be all that you're gonna do with that I'm being banished you've donned glove held a saw now it's time to get out oh wait no but before we banish you I want to give you a sneak peek of what I'm gonna be up to while you're up doing something with your brushes right Kajal oh my gosh look at it actually is like a fan brush you could do like foundation really fast it's like one that's on the things got me well we have so much to do so much to do to three once you get up off the floor fingers crossed she's gonna do something great but I've been kicked out so I gotta like hand the trust over and just go do my own thing and wait for the big reveal no biggie alright so now that Tati is gone we have a lot to do we have basically three separate areas we have to decorate I wanted to give talk to a feature wall built in is really symmetrical and beautiful and angular I wanted something that had a little more movement to it I love the idea of using these paintbrushes that are shaped like makeup brushes [Music] so these are brush blots we're gonna call it a brush blot wall and I'm using a really dark charcoal grey which will need like black but not be like so harsh against the white [Music] [Applause] so I'm painting the brush blot wall Joey is hanging the curtains we got these awesome blackout curtains that are a light color on the inside but they also will totally block out the light so that way when they need to shoot they're not competing with the sunlight and their beautiful gray silk curtains because silk curtains are so glamorous very luxe I mean this whole giant window slash door thing to have going on here it's very cool so we're just highlighting that by putting up a high curtain rod draping that down so in this big area we are going to put down a giant rug first gonna put the rug pad down which basically will stop the rug from sliding around then we'll roll out the rug no we were using my wall oh it's so cute there are paint splotches brush what it's so cute thank you well this function of sound absorbers when you're shooting in a big room you don't want it to echo so a rug is really important same with any textile in the room to kind of have the space you think this where I was going to make it all the way to the end oh yeah that's it work well we're just gonna have to turn down work Pat Joey done it a million times oh it's a fart tube Joey let go of it I'm trying to distribute such a big room I have to talk to you through to is an event it has said to me man I cannot do that Joey you're gonna pass out it's so big we can like spread out and hold him like a king size rug my flowers it's filled with nothing when I was in middle school I had like tiny didgeridoo I would just sit in my room and practice circular breathing I don't think I ever actually got it down the concept is you keep air in your mouth so while you're blowing out you can breathe into your nose like the hard part is refilling your mouth but you get it no one else is filled with nothing these shelves Joey enough with the rug cut all we got to style the shop this is the most epic styling I've ever done you guys I literally would wake up at night before this project being like do I have enough stuff to put in those shelves we are bringing in shoes hearses we are bringing in clothes sunglasses jewelry makeup displays coffee table books which they're not going on the coffee table they are beautiful hardcover art books of hair and makeup and fashion and all the things that will inspire talk to you and just really speak to her sophistication because books are sophisticated and I hope they never go away shout out to books blue and white China I love using an interior design I don't get to use it that often because it is a very distinct look the blue and white which you see in the blueprint art and in the China accents is just soft and sophisticated so in order to give her an area to film on we are bringing in this amazing desk the Joey put together this is going to be her filming tables how gorgeous is this chair how is this it has a beautiful light wood top and the wood is a very similar tone to the floors that are already in the space and the legs are these just very simple but really gorgeous brass solid looking legs that just kind of fit into the tabletop like it looks like a puzzle piece the bench we're bringing in for talk to you to sit on while filming is this awesome free bench I love free things it has a very glamorous look to it and it has acrylic legs which are really really nice next to the solid brass legs of the desk so just playing with pinckney juxtaposition so sit here with the light streaming in here yes do her tutorials and then she doesn't have a back yeah in the shot you know yep and then when she is collab yeah right people sitting next to her yeah great thinking key so ingenious Kate custom artwork you know I love and the same wood custom photography it's really nice to have things that are your own unique pieces I didn't want to just go and buy black-and-white photography for Tati I took it upon myself I'm not a photographer no no I'm a novice that was like you know what I've got a bunch of nail polish and mirrors and fume bottles and stuff let me just try taking pictures of these against a white background I'm using a nice camera with a 15 millimeter lens and let's just see how it goes Joey is going to arrange these in a cluster and hang them because he's really good at both of those things [Applause] you the living-room area I mean I'm calling it the living room area it's basically the meeting room area because they have a living room we're being in a rug rug number two we don't need a rug plat for this because we're putting so much furniture over it it's gonna be weighted down away whoa oh sure that's about kozaczek it no no Joey we're not doing the rug cuddle here no in the seating area we're gonna bring in a very cool Chesterfield tufted couch I love this couch it's nice and deep so if we can get it through the door we're good oh good job I think that maybe was the hardest thing I've ever done in my life okay that's why we've been doing squats at the gym so you can get better at lifting couches with me there's nothing more classic and glamorous than a Chesterfield couches that have like the flat back and the flat arms and are tufted on the back Chesterfield Wow looks very cozy isn't that pretty very pretty because like this is like her studio so she might want to come in here and just have like a peaceful moment read a book watch some other people's YouTube video go rock you know Joey this coffee people is so amazing coffee table it's sort of a patchwork of different marble colors different stone colors complimentary to the rugs but also is its own art piece for my next trick I will produce a fiddly fig we're putting a fiddly fig in the corner this tree has to look good all the time I'm going for a faux plant next to the couch I'm placing a round marble accent table with a pretty brass lamp again it's very architectural kind of simple because this wall has so much pizazz you didn't need a crazy lamp just something to accent Taji is very feminine and women li but I love the grounding color of black it's very glamorous and these chairs are just amazing and they have brass legs look in between these two chairs I'm placing another blue and white China moment a drum stool for bringing the blue and white theme that's happening over on the shelve over to the living room area some furry pillows complete these black chairs a little black tone on tone of the black shirt fabric being a little more shiny and then the furry cozy pillows okay so on this wall we got these two crazy sturdy awesome desks right because she's going to have her assistant any whoever might be working with her on a project she might have people in for meetings we need a place for them to be able to sit in here pull up a chair no wonder I wonder I Drive oh these cheers you guys oh my gosh she's glam like food I am NOT getting her just a regular old desk chair no no their gold upstairs okay well we do this backwards oh we have to put the brush diagram oh no I got to finish baking that yes baking in the Sun right now blueprint is gonna go centered over this yeah can you like at least stifle Leon that was like the opposite of a stifle build off the frame I'm gonna put that right above and center it over those two desks and that's gonna just be a really cool feature art piece that you're gonna see when you come in on the wall next to the blueprint art we are hanging wall lamps which I love wall lamps because it gives you the flexibility of getting a sconce look without having wiring in the walls the kitchenette area is really cool we've got retro fridge on the countertop when we were first here talk to you mentioned that you wanted a candy bar and that's stuck in my head the word fizz just reminds me of like old school soda pop and so does a candy bar so I just love that that's our little like retro vintage corner so apothecary jars with some candy completes a candy bar on the desk I'm just dialing some desk calendars some more blue and white in a tray and a little cup which I'm using as a pen cup and then just some other things like an amazing cement tape dispenser scissors of gold stapler etc for the styling on her filming table I'm keeping it very minimal because of course it is going to fill up with all of her products that she's using guys I think the room is done I'm excited let's bring her in and James juice gotta see it he's gonna work in there and be filming adjusting focus and all that stuff you better like it too Kate's leading me and my eyes are trying to just focus on the ground because I

I have been wanting to do this for three years oh yes you can even turn it on because it's unplugged Oh Kate's a tool she's my small tool so it's acceptable we using the same small jackhammer to jackhammer Jack ham the jackhammer in the tiles the kitchen is already looking beautifully destroyed the countertops are gone which you can see by wood underneath floors are pretty much all ripped up I'm going to go at them with my hammer really excited to get that orange off the ground I really want to make this a more neutral light beautiful kitchen we're taking the countertops off we're taking all the tile off the ground all the top the backsplash and we're going to replace all of that we're not removing this subfloor right no it's a subfloor yeah but I mean they put this over the old linoleum this is how you can tell an old house there's a subfloor but then underneath that subfloor is old linoleum tile this is in fine condition we'd have to redo basically the exact same thing redo all the floorboards the only bummer about having the raised floor is we have those little ramps up from the dining room I think it's fun does that mean have to do the baseboards everything and this is exactly we have to put down anyways under our tile this is another big moment I'm so excited to be rid of this moldy oh you got it wait no what I can't do this what do you mean can you go like this Lois slow your worm ever slower slow one okay stop wait okay next up I'm really not helping we care little crazy floors for renovation jokes so the plan in the bathroom is right now it's got two doors entering it we don't really need that because the guest bedroom can use our guest bathroom so we're gonna seal this door and replace this single ugly vanity with a beautiful double vanity this is gonna go to a salvage yard for someone else to find it and hopefully paint over that green color okay you're pushing you're pushing see your new president oh my gosh oh why do you mean why you know

testing on the shower ah there is a rubber lining that lines the perimeter of the door which is meant to keep in water pretty sure not necessarily to keep in sound if you like the goal how the edge : what is it it's not really no it's not mommy I don't actually like getting human in here let's go find uncle Joey all right so this is the kitchen the bathroom and the kitchen are done I saw how amazing they look and now is the big moment where we're actually having someone very important in our lives Joey's mom Sharon seeing our renovation we finished it yeah that's it see what our kitchen to look like well I know you didn't have the beautiful marble countertops not marble granite nope one porcelain whore when that's not a nice thing I don't even know what is the newest thing it's basically tile oh it's like a giant piece of tile I noticed there your sink your new whatever those are called backslash know these things yeah it's a backsplash your bridal thing Oh faucets oh yeah oh yeah I forgot oh oh oh it looks great a new cabinet you whole new cabinet front you got a front we redid the front yeah I really like the handles on them okay so Sharon's reaction it's very Sharon my mom's a very she's a very positive person but she's not the sort of super over emotional person like a Kate oh my god like that's me like she's more like a me like she sees the space she's like wow that's cool good job guys okay you got some new things and whatever those things are I don't even think she noticed what we did but that's okay it looks wonderful we did this all for you we will cook you dinner alright alright let's show you doctor yeah whenever we're going into someone else's plays and we're designing a room for them we get such big reaction so Sharon's you know subdued reaction it's very humbling reminds me of the real world no I think she likes it so the bathroom we had some tweaks oh it's much nicer than what you had before you're all we have it for you took out the door yeah you put in a new window yeah yeah it's great course it looks like you need to have somebody come watch a window but let's because we haven't done that we haven't clean there's not many pounds you're not really going you know it was alone right here and I bet I need to use the bathroom could I don't know sure about you Joey it's a I'm a guest bathroom but I want to break it in oh yes girl all right then come on Joey help cares the bathroom no Joey Sharon it doesn't matter what I get winter please be the master okay good we are gathered we let your mom use the toilet Joey apparently she wants to break in our bathroom which is so weird like we have a guest bathroom but sure mom go ahead we're sharing our design with Sharon in a very practical way everybody pees and maybe poops I have that worm spray in there one thing about the rooms bring in yet did I we got these beautiful brand-new floors in the kitchen perfect for the kids to sit down on and play this is like way too mathematical for me there's so many tiny things Kate doesn't get it I really don't know what I'm doing kids have Legos everywhere I have a feeling they're gonna be Legos in my ears by the time they leave but glad we can put the good new floors to use what is this that we're building actually don't really know I mean this is a good preparation I guess because you know me and Kate want to have a family at some point so this is a you know nice to see how the kids operate in the house we really want to get their opinion on what they wanna do with the backyard because we want to make sure that's family-friendly Jordan show okay what you're thinking about for that ride I mean I know what I want as an adult I think I know what Joey wants as a sort of adult so we might as well get the kids advice on what would be an ideal kid backyard what would you guys do for right here but something I guess but what what would if you could put anything in there what would you put in there like if you are designing it a big dinosaur that sprays out water oh yeah five guys are like a curette a deer at Bart's your ex is the meanest one it's like a machine oh is it a ride all right grab a parcel on the ride a Jurassic Park water right right there why right right here I'm down with that like a head or the whole dinosaur I think they might be a little affected by Universal Studios which is just right around the corner would you come over a lot if we built that cheer at spring water doesn't really like you know sing relaxation to me so now that we're in here what are you saying it's up to you you're designing it what everyone is make it go high in this side in a bit just then making the circle really widen go around alleys to traps and down I'll tell you have to be two right away oh yeah should we have a height limit oh yeah what say four and a half years old would like we're gonna have your old high limit okay for at four but form over I can just draw a picture of it how I want it okay yeah I'll go get a piece of paper and then draw the whole thing together perfect it's a really cute idea people do it I've watched youtube videos of people who build rollercoasters in the backyard okay well let's see how the designers are doing Engineers okay goes up and then they're roller coaster all over like this I want this thing to be a side the air like cell set goes from here to here that sprays out water Oh like you go through things that surround water yeah oh you go gravy we got to build up because they want the roller coaster to be like three levels I think we also may need to make a floating platform and we need to build a pizza shop so we got our work cut out for us Jordan wants your idea oh maybe I didn't need to learn a line oh we need to make a line to invite people say the line you want to wait in line for the right kicker that's the sign of a good ride Joey there's a line that's true in his mind a successful ride has a line right I mean that's his experience of going to theme parks and standing in line so it's gonna snake down the driveway and probably onto the sidewalk so her neighbors will love us even more than they already do from all the banging by the water right put in the garage a minute and then it goes back up and then it goes down into the water that's a good what should we call it right let's go over the name ID you're a state park well there might be copy me I'll come up with our own name trademark Jurassic world I am down to build some sort of ride in the backyard it may not be a giant roller coaster but I'm gonna figure something now so the next time they show up they have some sort of ride even if it's like a cardboard box on the skateboard that I can push around with one of the sprinklers and all their dreams will have come true so while our engineers are working on the plan for the pond ride Joey and I are taking a look at the garage we're not trying to make it a livable space but we're trying to make it at least a functional space just a nice chill area so new doors obviously do you think we can do the French doors I don't see why not and then we're gonna Jack out all the concrete yep which I kinda want to do myself we're gonna take out our driveway and replace it with pavers which will look really cool kind of play into that old English storybook house theme or going with you want a jackhammer the entire dry layers all yeah do you know how much that is oh my god why does it always be very happy no jelly I don't want to be your jackhammer no no no I really don't okay here's the thing do not pet a short person okay never Pat me on the head like I'm like a dog don't pick me up oh you're so low let me just pick you up like I am 33 years old and another thing don't use them as a human jackhammer that's something new that I'm just experiencing right now so never pick up a small alright and use them as a jackhammer we've got to finish inside in the garage like drywall paint the whole thing wait but I want to have like kind of like a meditation zone oh wow crystals you know perfect and why he's doing this away I got that at Pier one and I was 19 years old don't you deal in your meditation now I take it away we really want to unify the backyard there's a lot of old plants this house is over 90 years old so there has been a lot of random plants planted over the years the other thing we want to do back here obviously is get rid of the pond we just need to get it out of here there's all these old boulders it's gonna be quite the ordeal to get it out of here but once we get out of here well then have so much more space in our backyard we just have to tear out everything plants are expensive though we do live in California so drought tolerance is something to keep in mind are we keeping the pergola I mean I like the pergola I like the burglar so freshen up the pergola take out the pond or turn it into a Jurassic Park ride I wish the last thing is we need to paint the house yeah fine I'll stop paint ah you know what we're painting it later office we need to sand all the window frames down we need to patch the walls of the outside where we took those old bars off slap a new coat of paint on it it's going to completely transform the house so the next time you guys come and visit if there isn't a drastic part right here how are you gonna feel I guess all right well then we better get started can you help can you help us get started all right first thing you guys have to do is you have to Jack out all the concrete that's in the palms gonna get rid of it I can use a ball put it where where should I put it um in the trash yeah Trish can you remove concrete before Jordan no it it might be kind of fun actually do it yeah just start taking the rocks out of there yep the kids are so excited about this ride it's so cute they're already in the pond taking out the rocks so they're only picking up the ones that they can pick up which is actually more than I thought there were I don't know where they're finding all these rocks oh my god I can't show you down they think that they're gonna help get rid of that pond in 24 hours so I'm gonna let them realize how hard that is until they decide they want to go inside and play Legos I'm gonna feel really bad when they come back to visit us again and there is no animatronic t-rex I'm gonna do by the way DIY and animatronic to York's guys gel way and his big dreams I mean I am personally down to make our backyard a theme park okay I know that's about you because you talk about theme parks all the time talk about theme parks all the time I mean I know that that I'm carnie I like fun things all right I mean they are so exciting would be yawns I think it'd be fun to at least have a won some sort of ride so that when they come back they're not completely disappointed Joey our backyard is like a postage stamp yeah it can be a ride I can make out a PVC pipe so I can take it down and back up that doesn't sound safe anyways we're not gonna make a drastic park that is copy written trademark please universal don't come after us for this episode thanks for watching so what we're doing in and obviously we have big plans for the backyard that may or may not include a t-rex shooting water out of its mouth you'll have to stay tuned to see well probably will um big shout out to kids and their imaginations keep

Omg, we bought a house [Joey]: Kate door! [Kate]: Coming Hi! Welcome back, guys! Omg, we bought a house. We're in the backyard. [don't] be fooled. We're standing right next to a porta potti And it's kind of stinky. We haven't updated you guys in a while because we have been working on Omg We're coming over [the] stuff has been happening, and we've been vlogging all along. Haha We put out a lot of vlog footage with all the updates. We've done This is a huge moment forward you that subscribe Scribe. We're gonna get this video [to] what? Forty seven thousand two hundred [Thirty-two] likes so you so [excited] I'm so excited [this] house was like Dark tan and like bread We're going to clean it out clean it up crispy white we picked the color intermón. It's just like the slightest Gray Tone of white Ahh, oh my God the painting is going on still we were debating on painting first of doing a smooth co-star yeah, yeah, but we also decided that we're going to paint it because it's Cheaper we wanted to spend the money elsewhere. What is it? What are you doing? Ask my permission? Eyelash stop that flesh stick heading up my face   Um so look look look we've had to cover all [of] the windows With brown paper because obviously we're trying to reduce the amount of paint we're getting on the windows But it's causing our house to be a dungeon and our cats are just like freaking out; look at Winston Here's the painters on fire. [you] can't believe what's happening Since our house is vintage you guys know it was built in the 20s The garage doors are just like falling apart. We need to put in a new doors. We want to put in windows [we] love to go the salvage like vintage route when possible Now we're at the old thing and downtown L.A. They've got amazing things here. You guys have such a cool place Look at this mirror, okay? Look a big k. We need the [wind] to the rocks. [here's] a grand view I Don't know that this is the place. We're gonna find like We're going to see them in here. Goodbye ready built ready to be installed windows at your hardware store. We're going Home Vivo, we're making the decision between a gridded window and a non gridded gridded Window you're the point a series one hit lows. Let's get that one. It's a little bigger. We found a window We like you know cheap would be like it's cheap, and we can install it like this week, which we like make a muscle Suck it in Yeah Remember [the] story we went to go pick out our front door We went back to that store this huge warehouse you got these giant doors The doors Came raw wood which is great because then you can stain [it] whatever color you like There's four [of] these eight-foot doors 400 sills today is the day Goodbye ugly brown door Yeah High-five You just popped out the old doors there No, no, Joey come back back Joey Winston our child is [watching] i Think you need to go to therapy Look at that gigantic new hole we had to cut now. It's one big Panel of Windows [let's] so much light [isn't] it the ban We're adding some new stucco around [them] to just clean it all up Seal it all in I like the style of this, it's like more like old school We wanted to mimic the Pattern of the original Stucco from the 20s what we had to fill in this gap And then we're just gonna paint over it and hopefully you won't even be able to tell the difference But this looks really good all filled in. Oh my gosh, so we're doing a really cool project with our deck It looks like a mess It is a mess. We had like a weird infinity deck Just is like a sheer drop-off. So we're gonna repurpose The pergola wood so we're no longer have a wood deck under the pergola. We're gonna [use] some sort of hard scape there Yeah
We're gonna use that wood which is the same wood they built the deck out of originally and we're Gonna build Benches and inset stairs within the actual deck yeah our master bedroom doors open out onto the deck So we're gonna have an area of steps there boom boom boom I know like it's so crazy that they didn't Originally do that Over in the corner because we had kind of this angled cut on the deck [it] made a lot of sense to have that become an angled set of stairs because it really leads you straight Over to the garage area so we want a nice flow from the back deck Over to that area and this is like the [perfect] solution [we] save a ton of money would last for so long right, so it [looked] kind of crappy, but all it's Gonna Take is a sand job and some nice Stain stain and the scene we pick for the deck was a little bit of a different color Than we chose for the fence or playing with those mix wood tones. Let's go look at the stone setting process shall, we So we're gonna map out with some spray paint on the dirt Well, that's not right, okay? Well, it's rough Spray paint in the eye...are you burping you wanna get it out? just get it out, sorry you look like a pushover For our meandering path Doesn't look like much now   oh We make a gravel base or a place these really cool pavers hammer em in  so it's basically like a giant tile job So it's gonna curve around here and turn into like a path  these pavers are set really close together So there's really small cracks But then you go over it with sand and you just take a broom and you broom it in and you kind of repeat that Over the course of many days and sand just keeps settling and eventually settles until it's at the top filling in with sand has a very Lived-in look oh yeah, we're not the way for it to age Stone is like this cool. Colored Gray and we chose to do it in different shapes So we have both the square and the rectangle So it has kind of more that English storybook look to it with the peaked roofs and the texture and the cute arched windows So we wanted the pavement to be that way, too Right after the parking Pad that's obviously really wide we've gone more narrow and the first Narrowing in that little area of dirt. We're gonna do a nice little European fountain Maybe with some up light maybe check it out lights lighting is so important. I mean you guys know how important it is inside It's also really important outside like if you think of those really beautiful homes that you Hotels there's always like lights lighting up the trees and along the pathway we went to a lighting designer light Scapers my friends at lights capers, we specialize in Outdoor lighting There's [specialists] in everything We're gonna put those at the base of the trees yeah [gotta] pick out a lot of good lights Essentially the low voltage thing means that because it's using very little power you put it on a timer And it just goes on at night, and this is what we're putting on the steps Right here picking out [cookie] now So obviously on the inside of the garage we had it's so pretty it's so pretty [it] was just all raw wood before We wanted a vaulted area of our ceiling we left it raw which means That old shingles are original shingles from the 20s for some reason they [just] left those and then put the new shingles over them So underneath you can see it's like a very cool architectural detail so we decided to just paint that white and Since it was raw wood the white paint kind of came out a slightly different tone Well, it's also because there's like the oil from the original tiles are still yeah, I mean We're painting over drywall versus painting over raw wood we're gonna put our chandelier up there We haven't done the chandelier yet this ceiling is just [a] cool oh Joey thank you. Oh My gosh the floors you guys Beautiful great own floors are actually Bamboo. Which is sustainable? Eco-friendly and very durable [cuz] of course you're gonna be working out lifting weights on it Basically when you're building a home gym It's all about [space-saving] right it depends on what types of workouts you do we've been doing weight lifting I just put together these puppies power blocks. Which are like those crazy Modular dumbbells [be] saving you guys like we didn't want to get one of those huge Shelves and have every weight of every dumbbell separately yeah, so we found like the transformer of Dumbbell Which is basically like you can have like from like five pounds up to like 90 pounds in one Thing if you know anything about weights like weight rocks are big and clunky what I found is this company that actually?

people's faces all those phrases crotch heights doorbell door bye bingo I know but this is our barrier to entry I want to put an intercom system or something at that front little gate where they can like ring there and I can be talking through the intercom like hello who is it no thank you you figure out like our handles and everything and then we want to do wood trim and then we're going to do so decorative nasty with the trim looks like I mean I want a scraping beat because I wanted to be black you know it's pretty infinite without the body light that's that size it's saving dude in a poncho I feel like we're honoring the history the style of English storybooks by putting in these cute little artbeat fish ballgame yeah this is you yeah that's fine you yeah do the pink Oh so before the rain dumped on us we were able to get the wood sent in we took out that old ratty fence that was totally falling apart we now have the start of a beautiful new wood gate these needs agree they have a metal frame that secures them to the ground and then over the feet of them we have done some wood cleaning that then has been quenched when I start these look amazing I'm really excited it's higher obviously we've got a big gap underneath there right now but that's because we have a mud pit beneath it and we're going to be putting in concrete and stuff like that so that will come up and fill in that gap a bit more so it'll be just a couple inches off the ground it'll be able to swing but it'll be nice and secure we're also going to go in and do some nice trim on the outside make them look beautiful these are custom handmade gate we're going to get handles and things and then we'll put on spring hinges so that they stay yeah we think is really going to help the plastic all right so the goal is to get that driveway concrete out of there and then like within a day pour the concrete for the front driveway but since it started pouring we put plastic down on the front to try to like somehow try to keep the water off of it because it's never going to drive we don't cover it up but isn't that going to keep it wet and I'm going to keep the moisture in well now the sun's coming out

[Music] hello everybody.welcome oh my gosh I am in like a creative Wonderland right now you guys this is Sofia's house it's a cottage it's yellow it's so cute you guys don't ya feeling free huh I am feeling so free today we're going to do a DIY standoff frame slash whiteboard yes we are playing with flashes because we like versatility don't we so most important thing you will need is a piece of acrylic you could also call it plexiglass you could get it at a frame store or at your local big box hardware store you guys may remember in office bowls we have a giant piece of it in the booth booth groom that we use as a whiteboard that's what this is we have this larger piece which we are going to use this mr. Kate full year 2017 calendar inside of over here we also have the stand off and they just screw off so basically you through one part to the wall it stands off about an inch and then you will stand with the acrylic in between we also have a drill here and a plastic slash acrylic drill bit so the other things I have here is a ruler and a marker to mark where I'm going to drill through for the standoffs and if you guys are curious this calendar is for sale on the mister heat shop and what's gonna be so awesome is you can draw on it with dry erase markers so once this is sandwich in the acrylic I can mark all over it and play on my ear that's all we need for the supplies before we get into the eye though subscribe guys we are really really getting up there oh my gosh almost a hashtag mr. Caitlyn million thank you all if you're not yet subscribed join the creative group all right look good yeah I would advise having whatever print or calendar or artwork of any kind a planted sandwich in your acrylic near-by because you want to lay it down and mark where you're going to put the standoffs because you don't want the standoff to overlap over whatever piece of art you have in here this piece of acrylic is bigger on all edges something that you can decide if you want less acrylic but you should definitely make sure that it is at least a little bit bigger than whatever you're going to put inside so that you don't have any edges of the paper hanging out on the side that's nice we are going to sandwich this piece of paper between two of the exact same size pieces of acrylic so let me take my little tool here that so maybe like an inch and a half in and an inch and a half down on that side now I'm gonna just draw this line mm-hmm geometry don't sleep we're good at it there we go okay so now right here at the little crisscross is where I'm gonna drill and I now need to do that to all four corners of this piece let's figure what the front of you guys is all the supplies really aren't that pricey like they really don't break the bank so it's totally worth it and once you have like the drill bit you can make so many of these [Music] alright guys so now it is time to drill through our marking here I've got my drill bit already I'm also leaving the protective covering on the acrylic it's on both sides and that's just going to help the trick not splinter and I also have a nice thick piece of scrap wood under here which is essential because when we drill through the acrylic you'll want to hit something protective and especially cuz I'm drilling here on the assignor table which I did after it's okay to go on your tail alright okay great let's do it sounds like a pin wood all right so I want to make sure that the hole is nicely drilled through because as you can see the standoff screw is real big so that needs to fit through and it does alright great so I'm going to continue doing that to all four corners of this four feet [Music] okay I'm done with the holes on this first piece and I'm taking the second piece that I haven't drilled in yet and sliding it behind lining it up so that I can mark exactly where I'm going to drill and know that the holes on the first piece are going to line up perfectly with the back piece because you want a nice even sandwich you [Music] great sneaking off piece number one and now I am going to mark the center of my little circle fold [Music] all right we've got our hole and now we get to peel off the protective coating it's very satisfying you guys oh god this is so actually harder we really can't rip it off back not like a band-aid guys like Pilates slow exhale oh my gosh here is the sandwich time it's time for this acrylic to get a delicious meal of the beautiful calendar obviously the most important thing you want to keep in mind is making sure that your print is straight how to do that I would say use your eyeball presence of the holes makes it a bit easier if you guys want to use glue dot like something clear to adhere your print to the back piece you could do that because it would be against the wall you wouldn't really see it sticking pretty well when you take the film off before I secure my sandwich together I'm going to use a lens cleaner to just make sure that all of the fingerprints are off from the inside I'm making it seem like it's a permanent thing obviously you can open them up and put new things in another cool idea guys if you wanted to have the back differentiate from the front sandwich piece you could spray pain so it looks like your print is resting against like a pop of color and then the clear piece goes over top so many options [Music] all right they are lined up now time to get these standoffs in I'm just going to stick through the screw part so that I know these are nice and secured together before I then flip it up you [Music] it looks so good let's get it on the wall so one way to do it if you can measure the space between the holes of the standoffs and then you can mark out on the wall or a fun little cheat which is what I'm going to do is before you sandwich your art you can use one of the pieces that already has the holes drilled in to just mark in the center of all those holes so that you know exactly where to drill and you know it will line up perfectly these are the facts of the standoffs and then I have these screws that fit nicely that is how these adhere to the wall you got to get your drill bit down into there all right I've got the standoff back nicely snugly mounted to the wall and then I have the front part of my sandwich here I actually used some little pieces of tape here at the corner to just keep it nice and secure obviously because I don't like the backs on and now I am going to go up onto the wall last screw tightened they look so cool you guys I really really love it I love that you can put anything you want in this type of setup a picture you could even do like press flowers or press these and of course what's also so cool about this is you can write on it right so it's about the calendar up there I can use my dry erase marker and mark in whatever I want and if you guys are interested in this calendar it has some hand-painted little cuties on there and of course all the lettering hand-drawn as well so if you want to check it out that is on our website chopped up mr. gage calm that's it for today's DIY I think it's so cool so versatile I would love to hear from you guys in the comments what you think and give us the thumbs up what else oh right subscribe you do it as a please subscribe guys we need you to be part of our hashtag mr. kate 1 million cruising this family our family of creative weirdos and I will see you on the next video in the next DIY decorating video style video whatever see ya there wha hi mr. gate 
[Music] everybody welcome we're doing a Halloween special we are doing DIY of course we get into various TV shows and then we're like oh we should dress up as those people we were really into Breaking Bad and we dressed up as Heisenberg and Jesse so we're gonna take Ragnar and lagertha and Vikings and then mr. K defy them are you putting these in my hair yes I'm gonna give me a ponytail I'm gonna do her awesome hair and we're gonna add some beauty marks let's do it Joey let's sail West shall we let's sail West we're gonna kind of piece together the costumes for both la Gazza and Ragnar using like store-bought costumes because it's kind of nice to have the base of something but then spruce it up and make it look that much cooler you guys haven't seen the show Vikings a little backstory it was around 700 or so AD and I'm gonna try to keep it mostly of the period my character is basically the king your character is basically the queen of the Vikings Viking Viking I'm gonna be giving Joey this extension cool ponytail because Ragnar has like the most amazing hair he is like a dirty blond rather than try to make Joey look blond I'm just gonna embrace his brunette and this you guys know the store-bought costumes are pretty cheesy but what's great about this is it comes with things that Joey wouldn't otherwise have in his closet I beg your pardon we're gonna cut off these sleeves and like add our own elements and some fur and stuff like that but it'll be nice to just have the base of this let's do the hair first and then we'll do the beard so I have these clip-on Brown extensions which I actually already had because we've used them on some of our models and their look book videos so this is perfect well actually it's a little more reddish so this is real hair and this is synthetic this is just this like ponytail this is a real hair like real Cuban here yeah Oh Joey it was from a deaf person what's cool about these they come with the two clips so I'm just gonna add as much hair to the back here and then kind of try to cover it up with this [Applause] [Music] you're gonna probably put goop in my sides I'll put Bhuvan inside oh yes Joey oh alright so I think we're done with the extensions and now it's just a matter trying to kind of conceal them with his hair and then also kind of train all of this back and start doing the ponytail he had this really cool like stacked ponytail that was like wrapped periodically with like leather so I have this fabric here that's just like a faux suede a micro suede I started cutting strips so just finish cutting this strip yep right here yeah right here no notice no real Viking tools okay go ahead here here's the first one but but I need it to look like this okay got it yep what the hell am I supposed to do with this I'm gonna flog you look at mine and look at Joey's okay someone's coming up short oh my god what you are a caveman we're not trying to be caveman okay I'm just gonna do little I'll do it I'll do better please you got it you heard it here better right here for Mom these are just hair pins Brown like hair pins and bobby pin i'ma Ragnar lothbrok okay so now here's the hard part ride he has the ball you know Diddy's try to get these little ugly things just in to this mess I think I'm going to like braid it flash twist it I'll start by twisting it in the good thing is Joey already has some pomade in his hair so it's helping them kind of feel a little bit sticky so now I'm just braiding the length of these extensions I'm going to take some elastics and just kind of get it tethered together and then I'm going to take these beautiful strips that we cut and conceal the elastic cluster ponytail ah you can see how messy these braids are and that is purposeful because I am doing a warrior's hair I'm gonna look like a badass keyboard player I don't want to use elastics down anywhere where it's going to be visible because obviously in Viking times they didn't have tiny plastic elastics you look like a dothraki from Game of Thrones okay so Ragnar has like a full long beer so I got these real hair beards but oh this is real that is so gross like from someone's beard it might be pubic hair that is dscussion Joey that's why it looks realistic okay governing from someone's head let me tell them three years it's not totally long enough and like full enough so I got two of them and the plan is put one on his chin and then kind of like cut up the other one and sort of like yeah no no good I love it all Joey some women have mustaches yeah not mine so this is spirit gum that you want to do like a layer let it dry and that seals the pores because oil and sweat lifts it so do one layer let it dry and then to another layer how do I get it off uh burns and Diet uh well it goes up there I'm enough of them here because Ragnar has like sideburns he's just like a hairy Viking man alright so letting this coat dry and then we're gonna do another coat and let that get kind of tacky and then apply the chin Bob all right so you definitely look like but now I'm going to just go over this netting here with more spirit gum alright so I think what I'm going to do is cut this second one in half and just kind of like build this way and then once they're on we can trim and then any of the trimmings I'll use is like little sideburn no finish for us to get off yep girl look like Abraham Lincoln huh I'm going to trim the beard now try to blend it anymore and then I'm going to use some of the trimmings to add to the side of his face and like the sideburns kind of like disguise the netting a little bit so I'm adding a little bronzer onto the beer to just warm it up slightly since it's so black yeah Wow I love it looks very real how I shave all right so next let's add some of the tattoos on your neck of course we're gonna use some mr. gay beauty marks and these are the original ah I have Bangladeshi hair in my nose you look so real oh my god okay well it's my turn ready okay well I need to do my hair first let me do it hmm how do you what do you mean what is that accent I Lochner la roque I will prove my love to you by building you a shield that was good yo booyah shield I will fill to this you I'm like the ballet girl yeah the Mitchell uh uh yeah thank you I must be missing me get out of here lava thaw has some of the coolest hairdos I've ever seen and her signature look our side braids with a wavy texture that's half-up half-down and that is the look that I'm going to do today I have a lot of hair but hers is warrior wild so I'm adding some clip-in extensions for extra body I'm not putting any extensions on the side of my head because that is where the warrior braids will go and that's hairspray in my I but I am a warrior I must go on for the side grades I'm using the end of a teasing comb to get a nice clean slice of hair and I'm doing a Dutch braid starting at my hairline and gathering hair as I go straight back just above my ear then I'm braiding down the length of my hair just behind my ear but I'm not gathering anymore as I go because I want this to stay a small accent braid I'm cutting this round shape for the shield out of a thin piece of plywood I'm using the circle cutting jig attachment from the jig saw to get a perfect circle [Music] near the bottom of the braid I'm gathering the two outer pieces and holding on to the middle piece as I push up the two outer pieces up the length of the center piece and this creates a snake braid you can continue braiding down the length of your hair to hold it in place I'm teasing the end of my hair to keep the braid from unraveling or you can also use a piece of raffia straw to tie off the braid I'm also doing a twist using a piece of chain by simply wrapping the chain around the top of the hair dividing it into two pieces which I twist away from each other while also simultaneously twisting them together and then just securing the whole thing at the bottom now I'm painting it with laga tha's signature blue color using regular latex paint and adding details with black paint on the back on a strap for laga tha's arm using strong black tape to the top of my head I'm piling some teased hair to create a raised bun and securing it with hairpin now I'm adding some decorative braids across the top to make it look that much more complex and these are more snake braids that I secured with some smaller bobby pins I got you something ah this is my shoot I am shieldmaiden anymore a shield made in baguette ah this is the huntsmen store-bought costume but it came with these weird things like there was like a neck and sleeves let's talk about how we're gonna augment these

hey guys I wanted to record an intro for the vlog that you're about to see because it's different but it is something that has been highly requested from a lot of you just various snapchats and all that stuff the theme that's sort of running throughout this vlog is like how I take care of myself whether it be like mental health or beauty hair makeup you kind of stop it I'm getting a facial I'm getting a blowout I'm going grocery shopping and meal planning you know the sort of like healthy eating side of life so one of the things I wanted to touch on his therapy that is a big way that I take care of myself I've been going since I was a teenager in like early high school my sister got hit by a car I mean she's fine but it was a really traumatic event for our family and I was there when happened and everything so I had like post-traumatic stress so that's why I started going to therapy and then I stayed in it because a couple years later my parents got divorced I don't know why I'm laughing it wasn't fun so that's why I stayed in therapy and now is why I was in it as a youngster and now that I'm an old ster I'm in it because I just love it I think it's so great to talk about your feelings and work through things and have a professional kind of help guide you and it's really helped me with my anxiety it's really helped me with my relationships it's really helped me with my business too I talk a lot about business now in my therapy sessions so I go once a week a question I get a lot is obviously like the affordability of therapy and I know it can be expensive but there's also affordable ways to be able to address your mental health and keep up with it and you know if you get a diagnosis which I have a diagnosis so some of my therapy is covered by insurance there's also like social workers and there's clinics and places where you can kind of pay what you can you can work with people who aren't like a psychiatrist but they're like a social worker or whatever there's just a lot of ways so if you have been thinking about it I highly recommend just trying it there's no harm in trying it and mental health is something to really prize in your life and not be ashamed of and everyone has I mean I at least I think at least I do I have anxiety and oh my gosh there's a car alarm going on what's happening being like an int I mean those people need to go to therapy hmm but yes mental health very important and mental health isn't something wrong with you you don't have anything wrong with you if you are stressed or anxious or whatever like everyone feels those feelings and if they don't then they're really lucky or their line so without further ado just enjoy huh love you guys oh and subscribe too while you're at it if you don't like me stop watching / I'm gonna have to talk about in therapy kidding all right take it away it is Sunday Joey's out of town oh yeah and I'm sunburned hi so anyways I had posted and I talked about how I had like social anxiety on snapchat because I got invited to this Nicole Richie dinner event and I don't know I mean I'm an outgoing person but I'm also like shy and being social is like it's like a thing like I have to like like gear up for it I think it's just like a matter of having to take the initiative to like set up you know different social outings that are also balanced with like home time and recuperative time so you feel like you're getting both so it's just a matter of like suppressing that like aunt that's like crawling around in your brain giving you anxiety and just like leaving making sure you feel good in your outfit so you can feel confident going hi hello being open to the experience being open to meeting new people and it ends up being okay speaking of being open to new experiences I am going to go get a facial right now at this place that Joey got a gift card for me for my birthday but Joey also got me gift cards for Drybar so that was really sweet so I'm gonna go pamper myself get a facial and then get up out and take you guys along so cute oh my God look at these chairs them hello my name is Cali Ola I'm going to be your esthetician today line up all right I'm going to get a peel that is as blueberry it's an antioxidant field and it's going to turn me red up here cause it's going to shoot me up yes I did there's probably a pepper mill yeah what the average it blueberry belly oh my god it is tingling yeah so what is up um so what you're feeling at the lactic acid in the cayenne pepper oh yeah what is the cayenne pepper dealing um so it's like working from the inside the skin it's also providing as you're explaining it surface of the skin so it's a type of extractions and it's also going to give you a very plump and firm or face that's what I need you're neutralizing the skin after the feel a chamomile mist and a high of a high allure on oh boy we moisturizer so this is like a serum too like the serum exactly it goes yeah it's really called extraction time for the blackheads Elena I have been and now we're going to do when I'm free the layer of gauze as a protective barrier for a fashion station where look like a bride or a mummy it smells like one of those like ionic yeah it's releasing ozone opening oxygen into your so there's melody smell yells our halftime yes so it's a cure skin probiotics mass and then I mix it with a bamboo for me smells like I can't eat it yeah so it smell so sweet yeah these are what are they call on tulips cool-blue soothing my skin oh it does feel good uh I'm in the bathroom at dry bar getting a good look at my face post facial and it is red what she told me it would be read from an appeal that I do love the feeling of it being so like kind of dewy and plum I have like no more death Gentile they don't exist right now and that's made so feel pretty good except I look like a shiny tomato so there's that all right guys this is my hair before oh cool what's your name oh yeah the best part the scalp massage my tie-up I'm gettin messy beachy hair there's so much hair coming out on the hairbrush right now do you guys have this problem or you shed like a baby's head worth of hair every time you wash it alright we're doing a curling iron car get those beachy waves I'm all dry oh yeah which they're pretty perfect right now but with a little product a little cow flames a nice big barrel you got there first time you've heard that all right we're getting some action what is this triple set so it's really good your body touch your body oh yeah err median time I love it never again Eric I'm gonna take pictures of my heart for his leg up for your Instagram Yeah right Instagram could be so proud of work which make you feel that but I look like a tomato for my facial so whenever my son lots of the pictures and babble about a bribe are still tomato face but God's the bountiful hair what a difference Lil Jon can make any blow out I'm done with my pampering and I'm actually going to go grocery shopping now which usually Joey and I do on Sundays sissy's not here I'm going to go poop on myself and I wasn't gonna vlog it but while I was getting my blowout done I was looking at Twitter and some lovely lady tweeted at me and said can you do more posts and stuff about your eating and some like eating ideas that are like gluten-free or vegan etc so you grocery shopping with me right now [Music] so the total bill ends up at 181 which of course doesn't sound cheap necessarily but when you think about that this is breakfast lunch dinner and snacks for two people for a week I'd say that's pretty good the only thing that like isn't part of this is like the protein powder but we don't buy it obviously every week we buy it probably like once a month I say back home my face is still like red from the facial but I put on some lipstick to try to look a little more becoming for you guys this is Velvet p9 Pierce Manning dark heart dark heart boom boom that's the color by the way I have put the groceries away I thought it might be helpful for me to lay out like a sample meal day so here it is a day's worth of eating we wake up and we have a cup of your velocity your LaMotta your  not a tea so then when I come home from the gym protein shake time now this is completely plant-based oh you forgot the fruit you know okay so very incomplete with my layout obviously our shades have like the most ingredients so handful this a little bit of fruit a scoop of this plant protein which is the plant fusion complete plant protein in the chocolate flavor it is vegan and gluten free and all kinds of awesome stuff I really like it so yeah it's been going mom I also add a scoop of this which is the green vibrance 25 billion probiotics I am big on probiotics so we'll just keep it that I also like to do a scoop of super collagen and then for liquid some nice coconut water isn't as good because is just coconut water ingredients that would be breakfast in a shake blended up yummy yum like might sometimes for just being a better image shades - FYI speaking of peanut butter let's move on to my first snap of the day maybe a nice organic apple with some organic peanut butter and then I might sit on a kombucha which has more probiotic that is snack one now moving on to one I love this Greek salad for your Jose again trying to keep in mind a whole balanced meal with grains being really important because they are what sustain your energy and you keep and make you not crave a ton of sugar which I cook sugar this is a vegetarian lunch but obviously you could have a baby in and just skip cheese so snack chew would be probably some hummus and I would try to get in a serving of veggies so I might eat the hummus with carrots or sliced celery or I would eat it with some kind of cool graham cracker obviously they are wheat flour you could totally make with the gluten-free meal by either eating them with gluten-free crackers or just no brain and eat the veggies but I just like to have the grains again sustained you're okay so this dinner that I wanted to show you guys is a dinner that Joey and I uh we eat this quite often because it's just really quick and easy and also healthy and fills us up these are the organic brown rice packets that you keep in the freezer and I love love love these I don't use a microwave we actually don't move one hmm they're not gonna be so we will heat this up in a skillet and then these are all these amazing really tasty Indian food really really great vegan or vegetarian complete meal because you have the grain in the brown rice and then you put protein in the tools and then I always love to eat Indian food with a little bit of chutney of course this does have sugar in it so I try to like go limit it a bit but I just need me some Chuck so look obviously you could do this with a salad - he wanted more veggies there are a lot of veggies like kind of in all of these so I feel like I'm getting a good serving of veggies so I usually don't have a salad with this meal I usually will just have either computer drove as well spicy pickled vegetables meaning pickles good for digestion just like a good like palate cleanser so we'll do a little side dish of that and then after dinner I crave I don't know what you guys I am sugar favor like I want like something to eat right after I'm done being like I want to like cut out the savory with some sweet so rather than eating like candy or whatever which I try not to sometimes I do I will try to eat so I usually eat like Pomerance either love or grace or cherries or whatever's in season also really love this Piketty it is after dinner and it has sweet fennel in it and cardamom and whatever and just fennel it's like sweet but you know totally sugar-free and you know I don't have any sweetener in it but it is kind of like a sweet flavor and it really helps with your digestion and it really helps cut sugar cookies so if I have this and combo with this I'm usually good and I don't want any chops I want to speak one more note about beverages so I really try to drink water obviously you saw that I have a shake in the morning I have those teas I have tea in the morning of tnen in it and I try to drink a ton of water which I'm not amazing at trust me but I'm really really trying and then in the evening dinner Joey and I always have sparkling water this barley water is a nice option because it just kind of changes up water a bit makes it feel a little more fancy you could add like a slice of lemon to it so if you guys are like soda drinkers or whatever I definitely recommend trying some sparkling water because it's so good for you the minerals are really good for you um so yea though I feel like that's probably it for this vlog probably ended right here so subscribe please hashtag mr. gate 1 million and I'll see you guys in the next vlog and comment let me know what you want to see next what more you're curious

Rumple the rough up we're doing your corner back a little bit okay so we have lived here for three years you guys saw us pull together our living room three years ago when we first moved in we put a rub down we went away on vacation and we had a terrible cat sitter she didn't suit their litter and so they were like excuse me I will use this rug for my litter box so we replaced it and I got a temporary one that I just didn't love and I've been kind of on the hunt for a new rug to really pull the living room together I love your outfit do you let your rainy day off with a rainy day see I don't like you're in the marching band I'm no meter person sure what is that right in front of the marshal the conductor that's on the train Winston there is a road coming anyway he wants to be a part of the rod cuddle time tells me you'll probably let me just roll this right over you kind of with you anyways kind of with you on a couch my side we're getting to do a rug cuddle in our own place the rug looks great it just like sort of makes the whole room that was brighter you're wringing the dopamine oh yeah the dosa me is this amazing smart device that was like developed by a genius scientist now it is a consumer device that you can use in your smart home or while you're traveling it basically keeps track of the radiation levels that you're exposed to obviously it is very detrimental to your health and it's really scary it's something I want to be aware of especially as we settle into this house and make it our home I really want to know we're in a safe environment but even scanning our environment I walked around the entire neighborhood with it you did it I also for it huh this morning in Miami on your walk green low dose rate no I have it on my top Joey red in severe dose three get to a safe area we're not red we're green look 0:08 great half of the US population lives in a nuclear shadow which is mind-boggling you see it you know smell it you know taste it you don't hear it so you don't really know when you're being exposed to it dose rates between point zero five and point zero three zero in room for hours normal variation we do to factor such as altitude naturally occurring radioactive cheers I'm trying I mean how great how great of parents are we yes wasn't lay here in compliment our parenting skills we have a cat I love the fact that our house is so smart we have so many different gadgets in this home that really just keep us informed from the air we breathe to the radiation that we're surrounded by all right well let's get the rest of this room popular yes coffeyville ok get it get the tears should we already blanket on the couch we have this really fuzzy throw blanket and it's so cozy the casters love it so much I think they think that it's like their mom I bought these velvet ones just like nice simple velvet we're gonna velvet curtain which one's the fun it's the scene this one is kind of almost like a my cloth you know African my class and I'm Laurel yes African my cloth I know it's called a virgin mud cloth for a reason it's made with fermented mud okay I don't know I mean oh we have so many beautiful tones playing together in the rub I thought it would be nice to refresh our throw pillows so these are the old pillows that we got custom me three years ago remember I this babysitter poster guy and you just made them okay can I be in this activity yeah go take your novel dwindle famila Kate wants to do stuff with pillows I might just hang out on the carpet with with it this is nice that looks great it is like too many pillows oh look now it's time to give Winston a canopy we made our coffee table which we made out of an antique mirror and we put hairpin legs on the bottom of the mirror and it basically created this giant tray mirrored coffee table which we just adore we need to restock these because they're like pancakes when we're hopefully where we got them and then we park our butts on me every night you can tell which one is yours and which one's mine mine's a little bit poofy earth [Music] so I want to know if we have radiation around us I want to know if if our house has radiation so we want to try putting the dosa meat in the garage and not believe it yard of flutter again this is the word mother nature I love you you're beautiful you're very powerful but can you please stop crying all over our backyard it never rains in LA and for some reason it is just decided to dump it all on us before we have been able to finish the process of our side yards we're going to plug it in in there oh my god hey come in no no okay no no no you can tell you know mmm good luck it took her more effort to bail at that point than to just take an extra two steps and get in the grout early whatever okay we're good the garage is perfect the dose to me is telling me we are safe we are good the house is good I'm ready for this rain to stop really do you need to rain through this past weekend Joey and I went to a door place he found it it was cific warehouse we drove like an hour to get there we are going to get a the world but it was totally worth it because there were just so many doors to choose from [Music] this is what I'm talking about you're not taking it any the door like what about this beautiful door this isn't terrible because it has the arch I'm just like the biggest fan of like Crowley's Roley how cool it if you have an arch door you guys got your bowl no I don't like that that is like I'm in like a medieval prison completely I like it if it I was like surrounded but also some square it's kind of like craftsman story both you think we found a door so we didn't buy a door frame because the existing door frame that goes with our current front door is actually in pretty good shape until why spend extra money on the frame if it doesn't work we can just pop that out and get a new one oh my god did you break it that was way too ow so I'm staining the raw wood door and I'm just using the same stain that we used on the fence and the gate and it's really easy just putting it on with a sponge and I think it's probably going to need to toast get a nice rich tone here goes nothing they just love how natural this was the thought to dark not true reddish come to yellow this is a really beautiful rich brown now we just have to figure out how to install this we're just going to measure it make sure it matches the same height width of our old door we're going to cut it down where it doesn't and get it in there are you gotta have it do you have it you got what straight meaning is it meet Marlene's work I didn't love ya they're so easy to meet what are you guys I'm all screwed in yet the door looks incredible it fits perfectly I can't believe we actually got it on there and this is like a smarty bra I wish we could get some aids brass knob as our knobs but Joey of course wants to do a smartlock I love that we use the original hinges I mean I love do we we Stan disease now these hinges are so cool I feel like these may have been their original hinges from the 20 I don't know but they're these solid brass hinges and they were painted white and we just sanded them down to reveal the metal underneath and it has a really aged look to it and I just love it I love that we didn't get a new to work right how specify newspaper I mean it will probably find out it like it is exactly fall but I love this window yeah that's good people can see in oh my gosh it's a deluge so what'd I tell you in the rain yeah nothing worse that you're talking about like what a lot Marla what

straight [Music] can't wait to decorate there's so much we can make how will it turn out oMG we back house [Music] Kait door coming you're probably like where are you guys and it's true we are not in our house today we wish we were Niles yeah we're in someone else's house and that is because as you guys know it has been raining so much here in LA and it just released out us back on our house plans we've had to hit the pause button because everything's just soggy and muddy and damp and we can't do anything with it like that so today we thought we'd do an extra special episode we never showed you guys how bought our house cuz it was we already filming everyone we always get questions of like how do you look for a house how you buy a house that you know all those important steps that come before actually being in the house yeah so century 21 real estate is teaming up with us for this and they're a great resource to get into your first home so we're actually going to go into a fabulous home that they are representing it's a dream home you guys so it's like obviously a little out of our price range it is a beautiful a lot of our it's a beautiful house we thought if we were gonna walk through this process and kind of share some tips with you guys about shopping for a house we might as well do it and like dream home I'm really excited to see it let's go buying a house is always a big deal but there's some ways to simplify you don't have to be super overwhelmed one of the best things you can do is go check out what's out there open houses or when basically the real estate agent is at the home they have the front door open you can come in in our case we're stopping by a house to the LA area we found it online to the century 21 comp website where you can basically just search criteria how many bedrooms you want how many bathrooms you want buying a house is a wild process it can be a little bit scary but with the right tips and the right hand holding anyone can do it oh wait Kate it's an open house we can just go in oh really yeah well hi guys can you put some booties on please put booties on okay got it Joey the butt stops here come on when you get to the open house sometimes pending on what the weather's like what the floors are like in the house it's brand new and it might be like raining outside like it is today they will often have booties which are just little thingies that you put over your shoes so we're gonna put on our booties yes it is still drizzling out guys I'm going for the wet look the 1960s wet look [Music] [Applause] welcome guys my name is Lila hi they look like the flower yes this is so pretty in the sign please when you come over to an open house you always have to sign in the real estate agent who will be hosting open house will ask you to just write your name leave your phone number and your email address or if you already have an agent you're working with you can put their name down this is just the agent can like follow up and say hey what do you think in choosing the houses that you want to go visit you want to of course pick your neighborhood see if there are homes within that neighborhood that can meet your price range you want to make sure that you're pre-approved before you go view the house and make an offer etc just knowing what's in your bank account and then actually knowing what you're able to spend and put down on a house and then pay mortgage wise is a completely different process so you are you and the neighbor so you're looking for a house you're going to thank you yeah we're we're in the neighborhood think about other things that may suit you individually about the neighborhood walking distance to a school are there buses there's those things that might be important to your lifestyle nothing is ever perfect so you want to make sure that you can check off as many pros as possible but you probably won't be able to check off all of them so you can make a what's right for you list where you're basically keeping track with those things that ring true to you see how different houses compare just go see what's out there and it's especially important when you do have to make some sacrifices and some compromises that way you'll know that it's a very educated compromise that you're making because you've seen everything that's out there okay so this is a four bedroom oh five a five bedroom it's big you want to think about how many bedrooms and bathrooms you want how much square footage you would need for your needs the bigger the house the more money it is sometimes you have to sacrifice on neighborhood a little bit to get a bigger house or vice versa there's obviously always option to do what we did and find a diamond in the rough it is usually cheaper to update it yourself as opposed to buying something new I love this indoor/outdoor feeling looks like so California vibes this pool is insane it's a new construction it's not get less than a month you can see it in the pool watch TV baseball cooking in the kitchen that dining table outside is huge this is steak this is a staging yeah gotcha the stage in this place is awesome like they have staged everything down to the little decor items the cool thing about when you're buying a house is you can also buy it with the furniture see what size furniture they're using in the bedrooms in particular as much as it looks amazing is it can actually suit your lifestyle or your needs for the space Wow so are these real wood cabinets so real with cabinet built-in panel fridge or no frameless fridge with panel huh what do they call it I don't know built-in beautiful that's what they call great that one it's a plaid most of the men love the idea that to sit in the pool with all his friends watching the games love the cue on the way I love the pillows some of them are a little just pressed looks like someone's sitting on the couch were just gonna fix them just a little bit I can't out myself guys I see a throw pillow that's a little flat I gotta fluff it okay what what are you doing I'm just trying to figure out you're on the fireplace this table is you this pool area backyard situation is really cool so there's not any grass it's just all decking are you guys this is uh your price range this household maybe can we can we look at our to the house yeah of course have a look and Joey all right we're gonna leave while I can go check out the rest of the house and see what other kind of cool things this place has in store what's this room my office this house is listed as a four-bedroom and oftentimes when there is a house that's a four bedroom they will have one room style as an office so we are going to head upstairs I love these stairs they kind of have like a floating feel to them because the banisters are glass and I love the contrast of the natural wood with the glass and the metal frames of the windows there's just like a nice minna-san juxtaposition oh oh a seating area at the top of the stairs I like that yeah it gives me a place to uh hang out when like you're getting ready when you're getting ready when you do epsilon you're ready I love this there is a sitting room when you reach the landing that's it's just such a nice homey vibe to have an upstairs sitting room I mean of course it's very luxurious it's just really nice to have an upstairs area it could be a living room it could be you could put a TV and have it be like a family room let's go see the bedroom you have north sunlight and south sunlight because there's floor-to-ceiling windows on both sides so you're kind of always gonna be bathed in light in this place down the wide hallway there are two bedrooms are really cute there are nice sized bedrooms that's something to keep in mind that is a petite into bed with lots of pillows it's a jack-and-jill bathroom together this is that porcelain marble tile it's like a matte finishing yeah what do you think of this toe-kick situation going on usually baseboard kind of sticks out from the wall this one's actually like indented it makes it look like the walls are kind of floating it's very cool if you have like a modern new home Wow there's another guest bedroom is huge Fergus better a styling and these guest rooms is gorgeous I love just the simplicity of the beds they look really sumptuous both bedrooms have ensuite bathrooms very cool very classy I also love that they are using different tiles for each bathroom because bathrooms are just a really fun place to be unique and I like these details are like the simple matte-black handle and the black hinges yeah everything's mad right the walls are matte the handles are bad well I mean the light in here just so good like this is like Instagram ready I have a conjoined jelly it's a smart home it's got all these gadgets built into the walls this ambassador okay oh I love this perfect I love these sweater rugs uh-huh just think you're gonna roll around on it I love a sweater rug it's just like this very thick wool braided rug pretty sure we're gonna have to read puddle just to see if this house resonates with us if they come over here they're good see course we're gonna say that what girls are very important to us and that's the rub cuddle Joey does yeah uh-huh holy crap look at this bathroom I want to see you wanna see Wow double see look at this shower it's a wet room

welcome to office cool on the road [Music] one season we took you behind the scenes as we transform mr. key Studios in to our dream creative space this season we're hitting the road with the perfect sponsor staples Tamika were the offices of our fellow entrepreneurs who need our help today's episode we are heading back to LA why the Los Angeles youth Network LA yn is one of the leading nonprofits working to keep kids off the street in Los Angeles and given the housing and resources to successfully make it through the young adult years you guys remember when we made over there communal living space and today we are back to work with the mental health services team mark Anna and Tanya on the therapy building to give the staff and they use a beautiful and peaceful space right now it's pretty clean and kind of clinical feeling with some basic desks white walls fluorescent lights and a small table and tears in what's supposed to be the one-on-one therapy room we need to bring in some fun and color and turn this room into a space that can inspire and unlock the hope and possibilities in the precious minds and hearts of the youth sorry we're here and out it's all fair yeah [Music] all right wait real quick I need a little background what do we call this military coach-house but it is for a therapy and stuff like that and this program has the children who risk the kids right it's yeah aged 12 to now 18 and they're working on becoming independent right and they're all in these DFS sorry what is DCFS the Department of Children and Family Services mental health is a very important part of any developing human using me so this room is a really important room because you kids come in here everyday so we got to make this room functional inviting so that it doesn't feel clinical it feels welcoming yeah you like that I know the logo is purple and green sometimes those colors look a little intense when they're on the wall it's like when you see it on a low so it's big but then so I'm gonna kind of play with the like she's a little bit and when she says we're gonna plug she really means you're gonna play with that we're leaving you with all this stuff you're gonna figure out how do you know we're not gonna help you I've never actually played with a long part of it [Music] we'll be outside going over the plan you guys there's our supplies you got this is kind of like art therapy okay so the thing that isn't functioning now is it's just like a very fair uninspiring room their existing file cabinets gonna go in the closet and these are all the overhead fluorescent so those are all yeah so these are going to pendants so right now they have all their desks on the walls so we're gonna kind of have a conversation area in the middle and then this is whiteboard along here and then we're gonna do the door decals here right and then another big design element is pulling together the therapure yeah right now it's nothing because right now they've like the table chairs you know but now we'll do like the couch and the chairs so it's a lot better like a conversation area I'm welcoming and then here we needed two canvases on either side to cover up this window I think it'll improve it a lot make it a lot more welcoming I'm excited about that pink color you are colorful reading so many kids that are too cool to react but I mean I know they like it do you learn inside they'll love it you're still in there helping them no never still no fill team building already Oh see great you me me screen chill out now come on music oh yeah [Music] [Music] Oh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] our project okay we're doing our art project I love doing our projects that are unique to the space rather than just like going and buying store-bought art so we've got you here do we have more people with more goals Triana : in here it's lovely to meet you thank you for being part of our group what I love about this organization and what Joey and I have really been drawn to it's just the people here right like I think that therapy and relationships and all those things that you guys work on here it's about human interaction right so I wanted to have pictures of humans in the face so you guys are my human who's my model but I also have some props here so I have these blank puzzle pieces there you go Shan in my experience with therapy it's sort of like putting the puzzle pieces together as you sort of work through different things so I thought you guys can each write a word on the puzzle piece that means something to you or would be something that you would want to express to the kids so I only have one Sharpie field ignorance great I have lots of puzzles we the only ones that write in all caps if you don't mind got you thank you so she wrote love very important what is connection love connections [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you so thrilled of these photos these guys are all this is the time where you guys go work elsewhere right today cool cuz we have to finish your office I'm Jenna these photos I try to get them printed today are you guys excited to see what we come up with yes meet you okay so now that we kicked off the team we've got to get moving we're gonna replace all of the resently I gotta get these photos edited and rushed printed and then we've got to bring in all the furniture and decor items with staples and get some art up on these walls your big canvases I know well we needed them nothing to cover the window so the idea is that these are going on both sides of the window because that I think probably used to be an old porch and then they like made in a room so there's a weird like external window that is now internal and we don't want it to be a window so it is going to be a giant canvas because these are the pictures of the people coming in here with like spaces and holding the words and everything I don't want it locate obtain a big face No I have various colors of wall paint let's just tape off like some big slices geometric yeah so we're like really just making this kind of patterned wall panel guys I'm in our therapy room they do art therapy here which is so amazing and awesome you guys know that I love the power of creativity and they do that with the kids so these are all of the canvases up here that they have made look at that one with the beads zoom in on that one all of them expressing their individuality their feelings through the power of art I love it I love it it is so cool that they do this and these are here and they're beautiful we want to celebrate these and bring them in as artwork in to the other room so we are making a door decal out of all of these we've photographed each one of these and we are getting them made with staples of course into Georgie cow so we're gonna put on the door in there so they're basically gonna be like a grid celebrating all of this artwork the big moment [Music] oh I see yeah okay so we have these wooden laughing I love it [Music] powerful that is powerful and inspiring resilience you captured the emotions turned out so good I know you sure we want to put this up in here and not do it to the Art Gallery and auctioneers so now we have this photography that we gotta get up there right so these are gonna basically go around the whole room right go up a little bit with your left hand I got our bargain um ah okay great get those hum I got another such as you know I got another sensitive I knew more goes wrong I got more on their stuff we're making this a very cozy therapy spa this is the therapy room welcome here I'll lift the couch you put the rug under good looky there from one side gonna be okay please do this back where oh my gosh you're so monochromatic you still Joey I see that your shoes are on the couch again oh how amazing is this oh good they're art therapy canvases photograph made into door decals Joey that's the kind of energy don't and I also love that you can feel I could stir up the community looks like they're just painted on the door I like that we repeated the canvases multiple times so it makes them look like tiles right now they're like pieces of art this uh that's cool it's a whiteboard skin and call them till it sticks on the wall right yeah you don't have to melt it just sticks to the wall like everything goes all wall should be me the guy who this is really satisfying it's so fun all right so three of these guys along this wall yes okay so chairs rub tables pictures are up yeah oh ow ow ow ow move move you're pushing on me [Music] oh my god you legit my

and enter to win let's go see what it's like in a life as Ava oh yeah it's a great life let's go I need to learn how to surf hey guys my name is Ava and I am a YouTube comedy and lifestyle blogger on YouTube I grew up in Orange County with a bunch of friends we all would always go down to the beach every night and have bonfires and when I moved to LA to be closer to work I missed that so much so I moved back to the beach as close as I possibly could into a beach house and I think I did a good job with the living room but my bedroom is a little bit lacking I've never been able to get my bedroom correct so I'm so glad that Kay and Joey are here because I literally would have never been able to do this without them this is my room blue it's blue and it's disorganized oh you said it right yeah I was intelligent English did you paint it this color absolutely not I would have never done that it'd make a very bright pale blue yeah there is such a thing it's just confusing that is an epic wall of mirrors yeah max I've only lost over 80 don't get me wrong I love a good mirror you know you got to get that full outfit in the morning were there way too many mirrors in my room and it's scary at night when I go to bed and I see reflections but you're renting this please yeah so we can't like take those down and you have a desk which I see and have a big screen I feel like it next to your bed kind of makes it feel a little more like a dorm kind of setup I've never been able to figure out my room at all I think I just like freaked out cuz I want it to be so perfect I just like don't know where to start right that's why we're here yeah finally happening I know like so excited yeah we'll totally pull this room together I mean obviously the beautiful beach outside to inspire my style is very boho Beach surfer girl minimalistic it's very like grayscale and whites and colors and like textures I just like everything to be really clean and like simple and white cuz I like to DIY a lot so I like to add in like seasonal pieces that I make right so it makes more sense to just have it like clean second like splashing colors when the seasons channeling that one okay so we'll give you like a neutral palette that you can jazz up looks 7:30 and we have to be done today and Sun Goes Down early so maybe we should start clearing this stuff out of here oh and you like we like old wood - oh I love wood like wood the ocean breeze I know you're saying Michi I like one of you okay there we go ready set there the road first thing we got to do is get paint on the walls right now the room is this sort of baby blue I'm sure someone was going for like beach vibes but I think that kind of missed the mark a little bit it is actually competing with the blue of the sky and the ocean outside all right are you I'm done over here he hung I'm done ready ready ready ready okay I love painting I especially like painting walls oh my gosh you're our ideal person but I'm like I'm not on the beach right you paint every time I paint in a bedroom everyone always like has to tape everything off perfectly and like I just don't care I'm like I trust my like mine precision is that a comment on our taping did you think the tape too much I think you taped not enough you ready to see what color we're gonna do yes they just hit me with this color that is so bold I don't know if I can handle it honestly I don't know what they were thinking taking this big of a risk honestly at this point I'm freaking out I don't know what this color is gonna possibly go with it's white whoa so bold we're playing with subtleties here I'm really excited that she likes minimalism it's something that we haven't really got to play with that much it's really fun to sometimes play with minimalism negative space letting things just kind of breathe and have their moments oh yes I was hoping that you'd let me stir it gonna pour it yeah yeah yeah girl like Katie right easy Azam hey go for it can teach it I love it we're gonna roll now oh okay do it do I get a little off your life oh how do I here just kind of go well let's just get that oh it will ask the experts all right just go slow so it doesn't splatter back yeah [Applause] every time I do some slow like this I just think of like I am really excited to paint my bedroom I'm so ready to get rid of that blue and I also love painting walls especially with the roller if YouTube doesn't work out hiring me to paint your home what some of you painted so you just like painted your rooms like growing up yeah one time I painted my room purple oh my gosh Abel loves painting I mean she's just like an enthusiastic person it's contagious it's making me excited to paint I paint all the time when I was 11 I had a crush and a boy that was a surfer I think that's when I was like I love surfing and so I changed all my like passwords and everything to have like surfer and then I fell in love with it I was like this is the coolest thing ever I did stuff for boys but then ended up liking them more than I liked the boys and then I was like thanks for showing me this boy's good nothing telling it like you're out yeah okay well we've done some great coverage already haha she said she wants to paint yeah but I have actually I have an art project that involves painting well I like to pay walls so I should go to the art pressures on myself no you'll really like it when you can come back and help Joey's in it okay this is how we get it done what you guys go do your stuff Oh Joey thinks he's like such a badass like you know some guys write like dirt bikes and like other guys like you know go to like the game oh no Joey's got to paint rollers super manly hates pulling me out to do some sort of project I want to keep painting but I'm sure what she asked me to do is pretty cool so all right I'll put the paintbrush down oh my gosh okay no sir for I'm so excited so I thought it would be cool in your bedroom to do like a marble so sword that'd be cool almost like a sculptural element and then maybe use it as a surface to display some photos I'm gonna be awesome like you know like kind of tape them up with either like masking tape or just like glue da so cute we had this old surfboard it was totally broken it was just like a hand-me-down and we spray pee in it at the studio just prepped it for this project with just a nice white spray P we get to painted marble marbles also one of my favorite things my laptop case is marble at a marble phone case until I spilled chili on it so here's just some different colors of grey and the black we won't use like fat much that was so cool it looks kind of tasty I'm actually gonna tear it so we can each have a piece let's go into the lighter one the actual texture of the sponge is what sort of giving it that stone like look we'll build it up marble project okay I know marble is like so in right now and I am so okay with it because it is just gorgeous creating this faux marble is actually really easy you just take a sea sponge and you get it damp so that it's mushy and you're just kind of creating what is sort of the shadow of the vein what is the curve already hopefully I'm doing this right but look great never marbled anything before I love marble things oh cool it's looking good okay so now let's dive in with the feathers using the feathers basically just allows it to be like a really gentle kind of like like look so this is just like the eyeliner you know to speak we apply the shadow God we hide here well winged liner that's just kind of giving it like the littlest contour exactly so after we let this dried call it art so I think that Joey should have a nother surprise set up elsewhere shall we go check okay when you say it like that okay you dry alright so Joey should be here yet something to show you Joey open it's over here this is your bed oh my god reclaimed Wong's actly yes I know what these pieces are for I know just gonna look like it is giving me barn buds I am hatch oh my gosh you love it already Ozzy reclaimed wood look at this oh my god oh my god it looks perfect you love it I want to hang like Polaroids and stuff on yeah so this is from like a hundred year old greenhouse that's awesome is when you were talking about how you love wood and although there's all these like wood feds out there yeah I was like we should just make one god it's so cool 100-year old wood with a story behind it I hope it's not haunted no I feel like it feels good yeah I feel sick oh my god this is so exciting I've always wanted to make a wood bed like I used to look up how to make one but then I didn't have any friends I would help you so all right well maybe if you've always dreamt of putting together what bed you should help us assemble it before we kick you out okay yeah of course oh this is honey normally we would kick gave it out by now but a she's way too much fun to hang out with and be she is enjoying all these projects so much so she is helping us put together the bed isn't it how great is this gonna be huh my favorite part about today's project is this custom bed we're building her here is that because that flash over there so we just build the rectangle make it all lock together and then we just take some little slats and put those over the middle and the bachelors just gonna sit right on top yeah here over here here go ahead do the honors oh good okay that one big hole I stick this in right ready oh my god did I do it yep I knew it anymore nope I was good I feel like we're now far enough along that it might be time for Ava to peace out I don't wanna piece out but we want to be someone yeah I'm surprised mm-hmm okay I guess I'll leave you two alone um do you have something to do I'm sure I could find something to do she's like the busiest person that I could Photoshop dolphins into a photo definitely priority drop dolphins into a photo for about two hours okay if i photoshop dolphins jumping out of a purple cloud in two hours you guys will be done yeah deal I still wanted to help out but they didn't let me so I get I get kicked out I guess this is what I get after all we've been through together we marbled together I carried some of the bed upstairs and you just kick me out this is gonna be real nice though hello you guys why do we do this to ourselves all the time we were so excited to put the bed together with Ava we forgot that we have the area right to the town this natural wood makes me feel very relaxed with the ocean sounds you don't even look comfortable you're like holding your neck up Joey why hmm 30 is a rug down this could be our area oh yeah back massage oh yeah that feels good like you say anything okay oh okay okay enough what's up don't oh no no no you off the ground okay I mean it's nice that she had such a cute area rug already yeah great well we already roll around in the carpet so I might just do little chick hey jiggy what you're gonna like my day on the road try to move it the rug is inspiring Joey and I to do a hippie boho beach Dan Cates really getting into the vibe she wants to bohemian dance I didn't know what that means I'm just gonna channel Rusted Root concert wait hugs really stop [Music] they were called to with deaf man here the djembe is playing in my ears and dance the night away all right this is total waste of time let's go okay sped put it together what are you doing make the desk okay good I want this to be like an l-shape vibe with this she already has these sort of built-in bookshelves we're gonna extend one of those levels into the room so that she has a place to work on her computer see how big your brain is oh about two conference Joey circumference what does that tell you circumference is bigger than the radius or the diameter 23 inches yeah pretty small person as compared to what oh my god you're at 23 inches you have the exact same size head good minds think alike yeah but my mind thinks better because my head is bigger ratio wise to my body size your brain is like a little less good so I'm gonna go build the cushion for here it's gonna be like a window seat area because if we make this upholstered it'll be so much more inviting big mouth especially when Rich Jerk by we have to make that a padded window seat and that's actually really easy we got a piece of foam cut perfectly to size and also a nice slim piece of particle board he's braid he sit over the particle board and I lay the foam town batting oh my gosh then wrap the foam in batting and then just stapling down all the access and then once you're done with the batting you will do the same process with a fabric and la-dee-da we're done excuse me look Wow holy crap that's awesome Wow oh it fits perfectly reading yeah reading ocean yeah three ting what's going on with that shelf it's happening I mean slowly let's go no no no he already has these sort of built-in bookshelves we're gonna extend one of those levels into the room so that she has a place to work on her computer the only awkward thing about this bed placement is that there are two recessed lights directly over the bed hello there is a solution for this guys they make pendant lights that fit into recessed lights these are the coolest thing these really are so cool sliced bread so basically this just goes into the light bulb right for people who have big gigantic recessed lights like this from the 80s it's so cool light pendant light chandeliers everything you him to tell me I was with you I googled I pressed order that's true you press order but I googled like you don't even need an electrician you just unscrew the bulb and you screw in and this bulb contraption that's attached to the pendant light and then it comes with a ceiling medallion that just fits over the can itself and just covers the can and you would be none the wiser okay so we'll just have the two pendants coming straight down and then the surfer photograph in the middle like right here is good so I think so yeah it's cool it's like minimalist not super funky I love that copper okay great we're here cool I just I'm obsessed you guys whoever is out there with recess life that you hate get some of these right now and have pendant lights that you love all right good I'm gonna get the bedding and the side table you know what what did you get the bedding in the side tables please while I do this Thanks so power-hungry another thing we're going to do in here is we're gonna take her very simple ceiling fan that just looks like any ceiling fan you'd see in any rental and we were going to replace it with a really cool wood ceiling fan to bring in more of that would buy very excited about the ceiling this all right I'm very excited about this room it is giving me great vibes alright so like where well I wanted to be able to like sit she's a little bit taller than mine these are really cool cuz it gives you the look of a sconce without having to have the electrical box for it looks like maybe a little higher higher I mean this is so cool cuz it's plug in so you could add this anywhere here if you hold up ah I've got an idea oh that's so crooked that's so crooked I'm putting in the first screw do you see how crooked that is hey hello it looks so cooking yeah oh no that's still really high up right there on that time okay you know what there's got to be something else you could be doing right now all right pay attention to the measure everything at the sign thing you know you could do oh my god beside my table with the bedside table they didn't want to go matchy-matchy because the bed is so symmetrical to the room and we have two symmetrical pendants over top it just wouldn't give it that bohemian minimalist look so picked a round marble pedestal side table for one side and then on the other side a cube like mid-century style two drawer side table and they look so cool they're complementary era but not at all matching how cute I love mismatched side tables look at these cover does this look awesome oh my gosh so we have to tackle these mirrors you guys we cannot just leave those exposed since it's a rental a curtain is definitely the best option that's like a game changer this makes such a difference in here's a nice black rod to contrast with the white curtains and I'm thrilled with how it looks oh my gosh the mattress fits perfectly on this platform bed and what better to dress this bed with then linen bedding so when you're doing minimalist design you really want to play up those textures and subtleties of tones so we're bringing in white linen sheets with a beautiful fog like light gray colored duvet cover and then one yeah I said one do you believe it one throw pillow on the bed next to the marble pedestal table I'm placing this really cool antique wood stool it's just really simple but again it's reclaimed wood the window seat is an epic moment you guys I mean hello she lives in a beach house but has a window seat like of course we need to make that such a welcoming place for her to sit read Paris the little cutie kitty is gonna sit up there and look out onto the beach and see all the birds flying around and do that thing that cats do when they see birds it [Music] so the two pendant lights look amazing now we just need something right smack dab in the center and what better than a beautiful surfing photo than a wishbone chair one of my favorite styles of chairs is the perfect desk chair on the desk I'm placing this wooden ball that has crystals embedded in it and then a black and white box just bringing the black and white over to that side of the room above the death we are placing this beautiful a regular hexagon mirror it has a brass frame it's minimalist styling these built-in bookshelves is really easy because they're built in and they're white and they're you know I'm just placing some accessories I also love placing frames in bookshelves you can experiment with taking out one of the shelves and actually hanging a piece of art or a photograph the surfboard looks so cool you guys oh my gosh like that may be one of my favorite projects like we've ever done I wanted to make sure she had a place where she could showcase some of her beautiful photos I'm just styling some printed photos and also one of the mr. cake quotes wild and free which you can get on chopped up mr. peacock home and it's just like the perfect vibe for this room this room is ready you guys it is then we got a step back the trick with minimalism is knowing when to stop and we need to stop and show Ava this beautiful room we're leading up to me seeing the bedroom and I am nervous but I know it's going to be amazing I am leading you me leaning leer about tank carpet smells like fresh pain so I can't wait to see how the whole room turns out ready 1 2 [Music] [Music] [Music] how did you do this it's an animal that is not that bad how did you turn this space into this cottages

marble table right this is Sookie minimalist I was so excited that you like minimalism cuz I have we haven't gotten to do that yet and how much different is the room feel with these curtains up now like it's totally changed right it feels so much cozier I know the mirrors scare me at night the marble surfboard has its own focus point in this corner there's nothing blocking it so it's like its

[Music] hello my friend weirdos welcome to another shopping blog this is a jobbing vlog for grace Helbig mamrie Hart Hannah Hart you guys know them as the Holy Trinity we've been calling them the boss girls because they are just boss and also I am obsessed with all of them and this is like high-pressure room for me because usually we're only decorating for one maybe two if it's a couple these are three very amazing opinionated powerful women they all have their own style and this is their office space and they do a lot of important things in this office space and it's just a challenge you guys very excited so hit that thumbs up button because I know you love these shopping blogs and I love you guys so yeah give it a thumbs up and also subscribe if you haven't come on please more kamat took us off here so let's get in to the mood board this was based off of some inspiration images that they sent me and like I said before the challenge here is just having to design for three different people in one space fortunately their inspiration images were all pretty similar especially grace and memories they have like very similar taste Hannah's a little more of a wild card but the things that she pinned are specific enough to her that I know I can make those moments happen within the space but not have it conflict with the other stuff anyways so you can see this mood board here we have a lot of brick walls now this room has an entire L of bricks if you guys have brick at home that is unpainted and red it's beautiful and if you love that color it's perfect however if it is not your style it can be a challenge to decorate around and of course grace and memories pins were all pretty much like light and white and kind of pastel and you know a little eclectic so I'm going with that eclectic thing and I put in all of these images that have brick on the mood board very important so that we keep that awareness that that is going to be a big part of this design so then I'm trying to go away from that obviously with the furniture we're bringing in some like neon vibes all of that and also some quirky things like you guys know they are super weird and hilarious ladies and so we've got to have some of that sense of humor so that's the mood board moving on to the floor plan so you can see what we're working with here for the shape so basically it's one long room with the brick on the L side of the room basically where most of the furniture is going to go it's brick and then there's this adjacent room which is um it actually is a glass wall so it's kind of like a three walled room because I'm not going to put anything on that glass wall and that is going to be the like storage or closet room because they do have a ton of like clothes I'm just like random props we're going to make that kind of like a little like wardrobe closet room I think I'm going to put a vanity in there so that's what you're seeing here vanity two wardrobes which they have already a dresser over here some floating shelves on top and then a rug and a bench in the middle kind of give it like built-in closet vibes even though it's not a built-in closet then over here we've got the kitchen area there is a table here which is actually a table they already have I think it's from Grace's old place and then you can see we have like a kitchen island happening here so that was Hannah's request and this is Hannah's area of course obviously kitchen hello Hannah the chef so then over here there's the conversation area couch ah you know area rug the huge and then next to it we're going to do one of those big racks that hold paper right those paper backdrops we're going to put up a nice nine-foot one which are the long paper rolls it can roll up paper and then here you see there's this chair and a round circle this little furry round rug and this chair is big part of the room or a big part of the shopping blog because grace specifically on her board had a vintage salon chair she's like I'd love to have vintage salon chair so I love the idea of making the backdrop area kind of hurt area because you know she would says those like sit and talk videos this is memories bar so they don't want a desk I'd rather just have like a bar that can kind of function as my desk so this is a bar slash desk for memory over here and then these three other desks here are for grace Diane who is Grace's assistant and Hannah back here as well so that's the floor plan let's check out the shopping board there's so much stuff going in this room as you guys saw on the floor plan right haha highly recommend doing this whenever you're shopping online because it is just so much easier to visualize that way so as you can see you've got this beautiful rug I found the rug is not muted the chairs I just died for these beaded velvet chairs in this beautiful blue color got a marble coffee table this is Hannah's kitchen island and it actually has a fold-out countertop area so she's like filming videos and wants people to sit at the counter I think it's cool and also just functionally they could have that for extra seating but then it folds down so it won't conflict with the walkway or putting in sconces because they've got these like just to industrial looking sconces and again we're trying to like soften this place a little bit these cool mid-century office chairs we're gonna do the countertop desks this is mamrie's bar with the fold-out arm so that is where she'll sit as the desk and then she can fold it in and just have it be like a flat bar I have a gold basketball hoop on here because I just love the idea of spray-painting a basketball hoop shiny gold and hanging it up from one of their big beams in the office and I have it there because Hannah pinned a basketball hoop so these are the things I've shopped online so far and now let's get to the physical nitty-gritty shopping all right guys so here's the dilemma the salon chair that we found for grace on Craigslist it's a really cool color but the problem is just think it's too bright obviously this would be really rad and like Jesse's be so we just did it was opening our crush okay now my lighting has changed oh she's leaving with the giggle up guys save money and just find branches in the street so vehicles to our neighbors and just pulled Frances oh she's a she's a girl after my own heart sweet and you're allowed to if they hang over on this sidewalk you can oh free game it's a single in my eyes yeah yeah we say are and I'm making it makes it more dramatic anyways back to the chair there is a damage spot here which like I know oh and there's some stains here too so obviously this is a reason to reupholster it so we're gonna take the base off we're gonna load it in the car it's going to spend the night in the car and then tomorrow I'm gonna go to the fabric store pick out the fabric and then head to the pollster all right great this was your once yellow chair soon to be a yellow hello everybody I'm about to head to the fabric store to pick out a fabric for the salon chair hanging out back there hello I got to figure out a beautiful durable fabric I want it to be something that's look you know can take some butts lots of butts sitting on it you'll see what they have ah [Music] so the key with picking these fabrics is gonna be finding something durable and something that's just gonna age well how pretty this is oh my god this one is really standing out to me Oh what all this like dark Oh raspberry keytone should I do pink I'm gonna keep looking because I haven't seen everything yet so I want to make sure you see everything in the store before I make a decision that's why it takes me so long to shop you guys like I alright guys so I'm confident that I've been down every single aisle here some of them twice narrowed it down to these his ly at what I did and did a little collage so this is our couch and here's our chair we're gonna have two of these so I feel like the dark pink would actually be really pretty okay we have a winner this one all right guys we're at Becca Shuba also known as BTS okay so I am on the lookout for bar where I love these glasses of like the gold detailing on them the gold on this decanter the gold on these cups there's two of us so cute we like vintage execute Oh with this collection of like pink glasses oh my god these are so pretty like how freaking cute your knees get this one you guys it's a texas-sized jigger um you guys I've always wanted to use some of these there are those 70s lucite or acrylic or bakelite grape on driftwood I've like always always always wanted to ZZZ oh my god okay I know I'm in the kitchen section Oh a fish platter I could be cool very into these the wooden handle it was like tre chic here's another flesh oh my gosh i'm stas with us you guys for their vanity like a tissue box cover but it's like 70s or 60s like curly pink acrylic all right here's the spread guys this basket is style oh right that was awesome now let's see where my list is gonna take me next oh my gosh this is the problem with me leaving late if I just sat in so much rush-hour traffic so target is the closest thing to BTS I'm gonna go in here and see if I can get some of those faux plants and see what kind of mirrors and stuff they have and then maybe a couple more bar things and then also some more kitchen stuff for Hannah so that's a good list let's go and I'm here in the side table section and actually really like this like pale blue accent table for next to the couch I really like this lamp I'm gonna get this one for Grace's death I'm gonna get this tray it's like this cool minimalist tray for by Grace's beauty chair and then look at how cool this is you guys it is a minimalist whale coaster set for the coffee table it's like just boom and then there's communal underneath some alright here's some more things I got this little decorative minimalist metal thing candle and then you guys know I'm now a big fan of faux plants for youtubers because I just feel like they don't have time to change out real flowers oh I like these faux fake plans gonna get one of these ok my heart is getting forgetful oh my god wait what there is a rose gold rattlesnake mamrie has her dinosaur and then Grace has like her shark and her de RAF my this is like a centerpiece on the kitchen table just like so random oh my god yes also got this basket for one of the faux plans and I got an ice bucket for main kitchen tools for Hannah I am mixing and matching and I got socks of holes and pleat so you can put on the shelf and then look at this old school pepper mill I feel like that's really cute and kitchen ewwww alright so I have a very full car it is currently what it's 6:45 that's what happens when you start your errands at 3:30 in the afternoon let's go eat and maybe work out what probably don't work out yay Joey's here to help me alone oh my god guys I forgot I didn't have my vlog camera with me when I went to pick up the upholstered chair this is a very unceremonious reveal but it's like an entirely new chair hey guys alright it is the morning and I am sketching some stuff out for the boss girls to just kind of get what's in here in my head design-wise onto the paper also I'm brainstorming an art project so I'm going to show you what I'm making so this is the desk wall which you guys will remember on the floor plan is that far wall and this is actually if not brick so we have the luxury of being able to paint this so these are the three desks this is going to be white boards but I wanted to bring in some color but some subtle color doing shapes painted on the wall behind where we're going to hang the white boards and have those shapes be like more angular moving over to this art project that I'm thinking for above the couch so you guys know that we like to do custom artwork in every space the reason is just it makes the space more personal but also when whoever's in there is filming them they have the rights to show the artwork and all that and it's never an issue and also just a chance for us to get creative and DIY so the thing about something that the three of them can do together and I think but print art is like the funniest thing ever and I feel like they have such a funny sense of humor all of them and hanging out together so I hope that their game because I think it would be so hilarious to have them all like either dunk their butts in paint or that might be a little messy so probably just paint like paint on each of their butt cheeks and they could do this bare butt or we're gonna also get some like disposable leggings like really cheap leggings that they can wear if they don't want to like be bare asked in a video which I will totally understand if they don't want to so we'll paint their butt and then they'll just sit down when people first look at it they'll kind of have to be like wait a minute are those your butts and it'll just be a funny discovery process and just a funny story and it's gonna look like abstract art no matter what and like why not and if they hate it and it's weird we can paint over it and they can do something else I mean there's always the option to do that guys too with art so look if your DIY are just like go for it go for that wild idea and the good thing is you can paint over it alright and then here is this other sketch that I did this is the memories bar area this will be like shelving behind with far wear and then we're gonna run a light here swag it over that's one of those fixtures I got then this is going to be the white paper backdrop roll we're going to attach those to the beam that runs up here it's a wood beam so we don't to hang it on the brick and then it can roll it down and I actually want to style the room with the white paper or maybe the gray paper rolled out tape down on the floor then I have this round furry rug I'm going to put there this is Grace's the lawn chair side table and then I thought it would be so fun is to take like black paint or a black marker and actually draw or paint onto the white paper like a hanging plant and then this is a little conversation area with the rug and all that and I did not draw legs on the coffee table so that is the plan and then obviously but art right here which who knows how that's going to turn out we are flying by the seat of our pants or no pants haha okay guys I am here at HomeGoods I'm getting some colorful kitchen stuff this isn't like a teal pan it's like yellow strainer I also wanted to get hand a couple cutting boards so I found this really awesome wood woman and then this one that is the pineapple made out of marble which you know I'm okay with and then I'm also getting a couple more last options just to have they're so expensive like wine glasses and champagne glasses for me Marie I just found this knife block every chef needs a knife block and then also look at this cool cocktail shaker for me Marie it's not like twine around it all right I have a variety of baskets here that I picked out I grabbed these three four like lamp pots and then I also love these four inside the makeup dressing room like the give it in in the corner and they can store like bigger stuff in there you guys about my obsession with crystals look at this gigantic quartz crystal which is such a good vibes crystal and it's only $24 and it's huge and this on the coffee table is just gorgeous oh yeah look at this thing this is just this like rad I don't know this thing on a shelf or maybe like my memories bar I don't know it's just like an agate slice pyramid oh my god a pair of zebra mugs for grace on her little tray I think oh okay guys look at this look at this I brought back all the stuff home goods adventures targets ups here and then look at this let's just take it in there's just a shade Yoda stuff and we're getting really organized Joey and I are gonna leave to go to a wedding tomorrow and then from the wedding we're going to New York to the Shorty Awards which I actually think mamrie might be hosting very ironically or at least she goes them last year when we went

pop pop intro for the blogaid joining you for a shopping vlog for the beautiful Tati Westbrook you guys will probably have already seen the ohms you were coming over episodes if you haven't yet go check that out or you can check that out after this video I am doing this intro right now as we are really tired after our prep day and our install is tomorrow so I don't actually know how the room turned out as I'm recording this intro which is kind of suspenseful so subscribe and give this video a thumbs up and let's get into the box take it away me alright everybody you know I love to show you the mood boards and the floor plans and all of that before we get into the shopping blog so that you can be on the same page as I am as I'm shopping and obviously the mood board is one of the most important parts to jump us all off because this is what I send to taki and she approved it and as you can see it is glamorous I am calling it Tati's chic AF studio design working title behind the scenes and I love the mix in these photos of the classic elements like a tufted couch with then some beautiful blingy things I love kind of modern elements actually this floor is very similar to the floor that she has also black and white black and white photography you can see playing on this board I definitely want to bring in some black light photography into the space but maybe not of people I think I want to do something maybe it was just like beauty products kind of keep it a little bit more delicate we'll see how that goes you guys will come along but I'm going to try to do it and like edit it black and white obviously and then you can see the furniture on here is a mix of tufted with them some gold and some white and some black I love the grounding element of black I think black and white and ray with a little bit of gold that's going to be our color palette I also kind of like this blue you guys I'm sort of obsessed with blue and white China and I'm going to maybe try to work it into this room I don't know yet obviously smell on this board that's just something you thinking anyways so that is the mood board let's move on to the project board which in this case our biggest project is taken up the whole board which is our built-in and we want to make it look like takis beauty studio it's like in makeup boutique but not only makeup she's going to also have style stuff so as you can see down here on this little sketch I did there's the vanity area that I love the idea that being built in so here's some renderings up here what we're gonna do differently than what these renderings are showing is actually do a wardrobe here that's going to be with glass panel so you can kind of see it on the sketch and then of course a vanity mirror with the light but it's going to be huge it's going to fill that space and then the glass shelves are very much inspired by these blushing t'en photos here so like glass shelving up above with lighting going down they call them puck lights when they're up above and then the storage down below so that is the project board and then I will show you guys quickly the floor plan so this is a floor plan it is one big rectangular room the L shape here is the built in and we're just going to be building it off of the existing kitchen that's right there so you can see just how huge that is then a nice big rug and a desk or a table here with I'm thinking a bench so that she can and work facing the camera which can all be set up here so you can see how much floor space there is here for her to set up her filming equipment which is great two desks I want to make a matching desks two chairs we've got the couch here and the seating area we'll call it like the meeting area so this is pretty much the flow as you can see there's like three different things happening in this space so that's gonna be challenged now let me open a shopping board all right here is the shopping board for Totti I've done some online shopping this table is online this bench is online these chairs this chair this chair and then I'm planning on going to some stores for the other stuff but as you can see our color palette is here the gray the black the white and the accents of gold or brass you know brass and gold or friends so there you have it and we've got a little bit of blue white right there too so excited alright that is the plan guys let's get into the vlog alright guys I am about to leave for takis house today we are doing the before pictures which I'm going to take and the before footage which Marco is going to get there he is Marco and I are choreographing the the dance moves because he uses that gimble which is that floaty contraption and I have the monitor here all right so I'm going to try something a little bit different for this ball this time I'm going to kind of show you guys where I'm thinking that things are going to go calculable here because then I'll put two big chairs and then over here is going to need the desk area I think they want space with two people it's a little little walled up of two chairs this is where the built-ins going to go so we're going to have wardrobe all built-in closets lighting shelf shoes etc and then over here going to eat jell-o made up or for $20 and and seven and right up here the van builds into the filth she's going to have a table set up here because they win and light from the window and then have the cool background or like makeup organization behind her this original belt was okay and then she wants to teach in that area to be candy bar look I want to got your so much right now your cameras usually it because you are in Maui getting married on Maui okay guys look I'm here with the one and only chachi we're happy because we're about to get to decorating soon I've got to go shopping but I'm here I just had to show this beautify and bye alright we just pulled up to the custom closet showroom and we are basically at the point now where we finalize all the measurements mm-hmm so we have the design mapped out and so now we're just going to pick all our finishes I mean I already pretty much know what I want to do Thank You Joey he's a prop master here I already know what I want to do it's going to be white and clean and glass and puck lights and everything we just pretty much have to like point it out write down like the item number and then okay so here are two walls we have the vanity wall here and this obviously the mirror will go in here and then we've got two rows of shelves and drawers two rows of shelves and drawers and then drawers here here here here around the vanity and then obviously the space for the chair over here we have more shelves shelves and then this is a double wardrobe so and the thing that's super crazy about this one and super custom is we're making these tiny drawers yeah oh yeah let's go okay so these are the drawers here this is why it's custom because not only this width is a tray door right I get a drawer drawer drawer drawer so that something like that can fit inside right now no no leaking strangled okay so we're thinking like a white that's just like a flat white like this right like not with molding and they like that more text this one actually is a texture I'm thinking smoother than this this is this is the type of lighting we're gonna do they're not strictly internal LEDs so when they open the closet lights up or you can switch it to be lit there the faces that we're gonna do are going to be glass so we just have to now get what is on paper uh into the room the room on the wall it's like the biggest custom closet thingy we've ever done yeah okay good morning guys it is the first day I am going to go shopping for Tati usually you guys know that I get a lot of stuff online I get a lot of like the big pieces like she needs a couch etc and I'm actually not gonna do that I think I'm gonna head to living spaces I've actually been really loving their stuff lately let's go all right here we are feeling the glam vibes already we need couches I like the look of this a tufted grey velvet for those lamps those lamps are pretty glam - okay okay this is a really beautiful couch - this one's like very classic to me I like this oh this is super glam - it's like a mercury glass floating coffee table oh my god I love Wow they've got huge rugs here yeah I need to get a gigantic rug oh my gosh you guys how stunning is this and it's wool just really easy to clean I feel like this would be so pretty for her filming area but like her table or it cuz even if she drops like makeup on it wool is really really easy to clean look at this one it's like over dyed black and white Oh decisions look at this task you guys imagine two of these next to each other so glam and look storage storage storage storage more drawers here oh my god okay I was in this store for about four hours I'm leaving I got the couch I got the rug I got the to death I got nesting side tables I'm done I'm hungry I'm going to go eat lunch hello guys okay so I am trying to figure out what I'm gonna do for takis photographs I wanna do a collage wall above the couch and I want to do collage of like brass frames with nice white mats and I already got those those are from Westone but what to put in them well when building the mood board you guys saw I put some black and white imagery in there and I love like that kind of glam but sort of like a punk guard look I was thinking it would be really cool to do some like still-life images of makeup but a little more artsy the makeups like crumbled or there's like a streak of mascara or like something spilling why do original photos instead of buying photos because obviously there's so many amazing pro photos online well the reason why I want to do it for Tati is because she's going to be filming videos in her space and you upped it like legally get clearance from artists and photographers in order to show their artwork so having custom photos by me in this particular case will allow her to just show them no matter what and also to just create a weirdo style it's fun to be able to be surrounded by your own art and just take the opportunity to get creative I'm gonna go on the journey right now I'm going to just pull some items it's actually late Joey's here hi jelly Hey all right go into the back go into the back collecting Tamika I picked out some props from our glorious shell so here's my little setup right now and it's what I just took I was just testing out like lighting and stuff but I feel like it looks pretty freakin cool I have this really old nail polish color it's like separated and I think it's probably like not even useful anymore so I'm gonna pour this out whoa like just that looks rad I'm gonna like undo one of the bottles and have like the brush tip laying next to it and the open bottle and then I'll let you know how review oh my god this lady bag oh hey guys is another shopping day today in my last shopping day and then tomorrow's our prep day and I'm hoping to be able to spend the entire day Itachi's just kind of like prepping and going over stuff and maybe like putting some furniture together excetera okay so here's my cart looks like so far look at this Joe in our glass you guys and then I got a mini one and then this is like a shell and a pedestal I'm just getting like so many beautiful accessories to style in those shelves look at this you guys know I died for this raw wood with a crystal embedded in it or resin I died and then these beautiful trees which are sets you can use when she's filming and then you guys know I want to do some blue and wait China for this room so I have like from glutes happening there I just think it's such a classic look and look I found some more look at that beauty and this beauty alright here is the collection so far you can see the color story happening it's just like neutrals white great and then a little bit of blue and white karyam is the book store I got to pick out some beautiful coffee table books so I think these are the books are winning it I'm going to Chanel look because there's beautiful pictures of makeup in there I'm going to get this hair book I'm gonna get this shoes a tizzy and I'm gonna get this art and makeup book why their style is on the coffee table or open on the slanted

people express their inner self in their outer world Oh like that and we are showing up with a truckload of stuff paint colors and upcycle items and new items and items we brought from our studio our lady of the moment is Jelena - beautiful names she has blue hair from what I've seen which I'm very excited about because how not obviously I like colored hair and she lives by her song she's a working woman she's super busy anyways I'm glad I check it out hi there my name's Jana and this is my room I live in this beautiful 1922 home spanish-colonial and I am just not doing it justice I just simply don't know how this warm green color has been on the wall since understand I'm using this bed sheet here for a curtain my desk is a Craigslist find that's just great painted white I have the same that I've had since out of 10 years old I work probably 60 hours a week I have this demanding horse sport that I do and I just completed the screams plan I'm studying for the outside engine so the last thing that's going to happen is me spending any kind of time learning how to decorate okay that is a very green wall situation it looks like the space has a lot of character looks pretty good it looks definitely like a vintage species got that arch around the bed she's super cool I love that she's like so into just so many things she's scientific she's artistic she loves animals I love all that stuff you both have weird colored hairs it's gonna be perfect weirdos together speaking of creative weirdos guys join our family hit that subscribe button and the thumbs up button if you're already liking the video thumbs up the video if we get to 70 thousand lines kate is going to walk a dog backwards and then do a backflip into a dirty link Joey why does it always have to be a backflip breaking Bay Area [Music] [Music] this moment Fatimid has some really great architectural details like an arched inset and French doors I think we should keep the floor plan basically the same because that archway is just begging for a more elegant bed setup and an accent wall color this is a lot smaller than I thought based on the video you said yeah this is an old bed yeah no literally I've had since my grandma bought it for me when I was like 10 it's got a few things going on like with the slats down here did you paint this color I did not it was here when I moved in doesn't feel like your color SS I know it almost like gives me a headache when I study in here what are you studying for I'm actually studying for the LSAT creative big-girl bed color essence walls lips [Music] it's time for the design snapshot where I let you created weirdo in on some of the design elements and colors that I plan on using in the face I'm using me lick squared mosaic prints of a full moon and a line of trees that all go together as a beautiful splash of color and moodiness for the wall opposite purpose and I'll accent around it with more tones of blue and some animal and nature inspired accessories because Jelena loves all of these things and now some poses sneak peak on my own story and snapchat you guys follow me yet I choose your ring oh I'll blow any but you guys it's a color thing all right you said that your favorite color when how did you describe it the colors have Beyonce house on in the dark purple dress in like the second set of for pregnancy photos you wanna lift up the lid whoo so I know that you are not a a white paint wall girl but I feel like in life you need a little bit of contrast right it's like your skin tone is the canvas for your blue hair to face again it's the candidate for that really so my gosh you're gonna end up with a purple tail [Applause] so I feel like we are totally kindred creative weirdos obviously obviously in your questionnaire you said you were obsessed with cephalopods particularly cuttlefish and so I had this thought like oh I was gonna do some ham sketches of cuttlefish for like your finished room but then I hear that you are an excellent artist okay artists because you do this right like you go through your encyclopedia beautiful books of animals and sketch them yeah there's already something you do I was gonna do matching frames to put them in so just small little sketches Wyatt cuttlefish your favorite they're incredibly intelligent in such little small bodies and they communicate using their tentacles and also by changing colors I also communicate they change in color I just do it much more slowly yeah [Music] making our own DIY well here's the thing not only does she write and she has like her work for her job and stuff but she also has that vintage sewing machine I want to give her a long enough desk within that small room where she can have like two different station her typing area and then she can like roll down and have her like sewing or sketching area that I'm going to cut this then I'm going to take the other countertop and I'm gonna make legs and support brackets on it okay so where is the support bracket going that side in the back of the desk okay good yeah so she can fight under because I have a rolly chair for her minimalist as possible while making sure it doesn't fall over great all right I'm gonna go dip dice in her okay while Julie builds the custom desk and Creation Station I'm gonna heat up some water and salt to mix in with some beautiful blue dye to create some ombre tipped curtains inspired by yelling of hair of course dyeing these white conkers is super easy I'm just adding a bottle of dye to my warm water and salt mixture donning some gloves how many fingers up sighs great and slowly dipping the bottom third or so of the curtains in leaving the very bottom in the longest to get a slight ombre effect then I'm gonna wring out the dye rinse them and let them dry in the breeze can you hold this bed yeah where are you going yeah I'm gonna try and wedge salad over this way yeah web salad hold the bacon put the magic back okay so Jelena has been sleeping in the same small bed frame in the same mattress since their childhood so it's time to finally upgrade her to something more grown-up so we are hooking her up with a new luxurious queen-size bed so we're doing bedding yeah it's something I can do that's better than doing bedding Curtis yeah I didn't touch that wall did you just get excited about curtains I mean compared to making a bed on the bed I'm using this gorgeous sea foam clothes along with some new crisp white sheets and some throw pillows including a super long densely stuffed one that Jelena can lean against if we're not using headboard it creates a clean minimalist look and it doesn't cover up the window are you eating oh okay oh my gosh it looks so good can I do it for me oh my god just like fight word okay yeah yeah got it got it got it okay guys are y'all done do we this looks so good - IKEA countertops turn into a desk that is such a good hack I'm so proud of you I'm down here give me the plug no charge so the shelf that's gonna go above it's kind of a like subtle tear - fact you know 24 what time for twenty four point seven five no sorry what's half of what's half of nineteen and a half what's happened I didn't have it in the corner no when I say that yeah nine point seven five nine point seven five 35 37 yeah okay I'm just marking my Center grandma's sewing machine I just don't want it to be blocked too much by this that's where we have Oh on top of the awesome lick squared mosaic prints were hanging a floating shelf that's the same material as the desk and we'll just use that to play some styling elements on and then on both sides of the desk we're hanging some wall-mounted swingarm sconces coming down our cephalopod sketches to fit into these two matching frames with math and now it's time to show Jelena it blondie they're brand new grown-up but still fun better how do you what do you think it's gonna look like do you think there's gonna be a good place for you in there you may have that can I please have that thank you you think they didn't share any paint with you you want some paint for your tail you think the rooms gonna look bigger when it's done do you think it's

welcome to article on one of the things we took you behind the scenes as we transform mr. P Studios in to our dream creative space this season we're hitting the road with the perfect sponsor staples to makeover the offices of our fellow entrepreneurs who need our help in today's episode we are heading to almost a communal workspace and gallery for artists started by Teresa and Isaac they have spent all of their energy setting up the main areas and they have completely neglected their shared office space the room is a weird triangle shape which has made it very hard for them to figure out a floor plan and they only have one desk their logo color is pink they haven't seen it on the side of the building so we need the full choice of painting they're old and patchy tile floors you guessed it hey we needed it to dry for a couple days though we are back today to finish the rest of the room this is your office right yeah well it's supposed to be our office kind of like a challenge space for us because it is so weird shape but we spend most of our time like prepping the space out there and making sure that it's comfortable for our our tenants and avoiding yogurt yes so the goal is to give you a place where you're starting to we're right and you guys are co-founders yeah what's your tasks so divvy she's the creative director and then I make sure to God our backgrounds are both creative I think so design yeah super creative when we were doing that design in the year you said you wanted this space to be a little bit more professional-looking a little more pulled together a little less vintage found yeah this was also previously before you guys took over this building oh it was a tile showroom right yeah you had mismatched tile to paint in the floor sort of helps make it all cohesive so here's the deal we're gonna clean up the walls but we're gonna have you guys obviously because you guys are a team already you guys have worked out your team dynamic afraid of the outside words gonna leave you there's your paint there's your stuff are you excited to have an actual place to work instead of having to work out in the kitchen I really want to know if when they would take naps in here we'll finally be official I love that we're doing this on will shipping container help they're so cool the fact that they use this old container at the coffee table yeah but we're gonna take them out of the world of found objects out objects and give them some real brand new office furniture this is probably the weirdest shaped room we've ever decorated right right yeah cuz it is a legit triangle with like oak tail so we pre did two things and we demoed all of this out we're gonna give them some storage and this piece here and then also here this is one of those like bigger cabinets which basically everything that was here will now be able to fit into here before it was basically her working in there by herself Isaac didn't have a place to work that was the big challenge is giving them both a desk and a space to meet with people if they have prospective tenants or whatever so the solution there was a wall desk along this side that's gonna be counter height and then obviously this is a problem area they have like all that server equipment and stuff that we need to hide away if you can build something I think that isn't yes if you can build something like to fit custom into this weird triangle spot so we can have a ledge for a plant but then also hide all their ugly cable Internet's off under it that would be great [Music] what's this I order from Staples a bunch of clipboards so because you know they have all these active projects going on they have to track all their different gallery exhibits I want to do a wall of clipboards here because it's nothing a wall of clipboard well uh guess what color they are pink love their desk I want to do a whole gallery wall for them okay because obviously they have so much artwork they have access to artwork she's an artist so let's get some inspiring artwork up there to help tell their story and then obviously the final piece there is a stones is the sign yeah which is massive which is laughs so when people walk in to their office they're gonna see fan and it's not the logo that's on the side of the wall it's the other one cuz they have two different versions that they use of almost they have to like block letter you're on and then they have to handwrite any one the one thing we're leaving in the room is their light the very had right there we're gonna take out the fluorescent light in here and do another bird you like that yeah which my plan is to swag that pendant light over not possible great it's not a swag abou light hey unless you order light the nice all the light we got is a is on a pole can we not have the pole and just use fire we'll see pending pending pendant light and okay we should go out with the meat no no because like I should paint you're right because we're in an artist studio but we're not helping them pay well what are we gonna paint [Music] they did a beautiful cow your hair thank you I think I probably got at the same place you got your hat please your accent farewell your father Oh ma'am you've never been to Provence sir won't know how the paintings going in there it's going splendid here away having a British I wonder how they're painted French let's just paint those well not the stroke this does not look like you know we're very upset about this it's because you wouldn't let me get your feet sheet early on maybe we'll have Theresa and Isaac judge these winner gets what if I win I get away without week if I win we get to go camping and the Smoky Mountains in a tent or there's bears Smoky Mountains okay ready to reveal yeah ready go close your eyes No okay then determind like it see it okay ready on three [Music] good you sign there yeah holy signiors I'm gonna go check and see if they're done painting okay the ladder looks so good pretty nice right yeah Wow I can even it's the right time I don't like things easier those eyes the two of you so meet me out front [Music] [Applause] we also so nice and quieter here so all of these studios are basically various artists yes right so like the art going on the walls is a big thing it's important yeah this is celebrating some of your artists celebrating yourselves people we've worked with the stuff we've done so that's why we want to have these things around you because when new tenants come in to meet with you there that's where you can talk about that so we have some really cool art you have the mural yeah so this is a local street artist yeah girl barf they did the sketch and then did it on the wall she's cleaned our entire building one of your best friends she's gonna find out on this video that she's that she's your besty girl bar of your dreams is that Fred you wanna mount this one sure I would do this double-sided mounting tape sure so just a little corner Corner corner corner maybe even the center Center to everything we've got the balls baby we've got the floor painted we have our artwork ready to go and so now is the time where you guys stay busy out of here and we will go and we'll tell you already yeah yeah okay I really like you guys are so cool I'm feeling like major pressure I know I'm gonna love it I trust you guys oh thank you that means a lot you guys no worries you join there better not be white paint on the floor no felony carries art okay we now that are figured out so Lee Theresa and Isaac in this already awesome space and go work to make in their office just as awesome with some gorgeous furniture and decor items including a massive custom sign that staples made for us alright so basically we're trying to solve that corner and we're just gonna give them some custom shelves where we can put the routers yeah so this is about how thick it'll be which will come to like the front of the door and we'll cut out spaces for the different condo and stuff that's there great okay I trust you I trust you [Music] thank you I mean they're like they're rough but I feel like it's kind of their vibe like it'll be cool put a pretty plan on here and some pretty accessories just that pose there's young okay [Music] [Music] why did your baby I think this thing needs to clean them you're great at that you're actually not very good at that Oh use your buck I am perfect and we've got a tiny little gap here which is good away from the wall so doc they can feed their like computer chargers through [Music] okay okay sorry lamb nothing is saved from Joey's drumming that's your schillingers hard what is this thing for is this for all of that artwork prints and posters and things push okay go make sure that that storage cabinet works wait Joey what when if I make this into like a sort of false wall here since that kind of like negative space back there we put the palm tree behind a and then we now have a straight angle here that all is perfect except for your definition of negative space it's negative positive cute now we just buy that weird corner and into some storage oh man I love these fairs this tan element brings them a more sophistication for me it is perfect because I look nice but they're still in her vibe yeah so you're gonna try that light I got it hang the sign oh I've seen it in the hallway but it definitely got here right sign was your responsibility find it [Music] [Music] okay I actually don't think I brought the sign what I think [Music] [Music] [Music] guys I think we're done we have so many cute things look look we did window thong here which is so nice so that's gonna like the other room in here it's nice private private office Joey can you look and then our artwork here style the death fits the computer station if you wanna just okay and then look look look at this this it's donor tomorrow action on now alright with the two levels here we've got our little coffee station and then we've got our printer station and trash can down below like this corner was just a cluster out sort of hurt and you know the time is tho wall okay so were you show to do almost open up [Music] so much picking blackboard is like workstation here so liquid or laptop station there art above what got so much cuter when this race is like Yousaf oh my kill in a wall and then obviously you have that storage in there but we basically deconstructed that then gave you drawers there cabinet here with shelves and then the rolls you had all those like paper rolls I think if you have anything bigger than what would fit in the storage that should go in like that all right well we're gonna leave you guys go ahead so bye you guys were painting we painted oh okay and it was very quick - all right ready yeah go you don't have to decide you guys can have a slight conference ready at the same time we love being here we love that get comfortable we gotta go good luck with a bit alone he is so happy with this hip and functional face be created with those pink floors and all of the amazing items from staples Teresa Isaac now has the artsy bas fees they truly deserve they're probably already planning Joey's art gallery show no I am NOT dinner let us know in the comments below you think of the space and don't forget to like the video and please subscribe to our channel to join our own artsy family of creative weirdo [Music] [Music] [Music] you guys are boyfriend/girlfriend couple tender couple for the record I knew that okay well we were talking we were guessing we were talking we weren't sure we don't want to assume I mean that was my essentially if we're in business you try to be appropriate right yesterday we try it was 
[Music] hello I create a weirdo welcome I'm so excited about today's video because it seems like you guys really like when I do art DIYs that kind of don't really require any art skills and also use an unconventional item Oh shout out to the spoon painting remember that so fun so today I'm going to be doing both of those things but it's even gonna be more epic because I've murdered with Super Lotto plus for today's video and they asked me to imagine if I won the lottery like what would I do uh and how I would apply the SLP acronym to my life I would create a subtropical lady palace oh yeah and plant 70 lush palms and invest in some stupendous lavish pop art oh and I definitely make a savory lake of Pike for my kitties and oh well of course solve lots of piece oh no with that in mind I decided to create some DIY art that anyone can do but it looks like a million bucks and it's inspired by the palm print trend you guys know it's so in right now but I'm gonna do creative weirdo style all over this wall behind me oh thanks crew guys and don't worry if you don't have a wall at home you can use a canvas and will I mean you have a wall home you have walls but you know if you don't wanna do it on the wall you do it on the canvas and I'm gonna create it with a wolf I'm gonna call it a stylish leave painting guys cuz SLP and I'm gonna use an unconventional item which is a pool noodle because why not so subscribe creative weirdo and let's get to [Music] [Applause] miss Kate okay so we have our setup here and I'm going to go through the supplies you can check also the description below for the specifically listed provisions of course we need our pool noodles various colors of paint here since I'm doing a palm leaf print with the pool noodles I have various shades of green and then I also have some blues and some yellows for a sort of shadow and highlight color I also have some paint brushes on hand but like I said to you guys this is not a painting skills required DIY a sharp box cutter blade be careful but this is very necessary because I am about to dissect the pool noodle so it's PG maybes pg-13 I'm all tied up so first order of business fillet the pool noodle I experimented and found that a box cutter blade is definitely better than a kitchen knife I tried both but I am going to cut down the middle of the pool noodle just as so the good thing is these are very inexpensive so get yourself a couple extra in case you mess the step up but it's really really all right we had two halves here these pool noodles are going to become our instrument so rather than using a paint brush to paint a hand painted palm fronds look me are going to be using the pool noodles as our stamps so basically I'm going to cut different pieces if you look at a palm leaf there's the center stalk and then there's the Frog the little smaller leaves that come off of it [Music] I'm gonna create a point on the top because if you look at a palm frond it starts thicker and then it kind of tapers into little points I'm just going to use the blade to just cut a triangular tip on this nice long piece and now I'm going to create some smaller pieces out of this side so now you can see I have my three smaller pieces these are going to do the same thing where I use the blade to create a point on each one of these [Music] I have all of my pizzas laid out here now comes the part where we get the paint on the noodle I'm going to take my Center long piece here and this is the part where you'll use a paintbrush but don't worry it is only to apply the paint tool interval I'm just going to do a nice stripe just down the center and this does not have to be perfect it is very forgiving so now here's my nice curvy piece this is where you guys get to just be creative and figure out how you want your curve so I'm just going to kind of come in from here and press it down make sure you're just sort of following the noodle along the way boom beginning of the palm frond as you can see it is not perfect but neither am i and neither is nature now I have my Center stalks of my fronds that are going to be my background fronds again you can layer them you can keep them spaced out you can do them in a pattern this is where you guys get to be your own creative weirdos right around here and here I'll create some longer pieces kind of coming off and then I'll start getting smaller and smaller [Music] so I've gone about a third up on my first palm frond so I'm going to transfer now to the medium length piece for these middle pieces and then go to the smaller one now the little guy [Music] and I'm gonna now repeat kind of going around the other side right so using the same size and going down obviously I have these very spaced out so you could keep them very Airy looking like this or you could go in and fill in in between and what looks really cool is if you fill in in between with a different color or just a different shade of green right so you're getting that sort of like gradient effect and also what I love about this sort of pixelization that happens as it looks like a pop art print like when you see those pop art prints that just have the pixels really glorified it looks like that obviously I'm using this technique to create a palm frond but doesn't this look like a wing - okay so this looks pretty cool I just love how this pixelization makes it look like and it was printed on the wall so here's where you guys get to decide if you want to just leave it one color with a lot of negative space or go in with another color I'm gonna bring in a couple of my darker shades dark emerald green and maybe a blue and add in some depth same technique with my three size stamps but using a darker color oh this two-tone I'm loving it guys I'm going to do this one maybe in a double color maybe I'll do blue halfway and then go into like a mint think I might do a yellow on this one new little highlight mint mint [Applause] [Music] I'm covered in paint and I love it it is the mark of a successful DIY project I had so much fun creating this you guys I really hope that you're inspired to do your own DIY pool noodle palm frond print cuz I just think it looks so cool and it would look so cool just on like a tiny canvas too or on like a bedspread you could do it with fabric paint oh my gosh we really want to hear from you on social media you won SLP what would you do let us know and use hashtag Super Lotto plus when you share comment thumbs up and subscribe and all that fun stuff and I love hanging out with you all the

wall keeps me there can you move any less Oh crews are gonna make such a big difference in this room even though these aren't super bold and color in any way just the fact that we have this big huge moment of textile here on this otherwise bare wall whenever you're hanging curtains that have grommets like this which are these holes up here I always like to put one on the other side of the bracket here so that it keeps the current anchored so when you're closing it doesn't swing all the way across okay so I noticed on Sophie's Pinterest boards that she definitely had a lot of plants but that totally makes sense because that goes with like the bohemian style succulents are one of the best plants to use because they're really easy to take care of I love the idea of using things like mugs to pot our beautiful little succulents in order to aerate the soil and create a spot for the water to drain I'm going to put some of these little pebbles down at the bottom before I then put soil and then I'll put some more pebbles on top all right that's straight and I have all of these guys which I could do a cluster over here and then I also have a mirror we want to do something over there kind of feel like I want to make a game-time decision and change up the floor plan I think it'll work let's try it a little harder than I thought really liking the couch here in this position I just think the flow of this apartment now feels onsh more open that much more welcoming got these amazing side tables here I was gonna layer them kind of stagger them with this but I love how this one can slide under the couch like this we have our cactus latte put that right there [Music] I love how these pillows work together this couch totally wanted some throw pillows [Music] now comes the fun part of layering rugs such a bohemian look because it really has that sort of found object feeling this is a storage ottoman this one can kind of be more for your feet and this one since it's a flatter top I'm gonna add a tray so this can be where they put dinner or whatever if they're sitting and eating or drinking and looking at the TV love this bed set up now this to me works so much better with the flow of this apartment this is a great tip for you guys if you put a bed in a corner you can make it really look like a daybed which is almost like a second couch by putting the pillows in an l-shape and adding a lot of throw pillows eats up the surface area of the bed so it looks a little bit more like you could sit here Rolo slow slow slow slow right here [Music] [Music] I don't even look like my apartment and there's her little bed layered bed you have layered rugs like all bohemian and Sheen it has a little layered bedford thank you so much I love there welcome home brain oh honey I'm home sure home dream dream mom I feel like this the best way to start from zero pretty much you know you know I came all the way from Peru hello few months ago yeah and I've been trying to make this

[Music] welcome I'm in a big empty room on a bed why because it is the first decorating video of 2017 and I thought it would be fun to answer some of your questions about just pulling a bedroom together the bedroom is a great place to start because everybody sleep and it's all about paring things down you guys loved Ava's room you guys love the minimalist design that we did in Ava's room but I thought it would be fun to play with three minimalist design that are just centered around the bed I'm all about positivity seeking and sleep and recuperative time is a really important part of that so let's get into the video about before I do please subscribe eyes click on that subscribe button hashtag mr. Kate 1 million which is our million subscriber campaign when we reach it we will pick one of you lucky subscribers to get a $10,000 room transformation so crazy and on our way there we are donating to charity so positivity seeking y'all's good vibes subscribe and let's decorate [Music] miss Kate alright so here is our set so to speak for today it is a bedroom and as you can see the walls are painted this really beautiful pale pink which I love and it will work really well with all the designs that I planned today pale pink we have these beautiful pink walls and I just love the idea of pens playing with a monochromatic vibe and I think a great refresh for your bed just a really quick change that isn't too expensive is to change out your bedding and get some really nice quality cotton or linen sheets and these are gorgeous these are from Target you guys wrastling with this BAM I love how this looks I love having this expanse of this knit across the bed so I'm not going to put a comforter over it because I just like this look I really want to focus my attention now on this wall and I have something really fun and DIY planned so let's head to the DIY band alright guys I am in a DIY setup here because for the second setup I want to use a tapestry or fabric element out of the headboard a lot of you asked me about using tapestries and interior design and I think that behind your bed is a great place for a beautiful tapestry if you have it I did not have one surprisingly so I'm going to make my own and I am going to paint this piece of fabric that's laying here on this table and this is a beautiful black linen and I am going to paint a pattern that I am very fond of it is something that I decorate with and also make jewelry inspired by and that is the phases of the Moon I just love it it's obviously a very restful pattern it's the moon at night you hadn't noticed so I am going to create a vertical phases of the moon that's going to kind of extend up from the bed and I have measured this fabric so that I am going to paint within the area that you're going to see between the top of the bed and the ceiling right so just keep that in mind so I've got some white acrylic paint here I've got water I've got a paint brush assortment I think I'm just going to end up using one I've got a pencil here to draw my circle sheet and then I have a template you could use a plate I'm using this lampshade because it's a little bit bigger than a plate and this is going to be my moon shape so I'm going to start with the center full moon I'm just going to use my pencil just catch a very light line so that I know roughly where the moon shape is I'm going to keep this organic I'm not going to make them like perfect perfect because nobody's perfect and neither is moving [Music] all right that's my full moon now I am going to do my waxing and waning moon which is the sort of like half moon shape at the big moon and then I'll end it with a crescent moon on either end of Center Crescent slice and this time I'm just going to sketch half way around the lampshade and then this third time I am going to sketch a little sliver okay now for this side I'm going to paint on the other half of the moon right so if it's waxing and waning so I'm going to go on this side to sketch and now here our moon sheets just very lightly sketch and I'm going to use one color of acrylic paint here it's just basic acrylic paint I got here in this little dish I also have a glass of water here on hand because I want to work with a nice wet brush because that's going to help the paint keep moving on the fabric because I want to get that very organic flow of the paint so let's just start on the full moon and shall we all right so I really like how this is looking you want to give it some more of the pock marks if you will the moon of create our dips you can just kind of go in with the tip of your brush and just kind of give it some little dots of paint and just blend those into you don't really want to see the texture of the brush but you do want to give yourself a little bit of that shading so this is awesome I love how this looks I'm going to continue painting the rest of these moons and what's so great about acrylic paint on fabric is that once it's dry you can iron the back of it and then it is washable all right let me continue making the moon and I'll see you in the bedroom oh my gosh you guys huh I die I mean I just die and go to lunar heaven this is so cool so it's just nailed up there with two little nails at the top like you would nail up a tapestry so I didn't cut the size of this fabric this is the width of the bolt which is really cool because it has a searched edge here you know or it's just kind of seemed off already if you can find a fold of fabric that is the right width for your bed I would suggest doing that hello crescent moon side table I do believe this is the most perfect lendable ever for this room so I am just going to place it here it's nice and slim and small this is just going to be the perfect amount of surface area for some well-placed accessories this dreamy bedroom set up really deserves a dreamy Oh peonies with some eucalyptus and of course a deliciously smelling candle right there oh my gosh I mean I'm obsessed you guys oh okay so I love the element of greenery so you're going to put this rubber tree plant right there and then look at how cool this little candle holder is a little broken open egg just right there [Music] [Music] this design is a little bit more masculine inspired I have gotten a lot of questions from you guys like yo what about us dudes all right here is our color palette it is shades of grey so we got a bottom sheet here we've got a beautiful quilt just kind of sweater looking quilt which I'll probably use kind of more as a throw blanket and I got to get these on the bed who's under there hello it's a slate-gray marshmallow I would definitely recommend if you have just a metal bed frame or you can see underneath your bed get a bed skirt there's different ones there's ruffle ones there's like clean nice simple ones it really just grounds the base of your bed so you can't see underneath and all those deaths funny all right I've got the top comforter down and now here are some pillows and look what I did with this comforter here you guys just folding it under like this is actually a really cool look it's very minimalist a little masculine to have this look like a pillow top as opposed to having the comforter drape down around the edges so as you can see there's no headboard here usually I use head boards it anchors the room it gives you something to lean up against it's nice but you can totally have a successful bedroom without a headboard and I'm going to get the secret ingredient secret ingredient what is it it is wall accessories that are statement-making and architectural without being a headboard right so I've got this amazing light here you guys look at this this is what we call a wall lamp so essentially it has a bracket and you mount it like you would a sponsz but you can put it anywhere like you don't need wiring in the wall like you would a traditional thoughts because it has a cord and a plug at the end I'm going to mount it over on that other side and this looping over the bed will provide a really nice line and then also the lighting you only really want one of this gigantic thing so I'm going to hang one of the mr. K clothes on the wall as well because I love idea of that sort of smoothing arc of the lamp and then a square piece of art and I just love contain it's just your uniqueness your does being unique in being you yeah let me get my drill oh I'm going to mount this bevel not scraping the wall when you maybe need a phone a friend yeah now [Music] so cool so now let's just bring in a side to you all oh I think I did that backwards you guys you just imprison this I felt in the corner let's ah this is where long legs would come in handy just don't help them okay there we go love it can we harken back to the cement lamp DIY I guess remember that so this is going to go over here tuck the cord in a second and then this vine is so cool I really think that even in masculine rooms the presence of like fresh greenery even a fresh flower if it's a singular flower it's just a really nice touch are we done I know it feels so weird I put in like five things in this room guys it's a new year then 22 throw pillow bring me one [Music] okay guys so for this third bed refresh our third and final we are going to use a head floor at this time but it isn't a new headboard while it is a new headboard but it's a DIY headboard and what I think is so cool about this you guys is it's using the same technique that we use when we made the tufted bench you're just seeing the back of it you're like that's not okay okay let it over oh guys like hello you could either stabilize it by just using the weight of your bed or you could screw it to the wall or you could bolt it to your bed frame if you have a metal bed frame holding of your mattress so look at some Betty whoa Lynn oh my gosh I am obsessed with this you guys so this is just a beautiful white linen duvet cover over a nice full bountiful duvet insert it has a very sort of casual elegance like it's okay that it's wrinkled you kind of want it to be wrinkled so it's a very forgiving betting to have but it's also so nice to cuddle up to so what's gonna bum it [Music] all right so we are going to do something different with this setup and we're going to bring in some wall lamps because sometimes having a big lamp on a small side table takes up too much surface area so I encourage you to think outside the box or above the table so we're just going to screw these up onto the wall about yay height right a boom bada bing cha-ching oh these matching life looks so cool I love the graph with this dark blue it's just so elegant let's get a side table in here does this slim side table is perfect and then let's accessorize the high table [Music] all right so we are getting there you guys I think we need something over the bed and I have a garage sale fine that is the perfect thing I'm on it then I'm like oh my gosh I've been dropped open and so longer I know my she's not Dori I know the rules [Music] all right so now I'm gonna get some accessories for on top of that like pillow and throw blankets and things we've done guys minimalist keep it chic don't overdo it look at these beautiful colors I don't want the pillows to be perfect there's just so much symmetry going on in the headboard I kind of like that the throw pillows are a little off kilter a little lived-in looking the art of rumbling a throw blanket alright I think that's it you guys you know no one to stop our theme is obviously refreshing and having a pared down really relaxing space I think we're done I mean I could keep going but this is a threeways video so I got to stop a number 3 [Music] hmm nothing like a warm cup of tea in bed right guys oh my gosh it's so much fun doing this if you think you've so much for hanging out with me for this video I love that our first decorating video of the year is centered around the bedroom because it's just such a special important place especially during those winter months so I hope you guys got inspired I'll say goodbye to you now make sure you subscribe guys and give this video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and let me know what you want to see next of the three ways style of videos like what should we do you guys even coming up with some amazing suggestions so let me know in the comments and Happy New Year welcome to 2017 and I'll see you next time bye love you lots mmm 9 table tea ha oh yes definitely this is a nap blanket if I've ever seen one [Music] 
Previously on "OMG we bought a house" -Do you love it? -That's so crazy. -It's so magical right? On the inside of the garage... We're going to put our chandelier up there. Why don't we just make the world's largest coffee table? Wahh! -Go go go go go Wait where? Go where?  -Down! Can't wait to decorate. There's so much we can make. How will it turn out? OMG We bought a house Kate, door! -Coming! Hello! -What's up guys? Welcome back to our living room. I'm so excited we're gonna do the dining room and a room that we have been meaning to tackle for a while which is the breakfast nook. Oh my carpentry project And joey has, yes, some epic skills happening in that room you guys it's gonna be pretty and comfy and cozy and pretty. Let's do it. Are we at 2 million subscribers by the way? Are we yet? If we're not we're like seconds away like two people away so hey two new people and also thumbs up this video while you're at it. Hundred thousand thumbs up here we go. Ohhh OMG we bought a house let's do it. Hey guys I wanna take a quick break to tell you about today's sponsor and special discount code. I am a skincare fanatic and I think you guys are really gonna like this product. It is the Vanity Planet "spin for perfect skin" face and body cleansing brush. It's an all-in-one solution for a healthy and glowing complexion It comes with 4 detachable brush heads which are cruelty free by the way and they easily pop on and off and they help remove dry dead skin cells from the surface of your skin to keep pores from clogging and prevents breakouts, blemishes, blackheads, whiteheads, ingrown hairs, and all the other not so cuties. The first brush head is a daily cleansing facial brush which is made of ultra soft nylon bristles designed to remove the outer layers of dead skin and debris making the facial skin more radiant and clear. I love this brush. Then there's the exfoliating facial brush. It's made of pliable synthetic bristles designed to break apart dead hardened skin that dulls the look of your skin. Exfoliating is great because it increases blood circulation to the face which breaks down Toxins and encourages new skin cells to come through. I love that it also comes with a larger nylon body brush that you can use to clean broad sections of your skin such as your arms, legs, and torso. It works a lot quicker and more effectively than traditional washcloths or loofahs and it leaves the body skin feeling so smooth and clean, trust me. It also comes with a pumice stone that you can use to exfoliate the callous cracked skin on your heels for soft sandal ready footsies. Omg and the best part you guys: you can get your own "spin for perfect skin" brush at the link in the description below and you get 70% off if you use my code Mr. Kate What a deal ok, now let's get back to OMG we bought a house. Alright Kate: Are you going to let it fall now? Well, I think it... yeah it's good. Woah So we've taken out our old dining room table which was obviously that big rectangle which Joey cut down and made into our new coffee table and So we're gonna need to bring in a new dining table but first we need a new light fixture because we took the chandelier that used to be in This dining room and put it in our garage. So we are hanging a new globe light, which is like a funky sculptural light with like the exposed filament bulbs under globes. It's like bulbs in bulbs. What? Double bulbs? Mwah. Yay! I want to audition a rug because we have a round... Where are all these rugs coming from? Around. Kate's got options. You guys know I like options and so I have two rugs that I want to try for under the new dining room table that we're gonna bring in. So since we have a smaller table going in here and it's round, we need a smaller rug because the rug we had in here before it was big rectangle. I got it for the size of our dining table which is now our coffee table. First one is this like woven, jute - it's kind of like a doily. It's also kind of muted because we have the black wall in there I want to do something a bit more contrasting -I also feel like chairs aren't going to be good on that kind of a rug Yeah well it obviously needs to relax  down here yeah -rug sir you need to relax. all right okay so Okay so option one We're not necessarily feeling that one - So option number two is this vintage cowhide rug that I've had for years little vintage let's see This was a vintage -let's see rug I got forever ago. Let's give it a spin, shall we? Oh, yeah. You're gonna have to lint roll me when I get up. But I love the irregular shape of it and I also like the black-and-white color which brings in the black-and-white that's obviously happening over in our living room. This wallpaper was like one of the best decisions we ever made. We took our tray ceiling that's in our dining room and we put up this mural that is just this gorgeous wallpaper mural it's actually pictures of the lunar surface that NASA took. So the lighting fixture is really important because the ceiling in this room is like a feature. We also did Kate's favorite thing juxtaposition and put like a sort of victorian looking ceiling medallion between the light and the ceiling. It's all beautiful. Can't wait to bring the rest of the stuff in so let's do it. Okay, Joey, before we do the gallery wall let's fill up this. Before we get to the gallery wall I want to fill up this little cabinet. When we first moved in we made it our like bar area I didn't love the look of all the liquor bottles and labels kind of cluttered but we do have some awards. Shorty award from last year. "Best in house and home." That was an exciting moment. Bill Nye the science guy handed me the award backstage. A dog had just won. I was in line behind a wiener dog. mm-hmm, new media. Speaking of, we are nominated for a shorty award this year too which you guys can vote on. We're nominated for best web series for "OMG we're coming over" which we know you guys love. Thank you so much. You guys vote with me, we'll be all voting together Links in the description! Shorty Awards Dot-com. Best web series OMG we're coming over Come on guys help us fill up this cabinet. and then I go to vote. If all two million of you voted I'm sure we would win. Oh my gosh. I just voted. So hopefully we'll win that award and that'll also go in that cabinet. Also Joey when he was in "The Click Five" they won a bunch of Boston music awards. So there's five members of The Click Five. I bet you couldn't guess that and they have stolen these awards from each other over the years like it's kind of a running joke like if they're in each other's houses they'll just like steal them. So Joey stole these two off the mantle from Ben who was the keyboard player in The Click five. So now they're at our house they've actually been in our house for a while So now Ben is gonna be seeing this video and he might come and steal them which means we need to win more awards. This is from my late grandfather's basement Mh-hmm that's weird Yeah. And this is this was our community award from the LAYN for our community service last year. -We need like a really small award. No this is what we're gonna put in there. I carved this lady out of stone. -All right so pictures? Yeah gallery wall. -So should we like lay them Lay them out here, map it out, and they're going up here. I love gallery walls because it's a way to really showcase photography from your travels or experiences and Joey and I, this last year had a lot of fun trips that we went on. We've formed a lot of fun memories so having those around will be really fun. The way we're gonna get these pictures on the wall is a trick that I think we have shown you before. Check out our "Gallery wall three ways" video. Seems like a really easy thing to do, right? like you're just hanging pictures on the wall but when you're trying to hang a bunch Of pictures on the wall you want them to have some sort of similar margins going on with where they're placed or whatever you can just start putting them up you know. but I've done it enough times that you end up hating yourself at the end of it because to get things level to get the spacing right it just becomes like a total headache so this is a really great trick if you have some scrap paper. We happen to have a giant roll of butcher block craft paper. You could even use newspaper. And we're laying it out in the size of the piece of wall that We want to cover with all the frames. -So we're just gonna be able to lay the frames exactly where we want them get the spacing right and once we've done that we can just put this big piece of paper up on the wall and then using My laser level I'm just gonna make sure one of the rows is straight and that's gonna mean the rest of the pictures are straight You know where your nail holes need to be from looking at the back of your frames you just measure those spots nail em in and then once your nails are in the wall you can just rip the paper off the wall and just go through and hang your pictures up and it comes out exactly how you plan. Wow Wow this is so different than our last dining table. So this table we're bringing in is so cool. The last table we had obviously had four legs it was a rectangular table but this is a pedestal table. It has a beautiful kind of sculptural base. It's iron on the base and then a nice beautiful quartz on the top. Look at these -I love this. -So pretty.  -compared to those white once we had because like the fact that there's no arm rests. -They're so sturdy hardy -They are very study. -I'm obsessed with these dining chairs you guys know that I like juxtapositions and nothing is more beautiful than having wood with stone. And I love the basket weave it's so cool and such like a fun juxtaposition with the table. And we're keeping the old vintage hutch right here right? -yeah When we first moved in we placed this victorian hutch that we have. It has a wood base with a marble top it's actually from like the 1800s. It's a beautiful antique piece and it fits perfectly so there's no reason to move it. -So we're just gonna leave that where it is and we're gonna kind of feature it by putting a giant mirror above it. Is this the same mirror we put in Lizza's place? Yeah -Immediately start fixing it. My contour, not my contour! The one we used in Lizza's place was the copper. This is the brass so this is the same mirror. I love a mirror in a dining room because it is actually good a fung shui. Feng shwee? -You guys will correct me in the comments- because it reflects the bounty of whatever food you have happening on the dining table, so it's nice to have a reflective element in a dining room. -Okay so I'm gonna put it up i just gonna need you to be my eyeballs [straining] This is heavy Oh God, don't strain like that. Ooo okay uh.. - Wait set it down for a second. Go on that side... -I had this same problem on hanging it at Lizza's place. [grunting] damn Wooo! Oh my gosh it's so great. It's circular, it's round it's like the moon for the wallpaper. We have the round medallion and the round table. Ok, breakfast nook! I'm so excited This breakfast nook has been a project that has been happening this whole week you guys. Joey went and bought all the lumber for it. Joey's building a banquette. So here is my sketch of the breakfast nook. Bench bench bench I didn't want it to be built in all the way to the ground. I wanted there to be some space underneath To be able to kind of tuck my feet back. These are all the cuts i gotta make. -Woah! I can't tell you how important it is to make a cut list. I've learned this over the years. You. need to draw everything out, figure out your dimensions, know exactly the lengths you're gonna cut and that way when you go to the store you're getting the exact amount of material you need, you already got all your measurements like this Cut cut cut cut cut [mimics saw] Cut cut cut. Place it in the space. Get it all screwed together. This is such a much better use of space. I'm excited. It's not, we're sitting on it, it's not falling in, it feels sturdy. -Yeah I know well you did a really good job with this. We're like embracing the very petite size of this room. So Joey's doing all the building, my part of this project was picking out the fabric and then taking it to our upholstery guy and I found this fabric severely discounted. It was seven dollars and fifty cents a yard which was amazing because it's really high quality, nice and durable and so I bought a bunch of yards of it, brought it to our upholsterer and he's making the cushions for us. - oh! Look at this cooshione. I think that's french for cushion Coo shone? -So i had Louis also make these keeney pillows they're called -Excuse me? -Yeah -Kidney? -Keeney. -I think they're kidney pillows. -No they're not kidney pillows they're keeney pillows. Joey. -Lift that up. I'm pretty sure they're kidney pillows. -Keeney... kini? Okay bikini shape... no bikini wax shapes. That is not what I'm... please don't show me those google. It's a kidney pillow. Oh man this is gonna be an epic nap spot. Whoever built this bench did a really good job. I just have to put in the table and then we're basically done in here. Oh wow. -Oooo color color color! Color! This rug for the kitchen is so cool. You guys know I love patterned rugs. Patterned rugs in the kitchen are especially great because if you spill stuff on it it's a lot easier to disguise. I love it. -Are we doing a kitchen galley rug cuddle? Oh, it's nice and long. Wooow Joey! -What? -We've gotten so much done here at this house. Our beautiful kitchen. -Something tells me we just are never gonna finish it. So, should we just eat at our various eating spots? -Yeah oh my gosh we have to toast on all of our tables. -Toast on the tables? -Toast on the tables! Toast to all of our surfaces!  Come on! What are we drinking? Lemon water? Alright you make the lemon water, I'll... lay on the uh banquette. -Wait how beautiful is this rug? Ah! I need a lemon. An OMG we bought a house tradition. Lemon water! And sip away! Cheers! -This is definitely my new favorite room. Wait let's go test out the dining room table. -Mm! Okay, cheers to the breakfast nook! You look great! -Okay okay let's try the dining table shall we? I gotta decide which is my favorite room. I mean realistically this is maybe my favorite room. -Oh this is your favorite room? -This table is more us. -Yeah, the flow. -It's shmall! -And it's round it's a good flow cause this is our pass-through room. We've got like door door door door. Cheers. I still didn't sip. -I adore you. -Oh that's sweet. You wanna give me a foot massage?-Not in the dining room, Kate! -No? The breakfast nook? Breakfast nook foot massage. Breakfast nook foot massage! Tag you're it. Sure but if you go first that means I get a longer round after you. I do ten minutes then you give me a twenty minute massage. -No! What? -That's the rule. That's how it works. I massage you now, you massage me later but you have to massage me for twice as long because whoever goes first gets the shorter massage. that's the rule. -Gosh you're not making up a new rule. -That's not a new rule. That is an age-old rule. I love how all this looks. Our space is really coming together. It's reflecting who we are, who we've grown into over these last four years. There's so many fun things in this house What do you guys think? Yay we did it! Oh my gosh we were so... -What's your favorite room, the nook or the dining room? -I love that nook. All the space in there is now being used and this was like a little room you know? I'm gonna be rotating my meals. -Yeah. A shmall room. Rotating meals and foot massages. -Guys we're gonna end this because she owes me a foot massage now uh -That was not the deal, no.  -Thumbs up to -To more foot massages for Kate. -To dining spaces. Yes! -Wherever they are in your home. -To surfaces everywhere, for glasses and meals. -Don't forget to vote for us for the shorty awards. -Oh yeah! -So we can get that shorty this year. -We would love to win another one this year. This year we're nominated in -Best web series -Best web series for OMG we're coming over. So last year we won best in house and home...

previously on OMG without house just gonna be all one level into the shower all right so we'll go pick up the tile tomorrow all right Kay come help me grab your toilet oh my god so the plan in the bathroom is replaced a single ugly vanity with a beautiful double vanity countertop can't wait to decorate there's so much we can make how will it turn out OMG we pop house [Music] Kate dork humming hi everyone we are back in our house we're back in our house it's such such an exciting day today because finishing the bathroom there's just so much to be excited about in that bathroom and it really is a pretty small room so there's a lot going on so we're gonna get into that make sure you guys subscribe to our channel if you're already thinking million all of the weird and fun and creative things we're doing yeah we got lots of videos of your new our channel thank you if you are an OG thank you make sure your subscriber so you have a chance for that $10,000 room transform a shot yeah Wow when we reach 1 million subscribers one of you guys will win ok let's go get clean in the bathroom it's all the finishings it's goodies so plate it so this little bathroom has been a big project we have stripped it down to the studs then we built it back up from scratch we added in the new floors the new drywall the new beautiful shower tile added in a shower door the new vanity we busted out those old ugly small windows and put in that new beautiful salvaged window beautiful window it's large much rather what we had in here before we just now need to finish painting we went with a bold choice Kate's choice which is a black paint yes a black window why not it's looking good and then I loved that we went with a bold choice we have so much black going on the black and white tile in the shower I wanted to justify it elsewhere in the room it really works because you walk in the bathroom and it stands out I'm gonna get this black paint out of our pristine bathroom without spoiling it mark my words don't touch me don't touch me take those touch me don't oh wow it looks good Kate what it looks good so today's all about finishing up the electrical which is really important in a bathroom what are you doing just put the light switch one reality what is it how great that one is oh my gosh it's so sweet these are the adorne collection by lagron LeGrande is one of our great sponsors are sponsoring today's video basically they're a more refined light switch it's all very Grande I love how this is like very much like the shape of our tile works really well yeah all right so I have to paddle switches which are controlling the recessed lights and the exhaust fan and then we're going to put a switch above that that's going to actually be a dimmer switch that's going to control the lighting that we're putting over the vanity you want me to install that one oh yeah go for it I want this I'm gonna do this yes guys I can decorate and install electrical this is the whisper switch because it's so so quiet it's per switch because it doesn't make much noise so this is going in here okay so then it looks like we need to pop these out right yeah those are just spacers oh yeah that pops right out just make sure the breaker is off you want to be very safe that is the first thing to do this is the voltage checker it's on and deep it's blue I am checking to see if these wires are hot now I'm going to twist this around the ground and then twist on this cap you want me to tell you what to do next no sir I know what I'm doing whew it's been stripped you look great naked okay missed out hot you get in there now we have our switch fully attached to the wiring we just need to pop it into that nice little area let's it sorry oh oh that just snapperhead look at that sleek now we just need a sleek Kaba for the sleek sweat what's really cool about these whisper switches is the plates are interchangeable and you can change them up depending on your deck or you can do a matte finish you can do different colors so it's really nice to be able to integrate that as part of your design whoa oh that is very satisfying Oh Kate did a wonderful job installing that switch very impressed Kate I'm gonna install the other plugs and stuff first so then we'll turn on the breaker well I love these lights okay what have you ever seen a plug like that no I don't see no plug in the track huh you tricking me press it Oh three plugs nope three yeah it's not so cool when you're doing a curling iron situation and you need sighs barrels plus your blow-dryer plugged in you might need three plugs go ahead press one port every day those are those are the things that excite me oh okay all right so we are installing these next to the vanity they are downstream from a GFCI plug because obviously whatever you're working around wet areas such as in your bathroom you need to have things protected by a GFCI because you don't want to get shocked installing these plugs are super easy you basically need to do three things connect the ground connect the hot connect the neutral put the plug in the wall screw it in put the beautiful face plate on it and press the pop-out when you want it push it in when you know we installed these speakers in the wall which we're actually supposed to go in the shower but we were kind of like yeah we don't really want them in the shower so we actually decided to put them outside of the shower next to our medicine cabinets they look really cool because they're a gold finish it's just cool that we have music in our bathroom it just feels like a spa now it is electrical day guys we are totally pimping out our house with these the ground such as joey is installing one in the kitchen that has a USB plug in it which is really cool because for me personally when I come home from a long day at work my phone is like basically dead and I want to cook dinner and use my phone as a timer look up recipes the days of having to use those little chunky square plugs for your phone charger are gone you just plug the USB right into the wall done charge USB wash my face wash okay guys call me crazy but the shampoo bottles the conditioner bottles are the various colors that come on the packaging that you buy from the store are not in my color palette so I'm going to take it upon myself to transfer them into some beautiful bottles this is a really easy DIY project because these amber jars are really inexpensive you can buy them in bulk on places like Amazon it's really easy to transfer whatever contents are in the bottles that you use regularly in the shower like shampoo conditioner body wash whatever you can get jars you can get bottles with pump tops you can get spray bottles and they're really just a beautiful natural tone I'm also doing a eucalyptus spray which guys I highly recommend this will transform any average shower into like a spa steam shower oh it's my sinuses are very clear now okay what little problem what do you mean I don't like those words I may have miscalculated something what's wrong well the water works that's good we don't have a toilet this beautiful new toilet doesn't come with a toilet seat what what are we supposed to do it's a gaping hole our old toilet wasn't that old I could pull the seat of about one we have brand new toilet and we've just sit on the same old seed that we've been sitting on it's not it's not that old though but that's a part the texture buds before and now it's gonna judge yourself guys so it's like two years old it's got history oh you're the master of the throne so find us a seat I got our to do it flushes don't waste water we're in a drought got these waterproof labels also off Amazon and my plan was to just use them on the jars with a sharpie so you could go that route but kind of thinking that it might be cooler and more vintage looking to use acrylic paint with a paintbrush and do just like one letter to stand for whatever is in the bottle which conveniently spells ESC escape escape to your own shower get these in the shower not only do we have the big niche for the tall bottles but we did a separate smaller niche for the bars of soap Joanne I don't use body wash we actually both have our own so and then I found these amazing soap dishes that are just their brass with black and they are the ones that like drain out so that soap doesn't sit in water it's just so Zen and looking I'm excited to shower Oh so dust in here oh yeah this'll work [Music] yeah it'll work yeah I mean this is super clean screaming hey what I found the other seat we're good it works what do you mean uh no it's never going wait no it's not did you disinfect it No so you're just touching it it's just our butt cheeks what you poop on the seat Julie no well then what's wrong with it the poop flex balance up oh yeah the aroma fits like a glove Kate's like weirded out by it but she'll get over it it's got memories F can you just actually please sit right now I'm gonna wash my hands first no it's okay just sit just sit what are you doing you're so weird oh my god this is perfect so Joey's testing out the toilet and I'm like ding ding ding he looks like the thinker you know the thinker he's like this I'm not touching my face just the back of your hand no Joey it's like I just replaced the toilet see I'm not touching the back of my hand just the back you can use the back here here yeah now lean forward icon it yeah oh I'm just doing a rough sketch you know we can't complete a space without doing some sort of DIY I didn't want to go crazy with the art on the walls because the tile in the shower is really a work of art so I got a black frame with a nice white mat and I want to do something kind of fun that has a sense of humor because you guys know I have kind of a weird sense of humor and so we need to infuse that into the bathroom because otherwise it wouldn't be our bathroom call and something there's the thinker he's not the finger heats up super simple to the point just I like my oh look at you the thinker yeah the good thing about store-bought frames are really easy to change out the art so if I ever get sick of looking at a silhouette of joeys sitting on the toilet I can easily change it out and put myself on the toilet other styling elements in the bathroom it's okay to change up your towels and not all have matching so you can see I'm placing a white bath towel on our towel rack and then using these really cool grey towels as our hand towels which I like using darker hand towels because when you're getting your makeup off and using them to dry your face your hands sometimes they can get dirty and a gray or black disguises those things the shower is amazing it has a big 12 inch drain head with just Cascades water and then we also have the hand shower which is the one I use the majority of the time and I'm not going to toilet a cute little aloe vera plant you know when you need just a quick little moisturizing piece of leaf you could just rub it off there and rub it wherever you need it this vanity is so cool you guys like literally we can store all of our products that we're not using in the medicine cabinet there's Center drawers which are nice and deep so they can hold all of our bottles the cabinets and this vanity are so cool because we have plugs so the blow-dryer the curling iron that stuff can be plugged in there without having messy tangled cords on top nothing is allowed on the counter top Zen Zen Zen this bathroom is so complete it's petite complete love it I hope you guys do too [Music] you you [Music] the batter is done pinkie though perfect I'm gonna take sure no I called it a fight I'll shave at our new vanity okay you such a good artist well not my best you're a really good electrician I am I'd learn from from you yeah and all your googling you just learn from the whisper switch oh my gosh I'm obsessed with our bathroom you guys this has been as you know a really long time coming that we finished that room and I'm so happy with how it came together we have the mix of the bold shower with the very serene vanity it's like the perfect combo of elements

welcome to office bull on the road one of these and we took you behind the scenes as we transform mr. P Studios into our dream creative space this season we're hitting the road with the perfect sponsor staples to makeover the offices of our fellow entrepreneurs who need our help in today's episode we are heading to Lord danger a production company in the heart of Hollywood California specializing in producing unique commercials and viral videos we will be working with Lord dangers creator Josh with the goal of pulling the main room in the office together giving him desk space for his production crew a snack station and also making the entry area of the office a style statement to all that enter the Lord danger zone this beef has some unique challenges because it's small and josh needs as many workstations as possible to inspire his creative team Josh we I even left a comment on the fact that we have competing high and tight I feel like his is higher it's definitely higher so only can I talk to strangers about this is your production office these are products you're a producer in Hollywood California right right in the hectic chaos at the center with all the history around you there's a club downstairs which gets a little crazy at night sometimes no way yeah like banging club techno you guys work like all hours of the day when you're in whatever the project demands yes when you're in production on something you have a team of people obviously come in you have like your director that might be here your commercials right we do commercials we do some TV show things we do music videos branding content whatever the client asked for did you put up this denim wall I did not put up the denim wall that was here when we got here what are your guesses you know who was in here before I think Jing COEs from the 90s the excited I need to cut them up and do some public there was so much fabric on the wall you have your office on the other side of this wall this area that we're in right now is sort of where when you bring in your production staff so every time you do a production you hire your act yeah this is this will be the bullpen you know we've got just like kind of some random desks in here for now but when we go into production you know a production coordinator the interns they'll be sitting in here with paperwork and computers and all that so it's got to look like you mean business it's kind of look like you're legit school what you are I try religion but you want to maximize that entry space to for work people attending there exactly we have you know only so much space and there's so many different things we need to use the space before this series it's all about office goals and it's your office right so we want you to really get your hands dirty and I don't know if any one towards you but the first thing you gonna do is paint all this okay I know it's like it's what happened to you that's what happens when you start a business you know before you can pay people to do it for you you got to be willing to do it yourself it's the only way to like so if you need a pep talk this can be your partner and Josh and laddie we're gonna leave call me when you're done work all right the Hollywood streets Joey all right it's definitely better than this bright way to tell you that laddie what do you think of the pink oh I think this is soothing you get more work done I agree I realized why I didn't do this for a living all of a sudden hey look you gotta do your job I'm doing mine Lord okay so we have two different species on this plan yeah so this is the entryway receptionist or if someone needs to work there whatever yeah but then the best part is we're gonna put the sign yeah yeah neon white neon against the dark grey paint look so wall so painting all of this fatty well painting just one side so doesn't become like a closed-in space we're gonna make this they're sort of Hall of Fame right yeah basically a gallery wall they do such cool productions and they have all the behind the scenes photos of those productions so rather than them being like movie posters it's like cool behind the scenes of like the different characters and videos they worked on which is really cool so then you go in through this door into here Josh refer to it as the bullpen basically we're trying to take this small room and give them as much desk space as possible but also giving them a little snack bar kind of area - okay so these are cabinets cabinets that are melted because they have all of those binders you know like for each production they do they have like the big binders where they have all the information right so they need a place to store those so custom-built tea desk with wall cabinet above yeah the reason to do this tea shape is because two people can meet across the table from each other well and someone can also sit over here two people can either work here or meet together okay right okay cool so should we go check on Josh Oh 'we have a date planned for us I see I'm taking you on a date what put something together for you oh no no no I don't know about that what is it these are your heads that's okay I'm really prepared of other feet Oh yoga not you silly come on what are you a t-rex dinosaur d up work never stops sorry guys hello we pushed the call time back two hours because the client then I gave you the number give them a call you know I'm kind of painting an office right now if I'm be honest with you no it'll be fine they're on their way sorry guys hey Kate is this a design element you were hoping to leave on the wall or should we peel and paint that I guess I'll leave it for now I want to take too many artistic liberties here [Music] but it gets better what we can make him right absolutely [Music] [Music] Donuts Rossdale I just kind of one takes that it's nice and warm you're the bossiest date it's very messy mm-hmm what emoji I'm meeting the chocolate chip emoji for those ears yes and I feel like we should leave the doughnut decorating to the professional journal decorators I have to the way you get a box Josh hey what your clear text messages can't wait this is an office it's another entrepreneurial endeavor happening across the street from you so you know I saw that what is in it great thanks no actually you're delicious oh I'm on an emoji donut diet so you never three keep working this is all you've done this is yeah I mean I didn't think this paint that okay yeah take that for me yeah come on yeah I think I need some PAS wait a minute look we take over with all of our entrepreneur in writing have some artwork for the spaces because I just feel like that's the a great way to tell the story of your company and all that and the amazing thing about you is that you have all this awesome photography because you guys do amazing production yeah absolutely so my friend Sela Salone yeah he's an amazing photographer but he comes to does rpts stuff so sorry industry terms like like you sent me so many pictures like so many to choose from it was really hard I wanted to print all that we're doing kind of like a wall of fame in your place so that when people walk in your office they understand what the company is about yeah because these photos are gorgeous and amazing and I love he's an amazing photographer what is that so that's a so in our halo top commercial that we just made this is the remote control that controlled the custom-built robot that we had so I like rolled across the room and it lit up its eyes and talked this was the controller okay wait I have a question okay what's your question where did the name Lord oh yeah that's very important so what we like to represent ourselves as throughout like all our work is some level of the combination of bold beautiful and absurd like if we can do that everywhere like then we're winning you know like and Lord danger kind of has that same sort of ideology it's it is bold it's weird and like you know it's kind of beautiful plate and it is awesome yeah we're trying we're trying we've kind of gone through some different iterations for about a year so we were working out of my second bedroom so as me and my producing partner and then when we staffed up there'd be like three or four desks in the living room and I live with my girlfriend who have a cat and it just got insane you know it's a sphinx I don't have you seen those hairless sphynx so it's adorable but it's kind of like the worst traits of a dog and a cat combined it's like 50 hours in the other room like incessantly it's super I guess so so the goals are bold beautiful absurd and no more working out of the guest bedroom with the sink scat exactly we want to show that we have got a nice space with that good taste but not pretentious over-the-top we're not trying to pretend to be something we're not so I'm trying to corral here you painted you did a good job painting we got this stuff so you go here any thing crasher bang I'll pay no mind oh my gosh literally a blanket it's a comforter this is like this would make it for me and I'm dressed oh my gosh so Britney and Justin circa early 2000s I thought that means Joey like a monk put this head built this wall it's not here yeah but I really like this plywood no staining this is gonna look cool this window is really weird we should definitely embrace us as like a takeout window like hey I'll take some stain yeah oh did you order some fresh special walnut stain sir well what should I write here at easily I thought we were staining well I'm just gonna stain and then maybe do like you know danger dogs ah I love that danger dog that's a bunny we should do that I'm using this old fabric as my table cloth so we're just embracing all of the screws and the fact that it's like multiple pieces of plywood we're just gonna enhance the woodgrain okay oh yeah [Music] so this is our brain so bring stuff in hang stuff things like that get you forgot some taken fluff thank you I won that's how I work Joey your hair is all over the place

[Music] hello I created weirdo welcome oh my gosh I'm so excited you guys because today we are about to get magical all up in here because this tree next to me yes this rose gold tree we are going to turn into a unicorn tree what is that you guys hear something I don't see anything but I just hear this like Slurpee sound munching huh sorry guys anyways let's keep going so what we are going to do today is we are going to jazz up this tree and it is a little bit of a departure from our sustainable holiday which I've been telling you guys want to do because I did buy the tree new but it is a reusable tree because it's artificial so once I'm done with it I'm gonna store it in a unicorn trunk in my unicorn garage and get ready for next year's unicorn festivities and by the way this tree will notice is rather slim and narrow and that is because it is a pencil tree and that's actually great if you live in an apartment a small space maybe you want a hallway tree or maybe you live with your parents and you want to treat in your room so we are going to deck this tree out with some fun DIY lights and some ornaments and it's just gonna look so magical I'm so excited we might top it off with a unicorn horn thing because no trees complete without a unicorn horn before we get into the decorating and DIY subscribe guys because we are trying to get to 1 million subscribers and when we get there one of you will win a $10,000 room transformation so make sure you subscribe and also thumbs up the video the thumbs up will kind of like unicorn horns all right so let's get magical and start with the first DIY so we have to jazz up these twinkle lights for this tree they have to be unicorn friendly so to do that we are using a strand of LED starry lights and these are plugin but you can so get some battery-operated what's great about these is the lights are really small and they're also really cool like they don't get really hot because their LEDs up great so it won't melt the hot glue and then I just have some feathers you can use any kind of feather you want I'm using white feathers but you could totally use colorful feathers whatever you like and then some hot glue to adhere them to the Strand I'm just going every few lights and hot gluing the feathers to the Strand I find it easier to place a little dollop of glue on the base of the feather first and then lay it down on the Strand because this is easier than trying to place glue onto the wire itself this looks amazing you can add as many as you like you can add glitter feathers there's so many options with this but I like this nice simple with the white all right you look amazing they look whimsical let's get them on the tree [Music] I love this DIY to jazz up some store-bought ornament balls you can get them in any color you want we got an assortment of these pastel they're like frosty and some are shiny but I'm going to use all the frosty ones and put mr. Keith beauty marks on them and the doodles packet is perfect because it has unicorns in it and all kinds of fun mix metallics and black so I'm just cutting out the different shapes and starting with this unicorn head and cutting it out and then I have a nice little paper towel with a spray bottle with water and I am saturating the paper towel and of course peeling off the plastic protective covering over the tattoo and then just placing it face down fully saturating the back of the paper and then once it's saturated you just peel off the paper and tada you have a decorated bauble for your tree I love this because we have so many different styles of beauty marks you can literally personalize them in any way you want and they stay on for good it's a really cute gift idea one of these cute little moons on this frosty silver one and then I love that these have a unicorn theme so of course we have to also do unicorn power so many options how to personalize and then unique and I can't wait to get them on the tree [Music] okay so I have moved outside because we are going to use some spray adhesive and more importantly and more fun we are using some iridescent glitter well it's not your doesn't glitter it's like iridescent confetti but we will call it holographic snow guys and it looks amazing so as you can see I have laying here some clear balls or bobbles as we call them for the tree and these are amazing because they're see-through these are actually plastic but you could use glass ones as well and then I also have these pink icicles which are icicles but hello let's just totally call them unicorn horns because that's what they look like and then I have this snow which is called Buffalo snowflakes but again we are going to be calling this iridescent snow or holographic snow because it just looks so pretty and then just some spray adhesive here and also a funnel which makes it easier to get our holographic snow in to the bottles so first step I am just going to open up one of these bobbles and you can just take off the top and then this funnel is really useful to get the holographic snow inside the ball you could just kind of pour it in but this wider opening makes it easier and I'm just kind of using my finger or maybe I'll use one of these unicorn horns to poke it down in there and it looks so cool it's like filled up it's like its own little unicorn universe inside this ball oh and we have a beautiful ornament filled with snow I want to go there alright now let's put some of this holographic snow on the outside of the balls and this is really easy with some sprays he said I'm just gonna spray the outside and then roll it around and it looks so cool oh my gosh look how amazing I also want to go to this planet now let's get some of this iridescent snow onto these icicles aka unicorn horns and again just spray adhesive onto the tip for this one roll it around in our snow and it looks so cool and then you could also do like a full-on snow covered horn and I'm also going to leave some uncovered because I just like the way they look uncovered but it's just like a fun mix to have all of these and we're done let's get these on the tree [Music] when I was thinking that a tree topper for the unicorn tree hello I have a unicorn horn and let me just tell you a little bit about the stuffed unicorn horn I got it for a photo shoot where we were using a course and this is a special unicorn horn that is supposed to go on a horse so you guys might not have a unicorn horn at home the utility DIY this with a stone pointy cone fabric and then stuff it and then wrap a ribbon around to get that kind of like spiral effect so I am taking this pre-made horn and then just wrapping it with some more of these LED lights these are battery-operated and they are different color lights which is super cute so I'm just going to wrap these up and I think this is going to be the perfect tree topper for the unicorn trees [Music] [Music] ah um wait what guys magic is definitely afoot today I don't know what's happening the magical time of year wait how did it get I the DIY but then I don't remember putting stuff on the tree okay it's I mean it looks really good it looks so it looks so good it looks so cute I'm scared and delighted all the same time guys so cute unicorn power I remember making this but I don't remember putting this on the tree okay okay guys thank you so much for a olney this has been obviously very magical experience and this is my version of a unicorn tree but of course you guys are your own special unicorns like snowflakes no unicorn is the same no unicorn tree is the same so I cannot wait to see what you guys do with your unicorn trees so please share your photos using hashtag mr. cake

[Music] hey guys we're I know that on a set in the mr. gates - yeah bill yeah we're upping our game here now we have a room where we can experiment and it's all about experimenting with design and decorating for you guys you're going to be doing threeways DIY headboards you guys love the bedroom oriented videos because the hard place for people to decorate put yourself first your bedroom is very important and we have an amazing sponsor today which makes a lot of sense for headboards because it's a mattress company lisa zappy rub mattress Pyrrha we're gonna whip you out a little bit so we'll show you that we got a good deal for that to stick around talking about okay I'm really excited cuz it's a very luxurious mattress it's a combo of Springs and memory foam and I might just need to take a nap in between some of these because we are going to be doing some heavy lifting DIY which is exactly why joey is here today to help me out I encourage you guys if you're doing large-scale projects to phone a friend sure mm-hmm so look we're we get to show you guys a bunch of different styles of course all of you creative weirdos out there have your own unique perspective so we're gonna be doing three very different headboard styles and of course styling around them but up photos do it subscribe guys oh yeah what do we you going at the high one okay the worst move [Music] I miss Kate okay so for this birth headboard we are going to do a plywood headboard now this is for those of you that love the more minimalist industrial loft vibe basically the cheapest headboard you can make yeah because we're you gonna use one piece of plywood 8 by 4 right 4 by 8 8 by 4 plus we got an extra piece to make the ship rather than bringing in additional side table we're making the headboard longer than the actual bed width it'll look very raw how I do with the show I mean they shouldn't be too wide it's just where you put like a glass of water look see you later hall like you need even I'm gonna be compiling all the styling supplies all right so I got my circular saw and then I have a piece of tile and I'm just using it as my straightedge under my cut I'm gonna use some tape just keep it from splintering too much safety goggles on here we go I got my shelf piece 3/4 of an inch you just want to make sure it's thick enough because we're going to drive some screws into here to keep it mounted I'm gonna make the shelves 14 inches each which if I had a pencil thank you all right so you could use your circular saw for this but I'm gonna use this saw because it's gonna give me a little bit of a cut you don't have any saws or any tools like this the hardware store will totally cut things for you so you can just go in with your measurements I have the tools that's cut [Music] all right so I got all my shelves caught now it's time to mount them to the plywood the way we're going to mount this is using these bad boys which are called one second structural wood screws I've got my wood clamps just to keep it straight up for me while I drill six inch drill bit [Music] [Applause] in order to mount these to the wood I'm gonna have to screw in from the back so I need to know where my holes were that I drilled I'm just taking a piece of paper just going to mark where they are so now I have my map and that's what I'm going to use to drill into the other piece of wood all right we're gonna decide on the side and this side has like some marks on it when you're going for the industrial lives you're embracing the rawness of things yeah this is gonna be gonna be I think it's gonna yeah match on both sides and another one kind of like about here all right so I got my holes marked okay [Music] treasure map are those all coming through yep and they're lined up into the lid whoo look you guys we have our three ledges and then what's so great is you just prop this big piece of wood on the floor you don't need to mount to the wall the boxspring and the mattress will hold it we've chosen to put the boxspring directly on the floor to give it that platform bed low to the ground look wait that is the mattress yeah oh it sounds like Rob Stan like he used to cost thousands of dollars the quality of this mattress is like equivalent to like a ten thousand dollar mattress which is crazy that there's ten thousand dollar mattresses by the way anyways well that's really soft I'm getting a versatile oh here put it on I'm not kidding right now this is really can you get up oh wow all right we're done great that's the room perfect minimalist we don't need sheets [Music] you need a hand oh yeah thanks [Music] Wow looks so good it's a styling I went really simple we've got a beautiful linen do they cover matching pillows I love these like cage lamps old camera and an old suitcase keeping it really minimal this lair minimalist modern industrial tada edible high-five I don't have it so enjoy this room but first let's cue the reveal [Music] [Music] alright guys I'm so excited for this next one we're calling it the upholstered nailhead mermaid scalloped headboard okay it's a long name what we're working on it we're using the same piece of plywood and I love the look of an upholstered headboard you guys saw us do that tufted bench video which you can also do that DIY as a headboard so it's a really beautiful option if you want like a rectangular bed today we're gonna do a scalloped sheep shell shape clam shell so mark a foot half head 12.5 [Music] where you going man where are you going oh I was all original line I told you need so this is a plate sure you guys are familiar this is gonna be our template for our circle shape that's gonna be our scallop sheet here we go here we go smart we're gonna try to get like the right art sketched out first and then we can put our scallops [Music] there's our scallop pattern so now I have to cut it out we have our jig sauce I'll think DIY and supplies this is not a solid use of you on a straight line and you can rent these again if you don't have one [Music] it's fun we want to trim it so I'm just resting the scissor against the wood and just kind of cutting around my scalloped shape [Music] all right so there is our scallops some piece essentially the same sheath it's just going to make our life easier if this foam is anchored to woods I'm using a little hot glue to just make sure that is the case boom is really what pads it initially and then this adding since it's flexible is the one we go around back just smooth the edges probably should do two layers of this let's flip her over them all right so you can cut the slit to help you sort of loop around these scallops or you can just pull it really tight into that crease we're going to hang this like a big picture all right here's our fabric look at this beautiful kind of minty silk satin because this is just silky fabric it's just like a cotton muslin underneath it but our platter of spiky things so these brass dome nail heads are very simple like look how pretty that looks with a mint okay so we're getting our first nail head down in the center so this is a rubber mallet so it's not going to damage the head of the nail head boom see that's the pearl oh that's a pearl in the oyster shell now we're going to go out from in either direction so just ensure that you're using the excess of your fabric to flow away and make sure that it's nice and taut [Music] this looks so magical you guys so I'm starting with the center one and just kind of pulling the excess Oh glad that didn't don't you Peter [Music] hold on feel secure let's get the bed back the Madrid mattress move in an end great that's pretty light oh I could sleep through that okay yeah I'm a bad to me [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Wow how cute of this we kind of went from like little girls room to like a slightly more elevated it's like a deconstructed under-the-sea nautical theme good job good job so we have the pale pink these things that sort of lends the idea of water and I love the copper accent course this is our DIY copper ladder and this is also our DIY twinkle lights can we redecorate our bedroom like them no what's next cute what's nice leave it forever no we got one more to go [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh my gosh okay so I'm obsessed with everything we've done so far such different rooms so now we have these vintage frames this when we got on the side of the road this giant one obviously they have no glass in them but that is good because we are going to use these to create oh okay oh well it's gonna be exciting so what we're doing it we're gonna make bellies on the wall yeah like actually putting pillows on the walls a headboard it's like a cool idea putting fabric onto the wall stuffing it looks like a little mound little village agreement that's funny so we're not actually putting the belly in the frame we're putting the boat in the wall and just putting the frame on top and belly we're gonna be done with this ten minutes yep all right guys these are the beautiful fabrics that we've chosen for this DIY is losen see how these really ornate cream for kind of going a little bit more eclectic but elegant [Music] before I cut the fabric I want to make sure that I'm cutting enough excess so that I can stuff it when it's on the wall using like this pillow is really helping me be able to see where I should cut it I've cut this piece of fabric basically to size and a little bit abut okay trim to excess fabric around and now we're going to tensile under Diego's belly oh my gosh okay maybe the weirdest DIY ever flash best flash cutest flash and wish she is these smaller ones we can use a technique that I think will probably be easier where we staple up three sides then stuff it with leuh stuffing the trick here obviously is leaving some slack so you have room to stuff [Music] I feel leaving the Pink Sheets off yeah let's leave these pink sheets on cuz it's very in right now he's really well with these muted tones so this is a beautiful duvet cover you obviously floral but it's really tiny flowers which has that like very vintage look to it how she good oh my gosh obviously we have this very vintage inspired print going on the bed we don't need throw pillows Robert blanket exactly we have our throw pillows on the wall obviously there's more clean lines when I'm at these side tables this one has a little marble top has that like found objects me market vibe this lamp which has more mid-century look to it right it's a little bit cleaner yay and going through wait wow [Music] we did it threeways headboards i love them all okay thank you Joey for being amazing horse we want to hear from you in the comments what do you want us to tackle

transformations some of you asked why we put out the shopping blog after we put up episodes and that is because these vlogs are just kind of behind the scenes of everything they don't really want to give away the design by putting out the shopping log first you'll also me my hair be two different colors during the shooting of this vlog because well I was shopping for Lily plays I also went and got my hair chopped off and colored and there is also a blog up about that whole process so I always like to lead in by showing you guys the mood boards and that is what I'm going to do right now I thought I'd try something a little bit different and show you guys new boards while I'm doing a screen recording at the same time is talking to you guys you could kind of see my flailing hands so girls would oh wait duh subscribe guys you want to be one of our creative weirdo family just hit that subscribe button and when we get to 1 million subscribers part of hash tag mr. gate 1 million we will pick one of you lucky subscribers to win a $10,000 room transformation oh my gosh so let's get into these mood boards and I'm going to show you here the first mood board which is a Lilly's bedroom if you don't know the mood boards are what I build based off of inspiration images that the client see to me so I said to her give me three to five images that you just like it could be the style space it could be just something in particular in the space just so that I can get into their heads on this mood board for Lily bedroom she's a bit image right here the one that kind of has these like sort of persimmon colored walls the yellow bed the pink accents clean lines as you can see also please note the dark gray and the white here within this photo with really grounds these colors so this was like my main inspiration image for Lily's room however she said fun fact I hate orange so I kind of built around this and I pulled out these colors appear this yellow the pink and the purple I actually sent really a ton of images of text on the wall and one of the images was this in it and she would like actually there's something really cool about that but in thinking of what we're going to write you like what about the song anyway if you guys saw the video we ended up doing that Bob Marley quote I really kind of put stuff on a mood board to disease there's any red flags so I put like this sort of mid-century light this that obviously is like tufted and a little more pillowy I put this very like unique looking vanity with the flip up thing and she didn't come back with any red lights like that the only thing she just wanted to emphasize that she doesn't like orange I was like you've got you've got it girls moving on we were at the office the big challenge with her office is that it's really petite and she wants to be able to fit four people in that room so as you can see there's a different vibe going on here so colorful but we're kind of clean with more of a rainbow palette I love this really bold Texans kind of needed blue a little whiteboard wall you will also notice her superwoman logo in black and white and that was a real specific thing because we want to make her custom lit up we'll go to go on the wall then I really like the black and white one because I really wanted to do a rainbow painting on the wall and I just love the idea of the impactful black and white standing off all those colors okay so let's move on to be shopping board for the bedroom now so this is the bed and actually Joey found this one he like helped me on freaking out I'm like they need to yell a little bit I also have this image of this gray linen high-quality Silver Logie Dino I like using when the bedding I did a big patch of this pink on the mood board which is the color that I'm going to try to go for on her walls it's so bold and so decided and then of course as you can see we at the yellow one and the headboard so we need to do the rule of three repeat the color three times to kind of justify especially in a color blocked room when you are just introducing like a random other color and I need to do these other things or modern feeling like these nice modern clean lamps this vanity amazing got the pop-up it's got the clean lines Greymon and curtains because we're going to have pink on the wall I was like really need to let that pink have its moment you can really see the balance of like bright colors grounding colors of the white in the gray alright let's move on to the shopping board for the office they put our logo here with the white which in our case that will be painted and then it will be the black and white logo sign and I'm going to get three of these low back white desk chairs and one high back white desk chair with the higher back one will be for her so I'm really happy with all these things bubble regular shop in stores let me just show you some of the online stores here that I chose to peruse and with Lily like in clean lines I was like okay cb2 is perfect because they're like sleek and nice and good quality I also shopped wet and overstock is a great go-to for me I love to get like comforters it's like eBay insert pillows when I can't find something I'll either use Google shopping or I will use how to like pull stuff from a whole bunch of different sites so you can save images inspiration images and then you can also shop products but you have to make sure you're actually searching in the product section and all the inspiration section because you'll be like I'm going to buy that and it'll be like someone's room and then I also have Amazon here because there's like so anything from like oh my gosh I need a TV now okay guys so that's the deal with the mood boards on the cabin boards and online shopping now we could go to stores we actually have to get these packages to arrive and unpack them and make sure that they're not broken and then everything came in the right color here at living spaces feel good about it I'm going to see what bedside table thing on here just to make sure there isn't anything better than the ones I got already you need a floor mirror and I need a desk floor me Randolph they actually have really cool accessories here under those we need these for her office oh I see form your oh my Catterick sweet you fancied the spices awesome look at this gigantic one it's really cool but I think it's a little too glittery for her but then look at this one you guys I feel like this one might be it all right Cheers desk and woo look at this one that's so cool that is a box lady's desk I ever saw and how gorgeous about you guys okay I do like this night in a lot because it's a really good sign it's really good praise to the nightstands I ordered smaller than this one okay I'm going to seem too happy I mean I can cancel as I ordered okay I'm in pillow land there's a man hiding over there woman no he's hiding but no I'm hiding from all right here is my collection on the car I got these two leaf these things for the office and getting this to the office me me for her death I'm going to go with that rad glass death with the gold legs and then I'm getting me two options for her bad okay I am going to cancel those nightstands that I just ordered on Amazon I'm getting those bigger white ones I have white lamps to go on top and it can be really clean those clean lines fresh fresh fresh I am he in your hat done Edward so I'm here to pick out like a million colors of pink let's go so I grab some like one of pink I don't know man this is hard it is hard color to pick and then I have all of these here you just want them all to sort of be in the same family and then obviously have it mimic this enough that like she's going to see and go like oh yeah that's my superwoman colors so this is very forming go over the paint of Dahlia and I pull these braids this cuz that's like the color of the bedspread and then obviously there's gonna be white going on in there twos which is kind of nice see how they'll all play together okay guys I'm waiting for my paint to get mixed I ended up getting samples of the three wall colors that they like the such an important decision I want to test it so let me show you what I got for those three tests and also for the rainbow wall I went with the lighter ones so thinking about how intense pain usually ends up looking when it's up on the wall and so I went for like as a lighter family and it's going to be the wall color it's just really pretty muted blue and then over here these are the three colors I got for the bedroom so I think this colors so beautiful but I just want to see what it looks like on the wall and then I got this color that's like a super light gray for the lyric wall to go on whatever we want my 16gb DVD we are here we are prepping your parking there's lots of seating and lots of things to unload and I'm going to test those paint samples that is number one on my agenda alright let's go do this might be a sample to see gosh I walk along this is all we have so he oh you do alright we have the pink Dalia there it is we picked it up we're heading back to office now I'm going to go through all of the online items okay see and I all right guys here it is got my box cutter which today is you can I drew the box cutter somewhere but as you can see in this room is enough so as soon as we're done pulling everyone else's life together it will hopefully pull our lives together I found these two different rolls of tape so I'll do like office/bedroom so any boxes for the office I'll put blue tape on any honest if you're gonna fit okay that means to also this stepladder is for the office because we're doing this the way for wall and the whiteboard calendar honors you always get up easily [Music] okay Joey and I are in the car we've a crazy game we have a little bit of time it's not by the hardware store and we are doing that because we want to see if there is a countertop that is 10 feet long which we use have a desk top surface for Lily's office this is as long as it gets 97 inches okay so should we look at countertops in like the kitchen section oh I'm calling me Sophie um hello well we as at IKEA with the countertops and we're at Lowe's with a kiln ago yeah all right so moral of the story we took pictures we know what it looks like we know this option and then we're just going to make a miniature we're going to Ikea and it's not peanut way oh look at my hell burger okay guys I am at Target and I'm getting Lily just some accessories for her bedroom I found these adorable little so yellow flowers and this pink candle and look at how amazing these are think I got to get both of these well how cute are these little so succulent like

what I see here apparently I can't draw a circle while I swear I know how to decorate rooms [Music] hello my create a weird of the welcome to another shopping vlog I guess thought into the office what up the outside your bling in it is a shopping vlog for Alicia Marie's white retro-inspired hostel Palm Springs room that you guys have already seen this video is all about the shopping for that room now guys it's gonna be different shopping log if you couldn't tell by the title I didn't shop for anything in stores so because I shop this entire video online I thought it was a perfect opportunity to actually answer a question I get a lot from you guys which is how to decorate an entire room on line that's whether you I would make up my computer and we will go shopping together yeah my office is calling oh there's Joey and there she is okay I'm singer now my dad opened up all the necessary programs so yeah let's get into it in my case Joey Knight went over to Alicia's place and we just spent some time in the room I chatted with her about her hopes for this beige her design style etc well Joey gates the measuring of the space and now the way that Joey does that is he has this little book and he just measures and kind of draws like a very rough floor plan so that and just gets the shape of the room and inputs all of those measurements and then once we're back at the office on our computers we lay out the floor plan which I will show you in a later step but it is very important that you get your measurement and it's also very important that you do like what I did here you take before photos so as you can see these are just iPhone photos I took I like to have them on my phone because later when I am buying stuff for the space I want to be able to look and visually see the space again so aside from this one time I went it only time I was ever in the space before I then went and shopped for it so there were certain aspects of this room like where the bed was on this wall and where the vanity was here and also the TV being like in this you know area corner that I was like okay this is working with the floor plan so mental note so that line we've analyzed the room in the existing state and we're ready to move on to step two so inspiration photos are really important to get inspired painting the obvious it is really important when you're working with somebody else because this is the opportunity for you to get into their heads so I always ask remember I'm working with two please send me two to five not more than five usually photos that inspire them that day look at and they go Emma got gold this is what I want my face to look like and so that way I am seeing the world through their eyeballs so to speak these are the photos that Alicia herself sent me GRU went a little crazy at the two to five she sent me more but it's cool because I could see from these images what she was thinking so as you can see by this room here it is very bohemian now what is bohemian about this room well there's a sheepskin here aged wood there's sort of rumpled linens there's another furry pillow here the walls are distressed there's hanging plants this is very very bohemian but then hang on a second she didn't make my life easy oh no because she also sent me this image and also this image so now what do we see about these rooms not really bohemian right definitely way more mid-century look at this sort of tapered legs of this bench these clean lines here of this headboard I also looked at these other elements here so there's a nice clean mirror here there's a cactus you know again the like this plant stand here very very mid-century here we have pale pink we have a poop on the floor and then she sent me this photo which I adore and was a huge jumping-off point for a DIY project so that I wanted to do which is take a picture of her wearing hat in her pool so now you guys can see how I've analyzed these photos so let's get on to the next step I cannot emphasize enough to you guys how important a proper floor plan is for a successful room because you literally dream too big first base like some of that I'm going to do this I'm going to do this I'm going to do this and then it doesn't fit or another trap people fall into is they're afraid of something fitting in the space so they buy something too small and so then the scale is just all off so scale is so important for successful design and floorplan is key for that especially when you're ordering stuff online because you're not seeing it in person you have to pay really close attention to the dimensions of something and make sure you're able to input that into your floor plan speaking of floor plan the program that I love to use if planner 5d and its planner 5d dot-com and you can create a profile and you can create projects and lay out your floor plan we'd take measurements that Joey's written in his book and input those into the program it's really user friendly I'm just going to kind of show you some of the basics so this is Alicia's bedroom empty you have this long hallway here we have her fireplace here we have the doors to her outside balcony we have the window this will bore her bed was so this is our jumping-off point it's super easy to lay this out you literally just like I was saying input all of your measurements so that you know that the room in your planner finds is the same size as your actual room because it helps you get the perfect size items like I'm telling you don't want too small you don't want too big you want it perfect so another things you're also thinking about is walkway space which you can totally see in a floor plan as well you want to try to have at least 3 feet in the main walkways and then you can get away with like 22 inches in between furniture items that are less of like a path and then I'm going to open up I have another one here that is actually the same room but with furniture input into it I haven't finished laying in all the furniture yet just like to show you guys some of that [Music] looking at this floorplan overhead I can see that there's a little bit of a naked area here so way to remedy dot would be to put a rug down so go the simple one here boom that's gorgeous so the king-sized bed you want a nice big cozy rug so I'm loving this side I think this is going to make it really cozy remember the scale the furniture should match the scale of the room and let's go into 3d mode so you just press on the 3d button and tell me you're outside Alicia's room let's step inside shall we this is a really helpful tool to be able to see all right that space looked okay from overhead but does it look okay inside the room now that I'm looking at this room in the room I feel like this corner wants something so definitely going to keep that in mind now we're going to move on to the mood board everything I'm showing you guys is an essential part of the design process because the mood board is essentially the map it is taking the elements that I plan to put in the room and put them all on a board together so I can show the client or whoever I'm working with and we can be on the same page and this is the mood board that I created and sent to Alisha I have the bohemian room here I have the more composed mid-century room here and I also have this room showing marble wallpaper because I really want to do that in her space and so of course I had to have that somewhere represented so that she could see it which by the way guys she approved this mood board there may be a red flag on the mood board where someone's like you know I love it except this one thing so that is really another test for me to kind of see if there are any like earth moments for people and there weren't any which is great and then obviously I pulled and the reference image here she had sent me this one I found this one just again representing that vibe of the pool photo with the Hat that I really want to take so this is just really how the mood board came together and she loved it and now the harder part comes where I have to take the already existing photos of rooms that are not Alicia's and make them real life by doing some very careful very purposeful shopping when you're going to be decorating a space the way that we decorate a space would just go in and just boom install in one day obviously you have to have shopped every single element so the way to do that and the way to make sure that you don't go over budget is to create a spreadsheet so I like to use a Google spreadsheet and basically there's an estimated ballpark number for the entire space which you guys can come up with what you're comfortable spending etc and then what I like to do is I take that estimated budget and I fill it in for all the items that I need to get for the space and you see how specific I'm getting with each thing and don't forget about things like deliveries and an install or if you need to be an installer for well paper etcetera just try to get all that itemized out into your guesstimate and that way it's also easier to go shopping for those things because you can go all right I love the set but how much did I a lot for myself and then it's also a great way to figure out where you can save money so like in certain cases of you know the art and photo and frames right there I'm like alright we're going to DIY it we're going to DIY a picture of her we're not going to be spending money on any expensive artwork because we're making it ourselves then once you start shopping I also do actual budget actual cost so budget is boring but necessary and essential time for step 6 so I said this before in some of the shopping blogs where I'm actually going into stores but really important to think about once you have your mood board and you know your vibe of the space you know your style of the space you can think about what stores fit that vibe now as you can see I have the floorplan open I always have the floorplan nearby whenever I'm shopping online because the dimensions are so important so as I am falling in love with the items as I'm visiting these websites I go hang on before I fall to and love is this going to fit is this going to work so this is a shopping board that I built while I was shopping for Alicia so every single piece that I liked that I net confirmed would work with the budget and would also work with the floor plan I dragged the product listing image onto a new clean board in Photoshop so that I could see how they all played together because the way that I personally like to design is to not do sets of things so even though this bed came with you know matching chairs and stuff like that I didn't want to get a matching chair to that bed I want to do things that complement each other and just surprising just more nuance so what I do is I put all that stuff in my cart and before I check out I make sure that it's all working together so I will spend a good two solid days just on my computer just troubleshooting like oh wait I like these bedside tables better should I get a different dress or etc I will not check out of any of the carts until I'm sure that every single thing in those cards is what I want so let me check out west oh I go okay no the style is very mid-century and I just would kind of look I'd also look at cb2 another very like clean line please stores like West Elm and cb2 are definitely where you would like get some more of those splurge items those items that she would keep for a long time and then you could fill in with some accessories and things that are easier to change out at stores like IKEA target and Amazon and Wayfarer love so that is how I shop online that is how hopefully you guys will shop online before I end this vlog let's just take a little sneak peek at the actual room and Alisha's seeing the room I got a little bit of behind-the-scenes footage while we were installing space and the day of the install you know of course the most exciting day so let's check that out alright guys we are in Alicia's room we got drop cloths down and look at these rolls of wallpaper here you have to

Kurt what you're looking at right now is a luckiest person on the planet because I get no one more two rooms done by mr. cute and in my opinion these are the two most important rooms my bedroom and my office where I spend most of my time I'm a big believer that you are a product of your environment you have to be around positive lives does mindful smiley okay she has done so many amazing things with herself and her business and her channel I'm excited and I'm also feeling the pressure because she is so fabulous so I have to make sure that these rooms are as fabulous as she this is the first house I've owned ever in my life that is my own and so I've never had the ability to be like I'm gonna do this to the small I'm gonna knock this down I'm gonna nails into the wall I've always had to ask permission so I'm super excited to make this space my own also extremely terrified kind of freaking out man on the floor I'm gonna dull that I fell agreed that you got a king bed no I've never said I've never had I can make my life she's a bed she's a TV and she has suitcase I don't have a bed frame that's not your box we don't like the floor you wanted that friend yeah yeah gonna then um I have a TV it's on this weird stand because my last department didn't have a place to put a TV on the wall but old apartment I had one TV but two rooms so I was like why do be two TV just get a rolling - okay all right how many times you actually roll in the three rooms you know nah this is how I've been living for like a month because since I'm gonna be so busy and I've been craving have a functional space is it disastrous isn't workable I don't miss so work I mean your place is gorgeous I love the floors high ceilings I love no but right now I don't have lines of people send my boobs I change it for this one I need one I feel like that's part of my life I've been very like simple nothing is wrong being simple I'm like I need a mirror let me go get any mirror always choose function no I think that a lot of people are like that like I need what I need when I need is a close cousin I got a room with like that's the role web TV yeah when we originally talked you were like no color like it's my bedroom I say you up to like find some mood for images and you came back with you remember love the color originally she was thinking that she didn't want to do a lot of color in her bedroom because she thought oh that's where I want to kind of escape from color and have it be more neutral but then all of the pictures that she sent me were so colorful in color-block she just said these just feel really good to me I was like scared to commit to the fact that is my place and when I finally got over my fear with the mood boards I was like let's just make it my dream that yeah I mean I know you're around so much color all the time but there's a way to make color peaceful and have and I think that's what I don't know how to do colors really excite me like I freaking overcome okay good okay first things first let's paint these walls okay I tuned I'm not dirt I'm the biggest nerd of the world right now Joey do plan I just feel like one of those like washboard I'm kind of like a country moon mime type or the jacquard Richard or we could just like drop the because Lily's got a little rhyme going in it okay now this pink is like beautiful you guys this is a deep sophisticated pink I'm so impacted by color color makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside I see this beautiful pink it was literally the color of my soul if that excited her she's gonna have her mind blown tonight I want to pick favorites out of one of her doggy colors feeling like I had to be channeling it it would be this one the pink color was the perfect combination like my unicorn side and the fact I like I'm obviously a mature adult it was like a mature unicorn pink Y is exactly so much is because I salute my parents yeah I mean Nina had no choice to judge me like never my parents and I always wanted to pick my room Greg when I was in because I've always had a white room I had to beg my parents like till this day you know I even might they let me pay my room [Music] Oh so I'm thinking there's rules I gotta follow but Joey's I plan to do something underneath the layer of paint and I'm like obviously so I wrote L and an S underneath the paint which the like for the rest of my life I know there's my initials under the wall I don't think there's enough room for me in here excuses excuses here's guys gonna go fight so Joey two rolls of course he's got this we're gonna leave him we can't apini it's a lot I mean it's fun to show the color but then I want to go do arts and crafts this looks so crafty doesn't it yes I'm bringing you options okay for the area by your doorway I don't know the last time I did anything artsy by myself she has this great idea which is creating this whiteboard frame I wanted you to have piece of art there it's just to play it well but then the door kind of opens we kind of anything too big so I know that you love text and words right they mean a lot to who you guys know I like to do a personalized piece of art that's gonna go into the room I was brainstorming different things to do and I know that she's very motivated and inspired by words we'll take a frame white piece of paper I was thinking it could say something along the lines of like today I will be have that just at the top and then we'll frame that with a glass over it and write on it with white more so smooth like that today I will create ah yeah anyways no I love the word create and creative shout out to my creative weirdos Oh Joey are you making a big do I get included in that like whole friend thing [Music] Lily and Kate are like having bestfriend sessions love you ever going to paint I have no friends I'm gonna eat a bagel we can either do like a brush pen so it's kind of more hand done then we have these stickers that we can lay out and then I also found these letter that are wood which we could either use the wood color or we can paint them black I think these are I think they're cool too because you know take cars 360 3-dimensional you're such a good dude we are going to paint these letters black which i think is cool it will just make them stand out more than the natural wood we'll just glue them down making sure to leave a good white space and then of course you can just fill in the blank every day what paint row yeah right now the message what will I create and then you also created this piece of art projecting a line on the wall I walk into the room and there's this like Mission Impossible laser thing your best beyond sorry I think you didn't work that I would just be so abused by this all day long the biggest project in this room is the lyric wall I haven't been able to sleep for the past several days because of this idea of having a mirror all in my bedroom I email you a million pictures nice 22 fingers all the options and then you literally this part I had a Eureka way to send me the sex and I've never seen this before was the complete wall was covered intact yeah and I thought would be really cool to have lyrics to one of my favorite songs just three little birds I have this thing where I have to have one Bob Marley or several Bob are the elements in my home somewhat Kate what if we do the lyrics to the whole song handwritten if that should go on my wall so we're gonna write the lyrics to one of your favorites on you that also has a message about waking up and this is what I love to collaborate on these rooms I wouldn't have thought of that I didn't know she liked Bob Marley and she needed to know that writing on the wall was possible and okay do you love I think Joey's like getting jealous or a friendship and I'm like to get used to it by my doorstep so to do this lyric all we are using the laser level which is pretty crucial because I don't have to draw any pencil lines and it's really important to measure your walls so you know how big the spaces are gonna be for your text I'm gonna write all of the words in pencil and then we'll go over with black paint it's not just gonna be though there's once we repeat it over and over again right yes very good question do you little periods in between I think I do actually it's a story we're telling through and it'll carry your eyes oh she's quoting me she is very much on board with a lyric wall she's like cool you write it I'm so excited okay I'm glad you're excited because that's a good note to leave on because I wanted because I really like a friend are you waiting what do you in it yeah what a surprise artists are you yeah I'm trying to be a good friend yeah I'm gonna need you to fight over you yeah we win so they're kicking me out of the room and I'm not really processing the fact that I'm gonna leave and when I come back like I'll have a room I'm not really comprehending that holdfast know what I'm a member will be done oh my god okay Lily goodbye go nap and I'm just gonna write on your wall I'm gonna do in cursive lettering because she has a lot of block print and I just like the look of the cursive letters it's a little bit more dreamy and you think about a song and especially this song in particular it really does sound like he just kind of penned it on a lovely morning while the birds were singing curtain hanging time where's my watchman and I need so I can sing my country so hang these curtains all day long did it do good and think think think and concur in the curtains curtains Bert and Carrie oh well I'm trying to get this left bowl I can't use the tripod anymore because the tripod is too high up this is my message to you don't worry he's gonna be all right I am worried I'm not listening to the lyrics I know I need some birds pitching by my doorstep [Music] that calming down no Joey I'm going to break out my BB gun in a second I'm using a calligraphy brush kind of a pointed tapered tip and some glossy black paint so it really gets that hand-drawn look like it looks like I used a calligraphy brush right now I'll show you some recessed lights in this room so we're gonna hook her up with a cool semi flush mount multi-tiered round light really good that Hotel vibe when we walk in here light up the whole room just a very peaceful lamp there's so much going on in this room with the color of the walls and the beautiful statement text that I didn't want a crazy light fixture competing with the text wall Lily had the TV on what kind of looked like a thing you would have it like a dentist office gonna make this stationary and put it on the wall [Music] Lili's vibe is so colorful and modern and so we had to really search high and low to find a really unique piece for this vanity we have it's gonna be a flip-top vanity with a glass leg this is not like something you just walk into a store and fine we like hunted for this thing got it oh we are bringing in this vanity and it is so cool similar vanity to the one we put in Megan's room because it flips up in the mirror is underneath and basically becomes a desk but the style is completely different because Lily style is very modern this one has really beautiful clean lines a glossy white top and it has one side that's black you know what I love what okay your favorite four hours I'm just like okay there's in my room I hear bang and I hear things I hear laughing I'm like I'm know what's happening I have no idea I'm really excited but I'm really nervous okay yeah this'll be what piggyback right thank you back well roll it's that time roll out rug time you don't worry me hmm I'm gonna get on Joey's back and he's gonna piggyback roll me roll out the rug she's my baby she can ride on my back I don't care hmm this rug was handmade I'm reading the story about the rub while I'm riding Joey's biggie back and he's only on the rug this rug has been certified as authentically handmade through our collaboration with the nonprofit hey this rug is beautiful it's like a purple velour kind of super soft under your feet lu-shi oh okay okay no no it's a small little package why are you always up to like make it super comfortable three little birds pitch by my doorstep oh I'm saw a spot we need to put the period really gone I'm studying let's go hey Joey Joey we gotta bring in the board and you know what that's gonna establish clariel did you make me coffee Joanie coffee I need you to get a good night's sleep is we got the office to do tomorrow will we had her bed on the floor so we're gonna help her with that the bed is really important she's the king-sized mattress already so we have to bring in a box spring Swedish tricky yeah oh it's a king-sized box when when it comes in two different pieces so really put it together and then we are like laying down the slats which were like what does Dracula sleep in coffin our son called da da da da going this everyone to decorate I can't suck it blood tonight up and dancing wait what is my head total of desire if your love way down further no this is how the vampire sleep really important we of a king-sized bed is to have a nice-sized side table you do not want a small bedside table next to a giant bed behind the bed we're gonna put this really colorful tufted headboard that is bringing in a yellow tone which is like I just love the color yellow and so does Lily it's just such a happy fresh bright color it is the color of optimism this dresser is amazing it's a giant lock dresser it's a sort of dark grey has this kind of land on the drawers and that's actually the handle it's super modern this is perfect this really anchors for TV or little asymmetrically because then we have this floor lamp very modern with a marble base and then it just kind of arced over and then just a bowl cool contrast to the other lamps in the room that have shape on top of the dresser I'm styling some pinks and some yellow items and the coolest thing ever a boombox candle when I saw that at the store I almost bought two of them and I was like I don't think she needs to lock candles some succulents on the dresser and also with the bedside table I really cool they're actually foci feelings which is good I know she's so busy I don't want her to have any dead plants in her room so these both plans are at the perfect solution also placing this yellow tray which I like a tray by the bedside especially on a bigger bedside table because it just gives you a place to put your phone and this plugged in at night on top we are putting these simple white lamps they have the nice white shade which we also have the white shade going on in the ceiling fixture above so we've got the rule of three plain beautifully with those lamps at the foot of the bed I'm placing a beautiful violet bench it has kind of the warmer wood tone that's happening on her doors and on her window frame it's really nice to have to sit down on to put your shoes on your socks on it's just actually functional and looks amazing we've got a yellow lamp on the vanity it's beautiful it has sort of a see-through base with the light from the window can shine through for the curtains I went with a light gray linen and they have a blackout lining so that Lily can close those because I know she likes to sleep in because she stays that's a late working so hard in all our videos and editing blogging just being a boss Sandy's so cool the top flips up and inside there's little divider compartments I've also added some more clear dividers guys this mirror think is the biggest like floor-length mirror I've ever seen like this thing is massive the betting is a dark linen duvet cover I love using linen because it's super cozy you can watch the million times and just get softer with every wash and I just like having that grounding color with all the other right colors going on and then of course we've got throw pillows on the bed you guys know I love throw pillows these multicolored ones and then some more blocks of color the pinks and the purples the stool really vanity is a super cool yellow square on tops basically like an upside-down pyramid on this silver base and it's swivel I just love color blocking throughout this room so of course we're repeating the pink the yellow in that little bit of purple so all those colors make and our friends by the door we were putting our DIY artwork the day I will create art is the perfect art for by the wall and I'm also hanging up two clamps which are the perfect little holders for some dry erase markers so they are right on hand and they also have little erasers attached to the tip of them which is perfect so you can just erase and write her new intention every day Lily come on in so the time has come for me to see my room and my body is not ready I'd be like my son I didn't pee a little I'm peeing a little bit okay I've literally been forwarded for thousands of people and this is the most recipes really yes I swear 1 2 3 [Music] oh this can't be my room I am NOT fabulous enough for the zoo but then hey guys listen up for the room and I was like ah this is so great is that a candle first thing I see is this amazing candle wait for it dramatic effect shape as a boombox what the heck this is your new vanity oh my god right so then it's not obstruct my baby stream if they give me water in life and

together in LA they also love Harry Potter check it out hold it I write Dez becoming a budding chef and I would love for our apartment to be on breaking bitch this is our mini farce falls you know we always have friends over a rustle at the hub this place tends to be the gathering we're growing up so like the host more like dinner party type situation this is the view of the television from the couches we would love for you guys to take a look at our place yeah come check it out oh my gosh and we haven't met them yet they have a drab place we're gonna work on that floor planner we're going to work on bringing their amazing personality into this week guys know more tricks in this truck Rafi got a bunch episodes of break your face coming up now [Music] [Music] [Music] okay these young professionals have fallen prey to a disease I like to call the wall hugging disease all the furniture is up against the wall it's also hand-me-down and draught there's also no conversation area when all the furniture lines the walls they've got some slipcovers they've got vertical blinds they've got ugly rental apartment light fixtures the dining room is cluttered and I know these girls like to entertain so we have to make it way more inviting and he looked do I see some Harry Potter throw pillows okay we need infuse some magical personality into this space finger dining room this is where you spent time you heard you guys like to entertain have friends over you guys are into Harry Potter what is the blanket hiding um a white couch oh you like white white with okay baby I appreciate this move a DIY it looks like it works if it works you show people this all right so you guys have an awkward floor plan here project make it a better flow for you guys having friends over and also take these wonderful colorful personalities I see in front of me and reflect it in the face daughters yeah [Music] now it's time for the design snapshot I'm going to share with you guys a little bit of the design so you can just see where I'm headed color palette wise I'm going to start with these lick squared prints this is from Antelope Canyon Arizona I love these pinks and purples you can see I'm bringing that in as well as some texture with a throw pillow and of course some plants because plants bring the light and this space really needs some life I'm totally obsessed with this vignette just gonna snap it from a snapchat and my insta story follow me yes all those is a fresh coat of paint does wonders here we got the tiny roller crazy what why Oh Joey you can handle it you're manly enough to handle the tiny role winter Poly's well don't do it like that and breathe it Juliana you should definitely have the painting covered so I'm gonna take a does outside to upcycle their old dining chairs when we get back the room better be Payne I like your style yeah I was just gonna say how is my technique [Music] so these old dining chairs match the table I'm going to keep the table wood but I like the idea of updating a bit and making it feel less dated by painting these and bringing them a new light you're just going to sand them down take off that shiny finish and then prime them with a white primer and paint them because there is much that we're going to embrace that and paint two of them a beautiful pale pink and the other two a black to bring in some contrast get why not guys one of the things we're going to do in this space to bring a little more style is get rid of their dated vertical blinds give them some curtain surprised I didn't think so we're also going to take off their old light fixture which was pretty dingy and really didn't give off a lot of light we're gonna hook them up with a brand-new modern fixture that's gonna have triple the amount of light bulbs in it to really help brighten up the space it's also gonna really help anchor this dining room area lays low you're discovering all the magical items both of you are just magical beings I thought it would be fun while we break these two also break the beige of [Music] I found the Vasia swans possible so these are just some random little fun thing vitals be sort of like a representation of your magical colorful amazingness love it wish em yeah all right well I lead these girls to their magical wand wizardry Joey and I have a lot of work caused you to get this place together before the Sun Goes Down pretty sure they haven't cleaned their floor since they've moved in here I mean people get so uninspired in their places they just like give up no first thing we are going to be

hello guys all right so this dropping vlog is for Ava I'm going to show you guys the mood board that I created for her the shopping list I did do a lot of online shopping this room is a bit different than some of the other rooms that we've done because it is very minimalist minimalism is a whole different game and she wants kind of like rustic beachy minimal as I'm sure she was in a beach house so let's take a look at the board and the chopping board and the floor plan it's a beach house did I mention that we chose it's a beach apartment okay oh my gosh and she's so cute and she's so free and like she loves adventure and travel but then she wants that vibe told in a very minimalist way so it's an interesting challenge oh by the way subscribe yes please subscribe click on the button to get in there hashtag miss feel a million all right let's look at movie boards and then go shopping all right everybody let's open up this new board for Ava first now let me just show you what is going on here now so some of these pictures she sent me and then some of them I pulled myself just based off of the tone pictures that she referenced basically we are doing wood and white furniture a separate desk and dresser area the dresser area is basically going to be like her giant closet space because she have a huge wall to wall closet travel inspired accessories and art natural raw wood accents we're going for that minimalist look but a very kind of organic minimalist look and then organic color palette with a touch of black this was one of the pictures that I sent her to choose like I love I love the raw wood bed so she really wants like an organic with that she mentioned a platform bed I also am obsessed with these I'm totally wanting to do a marble surfboard for her and I think we can absolutely I why it also just you know some black frames simple hard hanging bulb type lights so you guys are definitely seeing the tone here's just an imagery like it's just a lot of white and then some blacks to contrast but really cool-looking and like not too done up right very very approachable so that is the mood board that I sent that she said I love it and then her project board today's off the mood board I kind of went in and outlined some of the projects that we're going to work on so freshen up the walls of the clean coat of paint I want to conceal the mirrored closet doors with Forest earring white kind of glossy drapes and then I want to add a cushion and pillow and then some kind of plug in wall sconce under window seat and then some sort of photo arrangement which kind of thinking the surfboard might be the perfect thing for a lot so here is a this bedroom shopping board these are just references these two of what I want to get so this is the flat form bed that I want to build her so as you can see nice wide wood planks and they kind of surround the bed and then the mattress would obviously go here but you would still be able to see the wood which is why it's called sock or mat so this is a good reference for us for what we want to build I do think I want to make the headboard a little bit higher even and I also think I want to the would be a little bit more irregular but this is like super clean and straight I kind of want to let the raw wood be a little bit more raw looking than this I also got her some linen bedding some restoration card work I'm doing mismatched side tables I brought these off of Wayfarer it will link you guys to everything below runs marble when it's little cue for some storage I also got this tool just because I love it it's an EMT course made out of antique wood look at this ceiling fan you guys this is amazing such as like a wood just beautiful like tulip opening and then a wishbone chair which I'm obsessed with this is the wall sconce plug-in thing that I'm going to put by her bedside oh the thing I don't have on this board yet are this blue in pendant lights to transform her hand light into pendant lights just really cool here just a reference of the curtains that I won again so last but not least I just want to show you guys also the shopping more that I created for her patio we are transforming her outdoor patio of her details which is so gorgeous so here it is she was telling me that she loved these style of chairs this is bistro style it off like black and white so cute and then this table I found on house it's a normal table with the super heavy iron basic like a French bistro table so gorgeous and look amazing is a psychic heavy so it will look over in the wind then some cafe light and then over on the other corner of my patio this amazing round bed which as you can see by this picture it pulls apart and becomes like a seating area which I just think it's so cool and then some outdoor pillows this is a towel but I love it has fringe and then some outdoor foggy curtain hanging curtains outside is a beautiful look especially a patio special day at the beach to have a look blow in the wind and then this is a reclaimed wood ladder which I'm thinking maybe we think alike saying a fizzle story nice drink so cute and let's go shopping ok all right guys I am outside of a salvaged wood place here in LA you guys know I love myself as wood and like I told you Ava needs a bed and she loves the reclaimed wood look and yes there's new ones I could buy a new one or or I could go the DIY route spice in salvaged wood make her a new old bed a new bed out of gold you get what I'm saying we are not going to make this bed on the episode because it's like too much work to try to do in one day basically you're seeing me pick out the plank today which hopefully I will find some cute ones with head on it we are like right smack dab in the middle of La oh my god my in heaven mm oh my gosh all of these I love the wide plank you guys this is so pretty these huge wide clean hundred years old wait what no way oh my god I think this might be at you guys hold always easy all right I'm here in the car I've got my sliced apples and almond butter snack and that fuel so I am on my way to West town obviously the back is ready for stuff and something I tell you guys often is like when you think about your style or about the style of the room that you're designing think about what stores kind of fit with that style so because Ava is into like minimalism with like raw wood which she also likes geometric shapes and she's very like on-trend you know like she's very like tumblr if that makes sense that probably makes sense to you guys when I think about stores that I can kind of find things I would fit that style I think of like a West down I think of target target has a lot of accessories that are like a little more minimalist and geometric so I've got to basically get all like patio furniture and patio accessories and stuff and also stuff for her bedroom wow it was a that little succulent affair I love those plan these plans baby love that look how cute okay here we go here are frames I love love these brass rings you guys are these amazing they're kind of a brushed Wow super simple with like really hot white maps and them hey these are the blue ones I paid ten movies are all these silver I'm like a bin inside are you freaking cool it's kind of more my style you know maybe Siva okay why did you do it screams mediate frames and how cute this dose of stuff is okay so this is what I'm getting for frames meeting to Brahmas one black and one wood because I want to have that mix kind of keep that sound objects like minimalism singing so let's check out okay guys so today is the day before install for Ava tomorrow there is not too much shopping to do just to give you an idea this all Eva stuff so the other thing we have to do today is grab some of the projects so you guys know we usually do a prep day just get some project started that we're going to take awhile and we are not doing a prop day for Ava's which is kind of scary so we are prepping some of the things today in studio that we can bring in so obviously we have the bed the surfboard Sophia brought in one of her like old surfboards she's taking the wax out of it now so I'll show you guys and then I'm about head out to go shopping for all the steps I'm wearing my Beauty Blender hair it's from acne studios said I look like a human Beauty Blender when I read I'm just getting artsy guys because why not I'm creative weirdo I'm a creative way to have to do a lot of shopping today let's go checking on Sophia alright so Sophia is prepping this awesome old broken surfboard and she's using the steamer - ooh I think we need to do AK anymore what else in the water this was a Ford that was unused but we're going to make it into a cool sculptural element Eva's room but in order to be able to paint it you need to get all the wax off so the vod's being melting the wax and he's breaking it off with her old other pies hey everybody alright I'm in the car finally these days before these installs are so hectic I was just doing a ton of things and now I'm filing Carmen hit up a couple places in three places we think or places five places oh my god so I'm going

bulb string light section so I'm getting some little globe lights for Ava for her outside patio in the same section as all of these outdoor flameless led candles so you can have like some of these

cupcakes cool setting up the tree because we just renovated the kitchen I definitely want to add some decorations in the breakfast nook we don't usually do that we usually just decorate in the living room so I'm making some cupcakes while Joey wrangling the tree that we got last year it's like a birch tree and it has little built-in lights on it it is that right that's right clear out the branches so these are supposed to be like on the ground level no Joey it's a birch tree this tree while really simple is still somehow difficult for me I'm not really sure why me lady I'm making saffron cupcakes so for these cupcakes you want to make the base first which is mixing 3 eggs 1 cup of sugar and 1 teaspoon of vanilla powder it smells so good I'm using an electric mixer but obviously you can use a whisk for this part as well okay what can you come do this it's not working for me I'll decorate later come tell me with these do I know how to make cupcakes nope Kable you're gonna make me wear this sweater to charity hey coz they're gonna just they're they're gonna think we're weirdos I thought it would be fun if Joey and I wore some very festive sweaters I mean I know these are totally obnoxious I mean we're weirdos but our Santa's are really slaying the game I am making saffron cupcake it is Swedish recipe no no no no you're gonna get a hundred grams of this we'll cut it lengthwise this way this year has been a really big year for us with our home you guys know we bought our home like three years ago really and I work really hard it's really nice to come home and just know that it our safe place to nurture our relationship with each other okay so this is the most important part Joey the saffron because this is where we're going to get that essence oh it smells butter well that tastes good okay put that on the heat who don't know oh my gosh cold cold I mean what would you call it Little Mix it's a vertical mix when you don't know what to do you can always defer to a remix cook a remix with Kate and Joey is a cupcake okay so that cupcake bring them to cook the perfect that's right your mother-fucking look but cake did you say your mama so now time to make together the dry ingredients then this is creating the batter that you then pour into your beautiful muffin tins pop it in the oven and we'll let it cool and license not your traditional cupcake it's like a saffron bun cupcake with that orange peel glazed icing with a wedge of orange on top really I love spiced hot chocolate that has like cinnamon and a little bit of nutmeg so good especially on like cold nights to drink something that's both warm and a little bit spicy so mixing this up with some almond milk it's cocoa and a little bit of sugar I'm also adding some full milk on top and then sprinkling with some little bits of peppermint candy and some more cinnamon I come bearing gifts sparkly sparkly gifts when I come tell me that's up decorating this breakfast nook is really easy I mean it's such a beautiful little cute space so we're just using felt garland and we're just kind of looping it across the window I don't want to go crazy in here because it's kind of a small room so the tree a star in the window it's one of those paper stars I think like a like just a cluster of three that's five items in the little alcove next to the table we are placing this really cool thing and the candles are lit it spins the Angels around and they like teen ding ding on these little bells below and it's just like a really peaceful cute sound I'm going to thank someone's at the door like all the time all right so it's crafting time at mr. K it's time to make felt collars for our cats we can't hold holiday festive nest without something for the kitties are for children or for baby so I figured just for the holiday season they can have some little jangle jingle ease around their necks these DIY felt holly leaf Bell collars are so easy we're just cutting strips of the felt in nice thin strip and then we are cutting out some different size holly leaves we want to do this in a contrasting color felt and make some bigger holly leaves and then some smaller holly leaves to kind of layer over each other and you'll just want to stitch those on the collar place either a bell or a pom-pom or something in the middle and it's so cute and it's really easy you just stitch it on and then to close that you can either use a piece of velcro or in our case magnet so they just kind of like magnetized together so it's easy like breakaway collar the couch gets stuck on anything gonna be like strangling in their customers they are done they're so cute oh my gosh oh is it time for callers enjoy listen here Joe buddy very festive look at that Christmas spirit festiveness on fleek right here in our newly renovated kitchen I'm so proud of us we went through so much this year so nice that it's done in time to enjoy during this really special time okay so we're going to the charity I'll grab the checkbook you grab the cupcakes mmm don't pop this almost better than check I think they want both all right let's pack up the cupcakes and go okay let's do it love you you're talking to me look at all right we're here because we're donating $1,000 to your charity we have a YouTube channel and for every hundred thousand subscribers we get it we give $1,000 to charities that help those who may need a sense of home because our channel is all about home that's one of the things you guys do right exactly so we are a runaway and homeless youth shelter for youth 12 to 17 and then we have transitional living program for youth 18 to 21 they're really looking for hope they're looking for a place to live a stable and safe environment during this time of year it gets really full for both both houses and so we keep the doors open for for you to come in and we try to give them a little opportunity to experience what it feels like to sleep in a warm bed at night to have a hot plate of food we know what it feels like to be able to get up go to school be transported up and back so thank you for having us oh thank you more importantly for your amazing work within the community this is from our subscribers to you guys to you so hopefully this can help we should come back and do like DIY stuff when you guys that would be perfect thank you so much thanks for everything you guys are you know thank you on behalf of all of my youth at Los Angeles youth network we want to say thank you so much for you being a part of their Christmas this year [Music] oh I was really moving you know what's really awesome what yeah Wow Thanks who are you it was so nice that we were able to donate that money thank you guys so much for being the reason that we are able to keep giving cheque so if you haven't yet subscribed and when we get to eight hundred thousand subscribers will give another cheque and then nine hundred another cheque and then a million another cheque and then someone will win the $10,000 giveaway happy holidays everybody which home happening so much home happening yeah if you have the opportunity to give back or just do something for your community try that too because it feels good I feel good Happy Holidays you guys [Music] 
Hello my creative weirdos, welcome! W e are doing another room on a budget video. I'm so excited you guys loved the last one yay! Today we are doing a living room on a budget and this living room belongs to Ayla, she's 25 she works in PR, and so we are going to tackle it try to do like a Minimalist, kind of tumblr chic look in there, and we're doing the same thing guys $300 is our only budget to pull this piece together and we have to do it in one day. Oh my gosh Can we do it? Let's try! Knock knock, I'm Mr. Kate! Oh, you don't even need the introduction, you already know, listen! I'm Mister Kate! I'm here I'll take a look at your place! I'll stop by for a while and help you find your style we'll laugh and we'll paint Mr. Kate! I'm Mr. Kate! Ok guys so here, I am in Ayla's living room it's kind of her like living room, dining room, entryway combo and right away what I see in this space is something that I see all the time from you guys sending me pictures Just being in people's faces. It just doesn't feel like there's any element of decor or design in here It just feels like someone moved in placed the stuff, but didn't really go any further of course with our budget We need to embrace some of these things. She has in here and some of them are nice like she's got this couch She's got already a faux plant great. I love it, it's little dusty, we'll dust it off. That desk situation, it's actually a desk. It looks like an armoire, but it's really cool I just think this scale isn't right She does have this other vintage piece in her bedroom that I caught sight of which is taller, but more narrow And I feel like I'm gonna swap those out. She's got two coffee table options She's got some side chairs the dining table and chairs are really cute that looks brand-new It is a bit small for this space because I think even though it's a small room you can Decorate with larger items and it ends up making the room feel bigger so with my $300. Let's start the clock Alright, so now. I have to go find Joey. Hopefully he's already warmed up the car, so let's go, let's go shopping! Hey, Joey, okay? Hey guess what today's episode is sponsored by our good friends over at daily harvest my gosh I love daily harvest I know I love it too guys daily harvest sends super food eats straight to your door with your choice of smoothies, activated breakfast bowls, or an ice cream vegan sundae. They're also organic, unrefined, and frozen at peak freshness Each single serving cup comes ready to blend or heat And it's ready in just 30 seconds. My personal favourite is chocolate of blueberry vitality I like the strawberry and peach reviver and check out the link in the description box It is daily - harvest calm backslash mister Kate, and when you use our link you'll get an after special discount So thanks daily harvest, so now let's get back to this living room project shall we? Okay, hi guys! So we are in the car, we're gonna hit up one of our favourite thrift stores in LA BTS. What do you think about space? I think her floor plan needs a lot of help We need to get a rug, because an area rug is going to be really crucial for grounding that livingroom area Maybe I can get lucky with like an armchair, and then yeah, just some accessories I mean we're trying to stay minimal, but we still need like stuff so Fingers crossed that they have some things that will fit with Ayla's Minimalist, Tumblr vibe. it's a challenge. That's the whole point. I'm feeling challenged. Oh do not Ok ok just missed our exit, and we're taking the long way! I think we do actually need a lamp, wait I see one Joey, I see one! $7! Wow! I'm gonna set it down here while I keep looking, he's helping, tell me if you find anything modern, minimalist. Plant stand! Kate! 50% off furniture, wall art, mirrors! This is heaven. So the key is making sure that the modern frames don't have too much detail on them Like not too much gold and like filigree and whatever look at this one has this really Robin that inside of it thin metal Yeah, grab it okay Joey look clean Modern lines could it get any better also 50% off So this is the kind of stuff I like to see a milk bottle yeah, it's a dollar great 150 metals yes this Just a piece of sleep for like a tray or candle or something on the cognitive all $2 simple black pitcher $2.00 yes or like fun, right Mm-hmm and these are $5 for the set and there's a bajillion $3 $3 oh my god coasters coasters hang on Berisha it's too big to graduation It's like a wildland hanger thing right mm-hmm. Oh my god, okay? I can't hold anything else must put things down actually something We do not recommend this method for measuring no this is not the exact way of measuring Divide 60 by 2 It's a little smaller, but it's cool $8 at Finnegan mmm-ma sail Sail on top of that So now we need to figure out some of the more like artistic things in the room I would love to do like a wallpaper wall in that space because I love that archway and like the inset but we don't have the budget for that so I think the next best thing is a Tapestry, maybe where the TV is right now we have like a hundred and eighty bucks left basically, okay So you know what else I would love to do is get a smaller pan of paint and do the wall of the kitchen Because even though that's not part of the room you see it. Maybe like a dark anchoring color there and a piece of art You know go down down down. Okay? Let's head to the fabric store Okay guys, I am so low now in the car because I've just dropped jelly off at the hardware store And I'm gonna run in really quickly to the fabric store and see what I can find for the tapestry. Oh hey guys is Here is the fabric that I got I got this like canvas E-cloth which is nice and heavy and this was closed out, so it was nice and cheap, and I got this Beautiful floral which was of course more expensive because it's more patterned etc But I only got a yard of this so my plan is to cut out Flowers out of this and then create my own New pattern on this bigger piece of canvas so basically turning one yard into a two yard Tapestry oh, and I also got some very cheap block fabric and then I got a corner There's full fabric to be maybe a shadow and a highlight if I want to layer some more things applying the flowers So now I'm gonna go pick up Joey at the hardware store And then we'll probably stop at a big-box store to get Throw pillows a side table and maybe curtains if we have room in the budget. I don't know still see you back in there All right, so we have like not a lot of time Yeah, what's new let's just assess Okay, so guys we lucked out right this gray paint color is totally neutral minimal black and white guys But this yellowy Christmas is not so we're gonna do an accent wall in the kitchen of a dark color cool So you got that yeah, you're gonna Yeah, but I know she already has a little mount on the back It looks like it's maybe missing pieces, but I think I can find that I'm gonna move the couch out so that it is Basically creating more of an entry hallway from the front door and then the TV of course will be opposite back. We'll clean our new Thrift in white chair as part of the conversation area except. We're putting the TV day. What's happening on this wall? I have my DIY tapestry movie there, and then I want to swap out this vintage piece the furniture Which is just too deep should we put that in her bed early on her bed dresser, okay? So you go to projects? I'm gonna beat that rough. Yeah. Yeah, I'm gonna get up like ducks down everything me tricks my spleen Oh, there. You go, Joey. Love you. Bye Yeah, I might need a hand No, let it come to the beautiful about the store We only have one rug it is an amazing sheet from the thrift store. No stains no weird smells Smell test proved, but I still want to give it a nice beating with a broom Alright guys Tapestry time okay, so when I was texting with Ella he text me one photo that had a very pronounced floral wallpaper in it and she said she loved that look so this tapestry is my kind of twist on a wallpaper look for cheaper and faster the plan is I'm going to cut out the flowers first and Create some strips with my accent fabric and then once I've settled on the perfect layout I will adhere Everything using a hot glue gun because ain't nobody got time for sewing a tapestry So I think this way is a little bit bigger this it's so Changing the vibe and the space to have a rug here because We now are making it very clear where the living room coziness happens Ready for a thrift store rug huddle, okay wrong show? That's that's this isn't it OMG. We're coming over. That's true, right We do it. We do rose petals and og we're coming over. Okay, let's talk me we got a timer going That's true Timer how much time do we have? So obviously, this is beat up the worst one. I like putting it. I'm like girl she rolling it over that but You only have so much budget don't fix. What ain't broken? Will needs a little broken don't think so. It's only a little broken Poor art I was obviously not a cheerleader. I really wanted to be though anyways that's the five point point is we are doing DIY art right now, so here's what we're working with today because We want to have that minimalist tumblr look I really think that a photo as one of the art Pieces is gonna really make a big difference in here rather than me painting or doing DIYs for all of the art So I recently went to Europe and I took a bunch of pictures on my phone And I ended up getting on blown up as posters at the drugstore you guys I also have this beautiful plant that Joey got at the hardware store And then I'm also going to paint a DIY piece of art something really simple that is a great technique that you guys can do and that is sort of like a dribble paint it's kind of Letting the paint kind of dictate its own shape so I will be doing that with just Some black paint and a paintbrush. I have two sizes, but I'll probably use the big ones is it soaks up Martine It's a drips of all it's a bicycle. It's poo All right laughs, but just certainly not least let's make a hanging plant now I'm using this cotton clothesline so you want to cut three pieces and then double it over Right so at the loop and then hanging down you now have six Oh Math so this is super long because I just want to have access so that I can knot it and maybe braised a little bit All right, sue this loop will be where we'll hang it from the hook up at the ceiling so I'm just gonna add a Knot there. Yeah, all right? So that's that so this is gonna hang from the ceiling. I want a nice area to go down before the plant actually comes into play, so let's breathe this part shall we These are those really simple loop knots So here's our net and then I'm just gonna tie a final big knot right underneath the pot So that's what's gonna secure the pot in this nap creating a bottom And then this excess we can sleep hanging you could braid more you could trim I'm just gonna leave it hanging until we get it up in the ceiling because I might want some of these hanging down Line the bottom of this tonight fancy sandwich bag so this will be where the pant thought will go and that way when she waters it and it Flows out of these little holes on the bottom there would be something waterproofing Catch it Look at that so cute if you painted that it would be so cute But we're obviously gonna stick it inside this net and hang it up. Okay, so this is home guys we have no time We're literally down to the wire and starting it dark out She's gonna be home soon, so I'm gonna just finish, please and almost I have all this stuff to style deliver your own I hope you do the book, but we have no time Who's here guys, how does it look in here? Oh My gosh that blue color that Joey picked out for the kitchen is so beautiful I said a dark blue And he totally nailed it and see it really anchors a space now because she has this really pretty archway here. We're now Highlighting this architectural detail because of the dark color behind it and then of course it makes the artwork Just really pop. I also love that we have the hanging plant kind of near at the dining table now It's almost like a fun twist on a chandelier. It's like a Plant Alire, and then you can see that We've also created now a hallway by with the new placement of the sofa And then now that we're using this more narrow piece that she had in her bedroom And it just works so much better in here and now she can use that other desk That was in here as a vanity in her bedroom. So this is the way to go to flip-flop this I am so obsessed with this tapestry I feel like it is such a great way to get with the wallpaper look for so Inexpensive it just makes such an impact in here And I love the stripes mixed with the floral like it still has that kind of like Minimalist look and stripes and florals could be better We brought in our lounge chair Which makes such a big difference because it matches the scale of the sofa before she just have that rattan chair Next to her sofa with the leg clear plastic one They were just way too small for the space and this side table I got at the big-box store when I got the pillows and the curtains it's so cool and geometric and perfect in here and guys it was discounted because it had like a mark on the back of it, but hoop skin so long I Don't you like this? Okay everybody ready, okay? Yes, no. I know wise enough. Yes. Oh My god it looks so good And remember that that is oh yeah sure that was a lot waiting for a while and obviously we didn't have that in the budget It's so good. I like all the gray tones, but it's not interesting and there's plans The kitchen looks completely different, and what do you think of this new floor plan right? It's so much better It was just confusing before I know well It's you know that's something that a lot of people deal with you come into like a Big room and you're like okay this needs a function is my living room and dining room How do I set it up? But I feel like now the table kind of having its moment out away from the wall a little bit And it's broken up better, so like you have you have a case of? Come in with the medicine for a wall like this it's called floor Called in breathing the center of your room a little bit. Yeah, I just want to call my friends Wow I was like supposed to go do something and I'm like no just come here I could not even have imagined it to look like this under $300 hole no way Dramatic lighting it's literally nighttime guys it took us a full day all day these winter months It gets dark too early, but we got it in before the Sun went down Okay, we love doing these videos.

decorating so me mr. cake kind of linked up because of people were tweeting a thing like yo you guys need a meat man he's moving up Kate you're an interior designer let's do it and I'm like okay that's huge and you and your dad I've been working on stuff here obviously like you did the floors yeah I did about like 90% of the work my dad do about 10 so since we were here last you obviously put up the TV yes he looks pretty sick living room living room office yeah he wants to be able to lounge watch TV but he also wanted an office area in the sort of annex I think that we can make it work to have both a living room and office happen in that space I'm very like glam okay I'm not saying that I'm glad I'm but um I would definitely say like I like more glam space I like it to be like clean crescent moons which that's a nice that's like my thing are you a real witch no he's in spirit here how much is fear I'm not like doing no voodoo doll and stabbing no eyes or anything yeah here we do like a kick off smell power of the midnight of the Moon cozy glam face nospace vamanos vamanos perfect you mentioned neutrals creams whites all of that but because he is a walking duality himself we got to also bring in the dark are you are you a big painter I'm not a painter I'm not a painter actually I have you painted before um one time I think I've been dude once yeah like walls yeah yeah no but the I think they like the bottom of thing and I was just like the time I can do this I could do both like that again dude they ended like saying like man you were gonna open some paint right now let's do it and I'm like okay I'm thinking it's me blush cream so I'm opening it and it's a dark grey what he seems shocked and his shock beats is so funny it lashes just like oh like I died I did not expect that to happen it but that was genius like it's cool contrast between the lighter and the dark in the room it's juxtaposition I guess it is called Keats's all the time the color is called cover of night oh my god you know I was in love that yeah okay so I just go go for Q and W make it W or an M I make an end recommend would you have ever guessed that this is the color we would become now understand not like I started I thought it was gonna be like pink my arms King died here all right well that's fine because I actually have a less physically strenuous Dai Li this was gonna happen oh my god Danny Yeti I don't want to do this all time Joey took over I'm like thank you daddy because I was not going to do this I was sweating like a friggin bullet I'm wearing a full-face here it's the mask classic Kate they're gonna go out and do fun arts and crafts and leave Joey in here to sweat paint the walls hey guys I'm here when this weekend we are about to start the DIY oh my god I'm here oh this is so cute that's going around why did you give me the sketchbook earlier okay so this is like mmm there really isn't a ton of wall area and Manny's room for art there's just one little patch so we are gonna do some DIY art I can't draw alright well we are gonna do a little bit of rubbing but it's super super simple be cool like a hand you're a psychic me no I'm like are you serious okay you're a witch psych Oh get out of my head what lamanno the mani yeah am I need of the mani when I was thinking about mysticism I thought about palm reading and I thought it would be really cool to create a custom DIY piece of artwork that is Manny's hand hands and fate and magic and all that stuff come together in this DIY project the right hand is more career and kind of like what you do the left hand is kind of more what like the universe like brings to you like marriage line like relationship ulemas is so short oh how do you read a palm uh-huh so a hard line that begins below the middle finger indicates a person who is selfish when it comes beloved why are we doing this again it's between the two fingers no you have both people in mind great so I'm doing this with pencil first and then I'll fill in with pen right it's more permanent if the headline begins at the lifeline yeah yeah Chuck say oh my god it starts very strongly right this means that this person is strong-willed the life line curves are on the base of the thumb this line does not actually indicate how long you will live but rather strength vitality and prosperity the Fate line runs vertically from the base of the palm you have a real strong dominant line a deep line means that this person's life will be strongly controlled by fate it breaks and changes direction well actually that's kind of funny that was like a little mini break that one actually started really early yeah I wonder if that's like your like your decision to follow this path right yeah come out like what stop so we're gonna do heart here yeah so I would maybe just write a like along there so I'm thinking like it means heart but should I do like a word that captures like what my heart said in the reading yes this is why I like I love personalize part right you just having that idea is so much better than just writing heart on it like true love like true [Music] I love that being done at the mucho finally good you guys long enough yes we were out there for a while deciphering Manny's future in that time and Joey finished painting the room how was the handbag yes funny what's mine sir calluses with Leah cake like three here's a few things we have a lot to do and I don't want Manny to see anything else but before we kick him out there is a special present that we have to show him accessories are very important right so we need some stunning stunning need to hurry over this room like Christmas enjoy but son in July I would knew that I wanted a moon scheme in this room but then when I was looking up moon items what wait what I came across this 3d printed moon it's cool it's a little moon so in the Box I'm like is this like gift-wrapped cottage cheese I didn't know what was going on clintus obviously dark it glows looks so so so so cool and I was like this so it's not kind of change and he's like no isn't that since you guys took so long on the hand project yeah you gotta go bye bye I have to leave yeah my actually now I'm we're gonna go down like this you see hi fine you guys are like not gonna miss each other that much oh he's so pretty he naps all the time we have so much to put in this room wow this is beautiful yep ready he loves like mirrored furniture by the stairs it's kind of an angled wall which is sort of awkward to style but a console table is the perfect thing cool your crystals huh Oh order a platter of crystals we got these gorgeous sconces to put up on the walls he doesn't have a lot of built-in lighting in this room so the lighting that he does have we want to make sure it's really glam I know he wanted a chandelier it's a process to put in a chandelier because they're actually pretty delicate ceilings so we are taking the chandelier to the wall with these beautiful sconces Joey what are you doing like an adult grab toy all right so we got these really cool vintage fire irons I don't really know what they're called you know it's a little set that everyone has that you don't actually know what to do with them it's like an ancient tooth puller when Giants roamed those is that course like a really dainty pooper scooper it's like really a really small turd definitely needed some polishing I'm not done with it it's so cool it's so regal it's very oh oh it's very legal very fact that well I will wipe the fireplace for you ma'am oh thank you I was sweep the street and do poops excuse me that I do not poop on the streets excuse me ma'am oh my god now you're Scottish Kate's not as good as me with the accents though yeah you know I didn't want to go print it on the route I knew I wanted to go print it in the pillows and so this cream rug with a pattern that's in the same tone is perfect okay seance if you hold hands no no no no if you kept my hand oh I got to I'm gonna summon a power full spirit yeah I'm right there with to govern this space to keep it protected and happy and productive what do you want to add Joey normally I do the smaller artsy or DIY projects and Joey does the bigger building stuff Liam bacon nails we have the DIY crescent moon medallion for the window to be mean I can make that you want to make the DIY Roger I want to why do you all you need to get our projects because ah that Kate never wants to do the hard stuff Kate you're building the bookshelves I'm making the moon listen baby oh I'm in do that DIY listen baby I want to build up movies too bad alright so I'm laying out the parts for the bookshelf and Joey is over in the office area starting the moon project which is giving me so much anxiety all right I'm cutting we only have one sheet of metal like if it doesn't go right then I'm not gonna have that statement it's literally a crown of the room no Joey I just can we trade no please no I can't I can't take this anymore okay okay I love you can I have that okay look how good I'm doing I love you Joey the bookshelf was calling your name I bet you I can build that bookshelf before you finish this deal I'm gonna hear this moon project is basically a larger version of the phases of the Moon pendant check out the DIY on the circle it's basically just taking metal shears and cutting out a moon shape [Music] now that I've got the crescent-shaped cut I'm going to use some sandpaper to refine the points of the Crescent because those things are very sharp and I don't want anyone getting skewered by the moon I'm also using the sandpaper to create more of a brushed finish on the surface of the metal because it does look a little too industrial and I wanted to have a more aged pretty brushed look we got to add some bling and that is as easy as a hot glue gun and some flat back gems okay done Oh neat ale oh cool by the time you took to cut out a piece of thin metal I built an entire bookshelf ah the operative word was cut metal so yes I did that alright so we're bringing in a really big couch to put into this really big living room we got a sectional disclaimer about sectionals I know people love them because they're really comfortable they are not the easiest to design around it just kind of throws the room off balance of it but Manny really wanted one I want this our bloom isn't this big we can't have it why is our living room this big your feet off the couch the far corner we're giving him a high back chair which is great because it's really elegant and glamorous Oh Joey where's the poop sorry it's a crime fight this coffee table is epic it's big it's sturdy it's gold it's luxe looking man oh my gosh wow this is a block can definitely see that it was leapt on because it has that subtle texture help-o-bots yeah that's likely your piece for sure we got a really nice glass gold leaf credenza it's a console table whatever you call it I don't know it's like a bar table to just put things but to look good it's one of those decorating things it looks great so to prep the office area and we're gonna add some rugs on the floor and I love these faux cowhide rugs but look I'm Jon Snow winter is coming Joey where's the White Walkers ah you took oh no Big John snow coat okay let's bring in the desk okay originally when we met with Manny he talked about putting some desks up against the windows I just didn't love that idea cuz those windows are really amazing and I love the idea of making these desks more substantial which means bringing them off the wall it's gonna be really nice to walk in and see the back of the computer screens as opposed to the front it's just gonna keep it more clean looking Joey we were tight a tight deadline on the smoky eye with the cut crease I don't do those Joey you're my cut crease guy I don't even know what that means oh my gosh you're a beauty video editor and you don't know what a cut crease means a cut grease a cut crease a cut crease a cut crease when you cut a crease in it Wow genius over there I don't want to work here anymore you're fired but before you leave Pinkertons please okay great love

Sauer let's say but I'm down [Music] can't wait to decorate there's so much we can make how will it turn out oMG we're coming over open up we're here okay you're yelling like so loud she loves your bedroom you guys saw it now you're back guys before we get into this and subscribe thumbs up if you like your bedroom thumbs up if you're excited to see what's coming thumbs I'm where you can see it yeah it's gonna be good yeah you guys saw us we painted the room [Music] I'm the paint salesman did you need something we're creating our own billets and for Liza so we've started it crazy yeah we've got the countertop and we had to put down plywood with the countertop on and guys good god I love mr. cake guys I'm so excited I already saw the bedroom and now I'm just so excited to see what they do with the office I really really want to start something new on my channel where I kind of do like interviewing great you are already doing pretty well you're so humble what are you a natural laughs you subscribe six different things like that and I really want a cool office that has good desk space that I can do my editing on but then also another desk area so I can do you know different work and writing and different stuff like that so I want this to be just like an office of opportunity so because the rooms so small we really want to go offer so we're gonna do a built-in shelving system with a custom countertop base cabinets the whole shebang live a like bohemian she likes all of those neutral colors and wood thankfully is a neutral so we can bring in different tones of wood because we're still playing with the neutral palette all right so this shelving unit is no joke you guys it's custom so it is cut to size for the space I know the original design was to have the two shelves here but I couldn't really like it open like this since this is supposed to be like display behind her I want it to look like a bookshelf but not a bookshelf more like a display shelf and so we're playing with some verticality with those vertical pieces which are also helping to stabilize all the horizontal pieces that we're using she already has a roller blind on this window which we want to leave because it's really functional it's inset and our window it's not in the way so we're just gonna dress the outside of the window with some curtains if she ever wants to black out the room she can just close those curtains and if not those just there for a nice luxe decoration and they also bring your eye up just further making this room feel larger because this is a space she's gonna come in and feel vibrant and work in I think it's a presence of a little bit of a brighter color underfoot it's actually gonna work really well for her energy I feel like we should clean her gum off the floor yes but a giant piece of all the gum so weird habit does everyone know that Liza throws our gum on her own floors kind of weird Isaac oh she I do today I my love for you I was grape your you also have to taste it to see what flavor we draw the line there that came off pretty easy let me smell it peppermint it's peppermint dude we could sell this on eBay for so much money Liza Coe she's used to go off her floor yeah pretty sure it's not gonna go from what I think it'll go for a lot of things oh my gosh it's so pretty I can't lay down with my full ha my bowl walk is not inaudible what there's way too much to do Philly two rooms one day two rooms one day gtfo are we spinning this [Music] [Music] well don't touch the sides oh gosh got it okay go that way no on top of the rug we're

right just the mirror it's a big one you can do yourself a phone a friend if I need to but I'm gonna be doing art with life and also my best friend we talk so much an alien are you maybe you make such good friends with the people at whose homes we do and it's like what am I chopped liver I'm just saying I'm just saying that alright my friends do I think you guys agree with lies I'm so excited we are going to do a DIY which I've never done before so you can see how the creative process is one that just blossoms and there really is no wrong way to do DIY art I have a frame only - I'm afraid okay so we're gonna do a DIY together so Kate brings me outside and she tells me now it's time to DIY and I'm like DIY now let's go girl I suck at DIY so people I know you're brilliant at them I'm actually not I just know she pulls out some frames and she pulls out some wire and I'm wondering what's gonna happen I feel like you're a very like physical person yeah what do you mean I'm confused by what usually that's really good lead-in to this is it because we are bendable wire here I like the idea of doing wire art so some sort of two-dimensional shape yeah that will then mount on this really thick paper well she's thick okay yeah I get a lot of inspiration on Pinterest so I just looked at some other wire art and of course there's a lot of three-dimensional wire art out there but I wanted to do something two-dimensional so we could actually fasten it to a piece of watercolor paper and then put them in frames here's like a skyline oh my god mine's not gonna look anything like an object well if you look very good also as you know that's $39 we just buy it okay what color do you like black I think it'll stand out cuz we're gonna do two of them okay so I don't know what to design oh my god just like butt cheeks we're looking at the wire and we're looking at the frames and like what the heck do we do with this and the first thing that pops into my mind is booty cheeks wire but sure but she is really funny can have him on the frame behind me because I don't have him on my body but today's guys hey I have one I wanted to make some booties of all different sizes and shapes because mine's been it's small but others have really big old booties and I love those and I love staring at those so I want to be able to have that art in my house so I could stare at booty all the time I'm gonna make a bunch of butt cheeks I think I'm gonna make different butts Oh as we all have but she and everybody okay yeah and everybody's beautiful if no are no because they all serve the same purpose y'all just poop at home no matter what they look like you're right butts are not else per minute or II you know the loop oops Beyonce it's true I never thought about Beyonce who thinks I am she has such hilarious sense of humor but she also has a beautiful aesthetic so taking wire and making butts out of it is like the perfect combination of because this is gonna be like really cool art that's gonna look amazing in this room but gonna be hilarious why not how big do you wanna make your first but the biggest booty ever silly okay blue let's do it out there oh oh oh like if I do my booty it's like this what do you think I should do ooh first thing that came to my head was booty so you're on break what's the word that comes to your when you want to make what I mean I could do boobies that could be boobies and booty oh my god genius boobs we're weird that's like a super round boob like I'm gonna need to get a little more oblong but we could do a little a little nipple right there is that it is that a nipple is that like a nipple piercing no what is that I can honestly say this is the first it's on a wire area like Holly Nevers look at that it's a nice ratio of boobs a nipple yeah there's no wrong way to areola there's no wrong way to areola I'm making foods I'm making them all different shapes and sizes it's really easy make a circle banana oblong pear shape along and lean tiny flat E droopy these are looking very Picasso I think different sizes and they're all beautiful so you know it's gonna go my ball three six this nine of three or four plus thirty-six before they found a fourth I am going to somehow attempt to hang the biggest mirror ever to get it on the wall I'm just going to make my measurements definitely looking for a stud here if you're not on a stud you want to make sure you're using a really heavy-duty anchor yeah that's right got it come look at yourself anyone anyone no one come please just lie though we're doing something really cool we're actually hanging a planter in one of the spaces for the shelves so then this beautiful drippy fake plant of course is coming out and dangling carrying the ID down to the shelves below on top of the desk I'm styling with some various trees and of course we have clips and pins and all those things that just make it feel like a welcoming office [Music] liza has amazing vintage looking gold microphone that she told me about and of course I had to like factor that in it's an actual working microphone like there's a cord plug it it looks so it so you guys remember how funny that was seeing Liza sign OMG they're coming over so of course you have to use that whiteboard in here so I'm just lining it up on opposite side of the deck and I gotta change it because we came over in front of the death and placing this little stool it's got kind of a cowhide looking cushion it doesn't take up too much space and it's just a nice textured moment on that beautiful rug this shelve is teeny on so much life and of course the benefit of a shelf is the stuff on it is movable but she can arrange it however she likes there's so many options I'm creating another quick art moment for a frame again and change it out but I'm sharing a page out of a very old book it's just an old book I got at a garage sale for like 10 cents so don't get mad at me I'm not really gonna read the book guys I'd rather just use the page for some art so I'm tearing this page out and it's really cool and naturally weathered paper and then I'm just writing yeah it of course was really hard to figure out how to bring furniture into the space because it's so small but a bent under the window is awesome because she can have it for people to come and sit on she ever does collabs where she wants two people sitting behind the desk with her she can trade out the chair to put the bench their plant in the corner it's like a black pot on the brass plants and the same brass tone that's going on in the stool guys it's done it's time to bring her in this is a very exciting room for you because you're gonna be able to make lots of cool videos I'm once again very moist there's a lot of juices coming out of my body out of excitement okay I'm like peeing I don't know two three oh my god Oh John come again oh my god oh my god [Music] oMG they came everywhere I peered up before on camera but

you yeah all right shabu dog here you go okay everybody let's get on the same page for this super fun room Jesse wants a rainbow room you guys I am so excited about this so this is the mood board that I put together and sent to her she approved it she was like yes let's do this and as you can see rainbows are everywhere the challenge will be kind of creating an adult fun space there are some color-blocked walls inspiration here I actually really love this kind of orange color with a pink color so very much feeling that I also obsessed with the stack of colorful cubes even integrating some wood tone into them and I have an idea of doing this with crates because wood crates are really inexpensive you can paint them any color you want and we can also stack them in a cool way like this and I'm thinking why not have them surround her guitars doesn't have a pink tar she has a teal guitar it's actually like the color of this so we could build like a shelf system around it I don't know will it work let's see but we do have a ton of crates in the back so that could work also a unicorn with a glitter horn I just might have found that on Amazon what I know and then just a polka dots madness I was like I'm just going to put some weird things on here and make sure that she's okay with weirdness because you guys know I'm okay with weirdness and luckily so it was Jesse all right so here is Jesse's floorplan and the challenge with this space is again it's just one big room and I say again because you know we do these a lot where there's sort of these combo rooms where it's like living room dining room right now this room is empty it's her apartment her bedrooms over here and that's it she really only has a one-bedroom apartment which is awesome but this is a huge room and she only has one window over here so we're going to need to make sure that we bring in some light over here in the dining room because there are no windows over here so as you can see I've made this the living room area with couch and I was thinking TV but then we were just emailing and she said you know what I don't want a TV in this room so now I'm thinking we need to do something artwork wise over a sideboard here and we're actually going to be covering up like a wall outlet and stuff that's there for the TV so if she ever wants to put a TV in this room she can put it there but she had one in her bedroom and then we've got accent chairs coffee table over here dining room area rug table I was debating between a round table and a rectangular table it could not find a round table that I liked enough that was the right size so I'm going rectangle sideboard here then over here in the kitchen area I'm going to give our like a little kitchen island with some stools and then this will be our crate wall and then this will be an ottoman of fun I'm just calling it that but yeah an ottoman for her to sit and play a guitar so now let's look at the shopping board because I've done some online shopping Taha we are running with the rainbow here you guys so we've got a pale blue couch I got two of these pink chairs I got this ottoman which is just oh my god I'm just obsessed with all these things you guys I'm so excited about this room this is a dining table bringing in a little wood tone you know something to grow with just a nice refreshing moment from all the color and then the dining chairs I mean I just can't oh my god lavender dining chairs and don't worry you guys all the links for this stuff is down in the description and you can also check it out on the blog i'm mr. kate comm so now that you know what I've shopped online let's go shopping in stores yay hello guys I'm knocking like a very 80s look society so the online shopping has been very fun for Jesse and now is my first day I'm heading out stores to shop for some accessories and I'm going to pick out paint colors and all that stuff I'm gonna head to Target right now because they have a bunch of colorful fun things at Target and I think that that'll be a great place for some accessories it's that balance like fun and magical and rainbow without being like a little girl's room it has to be like a fun like wild explosion of rainbow so I'm excited to see what they have at tache let's go okay look at these pillows this is the perfect example of a pillow that has a rainbow palette but is not like super a little kid you know I'm very very into mess I was the texture I love like the black feel like it's like a mature rainbow I dig it I feel like I need to eat okay great so far so good this is the kids section but this lamb by its sole with the pale pink and this geometric breeze is very chic okay I want to get some styling stuff for her kitchen counter and a cookie jar would be so cute and I was thinking of you maybe this one's is it's blue but then um excuse me there's a dinosaur so I'm getting him we have Katie oh very out to you is how my cart is looking mr. dinosaur pink slam pillows I also got these two bouquets one with yellow lemons and one with pink flowers and then these accessories and then rainbow kitchen rug okay this is a pencil holder which we're not doing any sort of desk stuff but like how cute for just an anything roller okay you guys call me crazy which I am but how cute are these pinatas oh my god there's a freaking pineapple like if we put these on her side boards like by our dining table she'd like a nice dining table and then they were just like pinatas like in an arrangement alright everybody I'm on the song apparently not working on better no no I have another son beard oh the Sun beards there we go hi alright so that was a very successful rainbow shopping spree so I was walking through the store with those pinatas and as I was walking around I was thinking I don't want to just put them on her side or I want them to be sculptural art pieces so thinking wouldn't it be fun to make them into like like sculptural flower holders or like plant holders and carve out holes and put the pot or the vase or the whatever inside the pinata and have like leaves or flow flowers or whatever sticking out of them when they're on her sideboard I think it's such a good idea mm oh very problem is all I'm really excited I have managed to catch a little bit of a sniffle a cold which sucks but I'm here at the paint store which as you guys know is a big part of Jesse's design because we're going to paint lots of different colors and we have to do the rainbow drip wall we have to do just the rainbow wall in general the rainbow like arc wall so I'm here at the paint store to grab some chips because I kind of want to like look at them and different light and then decide on the color so I'm gathering my chips today all right well thankfully the chips are already in a rainbow I'm gonna grab lavenders Purple's bluey Purple's right here her hair is pink we definitely need some pink options thank God paint chips are free because I literally just grabbed 50 of them I'm kind of feeling these two colors for the walls look at how beautiful fresh apricot and rose reminder so I'm going to set these aside as my potential wall colors I like that they're not super super bright so then like the rainbow and all the artwork and all other stuff can kind of be the star but though will be like an obvious wall color so here are my rainbow colors I picked out now it's always better to go a little bit paler based off the chip then going like something supersaturated just because remember these are going to be huge patches of color like I'm looking at this now as a little 2/3 inch piece this is going to literally be nine feet tall something like that so this is the rainbow family that I'm feeling so yay hollows have been chosen alright guys today is basically the last day of shopping for Jessie hi jelly michael has just gotten a little bit worse I don't think I'm sick enough to be in bed all day long but I'm also like sick enough that today might be a little bit of a struggle but nonetheless there's lots of colorful stuff to buy so I'm dropping Dylan off at the office even though he's driving he's dropping himself off and then I will take over alright we're here it's awesome see on the next take alright guys I'm here at home good and I'm looking at all these mirrors so I love this one because it's big and round and obviously colorful and then I also really like this one back here and I like it because it kind of looks like a Sun and there's silver and gold here's my thinking I think I might actually get this one only because it's gonna go near the rainbow drip wall I feel like this texture and all of this is gonna compete with the rainbow drip wall alright update I've got these two green pillows for potentially putting on the pink chairs or maybe on the couch I just like having a pillow just in case can return them if I don't use them I also got this mint super fluffy it's so soft throw blanket which I think will be really cozy on the couch and then I found these boxes or maybe the crate wall just you know add some height and some storage and then now I'm in this section and look at this a pink shiny globe I feel like this is the earth that Jesse lives on and I feel like I cannot say no to this a giant pink fluffy pillow I'm thinking maybe for like the selfie bench I don't know it might be too big guys I'm so excited okay so you know how I got that little like iridescent faceted Cup thing at Target yesterday and I was like it's for penciled I don't know what I'm gonna put in it well when I was checking out at home good rock candy in rainbow colors and they're all individually wrapped how freaking cute all right so the rock candy energize me that shopping trip energized me I can't really smell or breathe very well but powering through I'm gonna go have a discovery process at the craft store which I like to do because sometimes the seeing give me ideas as opposed to me coming up with the ideas already which actually happened with the pinata so that's sort of like the trend for this room and I'm very okay with it considering 1/2 1/2 of bringing because the other half of it it's filled with snot okay guys I stopped here at artists and craftsmen I'm still gonna have to go to Julian's because winds has full flowers but they have amazing canvases here this is a good size 36 by 36 they have so many campuses and they're priced really well so that's why I'm here and hardest craftsmen and yay ok guys so obviously about Chileans know I'm like on my last energy leg I'm gonna get this vine - maybe like spill out from like the crate wall or something oh my god sunflowers coming out of the bean yata yes so you love it I love it hydrangeas oops mmm it just came off I didn't pull it I squared Shh walking with a walking waiting okay so here's my arrangement I do get some pink these little purples these white with a little bit of pink at the yellow sunflowers like how cute so I want to do that hanging cloud project like from the arc lamp so I got mono filament which is like the clear string stuff and then here I leave me a small back up good so polyfill this is gonna be our clouds okay guys so I got that big canvas and here are my two ideas which I'm just gonna get the supplies for both and meditate on it I love these giant big gems but I like the idea of doing something a little more like minimalist but with a big gem so basically taking the big canvas painting it like the wall color or maybe like the color of the other wall and then doing like a row of gems it's just like super like minimalist or this is option 2 I got these little craft wood circles because she loves like records and has a record player and has records up above her bed so we could make these we could paint these two-part like rainbow colors and then do a little black circle in the middle it may be like a little jump ring or like silver circle in the center to make these look like little records and then glue these onto the canvas so those are my two ideas and I'm gonna make a pile decision all right now it's prep day for Jessie taking a talk on Theon I mean they can hear you whispering can you hear me let's go check on viana are we doing painting many crates really covered in paint really not very clean oh right good that color is way too dark so Sophie is trying to find another color purple right now hey those are awesome yes and then what is custom this is custom I haven't thought of a name for it yet do you think it reads too pink over the way like maybe we need to add a little more maybe some of our red and a little more yellow yeah I mean that's peachy but at least it's orange yeah okay thank you okay we are at Jesse's please for in the middle of setting up everything it is a crazy mess here but the drip wall is looking so cool right Margo yeah I'm just here for emotions Marcos really cool and everyone look at Brad's healthy I made this always putting together a side table hey guys I just styled this shell um it's like there's so many cute and we needed a lot of stuff so I went to Jesse's room and I found these and those sunglasses so fun and then she had that little unicorn and she also have this bus oh and she had this fun sign and this hello and that so thank you Jesse for having casings all right Jesse my gosh this is crazy should we did the reveal we're basically done we're packing up or leaving so you're seeing like the aftermath and she's so happy I'm so so happy like she literally got it down to like just the perfect point I'm obsessed my mom's reaction yeah I know she sees time with her mom and it was so cute her mom was like just tearing up everywhere cuz it's a big deal her daughter just turned 18 and now you have your own space and it's a space that's like so that's amazing you you better not get any crazy friends over here that tangle your slinky look at how cute she looks in the space like this is everything

Good morning guys. Good morning Winston how'd you sleep Welcome to the diary of a creative weirdo Hey Friends, subscribe, Not too bad [alright]. I got my coffee Look who it is, my baby, oh good morning Roxanne the two face girl alright guys so you know that we normally do interior design videos and On my social media I get so many questions from you guys on Snapchat and Instagram, and oh by the way follow me and on Twitter too I get so many questions about like style stuff beauty stuff make up stuff excetera So I thought I start a blog series and call it diary of a creative weirdo where I can share with you guys the behind the scenes of all the aesthetic expressions So this is the first one of those and I'm doing my skincare Routine I thought I could wake up in the morning with you guys and share with you my a.m. skincare Routine all also tell you about My p.m. Skincare routine and doing my am skincare routine but It's pretty much the same Actually, I'm doing this in partnership with Nº7 which when they asked me if I want to do video with them I was like Yes, please because I already use one of their products, and I love it. We're gonna wash our face together Alright, let's head on into our bathroom Yes, you can see this whole bathroom transformation in our omg We bought a house series. All right guys I'm gonna let my head do the talking now because this will go a lot smoother and faster and also I won't risk getting any cleanser in my mouth cool, okay? Cool. Oh, wait actually first. Let's do a skin assessment shall we this is me with zero makeup on, zilch Totally ou natural I usually have dry skin and not too many breakouts although, what is this on my cheek? I do have blackhead on my nose But I'm always kind of struggling with but I found some things that help that. As I'm filming this I'm actually two days away from my 34th birthday So I do have some small wrinkles around my eyes and on my forehead you know the usual But wait pause the video this is where I need to do a disclaimer in my opinion skin care should be about having the best Skin for whatever age you actually are you know not trying to appear something you're not and I can honestly say I am Happy with the skin I have now with my tiny wrinkles and all Because I know I take care of  my skin, and it's the best it can be for me. Okay? My disclaimer is done Thank you for listening unpause So let's get into all the skincare deets, about two years ago,I got some advice from a dermatologist It has really helped me a lot I cleanse my skin with a sonic face brush twice per day because She told me this agitates the Collagen layer which basically makes it keep reproducing because as you age you produce less Collagen So it just helps reinvigorate that growth so you can always have fresh looking skin. With the sonic face brush I use a creamy hydrating cleanser because my skin tends to be dry, if it's during my evening routine. I will prewash my face to get all the makeup off and then I will use the brush again with some more cleanser (Music) Next I'm going to use a hydrating face mist otherwise known as a hydro-sol  just further hydrates my skin after cleansing So I'll usually just pat in the mist and once my skin is dry I'm ready to move on to the next step. Guys, serum is where its at I have been using the Nº7 lift and luminate triple action Serum on my entire face Neck and chest this stuff is pretty magical. It's been clinically proven to make your skin tone more even, reduce wrinkles Which you know we are okay with wrinkles, but let's reduce them a little bit, sure, fine And I've noticed my skin feels bouncier since I've been using it I will sometimes finish of with an eye cream dab gently under my eyes using my forefinger. You know the gentle finger I don't know that's what they say anyways, especially when my eyes are feeling a little extra puffy or dry. Another thing I will do but only twice a week in the evenings, is I use a retin-a micro. It's a prescription I got from my dermatologist, and it's really strong, so I literally use the tiniest little droplet sometimes I'll mix it with a heavier moisturizer because it can make you peel since it's so strong. Guys, I'm obsessed with Chapstick this one's gigantic. It's the size of my face I need lots of Chapstick because I hate peel-y lips. To further prime my skin for makeup I will dab on a little bit of oil primer on my cheeks forehead and chin I always use sunscreen in the morning after my serum. Then if I'm going out or shooting a video I will use the Nº7 lift and luminate foundation which has broad spectrum SpF 15 and It also smoothes on really naturally you can see it's just kind of going on very sheer Which is perfect for me as I am not into heavy foundations I don't really like that cakey look. Oh and also to find my perfect foundation shade actually use their virtual Match Made app With the skin tone analysis card, and I found my perfect shade, and it's pretty cool how accurate is My shade is cool vanilla if you're curious And now there's no risk of my face being a different color than my neck That said I will put it on my neck and chest too because I want the spf there as well, sometimes I also put it on The back of my hands, so that's pretty much it for my morning skincare routine for my evening routine I will do the same cleansing hydro-sol serum, and eye cream etcetera, and you know brush your teeth guys so now that my skin is smooth and even I'm going to finish with the rest of my makeup and do a natural look because When my skin is luminous and bouncy I really don't feel like I need to go too crazy with everything else You know what I mean So let's speed up the rest of this makeup part because I'll do other blogs where I show you guys my makeup routine (Music) Alright guys, my makeup is done. I didn't put on any false lashes or anything I've got a casual day, so let's pick out an outfit shall we okay outfit time, here are some vintage jeans I'm obsessed with these They're the like old Levis that they redo to make like cuter and not all baggy and I think I'm gonna pair it with this acid wash denim top like different types of denim because why not and then some shiny silver boots I love these look at this little tiny heel It's so small and I love how they're pointy and then some Mr. Kate jewelry of course and cuffs and a necklace that I think I'll double up and it's just gonna be a casual look Alright guys, and here's the outfit on you know just a casual Vintage Denim, shiny shoes, rolled up sleeves, bracelets. Yeah, okay.

hello guys welcome oh my gosh I have new hair it's crazy I'm doing this log it's out of the ordinary for me because I don't usually blog about this kind of stuff but it was such a big deal that I was changing my hair obviously I died of platinum I have had the same hair for like 12 years of my life I used to be experimental and highschool and pixie haircut I had like extensions they did like extension braids and then since then I have a change in like the entire time I had mr. Caid hasn't seen hair so anyways it was like a 6-hour process to lay my hair all the way basically strip all of the pigment out and then of course tone it so that it wasn't yellow and yet that is what this vlog is about so hopefully you create awareness to maybe just get inspired to change up your hair is that as something you want to do or you can just kind of live by here to sleep through me whatever you want I'm sure some of you will be like I like your hair better before but that's okay we all have our opinions and that's great and I'm still like getting used to it I don't know I I like it I'm glad let's get into the vlog before we do subscribe guys now as I can assure you a million how close are we like it's crazy it's awesome thank you so much everybody who's subscribing oh these movies love you so much thank you thank you thank you so without further ado this one so the darkest part of my hair is this underneath layer that I never get highlighted a lot is with GME is now painting with good old bleep so use my insert it this is obviously a part in the middle with and I'll lick a little longer here whereas this one shorter and side for this is like I mean in so the strong I want to do that link but I don't know if that is going to be too weird if I ever wear curly so basically see anything he doesn't want to waste all the bleach on the ends of my hair from going to cut it off which makes so much sense you're so sustainable you're so eco-friendly Leonardo DiCaprio would be proud saving all the glacier colors here Tomas is my polish crabby hair stylist yes cheaper versions all in the third person well we love him it's going to weigh in Ricky the dude come on everyone Oh cutie and so here's my info okay yeah no it won't car deduction kill me real like the tatis that longer than that a Tottenham get too long big all right you're gonna knock when it's going to get laughs yeah don't laugh all right here you go oh it's so unfair million where's my Symphony there's no going back now oh my god so is going to hate it I'm like slightly victim account give it up and so fast we're all off never ahead right there I know we just know creepy isn't height full of so experimental and like a boss in high school and then I cut my hair and she was pixie here someone then I got extension so they were like need extensions or they do like separate across and then fill them in and they work early and I looked like Lady Godiva and it was so back in an hour going platinum and chopped it off hmm so because my hair's already died on the end we will need to set this long feel my roots aren't painted so we're going to set the length of my hair then do the roots we're gonna have to double process as we gotta get it super light [Music] so here's what first layer looks like like a purpley bluish white and then we are going to do okay we rinse the first box and I'm like orange because it is the first round and I have mid-tones Tomas is going to cut my hanger now homeless we're doing this all kinds of backwards I still obviously need way more leaping happening so that I'm not an orange yellow margin around did you go get it well I don't want to be a little picky just even things out right now so hang better lengths and he can't believe the cold or whatever you need to do so I just want to make sure everything goes free there's a lot of what I've injected you just all McLean's exact who made uneven pieces I kind of did but I wanted to make it cool and exciting so I hated very little very dramatic drop are you know it's going [Music] there is me and the baby chickens the baby chicken will evolve as Tomas says if I look like a check to them yellow is too dry my hair and then you can hardly comment this is the part where the fleet goes into my brain does it go into your brain really what kind of Kingdom a that's normal that Everly does not seem goal when I get my highlights oh yeah that's a senior I'll just think of it as like a spa dream and we're doing this on wet hair which usually is sleep like when you do my I like to use dry marinade just like the hair sitting under the rotating fists of fire I am might be basil every now and once the roots are good then he's going to pull it through both ends if you like the plastic is like going to be like me on all right we are you [Music] this is it pastor the second one and I thought we were going to need to do another one because there was still yellow your but see anything you just need to do the toner and that will take down the yellow and we don't need a bleeps again he's trying to protect my hair as much as possible which I appreciate so here it is after the toner since my hair is like already been highlighted in areas so part took the toner more so I actually kind of have like lavender here right now [Music] final verdict see anyone in Brighton dese's purpley spot and then now it's time to try it let's go must finish up the cut a little bit and probably put in some ways come on now just go to Messing blending blending the time okay okay are we done oh my god okay you use the the one and a quarter barrel and only half a bottle of dried we should be so proud right here this is the sunrise before this is alright guys there it is the process to go platinum it is like we mean like what fourth day of having it after I died it was like 5:00 p.m. I had to go shopping for Lillian please and then the next day we literally woke up at 5:00 in the morning and went to Lily's house and installed her bedroom and then the next day we installed our office so I like didn't have time to like look in the mirror like play around with it I left the salon why just need woke up and was on camera for like 48 hours so I don't know I'm still getting used to it I need to figure out my makeup now which is something I didn't even think about like my foundation color is now wrong even though my skin color and change but right now I don't have any foundation eyes but concealer and blush on and a gleam and bronzer and the maintenance now for this is I just have to go like every four to six weeks and just do my roof so literally go or less than an hour he'll just put bleach on my roots he'll tone it done goodbye I hope you guys like it it was a big change I think that part of my positivity speaking for this year you know is just embracing those impulses I literally just like woke up and decided I'm ready for a change you know sometimes you just have that feeling and I'm the type of person when I have that like gut feeling I just go for it it's actually

Cate my name is Monica and this is my dog Lucy I live in this tiny apartment with my husband Ken and we live in a tiki hut apartment we have this weird roof that comes out over our kitchen and we have this really awkward weird floor plan where you don't know where to seat people i'm mr. kate i'm Ken and I'm a children's librarian my wife and I are always like dodging each other in the labor room also I have a lot of DVDs have about like 400 or so DVDs I like better like utilize the space this is CC this is my cat one of the things that she has requested was to change this stool this is where she eats because the dog would eat her food if we put it on the floor the human help us bring some color into the space would make us so happy okay DVDs galore Kiki but I have never seen that seems like a very small fee we have to celebrate the TV Hut I feel like we gotta just like embrace it I'm so excited guys [Music] [Music] all of it it's up here Joey yeah yeah Wow first thing I'm noticing about this space besides the obvious partial roof that's protruding into their living room its how small it is I see a ton of room for improvement as far as space painting goes right now they have a small loveseat pushed up against the bar and a whole lot of gray and brown we're gonna free up that bar space as well as add some more seating options and make this space more conducive for entertaining oh and we are definitely going to introduce a color palette brighten up the space for Ken Monica and their furry family Wow okay obviously the elephant in the room sure huh what is that um it was here when we moved in and all we know about the building is that it was built in the 60s it was like a swinging sixties yeah Party it's a swanky okay first things first we gotta get everything out of here [Music] I'm going to set you guys up a little sneak peak design snapshot with some of the elements that I plan to use in the room we're going to embrace the tiki hut theme of the space because it's a rental and can't really do any construction to remove the roof so it's there's the lipstick make it a happy moment with some tropical themed photography I picked this shot from Fiji with aqua blue water and a textured blows up shot of a succulent I'm going to accent with yellows and oranges to bring in some sunny colors which will also lend a retro 60s vibe and now it's time to post the sneak peek on my snapchat in the story I'm sure to balmy all right so got the room cleared yeah we've got it covered in plastic for protection because we are gonna pain here okay part of this season of bringing beige or working with this amazing photographer Peter Licht he's a like really like world-famous photographer he is like his are all in galleries all over the world and he started a company called lick square which is basically like you can get the museum quality prints but more affordably this is one of aloe aloe vera plants they develop it on Fuji flex crystal archive media which is like really nice DUP and then you can see it comes like ready to hang so your inspiration picture that you sent us it was almost like southwestern I like that geometric kind of yeah it's entry I loved that jumping off point for like your vibe but obviously we also have the tiki hut this we're going to use as kind of a centerpiece artwork where we're gonna do some of those geometric she yes okay around it instead of heat square we're gonna hang it as a diamond we're gonna measure out where the furniture is gonna be so we know where we want to paint and hang our art okay ken can you set up the laser level for me here we use one of these before No one tool that we never leave home without is our laser level because when it comes to hanging anything on your walls you want to make sure it's all level Ken turn it on where's the unbuttoned Ken on the counter on button you can figure it out you can do it like a DVD player oh so now lift it crank okay crank it can come on Ken pretty good you know got on there I really think I need to like bring in the furniture to like just make sure that I'm putting it I'm sorry guys it's okay I think I need a rework to design what yeah realtor me to catch it I need to sketch it out I'm not painting it on the wall until I figure out what have you I you know I have another project for you guys alright this we've really fun for Ken you'll have fun too okay I'm going to ride okay let's go come on coming we don't need you what am I supposed to do project number one will be assigned to Monica I feel like you already painted this it's been painted a few times all right well it's gonna get painted one more time is your existing apartment wall color and I like the idea that kind of being more monochromatic and blending in with its surroundings but then we also have some other options like some variations of the colors that we're using upstairs I was thinking it could be cute if you did maybe like a little bit of a geometric print click on the top yeah on the top or on the side I mean this is where you can get creative the boxes take up a lot of room yeah they write on your shelf so I got these really pretty albums so they come with like the sleeves inside Lucy you supervise you let me know I'm gonna leave Ken and Monica to do their projects and go help Joey somehow pull the space together in a matter of hours I don't think Lucy understands why mom and dad invited us over I know we're wild all right so right now they have very beige balls we're gonna freshen up with a nice pale mint to further reinforce the beach vibes are embracing in this space we're going to paint all the walls except the accent wall where the diamond our work is going to help give the real more dimension while Joey gets a sleeve painted I'm going to spend a little bit more time reworking my idea for this wall are a lot of time since I don't see this face in person I have to make some gametime decision they have this really old tiny fan and it's definitely not cooling anything down in the space in fact it doesn't really look like it's been turned on in a while it's very dusty I'm going to take it out and put in a rad light fixture and make the space feel a little more custom and funky as I play over the artwork incorporating a photograph all drawn out so I'm kind of Joey do the math part and get it all outlined on the wall and then we can paint it and hang the photograph so this is our background square right so that'll be yellow what that's the same color as this one yeah I want to repeatable color these two are going to be different okay so then I want just any me my team oh your color choices maybe this is what's gonna be like coming out behind or yeah we have to let this dry because easily we've taped onto the other strife in order to allow room and then we're going to retain and paint the other side because this space is small we are going to be placing the TV in the corner via a heavier at swivel and allows you to position the TV in any direction you want you're just gonna find your studs using a stud finder or the rule that low stud should be 16 inches apart and then you're going to put your wall mount directly on to the wall to get the studs so that it doesn't come crashing down oh and if you got a big TV you might want to phone a friend to help you get it up there okay okay you help me okay can you help me sorry I'm sending it down don't mind oh great happy to help you okay let me read you a story let's see a long long time ago there was a little dog named Lucy and Lucy lived in a tiki hut as she lived happily ever after now that the paint is dry we are going to peel off the tape revealing our beautiful perfectly painted diamonds and Joey is going to mount artwork and place using a drill a couple of wall anchors for safety and some screws furniture in yeah let's go oh thought that was gonna be a butt slap sounds amazing Green coughs it's actually picked eat it's made for small spaces and it fits perfectly in this room and we even have room for a chair next to the couch were placing a mid-century Tower where Ken can tastefully store his massive DVD collection in front of the couch we're placing a natural shag rug and a glass top coffee table the glass will help the space feel bigger I really want to emphasize that the space is made for entertaining and you need a place for your tasty orders while you have your friends over next to the couch I'm placing a porcelain lamp with a beautiful yellow lamp shade under the bar I'm placing two new orange bar stools because it's not a tiki bar without stools to sit on and in the corner under the TV I'm going to make that their succulent world as a cool multi-level plant stand ah Joey oh my gosh how much better is this than that grody fan in the kitchen area we're hanging this other awesome lick squared photo of the beach in Fiji to make them always feel like they're on vacation while at home just measure the distance between screw holes on the PVC backer of the artwork and mark the distance level on the wall and boom drink please under their dining table I'm giving them this amazing vintage hand-woven rug and then we're replacing their existing dining table and chairs on top and bringing in a large palm in the corner I'm gonna hang some mini LED globe lights under the wood shingles because when I think of strolling up to a tiki bar Hut I think of cute chic sparkly lights and some kind of far-off Island to finish off the space we'll replacing their old curtains with some fresh inset melted white thick blinds to bring in that coastal vibe just some final finishing decor touches and it's time to bring ken and Monica back to see their new space tiki hut on three one two three ticking uh-oh [Music] it's so yes hey there's a bomb [Music] yeah it's like vacation oh my god so I can I get more of a conversation keep them guessing down oh my god we get to live here it's

[Music] that's definitely working that little horsey was that giraffe oh my gosh okay oh my gosh hi hi hi guys welcome I am Kate you are my creative weirdos and we are joining together today for another fun decorating video now this video is something that I have been wanting to do for a while for you guys because it's all about gallery walls gallery walls are really important in interior design because it's where you can tell a story with art or more importantly photos I mean I know in this day and age you guys are taking photos all the time but it's how to artfully arranged those photos so I am going to show you guys how to do a gallery wall three different ways and I'm going to pair some existing images that I have that are like personal photos or personal photos of friends family with also some professional photos so it's gonna be fun you know what else is fun subscribing oh my god I talk like an awful minds i subscribing but please please please click on that button we are on our way to a million and we need you to join the fam so I'm gonna highlight three particular stories for this video I'm gonna do a young adult gallery wall a kids set up and then a more sophisticated adult arrangement so I love this photo my sister and I have that as my jumping-off point and another thing that I love to do which is a great tip for you guys is take a picture of the frames that you're going to use in your gallery set up I'm going to put this picture of my sister in let's say this frame right here and I want to tell a story I'm probably gonna add a quote but I also want to add some professional images so I'm going to go to graphic stock calm a place where I know there's a ton of images that are high-quality and you're just amazing about graphic stock versus other stock photo sites where they charge per image graphic stock you just pay a yearly fee it's $99 can you get unlimited downloads which I really like you guys because I am always changing my mind I'm decorating a ton of places I want the option to access a lot of different imagery so you guys can also get a free trial and get up to 140 downloads the links in the description it's just graphics comback /youtube you get the exclusive free 7-day trial amahzing so we want to bring in one of her favorite cities which is Paris and I want some sort of picture with a skyline so I'm going to search here for Paris a lot of these colors in this photo play really well with the photo of test that has sort of some gray tones some blue tones so these together are going to look amazing and this is where the balance really comes into play you don't want a gallery wall just all photos of people because it's just gonna look cluttered and your eye doesn't really know where to go now I need something maybe a little more abstract so I'm just going to search now watercolor and a ton of things are turning up I love this watercolor one right here and then I'm gonna put one of my personal quotes this funny little me crazy I should get down off this unicorn and slap you I'm gonna put that right there so as you can see there's a presence of images now that have a background of white which really helps balance the images that are actual photos that are all color so now I need one last image to just put in this last frame and I want to do something a little bit more close-up I want it to be nature but I don't it to be as wide as the Paris picture so I'm gonna put in like palm leaves alright I love this balance until this story she's fun she's free she has a sense of humor she likes to go places she's going places I'm going places I'm gonna go put this on the wall if you're doing a cluster like this where the frames are touching I recommend laying out a big piece of paper on the floor and then you lay your frame down in the exact formation you want then outline each grain with a pen making sure you also mark the dividing lines now remove your frame from the paper and using a measuring tape find how far down hanging hardware is on the back of your frame from the top of the frame and then use a pen to mark exactly where that is on the paper because then you will know exactly where to hammer your nails next take your finished paper hanging guide and use some painters tape to adhere it to your wall where you want your frames now you can simply hammer the nails through the spot for you mark remove the paper and hang that cluster one last helpful tip when actually hanging your frames start with the bottom row and then work your way up yay oh my god I love it done [Music] what okay okay oh oh hey hey went a little too far look how the teen room turned out I love the all-white frames with the mattes supercool how they're all nice and cluster together this next one it's going to be for those of you that don't have any personal images that you want to put on the wall you really want to create a gallery high quality amazing fistic ated look what I wanted to do with this is arrange three photos in a line because that is a gallery wall as well we're gonna do a mix of frames instead of all white there's going to be a black frames metal frames so I love horses and I love the vibe of the sort of carefree look I love the cool colors so I'm really inspired by that there's a little bit of green but it's pretty neutral so now I'm gonna find some other neutral images I love the fog in the background of this horse image so I'm gonna just search like fog oh my gosh obsessed look at this so like I've never been here this isn't my image but it doesn't matter because I want to go there and I want to go there when I wake up in the morning and I'm drinking my tea I want to be transported and it works so well with this board image you know where else I want to go guys the moon yeah I love the composition of this one how it's just kind of a little piece of the moon you know what else I like about this moon photo is it has a lot of black in it so it brings in the black of the frame so we're really nicely balanced and sophisticated I'm gonna get the sophisticated gallery class on the wall darling I'm coming when you're hanging your frames in the line there is no need to use the paper outline trick hang your Center frame first on eye level or slightly above depending on how high your ceilings are when all your frames are different sizes like mine you have the choice to line them up with the tops of the frames in the same horizontal line or you could do what I'm doing it at the center of each frame line up I'm spacing my frames about a hands distance apart you can either measure or call on a helpful second eye to let you know if your spacing looks even I usually eyeball where to hang things because the eye is what's seeing it anyway so if it looks good that's all that matter tada oh okay that was sophisticated and fabulous we're gone totally different direction because you guys may want to use a gallery wall in a kid's room well I know a very cute kid his name is Ethan and he is Daisy who's part of the mr. Caid team he is Daisy's son and he's so cute and look at this amazing adorable picture of him this is going to be the personal photo that I want to work into this gallery wall what's different about this one is again we're going back to a cluster of frames but what's different is we're going to space them out a little bit and we're also working in some different finishes so there's a black frame there's a gold frame here and so I'm gonna put little Ethan right here so cute ah and now we got to tell a story around Ethan alright so let's look at what Ethan is wearing this is a great way to take a cue as to the other colors that we want to have I know that Ethan loves pirates and stuff like that but rather than making it like a scary pirate thing let's look for like a ship these sails like look how cool that looks okay so now let's go something crap right we like to balance a nature shot the ship's kind of our nature shot I don't want to use any other pictures of Ethan in this because this one is such a strong image I don't want another face so let's do a graphic Imagi look for like the letter E right I love that so that's bringing in like the black and white graphic let's do like an animal and you know an animal I love and I don't know look up your ass ah hello drop against white background I love this one that's kind of on an angle that looks really cool it's movement but has a sense of humor looks really fun like that's cute let's get another animal you guys know an animal a loner leaders one is wearing glasses alright so this one is so cute and it has a blue background and look at how well this balance is with the blues could always change out the picture of him for one of him a little bit older as he grows up yay I'm happy like a kid in a candy store with a gallery wall ah for this style of cluster where the frames aren't touching I'm going to show you another easy key to get the perfect layout use some craft paper to cut pieces the size of each frame then tape them up on the wall using painters tape and the layout you decided on the floor you can either measure the spaces in between each frame or you can do what I do and eyeball it with the help of a friend notice with this cluster that the vertical lines line up that the horizontal lines are staggered which is the opposite from our first cluster there's so many options once your paper pieces are teached up to your liking measured down from the top on your frame to where the hanging hardware is and then marked out on the piece of paper then hammering your nails remove the paper hang your frames and [Music] we did it we gallery the heck out of those walls and this was just my version of gallery walls of course I want to see your version so if you - gallery we'll share it on the forums the mr. King forums I don't know if you guys know about these but this is where we can talk you guys can ask me questions you can post pictures please subscribe so that you know when we have the next fun decorating or just creative that's just how I describe what I do what do you do I do creativity I don't know where to mr. kake.com and click on the top button the forms are right there share share away thumbs up guys I will see you next time on our next creative yay oh my gosh I kind of want to do another gallery wall it did mean there's just so many options I can't stop I can't stop mr. gay cause there's this weird sort of film over this print I'm going to let this first coat of neon dry and go in for probably another two coats 
hello YouTube weirdos oh my gosh it's almost the new year it's basically the new year happy new year thank you so much for watching our videos this year it's meant so much to us that you subscribe and watch and comment and everything so thank you today we're gonna be doing something really fun we're doing a playroom for the scope family two little boys five and seven and I'm really excited but it's got to be like still family-friendly not totally playroom explosions and we have a budget of only three hundred dollars and one day to do it you guys know the drill let's start the clock and go see your room I miss you don't even need the introduction you are no listen [Music] [Music] I'm escaped [Music] Laurie thank you so much for letting us invade your house I know you have two boys you're used to the actions of the NOI and they're gone hey they're at school mm-hmm so the biggest thing is obviously that it is the first room you walk into yes I mean your front doors right there now the front door is right there and this is the only space that we have that made sense for the kids the only reason it doesn't make sense is because we don't want it to be the first thing people see when they want right it's hard it's like you have kids you want them to have a space to play but then you're also looking at it all the time I mean your dining room is right there as well yeah huge it's a great play space for them you have kind of what we call a wall hugging disease where you just kind of like put everything along the walls there into so many things they're very well rounded boys gratulations nolan loves arts and crafts no I see there are over there on the wall you already have a displayed it's so good so we'll definitely integrate that because they like to display their art which is awesome and you wanna celebrate their artistic ability a standard nice aesthetically pleasing a little bit more contained Koch okay Bobby that you guys did these you and Brian we took an art class while I was like this big with Lincoln so what else do you do when you're this big with the baby so that's a challenge here because obviously you here playroom and you think toys kid explosion yes this needs to be tasteful adult friendly needs to be good first impression II yet be functional for the kid for a video games on the TV over there they do their computer work their homework I've got the tiny little table when they were tightening right of course and you know they're not tiny anymore so we could do like yeah big boy size table like in humans I say well that would be good they're also into sports right yes but we like him to be outside rainy days it does mine up and in here you know on a scaled-down version but yeah I'm happy we will have that may be subtly infused in here too okay so tell me about these big some pebbles to be honest I mean I'm over them okay because these know they both end up sitting on that green chair they do they cuddle in the green chair and they play video games so we'll just bring in some style and just really make this feel more like a complete ring so you have stuff that you can do and then we gotta work fast because the kids are gonna come home from school yeah and we want them to season right now I gotta read a minute okay deli hey Joey did you know that today's episode is sponsored by home skeet oh my gosh I love homes good I just played it last night but I remember that I was there I'm not a big gamer you guys but this one is actually totally up my alley if you guys don't know about home escapes it's a free to play combo puzzle solving game meets interior design it's actually a really fun game the whole idea is that you help often the butler right who's returned home to visit his family as friends he has his compact oh there's a cat you guys basically he's pulling his childhood home together like beating puzzles swapping matching pileups etc and then you earn stars and then you get to complete tasks or a house yes which we are very familiar with like decorating all of the rooms in his house he'll redo brooms like his living room kitchen and bedroom I think I'm gonna go with this Craftsman style bed for the butler's that dream very chic Kate it's a great game though characters are funny I'm personally very good uh-huh but I'm better guys anyways it is so fun and you guys should definitely check out our home scapes download the game using a link in the description below and - the real-life decorating Charlie Joey let's do it Joey I found me Joey if you find yourself Oh Joey the challenge with this playroom is that they don't want it to look like a playroom so I'm thinking we split the room into like two different sections we have like gaming seating set up with the TV opposite to it and then other half of the room a table and chairs for like homework and arts and crafts and then also a little like ledge desk kind of situation for the computer so like two rooms and one okay and so today we get to go to extra fun store Hotel surplus I've never been even really imagine that something like this existed but like of course it does because hotels are constantly like redecorating you know every few years they like redo all the rooms and stuff so like where does all that old stuff go where does it all go to die or maybe be reborn they all have to get for a very little budget let's go shopping [Music] this is a Becca I feel a while I'm over to the lamp for it Wow Dewey this is crazy hey baby alright let's focus what are we looking for okay in here Kate are you in the area home Jerry event haunted by hotel bills if we don't need layups what do we do okay we need like a table which you know there's various stuff here we do I need another chair so we could have like gaming extravaganza wait what's over here I feel like this is like for $40 that's pretty good it's not that it's aa okcousin of everly also tell you we need like more like the robot ends yeah like what about this one it's high-back blue I need it to look good with existing chair that's pretty good yeah if it were chance look a little pillows and solid blue pillow goes with chair do not separate that after school we do with this pillow on the green chair and if you get a green pillow for this chair and make it brother just go tell the soul this is odd Joey this is perfect it's brand new only one I'm sure we can hang a little bit off of that price if you like but doesn't know what these chairs no we should maybe go traveling in our house because we're getting rid of all that would sell our chairs to these people we're more the ones that pay for these decorations anyways included in the budget for this this table with my chairs with this with the wood lay yes will be like nice and contemporary with that blue chair needs may be perfect because look the mats aren't so big we could totally fit like some of their existing artwork in there and we should get to so we can have both boys replica we need ground layups because I got about 500 of them you try it's very often you're the balancer oh you're the balance are you just yelling at me for not being the balance that was really cool me too we're like matching picture frames DVD players 500 sconces in your living room bottle not stuff and they're delivering it thankfully which is awesome love one places have free delivery I do want to get some stuff for Mikey I know that frame ledges like the ledges so we can display the books but have them like out we can't film an Ikea guys we've tried before I've tried to do shopping gloves there and they shut it down you guys it's a playroom and there's already a bunch of stuff like toys and things I don't really want to be bringing in a lot of accessories because then it's just gonna be like Gucci yeah there's just gonna be too much stuff it's really more so about getting them like the functional furniture and items that like can house those things we also need to stop at our house and go shopping at our house I'm not very cheap you better bring your haggling shoes okay we're back home at our house stop by to grab our old dining chairs because we are redecorating and I feel like these are gonna be perfect for the players table I've seen some screws I just gonna figure out some replacement screws but they're pretty good shape they're a little dirty how much we charging it for we should just give it to them but we're on a budget okay well we have a budget I gotta fix all the chairs so that takes off some of the price I'll give these to you for 50 bucks for the set no come on sir I'll give you 25 for the set 25 30 but I want to throw in hang on wait for it if you throw in this I can't call them poodle puddles you want those in the chair and no cuz look don't they look like a puddle of poodle like if a folder was a pedal I will give you the four chairs the poodle puddles in the blue chair I'll go to offer a 38 50 final answer 38 that's a good deal so you guys I thank you offend deal great deal guys framing those people look at these another can't believe the tag still on our lemon tree we have a lot to do at our own house all right it's organic guys it was a very inexpensive toss me the pigskin yeah for debris on it that's gonna be our desk the desk glad we got through shelf bracket and then these I'm excited out the curtain rod fill up the table and these are curtain cables pardon game bar and then the little hook so they can just clip up their artwork as the kids keep me because they're always making new artwork no more taping art on walls great all right let's get everything in there good job shake on it you know your bath is little no it's okay carefully taking this oh it's taped over here we're gonna use again I have to painting supplies apologize to your brother that's a key design okay so in the interest of a time and budget because this room is very odd it extends into the entryway and the staircase if we try to paint all the walls we're not gonna have an end point yeah who wants to paint all the walls not me I was thinking we could make our own line think outside the box like you're sure like my shirt curtains would be too much textile in here there's a lot going on so we're gonna put the TV on the wall we're gonna move these around these blobs are going yes move the sacks move the facts we're gonna keep this chair it's ending over there this is where the ledge desk is gonna go so solid and then point basically hitting between those two pictures yeah wait I was thinking we could also paint please ah [Applause] [Music] okay [Music] guys project putting in a little bit of sports but not too much sports in this room we stopped at a bargain for its supply store guess you pull picked up some hockey pucks these are rubber hockey pucks cuz I thought what if we took hockey pucks and meet them do it [Music] artwork time okay guys so the parents of Lincoln and Nolan Brian and Lori are really good artists we have these two framed sketches that they did while she was pregnant with Lincoln they're so cute we're gonna definitely make sure that these appear back in the room but I also wanted to have Lincoln and Nolan's artwork also framed obviously we're gonna have the rotating wire where they can clip up their new stud I did want to frame a couple so I grabbed these two because they thought they were beautiful and they have some of our green color happening in them so this one is by Lincoln and this one is by Nolan look how pretty you guys amazingly taking apart the professional framing job and putting a new art and taping it up in the box with some masking tape in this case painters tape hope that it looks great [Music] alright guys Joey here interrupting this episode of Michigan decorates with a huge tip right I see you in the comments all the time how do you mount your TV how do you want the cables the whole shebang as you can see I got my mount up my studs are 16 inches apart so right here I'm screwed into a stud and right here I'm scooting either stud in between the studs just nothing just drywall I use my one and a half inch bit put a hole in the wall below where this hutch lands I put another hole in the wall and then I'm gonna run my cables down through the wall plug them in buy on TV TV on here mount the TV cables head and get it done no excuses [Music] okay so here is what we're doing we have scrap piece of plywood that we are going to make the deck ledge over in that corner where the wall slant is a way better place to put the computer for their little like homework station but then of course we have the bigger square table where they can actually spread out with books and stuff like that but we've just got the wood which I'm gonna paint the same color as the walls our glorious chalkboard paint which I also love the idea of a desk painting with chalk whores take a like make notes look chalk these are my favorite shelf brackets to use really inexpensive IKEA wood very strong so we've got three of these which are gonna mount on the wall and it'll be a floating desk [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] hey Lori it's going well what is it what Joey oh good you got one up already so new development these days are never dull so Lauren wants to surprise the kids with a turtle she's been lying to get them a gift of a torch assert I don't know it's a tortoise or turtle but she thought it would be a good time to like integrated into the design this is alternative turtle did she have like a turtle tank that little point if she called me and said that she wants to pick up the turtle and the tape and everything today and asked if we could integrate it into the design if it would work if it was possible did you tell her what follow the walls are tore turtle green I didn't tell her that but it would totally work right here cuz I asked her the width of the aquarium premium tank whatever what's called the turtle tank the journaling she told me that she got everything like she got a turtle she got a tank she got a tank stand [Music] [Music] okay I take it that means you're done Joey yeah go ahead right that's funny egg nail art look so cool oh my gosh is penguin ripped paper like how cute [Music] yeah chalkboard walls of just awesome Laurie mama Laurie likes to make to-do list for the boys which she used to do on just a tiny little whiteboard and now she has the walls to write on and of course it's reasonable but the key with chalkboard wall paint is to season it because right now it's freshly painted and seasoning means when you take a piece of chalk and basically just rub it on the chalkboard to create a layer of dust and that will make it way easier to erase I'm about to season it ready [Music] okay this is my all-time favorite coffee table trade guy so topic it is and it's so low thing I love it in here it's so fun what do you guys think [Music] [Music] so we took this giant room and really gave it so many purposes there is the gaming area with the TV and the coffee table they can cozy here and play their games but it looks welcoming and cute love the homework corner now we've established a whole desk for them got the books their celebration of reading we've got some on display and then the rest stored in the basket got the kids artwork on display I love these frames with a giant Matt of course we still have the parents artwork in here and oh my gosh the chalkboard paint the way we angled it to end it I was like our secret way of saving money and not having defeat this entire room and you can color Leo just so awesome love this square table here this is gonna be the arts and crafts table and we've got our cool touch here now with the hockey puck poles that actually looked very glamorous you've got the storage still that she had before so it's all functional and let's just please take a moment to welcome turtle don't know the name I'm not gonna name it I was definitely gonna be Lincoln and Nolan's job but I think already go on go on all right no Joey oh my goodness you are wait let me style these oh my gosh look down right now one two three [Music] [Music] like this is like a marrying each other chair a coffee table we tucked all your cords and everything in the wall Joey did that all pro and you don't worry PlayStation everything's still hooked up the knobs of the dresser out oh yeah it sucks yeah homework station over there you see what we do with the paint diagonal the wall can be over on the wall and easily erased do you guys seen the thing in the corners of your parents got young children living in ICU [Music] and look you actually have a big person table now understand what this wall is all about yeah you can just constantly change out the artwork and not have to like always pin it on the wall if they have a new project you can just clip it up there obviously we're still celebrating you're amazing and then you some of their artwork over there I didn't even notice yeah yeah we spent every winter bucks yeah in the morning when you come down and usually the toothbrush yes we remind everybody there guys Janene your turtle good luck playing at home working in the reading and arts and crafting and gaming and all the stuff that happens in me I'm curious you guys think we did a good job of it's like flavor but still looks like you walk in the front door no I'm like offensive it's not like color and it's got function for everything they need it's perfect well enjoy guys [Music] it's like that never happens we always need the deadline of

(L) I got you! Guys, we're doing it right now! Here's the views. Woop! So this office space is absolutely miniscule. It's white Just like the rest of my house and my boyfriend so I don't really know what to do with it We've got to create a beautiful backdrop for her vlog videos, but also giving her space that she can come and get work done Let's be honest like Look, this is a pretty small room, six feet Oh yeah, Joey's six feet. That's like a Joey.

(K) Okay! Yeah, this is the other room. Tada! It's a tiny bit bigger. So for this space We want to create a beautiful serene room because these two rooms are right opposite her master bedroom So as she wakes up in the morning and comes out. She is going to see both of those rooms in tandem So they have to represent Liza, make her excited for her day and also complement each other, so NBD My style is definitely very like bohemian mid-century, very like natural-looking It's literally just like my ethnic background And I'm half Indian, half white so a little boho, a little like ethnic culture, and then a little like you, from America so like but Just like the mixture of that, but like in a room Yeah, this is gonna be like a guest room, and I just wanted to have it like in case family comes over (K)Yeah.

Let me show you where I shoved all my dirty panties, so (K) No 
(L) Basically, it's all, like I'm having trouble opening the closet Oh my gosh, stop. Wait, wait, wait! She shoved it all in the closet, like this closet is like actually kind of scary Wow, oh, oh my God, I'm starstruck! This is when Jack got a haircut. So like one time He was feeling a little frisky and he got one of these guys.

(J in accent) Oh, it's so lovely. It's so beautiful
(J) So beautiful. Who are you? By the way, Joey sucks at accents. (accent) I'm the paint salesman. Did you need some paint? From where? from the south side oh Well, I'm from David Dubrovnik in Dubrovnik Croatia It's a great place American tourists there. We're painting the accent wall the accent wall You know it's like the accent wall you gotta have some accents in life to make it fun I think that's kind of like my South African Golde Young Irish we grew up at the end of their sentences, and they kind of pulled it off Just a little bit they also don't pronounce Everyone thinks I got bad accents, but I think actually they're just jealous. Sorry guys. This is what real accents sound like Accents by yourself, okay good. Bye. It's a Geordie two roles that Jolie it's a bloody joy, two roles you, and I have had a tax cut journey yeah When Liza and I were talking about inspiration she mentioned idea of a mural because she's from Houston Texas and she's very proud and Now she's in La and she's loving it and she had this idea of doing a mural that combined both the cities I basically always imagined like having the buildings of Houston flowing into the buildings of La and like seeing the Hollywood sign But also seeing like a houston map and like you know not forgetting where you come from kind of things don't home before death But I never knew where to put it in my house. I never knew how to execute it properly we have here Houston Street map With the skyline of La this is option two, so this is La and then this is houston So I have both of these files loaded onto this alright. So here it is Move the room is this small depth wise yeah? We had to divide it in half in order to be able to position it I want to in keeping with a minimum theme go with a more pale like taupe color that looks like a more delicate Mural it's taupe Brown oh sunny Opener Joey yes, will you bring me a paint opener and try to you guys for dental work? Yeah, I don't think I need it Alright fine. I'll take it. I'll take it. Huh you ever had a breath oh That's pretty I'm Gonna. Go color yeah, you're totally Told I think when it comes to murals. I love the one where you have the houston map, and it's like integrating a teeth La map, okay, that was my Favorite yeah, I didn't want to you know Joey around I Love it. It's Gonna be so good Yeah, yeah, yeah, how do you like negative that oh? Wow, I straight-up thought that was white. This is like me and my different shades in the summer wait. It's a what Oh my God these are too many options What did you really have to turn off the cameras for this one save some battery on these bad boys because I don't know She has three options in front of me, and I'm not able to choose you're having for a later Oh, no, you can't make a wrong choice. This is Gonna be the most vintage looking on anything Yeah Cuz that's gonna need the most like faded looking which is gonna be really pretty that's totally your secret choice stir like these are great this one Battle vintage This can't go wrong. It's it's so freakin pretty I'm so excited to see it come to life. So now we know the mural We know the color yeah? All right, so kate told me to get out of the room so she can do her thing Live I can see you. Thank you Can you how about now? I mean it's hard, but yeah like I guess. I'm just gonna say Hey, hey, I'm sorry about that So the plan is because we're doing this mural kind of a third of the way up the wall We need a dividing line, so while Kate swims in the mural. It's looking amazing I'm gonna go ahead and build a shelf that we're Gonna put wall-To-wall We're gonna use some slightly more advanced techniques and get some floating shelves in there. We're gonna build everything out of apple pie which is a Multi-layered birch wood with a maple front. It's a finished material Which is really great because we don't have time to do like raw wood and stain and all that Okay, come check this out Exactly how I imagined this is a great dividing line right there Joey when bam install This natural fiber rug is gorgeous It's kind of a bleached tone so rather than being a yellowy jute it has more of a white tone to it beautiful oh He's like whose line is it anyway? That's what I was gonna. Do I Grew up watching whose Lines anyway? I would do that like a prop game where everyone just has to make up the stuff with the props oh You know only could make a curly I have curly hair. It's like a rat tail. Come on oh Joey this is where you get so sweaty join up my pool alger I just love a good cuddle with kate on someone else's rug. All right. Let's build this bed I Think we need to take the bed out or lift it up. I'll go up You keep it from slamming into the wall, okay So we build the bed sideways, and now we have to turn it around this room is so small. I don't know Turning this better husband be interested. You got to lift it a little bit so you can come towards me Here we go Move out from behind the bed key ahead. Yeah So on the side of the beds were giving her these cool mid-century modern nightstands Okay, think she's in like an action movie right now with the Saran wrap even though like it's really not that much Saran wrap Alright, so on top of these nightstands. We're gonna do some industrial looking swingarm sconces. We're not Gonna hardwire We're gonna let the cables be exposed because that's sort of the vibe that we're going for All right, so let's go back in the office and talk through the plan for that room Okay, come over here. Let's talk about the plan so here's your sketch, then here's a scale version of it so basically We're gonna install the countertop on top of these and we're gonna do a full built-in system around it yeah, the Shelves extending up all on this wall so we can create kind of a built-in look, right? But having me like natural wood shelves and then two pieces of art and two shelving areas here, but like on the wall You know right you got these knobs somewhere else. Yeah, I didn't like the navajo. So we're customizing. Oh Amazing and do you have a you have screws for these? Isn't there a screw in there? Yeah, but I don't know if this ice cream works. I know what you're gonna say next Great salaries, I say but I'm down Brought it up, okay? Well when I whip it math ever and also singing in perfect pitch Okay, so back in the bedroom. Let's finish that with them on the side tables. I'm going clean I'm just doing a nice marble clock then on the other side. I'm doing an air plant a little coaster Tray I quickly did some watercolor line art you guys know that I love easy and Forgiving art and there's a very peaceful look to it And they're gonna look great inside the mask inside these Rose gold frames I Also, love these frames. They're basically just two pieces of glass that clasp together But of course I can't sandwich any real leaves or anything in there, so I am going outside to trim some of her photo plants So this setting is high-quality Beautiful linens, I wanted to do something striped because that has a really vintage look But I chose a smaller stripe for the sheets, and then a larger border stripe for the duvet cover and then I'm gonna layer a quilt down over the foot a little extra moment of coziness a Lot of people think that because I am a colorful person that I would want like a rainbow house When in actuality because I'm around so much color all the time I want to come home and have my space be really peaceful and kind of neutral and live on the same way as you can Tell also by her instagram her taste is very in the neutral colors and those Grays and browns and white and blacks on top of the shell want to keep the styling really minimal I texted her I was like do you want real or fake plants and she said think I can't be responsible for a living thing Copy that got her off fake plants, and then I love this mirror It's just hanging from a chain it has this little tiny fold down tray In the corner, there's really only room for a small chair I wanted to bring in another mid-century moment to complement the side tables So this rocking chair is perfect and then next to it this braided Basket it's really soft and then inside this awesome macrame blanket All right, we're ready to show like that like that get up here. Oh my God I'm gonna put you into position and we're gonna count where you're gonna. Look okay?

the rain dumped on us we were able to get the wood sent in we took out that old ratty fence that was totally falling apart we now have the start of a beautiful new wood gate these needs agree they have a metal frame that secures them to the ground and then over the feet of them we have done some wood cleaning that then has been quenched when I start these look amazing I'm really excited it's higher obviously we've got a big gap underneath there right now but that's because we have a mud pit beneath it and we're going to be putting in concrete and stuff like that so that will come up and fill in that gap a bit more so it'll be just a couple inches off the ground it'll be able to swing but it'll be nice and secure we're also going to go in and do some nice trim on the outside make them look beautiful these are custom handmade gate we're going to get handles and things and then we'll put on spring hinges so that they stay yeah we think is really going to help the plastic all right so

in-home office where she had her editors record boss lady Herbie a WSB got to be creative really representative of her brand but also functional and we have respect for people in a very superior challenge accepted or we do make sure and it go over to Lily's channel but awesome hey all you people from really sure I should hear news already a nice to meet you okay we're giving one subscriber a

every hundred thousand subscribers we add really superb autism oh my god tell already how do you do this oh oh today is a monumental moment kate is going to be decorating my office which is on the main level of my house father's room I spend the majority of my life in so crucial that it has good vibes a good environment a creative space music oh we've got these blue painted walls now this wall is a co-star if you will because we have something really bold plans for one feature wall you guys have been leaving to do this so I walk in like really early in the morning and a wall is painted it's a beautiful blue car like are you wizard last night before we left we just put on a coat of this really cool blue paint the main goal with this room is to keep it clean and simple but still fun thank you okay okay yeah better the wrong --jeans I feel a smaller Merman or better yeah a lot of said I was going to fit more in yes subjective more body well depends on how many bodies in our bedroom Charlie Duncan okay I not very many not very many sometimes three sometimes it's four etc but she wants the ability to be able to invite friends into work if they're visiting from Toronto etcetera my house is kind of like that everyone gets together and brings ideas and work and get things so elegant and organized and functional a space near while still representing your brand I don't want to give Lily like uniform wallpaper and unicorn chair in a unicorn lamp and unicornia nudity because you get all that stuff as gifts anyways just so much unicorn paraphernalia everywhere what he will sort in her closet this is more to a room that speaks to her personal style she's bold she's colorful but she's also kind of tomboyish and has just a real casual fun vibe about her so we really want this office to be clean chic colorful and functional this is probably most of the most amount of time in the entire house no pressure no pressure organization is key yes I also write a lot of scripts and a lot of creative work so I need to be in space that's like okay motivating which we creative just weigh 50 percent right so now we're kind of tired so we're going to go out we're going to crush the second half it's like ah alright we are halfway through this game we have half left we already get an amazing job in the first half we are going to do an even better job on the second half and we are going to win the Super Bowl up Lily super woman sing whoa also it's not my doing any of the work really all right back with the laser all right so now it's time to reveal to her the basement wall piece oh right yeah yeah so I see various paint has been already my brain is like various pink cantons various colors for color number one is what's in color girl I think I know it's happening here but over the first end it was a beautiful pink or like clearly I love pink and then there was blue and yellow purple I'm like oh my god I'm a genius kate is remaking my logo and my animation from the beginning of my baby yeah salsa because your video laughs drop it I have picked up I went a little bit more limited lately oh there's a little too aggressive on me on a walk but you know things I would never know see I was into submission to the credit clubs everything nice and then one whose office and go blind like little about we had to press as well cuz we got to get nice even strain and we also want a nice clean line of paint we don't want any believing into other sites we got the laser level [Music] fidelia's helping the stripes we want to evenly space them on that wall but we're not going all the way down because we have a counter death lamp which really doesn't know yet my good job we're in a while right there when lily and I were brainstorming she loved text on the wall you guys saw that obviously in her bedroom where we went more cursive with it but in the office we needed goal nice gold this lock letter I was waxing why don't you just do it I'm not gonna put my finger face off my limit experience yeah I think we're gonna peel one set off we're doing this decal I have no idea how to do it but we figured out we DIY it yeah course I had asked Lily before I ordered the decal I was like okay what word or combination of words mean something to you so she was like how about hustle harder because I use that all the time that's like my hashtag it's what I tell myself can make me work harder now we know the place and everything you waiting on that but I'll do hustle all right school when you're sleeping you mean work oh no let me show you the beat for ya I'm going to go do a special thing all right well the girlfriend is Akron wall I'm going to take off because I gotta check in on her sign guys we are here at sign makers sign makers is probably my favorite sign making place in the world to throw the ones do I make all my signs when we are building Lily her logo with lights glowing on it I'm gonna head over sign makers check in with in and pick up son the process that we are undertaking to paint these wall stripes is pretty involved because we do not want any bleeding so the way to do this is to measure out your stripe just hate these stripes that you're going to paint first so right we just paint them off you could taste into one of the stripes delet the paint alternating stripes heard we want to do is you want to paint the cake line with the other color first so that way when it bleeds through its leading through the color that will actually be on that stripe as opposed to the other color no matter what type of piece or tape you use it will always lead a little bit especially when your wall is textured if you want to make sure that those needs that first beat through are the color of the stripe then that will seal any other meet and then you can go over it with the other stripe color so we have the aluminum aluminum box signs right three inches deep right this is going to be on the wall with and off you're looking at about three quarters of an inch to stand off from the wall you'll have a clear acrylic sheet on the best job all right yeah is it called a halo lid alright so basically for the sign we're taking a piece of aluminum we're going to route it out on your big machine or they can cut out the logo using the designs you sent them but you've already started right yes we have okay because you know I'm leaving with this today right guess you're here on this I want to see where we're at okay let's go back to take a look at it this is the aluminum material using to route out the box this is just a raw piece of material that we use got so basically what it here is this the machine's going to route out that S shape yeah the double box yeah and that's where the acrylic will come through so basically we have to route out the face in the edges you wanna see on that's right yeah start it up okay go I think I'm done here healthier oh yeah now we want to let these dry because we then aren't going to repaint so I think it's a good time for you to shoo-shoo on ice to do so I stopped painting the purple and it would be beautiful already the colors are so vivid they're so wonderful my soul was having a party inside my body I am making me out I don't know in a bedroom but I was working up money back okay I'm so excited oh my god I mean I anybody all right one girl three straight there we go Lilly superwoman time here we come we're cut not like the inner half right now [Music] [Music] maybe it isn't the clear acrylic piece that gets routed out right it could be push through the box that we're making that we just walk right they're going to use the same machine to route out a thick clear piece of acrylic that's going to be 2x it's going to go inside the aluminum can and then that's going to pop out in front of aluminum cans and then the top all that off we're going to fill it with LED lights and then makes me stand off that's going to pop off the wall lights and spill out from the sides and out the s and it is gonna be Koopa I got to get back there and install that thing you ready for your side yeah all right sounds good thanks man no problem all right I got the Sun gonna head back to the office Kate kicks Lily a lot has gone out time for us to just crush the toll play on the wall above where Lily's death going we're doing a really cool minimalist shelf oh my god you brought that baby up Joey and I are setting up this amazing that it has all it for a sawhorse leg which you know a sawhorse have kind of that like industrial look but these are like glam sawhorses it is such a boss down oh yeah Joey never smile me text alert oh okay Oh Joey did you just rip your meniscus I hope I heard a pop on top a release Nick beautiful piece of glass that has these little silver discs that go right over the sawhorses and it's just so cool [Music] I'm going to do a DIY piece of art for above Lily's death I wanted to give her something instead of salt so she has her book coming out this year at her she's the boss's her boss station and so I am taking a piece of this ombre paper I have like a turquoise too yellowy green ombre and then I have a pink yellow ombre and I was going to use the blue to green but they liked the pink to yellow it's a little bit more the pink of the color of her room after all she did say it's the color of her soul so I'm using these stencils that are just cardboard stencils and I'm laying them out in salsa so she spells I'm taping them underneath to the center of this piece of paper because I want to use spray paint and spray it on because I want it to look kind of like graffiti like [Music] I'm so excited about that oh my gosh when you hold this up to the rainbow behind me so Joey and I are working on the window film now this is really essential for this room because this room is on the ground level so any of these neighbors who walk by they can see into her office because it's an arched window putting a curtain there would have been just so bad so the window film is the perfect solution Oh both sides okay from these really cool window decals that basically are like a prism effect still let all the light in but you totally cannot be in from the outside so once we lay the film down on the window you use a little squeezy tool to spin it to get out the air bubbles get up excess water did you clean the Adal and read the next step of instruction oh you pretty hair also you know I oh oh this is his salmon that costed that baby with a trimmed film there is a little tool that comes with the kit that you get with the window film it just has the tiniest little bleed on it and just trim off the excess and then tada this is a unicorn window film I don't know what is okay so we got our often sign it's time to get it on the wall we are going to run the cable down through the wall so they're hidden going to come out into a plug to load the desk then all young mutant through an hour standoff just some studs get that front plate on [Music] this time look it's so cool you guys you can walk into our office and switch on all the lights including our logo with just the switch panel by the door so forth until I could find that yeah no we need the calendar she is very busy and her and her team have a hard time keeping track of where and what she's doing all the time so this white board decal calendar is the coolest thing it's gigantic once we get it on it's going to be really cool alright so now that we got the sign on the wall I'm trying to put up the depth that her team's going to work on we're going to three spaces here where we keep a really sleek minimalist instant DIY tabletops I went all white with the chairs because there was so much color going on I got lower back chairs for the wall where the stripes are I didn't want them to go up too high and block stripes and I also wanted to make sure that Lily's hair was a little bit different a little more boss - blue lamp or really cool there's the elbow lamps you know very office looking we're placing some really cool like aluminum cups the markers and the arrays are easily accessible in this Cup they can just pluck them out that way for calendars huge I would need a stepladder and Lily's only a three inches taller than I am I think though I am giving a girl a stepladder and is a cute little pale blue stepladder because you can get up and right on the top line on the other wall in front of where Lily's desk Joey's into the whole law with white board pin so it means you can actually use white board markers to get creative on the wall easy to erase draw on the walls Lily basically this brings out have a giant closet that has built-in shelves and everything so that is where she will be able to store a lot of her scripts and books and papers and office supplies so that we can keep the rest of the office space really clean you [Music] I found a lease basis where he's bringing the color that's happening over on the wall in the pink or in accessories on Lily's wall long header oh my gosh and also leaving her some little gold magnet on hand because the magazine holder the little planter with the succulent those are magnetic so she wants to she could magnetize the moon notes or some little cars around to bookends that are arrows I love them because they kind of look like cursor arrows and I'm just putting a sample of her book that's my final sample guys we're putting it sandwich right between those book ends but when her book does come out and she just like was like three five a little side table and they would top with yellow away this can act as a stool or a side table you know in an office you like to have it be kind of convertible and the wall behind her door to the office I'm throwing up her

Rumple the rough up we're doing your corner back a little bit okay so we have lived here for three years you guys saw us pull together our living room three years ago when we first moved in we put a rub down we went away on vacation and we had a terrible cat sitter she didn't suit their litter and so they were like excuse me I will use this rug for my litter box so we replaced it and I got a temporary one that I just didn't love and I've been kind of on the hunt for a new rug to really pull the living room together I love your outfit do you let your rainy day off with a rainy day see I

rug looks great it just like sort of makes the whole room that was brighter you're wringing the dopamine oh yeah the dosa me is this amazing smart device that was like developed by a genius scientist now it is a consumer device that you can use in your smart home or while you're traveling it basically keeps track of the radiation levels that you're exposed to obviously it is very detrimental to your health and it's really scary it's something I want to be aware of especially as we settle into this house and make it our home I really want to know we're in a safe environment but even scanning our environment I walked around the entire neighborhood with it you did it I also for it huh this morning in Miami on your walk green low dose rate no I have it on my top Joey red in severe dose three get to a safe area we're not red we're green look 0:08 great half of the US population lives in a nuclear shadow which is mind-boggling you see it you know smell it you know taste it you don't hear it so you don't really know when you're being exposed to it dose rates between point zero five and point zero three zero in room for hours normal variation we do to factor such as altitude naturally occurring radioactive cheers I'm trying I mean how great how great of parents are we yes wasn't lay here in compliment our parenting skills we have a cat I love the fact that our house is so smart we have so many different gadgets in this home that really just keep us informed from the air we breathe to the radiation that we're surrounded by all right well let's get the rest of this room popular yes coffeyville ok get it get the tears should we already blanket on the couch we have this really fuzzy throw blanket and it's so cozy the casters love it so much I think they think that it's like their mom I bought these velvet ones just like nice simple velvet we're gonna velvet curtain which one's the fun it's the scene this one is kind of almost like a my cloth you know African my class and I'm Laurel yes African my cloth I know it's called a virgin mud cloth for a reason it's made with fermented mud okay I don't know I mean oh we have so many beautiful tones playing together in the rub I thought it would be nice to refresh our throw pillows so these are the old pillows that we got custom me three years ago remember I this babysitter poster guy and you just made them okay can I be in this activity yeah go take your novel dwindle famila Kate wants to do stuff with pillows I might just hang out on the carpet with with it this is nice that looks great it is like too many pillows oh look now it's time to give Winston a canopy we made our coffee table which we made out of an antique mirror and we put hairpin legs on the bottom of the mirror and it basically created this giant tray mirrored coffee table which we just adore we need to restock these because they're like pancakes when we're hopefully where we got them and then we park our butts on me every night you can tell which one is yours and which one's mine mine's a little bit poofy earth [Music] so I want to know if we have radiation around us I want to know if if our house has radiation so we want to try putting the dosa meat in the garage and not believe it yard of flutter again this is the word mother nature I love you you're beautiful you're very powerful but can you please stop crying all over our backyard it never rains in LA and for some reason it is just decided to dump it all on us before we have been able to finish the process of our side yards we're going to plug it in in there oh my god hey come in no no okay no no no you can tell you know mmm good luck it took her more effort to bail at that point than to just take an extra two steps and get in the grout early whatever okay we're good the garage is perfect the dose to me is telling me we are safe we are good the house is good I'm ready for this rain to stop really do you need to rain through this past weekend Joey and I went to a door place he found it it was cific warehouse we drove like an hour to get there we are going to get a the world but it was totally worth it because there were just so many doors to choose from [Music] this is what I'm talking about you're not taking it any the door like what about this beautiful door this isn't terrible because it has the arch I'm just like the biggest fan of like Crowley's Roley how cool it if you have an arch door you guys got your bowl no I don't like that that is like I'm in like a medieval prison completely I like it if it I was like surrounded but also some square it's kind of like craftsman story both you think we found a door so we didn't buy a door frame because the existing door frame that goes with our current front door is actually in pretty good shape until why spend extra money on the frame if it doesn't work we can just pop that out and get a new one oh my god did you break it that was way too ow so I'm staining the raw wood door and I'm just using the same stain that we used on the fence and the gate and it's really easy just putting it on with a sponge and I think it's probably going to need to toast get a nice rich tone here goes nothing they just love how natural this was the thought to dark not true reddish come to yellow this is a really beautiful rich brown now we just have to figure out how to install this we're just going to measure it make sure it matches the same height width of our old door we're going to cut it down where it doesn't and get it in there are you gotta have it do you have it you got what straight meaning is it meet Marlene's work I didn't love ya they're so easy to meet what are you guys I'm all screwed in yet the door looks incredible it fits perfectly I can't believe we actually got it on there and this is like a smarty bra I wish we could get some aids brass knob as our knobs but Joey of course wants to do a smartlock I love that we use the original hinges I mean I love do we we Stan disease now these hinges are so cool I feel like these may have been their original hinges from the 20 I don't know but they're these solid brass hinges and they were painted white and we just sanded them down to reveal the metal underneath and it has a really aged look to it and I just love it I love that we didn't get a new to work right how specify newspaper I mean it will probably find out it like it is exactly fall but I love this window yeah that's good people can see in oh my gosh it's a deluge so what'd I tell you in the rain yeah nothing worse that you're talking about like what a lot Marla what is it valued mean to touch oh my gosh it is one of those feely things can I peel it off oh my god the most satisfying thing ever hi welcome oh this thing is so cool you can enter in a cold weather and

previously on OMG without house I'm going to Jack out all the competition is it raining non-stop ever since you got that driveway out the working we finally have some zinc up at our place any honest crazy indeed because I wanted to be black the last thing you say down yeah final Japanese you know what we're painting it straight flat one you can a lot Oh can you decorate there's so much we can make how will it turn out OMG [Music] okay torque humming okay okay what what what we're that we're about guys we have it we have a really exciting path today what I'm so excited we're going to pick the color of the house Oh why aren't you excited that's your reaction this is what are the biggest you'll ever would just make exterior of the house and the trim color great thank you this is what I'm dealing with here you know it's been a long process I just want to paint the house already I know there's so many details you guys owning a house is a lot also subscribe alright let's get that back on mm-hmm and let's go get some something in common we got done no but we just watch first and then comment okay great you guys have your agenda we have our agenda let's get into it the driveway is done I'm so glad the old concrete was all cracked and grows and we had this weird crazy plan so you guys know it has been so long that we've had like muddy moats along our house because we just were so badly timed with tearing out the old concrete the cement truck is here they're pouring the driveway look it's enough it's wet my god we should go out there and designer names in it we leveled it out more so that the water is creating away from our house so if there's ever a big rain it will all travel out of our yard and Judy's strength the other thing we did is drive it which is really cool it's kind of an acid treatment off the top of it so as it dried we were able to then wash off a little bit of the top texture so rather than the concrete's drying super super smooth it instead exposed the aggregate which is like you know the little stones and the little pebbles that are inside concrete it kind of exposes that texture a little bit more and it's a really cool kind of modern look while still being subtle enough to fuse to the vintage just feel about the gates done it's got the trim it was so nice with the stain it goes so well with this darker gray tried way it looks awesome we have so much to do at our house it really is the manna and probably the biggest project surface area wise is transforming the color of the exterior of our house all right so we're talking aina doc oh yeah okay you're going to stucco over the stucco snoozer coat stucco because we have a cottage cheese house our stucco is so old from the 20s like crumbling if they try to power water like sands off the pain is just going to crumble if it's to go over with like a glue code yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so they have to so basically our goal relation is basically our goal is instead of painting our house white we're going to use more stucco to make it black all right so the stucco we're using is going to already be tinted so we don't have to actually paint the house we just pick the color of the stucco we're going to use oh look here is the texture right we are we doing a brick or stucco I don't know well we'll figure it out I think always picking out the color okay so hearing what I did all right I went to the paint store and I got samples of a trim color and then I also got samples of like white paint color so that we could just be nice white like a white stucco would look like because I really want to do like a light house you're the lighthouse oh yeah already the color is just something that I really dislike it's like a weird tacky saturated tan and we haven't even painted the trim yet either which is like this really ruddy rick reddish color i know we're going for a white for the wall and like darker trim so do she's got like a light-colored house the reason why you're sitting like because I like to be presented with options what is a special sign sir oh yes well tonight we have a nice fine choice of stucco may I recommend the white go I do like the glacier like stucco however I combined two colors hmm no actually kind of a nicer restaurant so well then you would accept the nice custom order no that's like a mid-level nice restaurant with its epic afford it's like chef tasting so I'm doing like a normal cafe because we live in the middle of LA and there is so much sick we have a lot of carbon pollution and it just looks dirty all the time this is why we need a smooth coat stucco because all of these bridges are gather like that oh absolutely much pollution yeah I mean look look at that ooh there is so much dirt on this house we have not been good house washers Oh so that's my lease of it smooth it's not gonna quick look at that good not how it gathered there look at how thick that is dude this is like a topography it's very mountainous we've got the Himalayas the Sierra Nevadas the Rocky Mountains and then like all of Mars just all over our house I'm sure in like the 1920s when they originally did this there wasn't as much solution but now that our planet is dying because global warming is real my asthma right now the smooth tool is going to be way better it's going to be a good solution those we're not going to have this sort of dirt on the house anymore instead of painting you can stucco the outside of your house so you basically do like a new smooth coat over an existing very textured coat yes it is a little bit pricier but I think it will make such a difference having less of a textured house we won't up the power clean it okay so these are tests for the white option because these are just a bunch of different ways they're going to look the same no Joey done reset on dripping you're dripping or drooping make I know well we use a pollution rag on it well what are the rag do I have you want to donate a shirt I think we should plan out our testing strips so you do a square up we haven't tested whether or not it makes sense to smooth those just loose coat stucco is more expensive than just painting the house I know but if we paint a light color over this texture it's just going to get dirty again and then we're going to have like a marble house no no no good there any cottage cheese house are gonna put the goal yeah so make a square up there only get clear right here yeah we're using paint to pick the color because we want to just put it on the wall and see how it looks obviously ultimately it's going to be stucco nothing from literally just working out giving it a nice flattery coat I don't know what you mean by fun walls or anything like that was literally oh my god calm down Siri oh wow it's a really fresh and everything up I mean how big of a difference if we thought our living room color was that this stucco color the cockiest of the khaki oh man I can't wait our house is gonna be so long me full fresh so no this one is white Pete yours is Carrara oh yeah that looks good oh wait there was a third way this is winter morn all right you want to put winter morning up above that and I'll start with the trim I feel like I need to believe in the name of the paint's it's going be like covering my entire house sort of like what vibe do you want your house to be you're hot to be like oh yeah winter morning are you later out to be like Jessica cut it out are you aware house we like babe babe why key I don't want our house to be that sounds a little too much like a NASCAR eighties movie I'm leaning more towards Carrera it sounds a little bit more European Oh a half more like it didn't occur we don't live in a spanish-style house no I'm just try to think of like what an English story look calm community screaming wind time on land long for the shrim we're going with like a black flash gray we have four different grade gear we're going to try out see which one we think works at that all right this is cavernous this is our first trim color Oh cut cabinet would actually work real well with Carrera we put it in strength of cavernous this is a very Hollywood name it's celluloid celluloid not to be confused with cellulite when it's very annoyed you mean like that's what films made out I know it's celluloid welcome to in gelatin I don't feel I really want to go with kind of that more English look where the house itself is later and then the trim is darker right black on a piece of meat that's what it's called yes it's cold ah they like like waiting for creativity yeah skulls on black so this one is called legendary grey forgot the color together okay okay I'll think of the colors I like even clothes you like no Khanna 302 is a time one two three cavitus Carrera you didn't say anything I haven't decided yet so like I'm feeling like the cavernous meets the Korea revive it because it's kind of like being at the pub and Liverpool where I used to play with the band and we'd have our pine from the cabinet there's going to be so much of it around all the windows I don't want it to be so so intensely saturated black is just too dark agreed so celluloid Carrera I think I like the celluloid color for the trim and then I think I like winter more okay sticking celluloid winter morn they all the way they look black I don't care well we know we want to do the front lines black so I have the mark raping tree just painted mark right now doing it from a gun you'll accomplish specific folders oh yeah baby get it baby in this movie alright especially the front game we have these old lamps that I have on a timer they go on when the Sun Goes Down it turn off and so come up because we have black spray paint on hand and it just seems like a painting for today we are going to read 63 paint all around the light so are you gonna dismantle the top of it yeah here's the thing got a nice day super for you my video it's a light chicken soup Wow but that does not add add I was like the Pope nope when are we going to have a female Pope let's do my channel we are going to tape off these old light halo perfect I guess we're just going to paint them kate says we can just spray paint on which like I'm super into you because they that's another place that we can save some money we'd have to buy a new lighting you do this one I'll do the house I am going go go on then get going when just things line up get going then this is child through and paint crews yeah Oh God spider webs wow that was like an extended family of Fighters yeah writing it down there like this weird like rusted color and it has like a reddish tone to it and I'm so sick of the reddish tones going on house I want these just sloppy black and elegant we got a really nice quality gray paint that is meant for exterior and mess to go on metal so I want to make sure that it ate as well as the steel etc so we're just doing a nice smooth coat of the spray paint on and of course making sure to clean it beforehand [Music] I got the glass baguette who would have thought that these are actually so beautiful I mean I thought we'd have to replace these that just saved it's probably what like thousand bucks Joey there's still like copious spiderweb Allen was yours to tend to Facebook so rejuvenated how do you feel good not yeah I know the answer for the light I love of your life look so cool you guys like that's why I love craving like it just has the ability to so quickly transform so many things and I think that this is a huge talking and then to top it off because they match the mother for the doors but on some cast iron handle that have a thumb latch which basically is like a piece of metal that goes through the gate get the thumb pops it up on the other side I love the black is very and the beautiful grand Mel it's done these are everything like they're so cute and these were totally custom-built obviously if I saw the planks before that they were just vertical but now we have this beautiful art trim it's going across the top and then down around the side and it really completes the gate it's really true to the style of the house oh my gosh feeling so much more like established now no we need to still get the intercom here I definitely still want some sort of like doorbell or intercom system or something there so people feel like they have to come and ring the bell there as opposed to walking all the way up to our front door because our front door is right by like our dining room windows and Hennessy in I'd rather that be a more protected area literally if someone comes to our door like a solicitor come to our door we will have like the TV on will be talking someone knows we're there they knock the door and then we'll just like sit there and we won't open the door she's very anti solicitors we're going to be like okay this happen what time they're gonna go hello Oh doorbell damn dog hello I'm gonna say please be your name Joey the pool boy you guys the backyard I'm sorry sir we don't have a boy like hi okay well I guess I won't come in because there's a handle there but clearly they don't want me to come in like I see what I can get it I'm trying to get in she's she's to top back away from the handle the handle is all for you sir well you got a good looking gate ma'am thank you welcome don't touch we already have the alarm system on the inside of our house nice that we're going to have some things on the outside of our house to further protect our castle when we bought the house there are bars on

P studios into our dream creative space this season we're hitting the road with the perfect soccer staples to makeover the offices of our fellow entrepreneurs who meet our in today's episode we're heading to the offices of tens ot tens ot was founded by a group of college friends one of them is a seven-foot-tall former pro volleyball player with the mission of bringing clean caffeine to the masses via their premium matcha green-tea they are in desperate need of an office makeover because right now there are beach towels on the windows books all over the place a total lack of branding zero floor plan and no way they are going to be taken seriously if they ever need to meet any potential customers in this space so our goal today it's get in there put their team to work and completely transform their office so that they can take their business to new heights get it early at all yeah you are to me unlike up to your so we're gonna do this but you guys are gonna do a lot of it because this is our office because you guys are a team you guys are already a very like close-knit team anyways obviously you work on this like smallish room all together all the time but like being of a work family means working together on various entertaining so today might be something new for you guys yeah I think we're gonna just kick this off we're just gonna jump right in you can also like volleyball players or something right oh really they all are oh my gosh I'm terrible apart I did like talking to you guys II really came downstairs and lots of planning you guys have no idea what we're gonna do but it's gonna be sick I don't want to see any spots on the floor I don't want see any paint on it surely they get it they get it see my nothing's ever painted nice up and out nice what a nice it's really so clean [Music] attends our tea plan okay so they have the desks lining the walls they have that just big blank Center area but basically the flow is just like not great I mean they have all their desks and then they'll sort of turn around to talk to each other but since they're such like a communicative bunch and they really are like a team I feel like placing all the desks in the center is gonna be great for them and then they can help the computers kind of sitting facing each other over here is kind of their like meeting table eating table because you know they like have their team dinners this is like packing area so we've got shelving here for all the supply of bins then over here is like the library corner so we got a install window treatments install the sign install the whiteboard install the shelving and then bring in the furniture I think we should also help them great yeah hey paint for everyone like let them there it's a business they can use Joey Tirol Delambre we're gonna delegate to them to delegate to themselves to get that room painted while we just hang out and enjoy this weather and get like a Sun rash oh yeah no Joey they have a cat hair okay come over and lay in the Sun no Zoe I get a Sun rash you're not allergic also I'm pinning inspiration for the next office we have to do we have to do another office Oh oh my god I'm

beautiful starter kit and in here we have a variety of photos Roby so kindly sent to me and then we blew them up so you guys are going to kind of go through these photos bringing them so the intention with this is basically to have a gallery wall where you guys can have your story sort of told visually and then also the starter kit display so I feel like this is gonna go really well with overall design because obviously the goal in that space you don't have a ton of room in there right so we're just trying to like maximize the space for three giant humans in one normal sized human you guys have you know a way to kind of market the business to like when you have meat all right so I feel like this is a great way to showcase that and it'll be great to reminisce yeah you're gonna understand very soon how much design will affect the workplace and the productivity bring clients into the office yes okay tell me about these are you Robbie well we took this picture in Japan this is the process of making a traditional Japanese whisk or a sentence they call it start so stick of bamboo and they split it into fine pieces and separate them and curl them and then I also love that you guys include this in the starter can't wait wait keep it out because I've been using this like every time I mix I then just move up to the stand helps advantage otherwise wait Kate Kate help me Kate these analogy kicked out the tens of team you only have a little bit of time left to fully pull this space together we gotta install fixtures and bring in all the furniture and decor elements from Staples we're gonna really emphasize matcha green in this design not only did they use towels for curtains but they taped up shipping boxes on their window to fill the gap above their window AC unit and this is just not working this is what makes their space look so cluttered and like College yeah it's such a weird choice the new AC is a piece that will go right here right it'll look way more professionally done humming get these blinds up bamboo blinds how on em are we we have bamboo accents inspired by the bamboo whisk right the bamboo blinds family tons of wood [Applause] [Music] all right so wrong is gonna go under the table and chairs this is there sort of like homier area you know it's green it's like matcha latte green it's like those guys would never think to get this rug all right let's bring in the table look at this custom table well you built this table well I didn't build the table when I put the decal on it oh it's great we're like really making this feel like an office in here with their logo artfully placed all over good lovely alright alright I mean honestly we should just measure and center it between the two walls I think even though the doorways about Center yeah [Music] okay this goes here so this is another des fleurs packing up packages it'll be here because on the storage Schultz are gonna go here yeah [Music] okay this beauty of a whiteboard is mounted perfectly yeah the ceiling is completely not level so like you can kind of see a ramp in the ceiling well this is just a slanted like 60s building so we're just embracing the slant I mean I

special and now we're going to go into the shopping block group hug good moment yay thank you hey guys welcome to another vlog oh my gosh I love doing these shopping blocks for you guys in someone fun to like shop and decorate for people and bring them joy through the artistic expression of interior design today's vlog is gonna be about shopping for patrick stars he is one of the most livable humans I've ever met in my life and does amazing makeup tutorials so obviously we're doing an OMG were coming over we're doing his glam room which guys it's such a huge honor to do his glam room because it's where he's gonna shoot all of his Beauty tutorials his collabs it's been very challenging because it's not that big in the scheme of all the stuff that he wants to do in there he has just store thousands of pieces of makeup and then he also a shoot there so it has to be like a convertible space this stuff I'm shopping a store is mostly accessories the jewelry of the room I like to experience those things in person but I like to shop for the larger items online let's go shopping her first maybe check out the mood boards let's first look at the mood board that I sent to Patrick for approval and he personally created a Pinterest board and sent it to me with inspiration images so that I could get into his head and it's a little different from what he normally does there's a mix Styles you want to use this room for three different purposes he wants to shoot tutorial videos he wants to shoot collab videos and also to shoot like sit down talking video we're gonna make an account we're going to bring in a common table we're gonna bring inside people's now here's the deal guys everything needs to be convertible this coffee table I found on over stop and it raises up to table height and lowers to coffee table height so that means you could use it with the conversation area of the couch couple chairs love this our gallery are definitely getting inspired by that to do something let me show you the floor plan we are needing to do a lot of stuff in a small room which is why we have the convertibility aspect of the different furnitures there are two windows here it's a little bit odd and that there's right into the corner but they're not symmetrical you can see this window is shorter than this window so I'm not going to make a huge moment I'm just going to do some simple with the white curtain panel probably we've got the sofa here it's going to take up half wall half window super super important for this whole transformation is giving him mega storage for his makeup so that is what is going on in this closet this is kind of the jumping-off point of course things always change once you're in the room measurements are really important to know what to buy etc now let me show you my shopping board so these are things that I went online and shopped actually shopped for him a lot online which is great because the selection is just way better than when you shop in stores about him this yellow couch I love it so much poteete right happy it's three mine I love the legs I'm obsessed with this rug you guys it is a Moroccan shag beautiful 100% wool which is great because it's easier to clean than a synthetic rug so then I can get away with playing so many different colors because this rug is in the room this cyborg is literally like what dreams are made of it was a little bit more of an investment piece it is so worth it this could travel in every room ever it's got the brass accent it's beautiful other accent pillows here we've got the orange gold we've got a beautiful pink here that's so fun with the tassels you can see how well pieces rub you've got this convertible coffee table that raises up we've got some nesting tables here and I also for the side table rather than doing like a regular side table I'm doing tiered rolling table so it has the wheels you can roll it around and also be able to just store it apart things so this could be really helpful when you shooting video last thing I want to show you guys is this closet now the closet is so so so important for this room because of the storage and the need for clothes in there needs to store hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of make up things so drawers are essential went a little bit more of an economical route than getting like a custom closet using this IKEA pack system which I built online they have on the IKEA website the ability to lock up what you want I'm going to paint the back of the closet a bright pink color and because these come with backings we're probably going to end up painting the back of these closet systems the same hot pink color so that it's uniform and then you can see all these drawers they don't come with poles so that is what I'm going to get also labels like these which are actually from Amazon which I want to put on all the drawers and so you can see these labels have little tabs on them so those will be good for like the side smaller drawers and then these don't have them so those will go in the center of the longer Jordan will do some fun coals on either side and also foxes up on top and more boxes like a moment of like cute display area so that's the plan guys holy crap lots to do I am at the farmers market slash Grove area here in Los Angeles I'm gonna head in to anthropology and see what kind of pretty poles they have for those Center drawers and it's really hot and I'm wearing jeans why did I wear jeans oh okay shopping here we are [Music] knob goals right here ooh they're really pretty I think you want something with a little bit of color in it wait here is the colorful knob land these are so pretty Oh ooh I like these the labels that I'm getting for the drawers are like this kind of antique brass color these could be perfect I really like these okay so something that I always I'm telling you guys about these mood boards is like to save them on your phone for reference while you're out with now counting the large drawers in the center closet set up so obviously this is really helpful because now I will get the right amount of knobs and I'm going to just take it peek at some of the other accessories on here take a pee do we need this uh yeah Cost Plus World Market fast with things are you kidding oh that I have anything to use these for though that's what's so sad this is the reality of it design you guys you find things that you love and then you're like oh wait a minute I don't have a place for that moving on remember me this is him all of his many different outfits and character okay I'm getting one of these Oh little Russian doll thank you I'm all green and orange how cute okay love that I didn't get as much stuff as I wanted to know so I'm gonna have to hit at home good for some of those blingy or items here we are in blingy lamp plan do these three lamps I'm getting X beautiful square shade one with this amazing faceted glass base blingy like almost like pineapple looking it's like a super super peel ping and this really cool like cylinder lamp that looks like a disco ball I know my mum's obsessed with these boxes I have a little bit of black and I'm too because I also have a black side table more storage and in my beloved curtain section I'm gonna get Patrick some 96 inch panels on a hang the curtain panels up pretty high so they look nice and dramatic and elegant we could go super loud with these but then that's just too loud and not glam and he's glam so we're going to go these this are some colorful out Jack's to place around the room like I'm very happy with what I got the only thing I had left to get our frames for Patrick's artwork that I want to do think I'm gonna actually hit up a thrift store for that for those frames so we will see good morning guys I'm outside Patrick's apartment I'm about to go in he's actually out of town he's in Paris we're doing a prep day sometimes we do depending on the workload of the room design just so that we can ensure that when we actually shoot the episode of OG we're coming over we can like get the entire room done in a day I'm here with Brad we're getting some before shots of the room Sophia and Joey are on their way with some of the furniture which we're going to build had a custom closet company come out and give us an estimate you can do that for free they come and they measure and they do a little sketch it was so expensive because we needed so many drawers and like the drawers cost a lot when you get a custom closet it was just more budget-friendly and also just kind of like a better tip for all you guys to go the modular route and do like an Ikea closet combo with some like Anthropology knobs and also breaking apart the inside of the existing closet and painting it pink so yeah that's like the behind the behind the behind of seen some of them can actually take a day to do and some them take a day and a little behind-the-scenes crowd anyways there's a lot to do so let's get up into Patrick's apartment and here is Peter hi what are you working on yay Seeger project okay he's like watching a movie I'm vlogging Brad who's about to get the before shots of this room look at Patrick like set up like he don't kid with these alive with the soft little condoms on them this is the closet that is just not working I mean he really doesn't need a clothing rack in here so we're gonna bust this out take out the shelves and then put in a whole new drawer system in this roll of paper we're actually gonna hang a roll system yeah are you banging it punching it oh my god Joey oh are you Patrick sorry not sorry me so we're gonna paint the back of closet and then we're also going to paint the backs of the Kia like shelving units where the drawers are gonna go and look at how freaking gorgeous obviously I'm excited about this pink color and now we have to see what family with it closer on the color wheel should paint grapes kind of like an orange coral or we could go a little bit farther away on the color wheel even mind other colors or being in with the furniture and have like a lemon yellow cow meaning towards the family how pretty that is to color it and debating between this is the later one which you can see how much one sits against white which it will be since we're doing just a horizontal line across but I think that'll be so cute the yellow house against it this is it this is the winner getting frames per Patrick's art wall so I'm going to go to a vintage store you know I always say that there's go wrong no matter what the chairs that I ordered far back ordered for like the rest of my life we cancel those and I have to go find two awesome tears right now I'm coming to get you counsel first drop and donations honor so that was kind of a bust so I'm going to go hit up another thrift store I didn't want to spend $50 on just one frame when I need like four or six of them I'm going to go hit up beach yesterday or one of my trusted places to get awesome stuff okay so this is my thrift store heaven look at this frame section see what kind of price they can give me because I'm a good customer six frames with math rapport you dollar allows your stir chopping so I'm gonna go into HD buttercup which is an amazing furniture store to see if there are some chairs here oh my god and right as I walk in I'm with green oh my god with these wood arms are you kidding me and the brass frames a done oh my gosh of course there's a datum hold tight on these you kidding kaylynn I'm gonna hunt you down the work of our lamp poles I mean look at this light it's a freaking jellyfish shut up to pale pink club chair with low backs there 975 they're too big I think so I'm going to go see what they have at cb2 see what I can find all right these are the orange awesome pillows here just like that really pale salmony orange and then this is like a darker orange how cute the lighting in here as far but it's cute trust me I'm also getting this awesome marble base where you rest the fanon you're like that over bag I'll give you two sources definition sunlight giving me a Sun beard how you doing back at it combing la for the perfect chairs for Patrick also shopping for some art supplies today so look how freaking cute only one of them I think and I need two matching chairs oh my god guys what is the first time I've left a home good empty-handed did you get a sandwich though starving there's another home goods like right nearby so I'm going to try that one now I'm a target so cold West Elm or like oh no or a showroom you can't leave with anything we don't have anything in stock to order it it'll take a week minimum does nobody have things in store anymore see what target us okay guys here in the clearance section or two chairs way more mid-century I just worry that they're not like special enough I'm about to head up this place that I've driven by a few times and I really want to go in there shut up you kidding me vintage you guys Patrick's chairs are here this is why because I was meant to come to this place it was meant to be I'm so excited they are authentic tulip chairs from the 1960s the swivel so happy all right guys I'm making a quick stop at one of my favorite arts and crafts stores here in LA artists and craftsmen supply I mean like a look at this guy's these are so great for like backgrounds of photos and I don't know even flame amazing using art I am here getting some paper some really nice weight papers for capture it I'm getting some nice weight paper for Patrick's makeup art and then I also want to get some color paper so I want to do collage wall in those frames that I got from the thrift store and I want to do a combo of art made with makeup and then also art that's like shapes of faces with colored paper so basically take cutouts of faces maybe making kind of look Picasso ask so that it's not going to influence Patrick's like actual makeup ideas but it's going to be indicative of his art I am just testing out the artwork we have just some random makeup here that I'm going to experiment with these loose sheets of the color paper this experiment with cutting out a shape anding glue I don't want to do all of the artwork all but I really do want Patrick to be able to make his own art for his place so I'm going to try it out and let you know how it goes so like something like this framed in a mat like a super thick mat frame it looks like super artsy and so I'm going to let these dry they're all like stay proof like lip pens and these are liquid liners I use like a cream lipstick or something that doesn't dry I put the glass over it it could transfer onto the glass and look messy and smudged so that's just why I'm experimenting with these things like just really technically to just see how they react oh my god you guys I am obsessed with this cut out like a rough face shape cut out a sort of rough eyebrow shape cut out like a little almond shaped I did this plummy purpley color cut out this triangle of like pink and I've symbolized like blush look almost Picasso ass is literally obviously so many options oh my god I'm so obsessed so I'm gonna glue this down when do these oh my god look at our back room okay so this is both Patrick and Manny stuff mostly online shopping because they were two empty rooms so obviously I ordered a lot of stuff online Sophia me these hilarious list all of the receipts and everything here which is great cuz it helps us stay organized see we're getting like a ton of shipments coming in and like anyone

Can you just extract extracting. In a beige beige world Mr. Kate is on a mission to break it. 1...2....3! (scream) Oh my god. You guys did such a great job So join us... Joey we get it you're really manly. Hello everybody! Welcome our creative weirdos Back to another episode of breaking beige. -Whoa breaking beige The series where we go into people's homes, break them out of their beige. We go in with our truck, our breaking beige mobile, filled with new stuff, vintage stuff, flea market stuff -Up cycled! -Stuff I found in the alley. and guys beige it's not just about breaking people of a color it's about a Mentality it's about being stuck in a rut being just drab and having your outer world not Reflecting the life and the personality that you have inside Speaking of lively wonderful humans let's check out our lady for the day Hi, I'm Christine, and I'm going to show you why I need some help I just haven't had the time to do anything to our master bedroom So it's pretty much bare as you can see I love you guys, and it would be such a great honor if you were to help us Oh my gosh wow, guess what color we're gonna use to break her of her beige mmmm... beige. Yass What no where not using beige. Yeah. How did you guess? We're using beige? Yeah, no for real guys We are gonna use a beige to break her of our beige, because I'm all about this design being neutral and I'm all about this design showing you that neutrals can be beautiful and textural and Stimulating and calming, but they're still beige and neutral you know be just like grey and neutrals and creams Etc Nothing crazy because we want it to be peaceful for her. Okay. Imma put on my peaceful hat. We're breaking beige with beige subscribe Yaaaaaaaas. Dead end. Dead end. What am I doing, how do I get out of here? It's a maze Do you see anything behind me? I mean I see things, but no humans or small animals. This is a big truck. Eh let's do it Breaking beige! Woo! Hey! Hi! Hey! Hello! Hey, welcome to my home Christine, right? Yeah Are you excited? Yes I'm very excited Show us your space! Yay! So this is the room My gosh. But the ceilings are really high! Thank you We always ask our breaking beige participants for some inspiration images so I can make sure to cater the design to their personal taste and Christine sent me all images of rooms that had a neutral palette so the challenge today is Breaking beige with more beige by bringing in contrast and design complexity mostly through accessories since the bed and dresser are already in great shape Whoa that is a big TV?! I know! My gosh those photos are so cute. Is that your daughter. Yes? That's my daughter, and that's you in the photo Yes, that is me in the photo. With short hair? With short hair. that was after Chemo, and in remission, so my hair was starting to grow back. Beautiful! Oh, well it looks good. You look good both ways. Thank you! Yeah, I was diagnosed at Christmas 2013 so all of 2014 I was in and out of the hospital. She was two, so but Oh my gosh I'm gonna cr- But yay, you're in remission now, so that's great! Yes, life is good. My whole goal is to kind of get my life back together We're gonna celebrate the family time that you have here So you spend time in here, obviously you sleep in here and does your daughter's sleep in bed with you. Yeah she does, it's big enough bed. Why not? Normally this is where we go okay. Take everything take everything out, but you have a beautiful bed. And you have a beautiful dresser So we're really bringing in things so we should kind of like maybe move stuff off the wall Move stuff off the walls. We're Gonna use those photos, but I have a plan for those photos. Perfect! So let's put them someplace safe this is the 200th Annual beige of Beige on Beige Awards I would like to discuss the fact that you have gray walls. It's a nice gray. It is a nice gray It's like a medium tone right and your bed is like a medium beige so you're like medium Everywhere right now, so because we're gonna stick with kind of a neutral color palette for you But our exercise with this room is making beige Beautiful. Yeah We're not about to like neon-ify your room, or are we? Hey, ready, you can oh my gosh. It's white. So no more great grey. Super Wild I know. This is actually called Swiss colony, so I guess it's like if you put a lot of creamer in your coffee. And oh my God. I love this gray. This dark, dark gray No I love this gray. So you you see what I- Okay good So we got the light and the dark so we're just gonna do the dark behind your bed Oh, so one wall basically like an accent wall right and then we have some other Textural beautiful things planned Ready for the catch? What's the catch? We're doing it all splatter paint. Oh my God that is really? No! Joey's just being annoying! She was so down All right, well you know what Joey just loves painting so much I think it's time that we leave him with his favorite pastime. Christine you ready for another project? Yes, I am. Next time you see it. Next time you see it hopefully it won't be covered in plastic. Oh my gosh That's not the look we're going for now the real work starts so you had These already framed. What I want to do is because the whole goal is to bring in some like peaceful contrast and kind of give you like Cohesion and a story because I feel like when there's a consistent design story around a room It's peaceful because it's like it makes sense. I just got these like basic Black frames with white mats. The other frames you had didn't have any mats and these are such awesome pictures I feel like they deserve mats But what I thought would be a really cool project is to create our own Pattern on the mats something that people don't usually do is draw on the mats. Yeah, I wouldn't have thought of that No, you're right. It's gonna be really easy. It's basically gonna be taking a straight edge and just doing like all kinds of diagonal Geometric lines, we're gonna finally get these adorable photos on the wall and off the floor And I love this project because it's literally something Anyone can do and it's also fun to be able to look at something on your wall And know that you've added your personal touch to it and the cool geometric lines will just help reinforce our neutral minimalist But still creative vibe that we have going on in this space. That looks so cool Thank you. Like we could sell these. So I'm gonna leave this on a side and you'll get to the third one I'm gonna go upstairs and just you know decorate your master bedroom and no peeking upstairs Bye! Love you bye! It is time for the design snapshot where I show you creative weirdos a sneak peek into the design elements that I plan to bring into the space. I'm going to use this lick squared designer pack of Greyscale Sand-Dunes as the jumping-off point to bring in other black white and metallic and neutral accessory We're establishing a very peaceful elegance in this room. Can you see it? Now it's time to share this on Snapchat, and instastory I know you are following me by now my username is in the description. That's okay. Go follow now So sweaty. Okay, so we've got our walls painted easy-peasy And now we're gonna add some nice simple touches to the room. Just elevate it to the next level We're placing a cool vintage looking fan with some wood blades to help mix up the styles going on in the space and give it A more decorated touch and on the food window she's already have these Blackout Roller shades so we're just gonna frame that window out with a cool industrial Rod and Da-da-da-da... Curtains! This is the designer pack that I think is just so perfect for this room. Neutral but so Textured and complex you know Blank the window yeah, and do two and two so this is a whole like symmetrical story that's happening here I'm gonna get these acrylic prints up on the wall a good tip when hanging things is to start with a smaller drill bit first To determine if you're going into wood or drywall if it's wood, you'll feel a little resistance as you're trying to drill You should also see some wood come out with your bit if you don't get any resistance or wood then you know you're in drywall And that means it's time to use an anchor with your screws Oh my gosh, christ, tags *French accent* Consumerism! Macrame! You are, so soft you are So creamy and you'll go on this hole like this. I am spitting I wanna put something larger scale above her bed But I don't want to do artwork since we already have plenty of that going on in here So I'm going to use a macrame wall weaving and I'm just sliding this onto a natural wood dowel Rod that we got at the hardware store. This wants to go... Okay so I'm taking this all the way to the ceiling, right? Joey, look at this. It is like the cutest Recliner you've ever seen. Wow! Okay, where do you want this right center?
 right am I center? There's like so many colors and shades of grey in here and beige that it's like very colorful Yes, Joey Stimulating for us all cause six five quatros? Sure five quarters of pizza. Just look. With breaking Beige with breige breaking beige with beige. With breige? Breaking beige with beige. I like breige. Breaking beige with beige. Hey breaking beige with beige *Joey chants* bleige Breaking beige with beige. It's something to flip breaking beige with beige. Gonna juggle really dangerous things Joey! watch the art! Can you just... extract Extracting We're bringing back in her beautiful dresser that she already had cos if it ain't broke don't replace it. Oh !Oh, oh! You okay? Yeah? I saw that point go right into your... cabeza. Yeah me to you. I don't... You to me. I don't do that You have stuff to put on this? Do I?! So you creative weirdos know I love using hand-lettered art in my designs. It just adds a personal touch I'm gonna use one of the maps that we've already made, and inside I'm writing queen of Peace because Caiden has been Christine's queen of Peace through her tough journey over the last two years and now it's just going to be all Happy healthy Vibes from here on out. So Caiden are you excited? Yes? What color do you think our rooms gonna be? Red! Red? Well I'm hoping it's gonna be a room that I can fall asleep Really easily, and I hope it's nice and calming that's what mommy's hoping for Okay keep your eyes closed! Keep your eyes closed! Keep walking forward. All right, we're gonna count to three and you're gonna open your eyes and look all around. Are you ready? Oh my gosh! One... Two... Three Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!

Yeeeeees And they even do a little bend at the knees and we also got you this really awesome artwork So there's a really famous photographer named Peter lik who started this company called lick square where basically we can get like Galleries quality prints from so we got you those their dunes they're peaceful It's the whole story of textures. Isn't it crazy that  in this whole room There's so much gray and beige, but it looks so colorful. Yeah. Yeah, what's your favorite part of the room? What do you think? The new fan? Oh my god i didn't even notice that fan! Something a little more old school, like vintage vibes and bringing in the wood tones. I just never would have thought it would look like this.

very happy so you're excited give this video thumbs up and also subscribe because we are at a jillion subscribers thank you thank you take it easy we're going are created weirdo Valentin you hungry now virtual hawk what is an interior designer the traditional definition of an interior designer because there is a difference between interior designer and interior decorator an interior designer is someone that has more of a macro view of beach planning they're oftentimes we more involved with the actual building of a sea they also do obviously the finishing touches and stuff as well an interior decorator is definitely way more about just those finishing things within an already existing room pink color and furniture and decorative objects etc for the purposes of this video I'm just going to use the term interior designer because they feel like nowadays just renovating and all that stuff you might be confronted with something that are a little bit more interior designer s and less interior decorator s but obviously I do both enter and in soup guys I was really organized when figuring out the spot I actually wrote up everything look at this oh my gosh I feel like I'm getting like a college presentation I'll be your professor cross arms can be a role obviously part one a PowerPoint presentation maybe we'll just edit in so part one how I became an interior designer I think it will probably be interesting for you to know just what my journey was because it is not a traditional journey I really found myself here I do not have my certificate I haven't taken a test you have to take a test and we're going to get approved by the National Board of a thought about ah what is it called when we could smell my nose it's so sweet I bought one so I don't even notice you have to pass the National Council for interior design qualification exam I think I'm calling myself an interior designer I guess by the you know standards of the qualification of whatever I have a past exam however I get paid to design people's faces and decorate and help them renovate and all that stuff in that respect I am a professional so I've been doing this for about eight years now and I wanted to share with you some steps along the way that I think contributed to me being a professional creative weirdo aka interior designer one of those things is I grew up with a very creative mother he was always bi wiring things around our house I also have a grandmother who worked at a so finishing place so I grew up is my mom DIY and all the time my grandma doing art projects of media making faux finishes on wall I quickly realized that all of it was doable and it wasn't so scary so that was really cool my mom at one point hired an interior designer when we moved to decorate a couple of the rooms and how that was a big like WoW moment for me I was like oh this is like a career but someone does it where they come into the home like we can look really awesome so that was a big light bulb I did a lot of art and no school I went to really treated school a welder school shout out while they're kids I did go to college even though I didn't take that exam and major in interior design I did graduate from the University of Loyola Marymount here in California and there I majored in film production which was a really valuable experience because I did a lot of art direction and production design back dressing a lot of those things used to be for your student films they got to decorate faces and also see how they looked on camera I minored in theater I was acting professionally he's been loosening up an IV v and probably watched some really weird funny bad movies that I've been in and the reason why I think being an actress really helps me now as an interior designer in I have to play roles still you know I'm not reading lines etc but I am having to channel different personalities and you design for other people you're interpreting their personal tastes so I have to handle them either room through their eyes really tried to play a character to give them the room that they will like I was always really experimental with my personal style like I've always dressed weird these people would always say that like you're so weird a force now you guys know I have turned that into a positive term because they truly lead but being a weirdo just means you are expressing your inherent awesome unique creativity that's inside of you and being able to direct fun and funky and express yourself through your personal style through your creative projects DIY projects and interior design it's all a reflection of how weird and wonderful you are the birth of mr. Tate started about six seven years ago I started it as a blog his chronicler my creative pursuit family jewelry line and I also started the YouTube channel to just be able to make videos that was a way for me to really see how much people responded to DIY projects and stuff like that obviously and exercise making and feeling and creating and being visually oriented since I was doing so many decorating DIYs on the channel and on the blog a lot of my friends started asking me to like help them decorate their spaces which I was fortunate for free by having a blog and videos here just online and someone found me from the Nate Berkus show and asked me to do some segments on his show so I was my first time being on camera and kind of like showing my DIY projects his acknowledging my creativity was like a big boost to my confidence after the Nate Berkus thing I got hired to be an interior designer on a show called homemade simple which was on The Oprah Winfrey Network I was an on camera and off camera interior designer so then but I being by the blue mama comic designer on a TV show now I really had friends of friends coming out of the woodwork and asking me to help them so at that point I was like you can't be working for free I should start charging so that was when I started actually charging like clients and up hiring assistant helped me do some installs and stuff that they needed help so once I started getting paid by people who are like really trusting me my interior design voice I was like you know what I really want to learn more about history of this I ended up enrolling in an extension program at UCLA legend intensive class and interior design is basically like the history of interior design and it was so fascinating and I loved it so much I love school I could have continued with the two-year program to get my certificate but I literally have no time as you guys know we're so busy with mr. Kate's up and I keep getting paid to be an interior designer that is essentially my backstory if you guys are interested in learning more about me you can watch the draw my life video and also I really encourage you to get houses on mass my book because it's super personal and I wrote a ton about a personal journey of my life so you guys are all integral of link below no pressure so that's it for part 1 and part 2 I am titling how lately my talents determine how to become an interior device these are my tips for you about how to become an interior designer in doing this video I actually googled how to become an interior designer because it's one of the few frugal said earn a degree in interior design past the National Council for interior design qualification exam take pro bono project meaning free projects at experienced fill the portfolio will look for continuing education opportunities like cool Google when do I get paid spend money on school do free projects spend money on school I'm not going to follow Google's of vitamin A to view my kit number one go to school I know such a classic typical bit of advice but if you don't want to major in interior design obviously as now know from my story that my college education really helped me know about interior design because I did film production take art history classes take history classes in general interior design is a reflection of what people did in history so fascinating if you can't afford to go to college I would definitely encourage you to just be like an internet Pro download book read a bunch of different articles and watch as many videos as you can try to educate yourself as much as possible about the history of interior design because you will only be as good as the knowledge that you have number two visualize with mood boards I don't have a project unless I have a move forward and that is where I start the brainstorming process learn how to mood board it's really easy it's really fun you can do it on Pinterest you can do it on Photoshop that spark of inspiration is really what the mood board is about for me it is not the end-all be-all of the space though a lot of times people go like I have my mood board I've decorated a room and I'm like on a computer now you actually physically manifest it which is a whole different story but I am always going back to my mood boards number three measure and create floor plans I look terrible now what floor plans is a mathematical part of being an interior designer but it is so essential because it doesn't matter how beautiful your mood board is or how beautiful the items that you buy for the space are you say don't fit it's a waste of time you want to learn how to make four plans so you can do that with a bunch of different programs there's some that I will link below or you could do it the old-fashioned way you could create kind of a scale you know using a ruler number four get your hands dirty decorating this is one of my favorite tips you know when they say practice makes perfect that is this tip and telling you actually physically interacting with furniture and spaces is the best teacher out there and you will get better and better every room because you will learn from your mistakes from your successes and I am only as good as the amount of rooms I've done like I literally get better and better every single room we do decorating is a physical activity like actually painting and screwing things into wall and hammering things together you might need some help with that obviously I have Joey burly strong man if you don't have a Joey buying yourself someone who's good at that stuff find yourself a handyman TaskRabbit etc and do some free work for friends and say hey do you want decorator taste and I come over and help you you have like 100 bucks to spend we could go to script store and like I some stuff and paint it and knit it enough number five no your work if you are looking to be an interior designer an interior decorator in order for it to be a career you need to make money this is a question I get a lot how do I know what to charge people really the best way to do it it's just charge someone for your time so you could start out charging people's hourly the range is gigantic because obviously there are people that don't have that much experience and then there's people that have so much experience and have like and mean and whatever you could be from $20 an hour to like a thousand dollars an hour so find your sweet spot you can also do a flat fee per project you can kind of like ballpark like okay think this will keep me around 20 hours 30 hours 40 hours to get this room to office rooms get it set up another traditional thing that interior designers will do is if you have a retail license you're registered with a federal tax ID that gives you a discount where you get kind of closer to wholesale prices then they charge a commission on that they basically resell to the client for retail and they keep the difference basically charging a commission on the things that they're finding I don't personally do that I like to find cheap awesome budget-friendly finds so I was always going with the hourly rate number six oh how to spend other people's money that is really hard because you're basically ballparking in what I like to do is create a spreadsheet and I input ballpark numbers of things will be like well I'll probably spend around $800 on a cow put them in and then tally it up you know you can do formulas and spreadsheets so that it'll total it up just be ballpark how much those things will cost but don't stop there remember you might need to pay an electrician you might need to pay delivery fees you might need to pay installers to help you put up certain things so make sure you are putting in line items for all of the things that you are imagining that you to pay for then you will see what is sort of your basic guesstimate initial budget I will tell you that everything ends up being more expensive than you think it's going to be but that is because you are buying everything all at once people usually don't shop like that when they're decorating their space so like buy a cow six months later buy a dining table so it doesn't feel like as much but when your interior designing you are getting everything for that room and one bulk shop though it is a higher ticket but it is basically the same amount of money they would probably otherwise spend over the course of three years one thing I always tell people to keep in mind when it comes to budget and how much would you spend on a hotel you know when you go to a hotel edie it's like a nicer hotels oh this is so nice and luxurious how much was that for night then like add that up and see how my flower cross if you lived in the hotel probably a lot well your home should be like a hotel gorgeous and lovely and inviting and happy and relaxing and all those things you feel in a hotel what is the dollar amount to place on that alright we have reached the end the last tip number seven believe in your talent it sounds cheesy but it is so important as an interior designer you are going to be making creative decisions all the time in stores online with people they're gonna be asking would you believe in your voice and your creative ability to answer those questions and make those decisions and you can do it there is no wrong way to be creative there's no rule your way in this particular case when it's your project is the right way remember that and believe in those instincts it doesn't always go the way that you think it's going to go I make decisions all the time I'm like that's the one that's the rub oh my god oh and then the rug doesn't come in time or a stained or a different color in person than it was online and I have to make a decision to change it you guys know if you watch my shopping videos I am confronted all the time and I just look at it as another moment to be creative okay universe serves me this and I am going to make the most of it and I'm going to make sure that this actually makes the movies better who need in that talent confidence is really seen and you can do it there is no wrong way the creative window and that's so cool alright so if you have lasted to the end of this video congratulations guys you uzoma that means that you are truly very interested in interior design or interior decorating or just being a professional creative person and being able to make money being a creative person so I really hope that this video helps give you guys the tips and tools and maybe some tricks to figure that for your own journey everyone's journey is unique there are so many different ways to go about being a professional in the creative space obviously I am just one person I encourage you to get other people's advice but in closing I just want to end on this note and I truly believe and interior design and decorating is just an outward reflection of who you are internally even though it seems superficial it is a really big important job because people's home spaces offices are environments where they will create and do really important things and then alive how inspiring and functional those spaces are is just crucial thank you so much for watching please subscribe please give this video a

Kate come over and help me with this freaking beige project she's gorgeous raven with that raven black hair and I'm assuming William is her director William thinks she doesn't have to be in front of the camera he's got another thing covered for I love but she likes bohemian style because that is so well-suited for a nursery it's very magical we won't go crazy with the colors we'll keep it still kind of neutral but obviously breaking their beach with some textures and the magical moment and I think she's having a girl alright guys don't forget to subscribe we're gonna go in and break this household of their beige and thumbs up here give us a thumbs up sixty thousand thumbs up just thumbs it up because she's an expectant mother and she's gonna have a beautiful baby thumbs up to that

nick of time they have been working on this room a little bit construction wise but as you can see it is basically a junk collector at this point so we are going to clean everything out and create a beautiful peaceful space okay first my first question is you have a compressor with the nail gun and you look like you have a new door frame this is you yeah I just did all this oh really I don't know what we're here for because I need help I'm stuck doing all these projects and I have no time and they don't get finished well we're the finishers we need to have it be like a sanctuary for baby very calm yeah and your style is like Samia feathers dreamcatcher I love that I love that too neutral colors like knock great coffee baby or like peaceful behavior alright project peaceful they oh let's get over there okay not the people [Music] it's times at the design snapshot I'm gonna be using these beautiful lick squared images these are the shadowbox photographs this beautiful black-and-white bridge shot of the perspectives it just feels very peaceful and then this forest image feels that a beautiful tone for the textures are bringing in like so sheepskin and hill pink pillows and faux flowers I love the look of these faux flowers with folk greenery just have a very whimsical wildflower look I'm going to be using these in a DIY I've seen a little bit and then also some accents like crystal dreamy ins and natural textures that are perfect with a bohemian vibe that we're going for in this space and the time posts need to be picked my insta story and my snapchat you guys follow me on there yet come on get on it it's fun [Music] you obviously mr. handyman you did your homework and you already primed the walls right yes sir so we're just gonna throw some paint on that primer all right here we go girls do the fun stuff all right so me and William we're gonna do all the sweaty work while Kate Raven go and have fun and do creative projects you really want the nursery to start off with a clean pallet so we've primed all the walls and we're painting them a nice decorators wife oh look at he's full mom all settled in okay you said it feathers you love yeah I feel like no nursery is complete without a mobile of sorts so I thought it would be really fun to DIY one put like a bohemian beautiful cuz I feel like a lot of them are like kind of a little more cartoony yeah oh yeah so something a little more or no I'm loving this we have feathers galore this is an embroidery hoop you know like a quilting who people stretch the fabric over we're gonna just use the inner hoop it's a good size you know it's very lightweight too these are those little starry light little tweet legs but they're battery-operated this thinner ribbon can be the ones that hang I would start with the underneath layer so start with wrapping all the pieces that are gonna hang first and then probably the twinkle lights and then maybe something like this is the fit okay the finishing cover all right huh sunbeams alrighty here we go all right so whoops oh this is a project that you're just gonna tackle on your own okay so basically we have these wall shelves that we want to put in the room call them vintage okay hey used it's all about upcycling saving a buck you know sander mask primers over there paints over there call if you have any questions but I think you got this okay yeah this is easy stuff right while I leave William to work on these bookshelves to give them a brand new life I'm gonna put together the structure for a tent that Kate wants to put inside the wheel I'm using four dowel rods that we got the hardware store I'm gonna drill holes into each one of them so I can secure them all together with some twine what my gosh no shoe what's on the rug I don't have dirt on my shoes you have paint on your shoes it's not wet paint you put the rug out without me it's a small rug I didn't need you oh this looks great right say you own it no way out another fun project we're doing in this space is a really easy DIY triangle shelf to hang up on the wall I've got a long piece of one by four that I'm gonna cut into smaller sections and then using my chop saw I'm cutting 30 degree angles on the end of the pieces with 260 degree cuts for the top and then I'm attaching it all together with some wood glue and a nail gun for the time I'm using a combo of lightweight cotton fabric and flow flowers to make it whimsical hideaway for momma and baby to just lay in play and read stories in but we need to make this secure so I'm going to nail down these fabric pieces to the Beast it's gonna keep the dolls from sliding out and then it's gonna keep wrapping the fabric around kneeling at the top at the bottom and letting the excess drape down around the opening to welcome them it [Music] communism' pliers to trim and shape my beautiful folk greenery and flowers and I am attaching them with some twine oh my gosh Joey so obsessed with it can we have one of these in our house Raven could sitting here but obviously this is like her baby too I wanted a lot of texture you know since we're not doing like a ton of color in here Cheers plus outer curtains overhead I'm installing a simple flush mount crystal light to cast plenty of dreamy brightness into the space this is one of my favorite vintage chairs I mean I can't not step on the carpet Joey yeah product Oh

they watch TV where they also study and hang out at the table but the floor plan with the couches all along one wall and the drab color palette is not worthy for this inspiring organization so we need to change is this the room where we're tackling they have been talking about this forever so they are extremely excited about you guys being you've already got like a good color palette this is like a children right yeah all right well first things first it's cleared up let's get it in here [Applause] [Music] all right we've got two new members of the squad welcome all right who wants to be on a team Kate who was gonna team Jeff raise your hand for team cake yeah you guys go to your thing okay everyone on Team Joey over here all right so we have a lot of wall to cover Erica you could finish taping the baseboards Patrick you want to pop up in the paint oh my gosh I'm getting so just give it a stir are we taping this today yes currently these walls are a very beige in beige beige beige one of the goals of the space is that we're gonna make it bright and happy for the residents so team Joey is gonna bang out these walls and a nice clean white as the canvas for the rest of the interior design okay so I'm really glad that you chose me on my team because it's gonna be fun we have here a window and another window and more windows are there you guys live in a craftsman house so you guys live in a historical la house which is rare so we want to celebrate that we also want to give you guys privacy you guys had a curtains here they were kind of drab kind of dark we really want to let the light in make this a happy welcoming room right and the daylight is a big part of that so we are going to make this into kind of a textured glass is actually very appropriate for the time period but we're gonna DIY it and make it look like in the old school so I want to take this diamond-like thing that's happening up here there is this really cool fake lettin it's basically the way they used to make this was with lead we're gonna Dutch learn real not poisonous they don't know that back then and then we also have this which is white when it's wet but it's gonna dry clear and we're gonna take this and go all over all the windows on the front and kind of blend it in using pick once it dries here it'll create like a textured glass look which will help with privacy but it'll still it the lightness is that basically looks like we're smearing like glue on the window which is kind of what it is but trust me once this is dry it's going to blow your mind I can't go to Diamond pattern with tape on the outside of the window and now Rosa and I are laying down the faux lead with a sticky side down along those lines but on the inside of the window this continues the design from the window above down to this main Center window but we're going to keep the other side windows just clean but still adding that texture for privacy oh by the way we found that using plastic spoons worked a little bit faster than the toothpicks now in a driver my design sneak peek you guys know this is when I let you creative weirdos in on what I'm thinking for the color palette and design direction in the space I kept the walls white so we could really showcase this gorgeous Lix where photography in a variety of colors and so textured I'm just really obsessed with these prints I'm gonna bring in some more blue and mustard tones in the decorative accent as well as some metallics to add some vintage luxury to this Craftsman style home now it is time to post it on my snapchat Instagram which I know you guys are following me by now okay if you're not just quickly do it the names earning the description [Applause] wait two beautiful ladies for a picnic I don't mind if I do so I have here what do you guys call these cultures the House Rules Oh guys I might have a house rule now ladies we keep these to order and it keeps us organizing the Keats's from fighting and stuff like that also helps you learn self-sufficiency which is really important for anyways it's funny because if I think about our home I live with Joey we totally have House Rules I just we haven't written them down so it's an example we make our bed every day we have two cats they're like our fur babies so there's a whole set of rules we have to take care of them they have medicine we have to give them every night he puts the toilet seat down every time after he pees there's a lot of these that are actually like empowering the whole idea behind them is like a positive right so we want to honor this these need to be around so I'm gonna rewrite these on a beautiful new big magnetic chalkboard but I thought it would be really cool to do like little artistic bullet-point I love the idea and the symbolism of crystals and rock crystals have like a lot of good energy to them I figured you guys could pick out 10 stones that speak to you I would avoid maybe this huge monk is these are magnets obviously these are big I would definitely use these for the larger stones and then these are the smaller ones and then this is a six thousand which is just really strong glue so you're just gonna want to coat the back of the stone with the glue have fun I'll call you guys in the room done yeah yeah all right I'm gonna leave Renetta and Tatiana to their fun craft projects can Joey and I have to get cracking on that giant space because we really need to finish it in time to show them before the Sun Goes Down they currently have a ceiling fan and then a flush-mount white on the other side of the room since it's a big space I'm gonna give them two matching ceiling fans flashlight combos to help both cool down the space and bring in more overhead lighting for the new shaker looking house rules chalkboard I'm going to first season the board using a piece of chalk and just smearing it all over the board and then you an eraser to get the excess off this will just make the chalkboard look left brand-new and also allowed to be erased more easily if they ever need to change or add more rule to the board later [Music] respect each person's personal belongings rooms food etc clean up after yourself no bullying Julie acknowledged in passing outside and in communal spaces hey acknowledge me Minnie the trade edge to draw some fine lines which all erase later but this is just so that I can write beautifully with a chalkboard marker in cursive writing and make sure it's as straight as possible my hope is to make these rules really feel like art integrated into the space so that they youths will encounter them feel like they are a welcome set of constructive ideas to enrich their lives on both ends of the room are given the new curtains as you know my very favorite thing in the world complete with a second rod so that they'll have shears on them so that way they can have the shears close but the light still gets let in and the curtains are there hanging to the sides and they'll bring in a fun pattern and also just really bring in that decorated touch before they have the TV on one wall and all the pressure on the opposite wall so now we're gonna move the TV to the far end of the room and create more of a multi-dimensional conversation / TV viewing area that looks so good Oh Thank You DC I have up please and thank you please and thank you this also turned out really I know it was like so scary oh and hopefully not okay let's see this rug Wow color would you call this cornflower all-news because there's a save on flower mochi for flowers blue poor my room is important to yellow it's a big vintage leather towel they may recognize this amazing gigantic leather couch if you've been following us for a while yes this used to be in our living room in our old apartment we had it in storage waiting for the perfect safe to use it again because a well-made leather couch like this can be passed on for decades and really just gets better with age and we felt like the LAN was the perfect new home for it oh that was really dumb Joey did you just give yourself a cervical spine injury no but that's what it's like working with you take that back big fat and take it back lift it I cannot lift it I'm smart I'm not face planning my cervical spine [Music] that's not in the right place let's just place the other couch and we can ice thereof oh so this is a hutch they had the upside wards but it works well style from the corner office at the couch we are putting a mid-century modern inspired great tweed reading chair complete with a brass tone reading lamp and matching gray ottoman to make it a cozy place for lounging with a book to complete this conversation area we are placing one of the charcoal grey couches they already had perpendicular to the big leather couch and opposite to the TV you gotta put the four pictures in the black mats right okay you know how to do this way yeah well I picked all these prints cause like they're kind of textural shots Wow that black is really beautiful inspiring images but like not too specific to a city or anything so it feels kind of nurturing from the earth itself I look so good oh man the black we're gonna finish placing these other three beautiful acrylic prints into they're interchangeable Matt I really love how these masks are this rich black color it's such a fun and bold contrast to these colorful nature shots and it will look so glamorous when they are hung up on our freshly painted walls rebirth winter summer hydrate I do to my best friend the laser level I'm just gonna measure out where my screws need to go to hang these frames and also make sure they're level really easy to hang just drill in put an anchor in the wall done before we brought in a large end table because this couch is so huge and on top I'm placing these nautical dark blue glass lamps with burlap shape which are elegant yet cozy and Joey is doing a great job hanging artwork we have these four large frames so we are spacing them to give it an all-encompassing 360 gallery experience when you walk into the space over here the front door we're establishing another conversation slash meeting area we're putting down around natural fiber rug to anchor the space and on top of it we are reusing the sturdy pedestal table they already had but then pairing it with some brand inexpensive but expensive looking both other chairs to go around the table on top of the table and placing a copper bowl with decorative balls that bring in a touch of natural texture and contrast to the metallic mr. Qadir this was when we up cycled its lapis but maybe TG Weaver it's the DIY from the book hot glue gun s available on chopped Oh mr. K talk today of a thermostat above the hutch we are placing on the wall by the stairs which we obviously can't cover up so we are going to beautify the area around with some accessories and some pan lettered artwork I'm writing welcome home because I think that perfectly sums up what we want the space to represent to everyone who's living here it's a beautiful inviting home this mercury left coffee table is actually a DIY I made for the mr. Kate book a hot glue gun math so these la YN people are actually getting some really awesome mr. Cade heirloom to use in this space next to the entry cabinet including a white plant stand with a spoke plant and finally I'm putting the finishing touches of these amazing rock and crystal magnets on the house rules chalkboard I think that that let's bring in the lovely [Music] okay moving over carrot here moving over Eric here okay we're gonna count to three you guys are gonna close your eyes ready one two three [Music] and that's so please know - oh it's like good vibes thank you guys [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] this is such a legit vintage leather couch this is soaked [Music] are we bringing everybody else marks here okay mark come see this I'm gonna behalf of everybody that lives in this house we vote against all the better of our appreciation to vote for you guys we play mr. Kane so great to see you again thank you so much for having us we should know really like it's meant so much to like me everyone came out it created such a nurturing organization we're so impressed with the work that you guys do and I feel like now the space can reflect that great work welcome [Music] Oh oh my gosh I was so great wow that one felt really good good job you guys good job then there's some fun that was a big space but I think we've made a big transformation yeah I think we transformed some lives potentially yeah I mean they're of the age where it's just such a crucial a generic forming their dreams for their lives and I just think they spend time like conversing in that space and dreaming and planning so I just really wish them the best guys thumbs up the video if you liked it make sure and subscribe because who knows maybe we'll show up on your doorstep alright guys love you thanks for watching woah breaking [Music] you pick up the paint because I need kidding me faster well I know what all right someone intelligent

I love it! I never get to play with, like, rainbow color palettes, it's so fun! Okay, alright. We're falling over? Hi, I'm Jessie Paege. I'm 18 years old and I make YouTube videos about everything? They're kinda - they're all over the place, but that's cool. It's fun. I got this apartment, literally there was no color I just feel like it just doesn't fit my personality and it's hard to film there and it just doesn't feel like home yet, you know? I am truly inspired by just Jessie's essence. I mean, she just turned eighteen. She moved to LA. She lives by herself. This is her first, like, apartment out on her own. So this room is really, really important. This is literally where she spends all of her time. She's going to be filming videos in this apartment. That is her livelihood. She's a young professional and makes money by doing her videos, so obviously all of the backgrounds of her videos all really need to reflect her fun, fun vibe. Okay. Wow. Okay, one big empty room. I am so excited about this room because it is so rare that someone sends me inspiration pictures that are literally just rainbow, mermaid, unicorn explosions. It's just this big, empty, white space and I'm hoping that the room ends up being super color, lots of personality, anything that's weird is a 'yes' in my book. And that's just the way I want to live my life. I want to live a very colorful life all around! Basically, like, if you think it's too crazy, it's not. People watch my videos and they expect my apartment to literally be this, like this aesthetic, like the rainbow nails and everything And I'm like, I feel like I'm disappointing myself I'm like big, little sister. You guys kinda look like a band. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What, The Pinks? Pinky and the Pop? Pinky and the Pop? She's Pinky, I'm Pop. Pop! I just pop out from behind her because I can basically just hide behind her. Pop! Cool, I'm your manager. Okay, so. This is obviously supposed to be your living room, kitchen, dining room. You're gonna shoot in here. So, when I moved to LA, I didn't just want to have a white background So basically, I had just a little, little patch of tie-dye with a ton of fairy lights. It looked horrible, but it looked so good on video. So I would love to have that aesthetic throughout my whole apartment because that would make filming a lot easier. I would be able to film all around my apartment. Pinky and the Pop, we're going to the top of the charts! Today, we are gonna make some hits! You're listening to KISS Mr. Kate FM. Number one on the dial tonight is Pinky and the Pops! Let's go! Well, we gotta get all of the supplies. Paint and stuff. Are you excited? Yeah, can I make food? First, you know, gotta spray it with some perfume. Gordon Ramsay, where you at? Jessie's cooking her lunch. But she's not really cooking her lunch. She's cooking a piece of paper. This is gonna be a bizarre episode, guys. Alright, here. Now, Mr. Kate and I have, um, addressed that this is fairy pee. Put some of that in here, you know. Be quiet. Uh, maple syrup from the same branches that were used in Beyonce's pregnancy photoshoot. Pieces of unicorn poop. Throw that in there. A little bit of sweetness with a hint of, uh, edginess. You know, gotta start my morning with that. So, here I have some DIY meme toast, no clickbait, with live footage. Great quality content. So original. I hope you're not scared of needles! We have an experiment we want to do on you- with you. With you. Um, will you take this as a piece offering? Leave me alone. Come with us right now. Follow us patient zero. Come, patient! I'm filling up these buckets with one part water and two parts paint and then using a stir stick to nicely mix them up. I didn't go with, like, bright primary rainbow colors just because I wanted it to be a little pastel, kind of like the adult version of a mermaid, unicorn palace. I am filling all these syringes - they're basically the largest syringe I could find online, they've got a nice, thick nozzle which is important because the paint, we don't want it to clog up in the nozzle. I have so much paint planned for these walls. We're going to start the first project with Jessie. Okay, so we have before us, as you can see, an array of these giant syringes with rainbow colors! So Jessie's room has some interesting architectural elements. She has a soffit and a column wall that sort of creates an L space dividing her living room area and her dining room area. And I really like that this L-shape creates a rectangle that is the perfect place to do some cool mural art. What do you think we're doing? Are we splatter painting or-- Paint fight! We're going to use these syringes and basically create a drip wall. What? Yeah! She's crazy, we're crazy, it's a crazy world, get crazy  on your own walls, that's what we're doing. So, you get to start with one color, I'll start with one color. What color would you like to start with? What do I get to do? You're gonna hand us the colors. What kind of deal is that? A great deal. Why do I got this suit on? Because you might get dripped on, you know. This is gonna be our first hit - the drip drip song. Okay, you're gonna do blue, you're gonna do yellow. Okay. Alright. See how I just managed that situation? No, I don't want to do yellow, I'm gonna do green. You do blue, I'll do green. You go on the tall ladder because you're a small, you go on the small ladder because you're a tall. Alright, so this technique is super simple, you guys. This is so much fun. You basically just tape off your area. Of course, you want to have a nice line of painter's tape up at the top so you're not getting any of the drips up on the ceiling. Let me do the first drip. Are you ready? Just point the syringe there at the tape line and just slowly - drip- watch your drip. You got this girl! Ready? Yes! Drip on. Good, yeah, you got it, Jessie! Great! We're just letting it drip, literally, we're just putting a teensy bit on paint and letting it drip, putting some paint so that we have some lines, like dripping parallel lines. That requires a lot of precision. Kate is just over there, she's looking like a queen and I feel like the peasant. Like, you know, in comparison. Should I do it right here? Just random is good. Don't overthink it. We're making this a rainbow explosion. Alright, anyone wanna switch? I got a good solid four. Please, please don't mess up. I like that we're starting the drips all at the same point. It kind of gives it a more uniform look. Wait, look at how good this looks. Oh, my gosh. The drips just take on their own lives. Just live drip, live! This drip wall is just, like, so amazing, you guys. Like, I'm so excited about this. I want to do this everywhere. We just finished the wall and it already just added so much color to my apartment. I don't even know what to expect. I'm so excited. Today, Joey Two-Rolls, he had to go, you know, paint somewhere else, but his cousin, Joey One-Roll-and-a-Paintbrush Joey Roll-Brush is here. Joey is starting the painting, which is great because there's a lot of wall space in this apartment and Jessie and I are heading to the alley to spray paint. I have two wooden crates here, I actually have, like, eight more of these. Okay. So, apparently this is happening alley. It's really loud and really hard to talk to Jessie. We're gonna do an installation of these in your room. So, we have eight more to paint, but I want you to be part of this project. I thought you could paint one, I'll paint one with you. And then I'll paint the rest when you're, like, filming videos or whatever. Awesome. After you're banished. We've primed them, so, let's just get a nice coverage with these colors. Alright. I used to be Glam With Jessie on YouTube. Oh! Which is not me at all now. I'm literally not even wearing lip color. No glam. Yeah, but you have pink hair, so that, like, is instant glam when you wake up. This is my arm workout for the day. I know, this is my, like, pointer-finger workout. Pointer-finger workout, yeah! You know, you gotta work up those finger muscles. Everything I say rainbow-- Now there's two guys! He just looked at me and was like, like, yeah, we know we're being annoying. Alright, mine's looking pretty good on all sides. How are you always so fast and then there's me? Oh, your's looks good! Yes, Pinky! This is a good moment for me to- You have stuff to do today, right? I'll figure something out. You have videos to edit or -- Yeah, cool. Because, um, I'll probably say goodbye to you here. You're banishing me in the alley? You're gonna throw me in the trash? Maybe just stand guard on these while they're drying. Okay. Cool, just text me when they're dry. Just stand by the trash? Yeah. Alright. Love you, bye! Where do I go? I can't go home. I mean, she's already outside, like, it's a beautiful day. Go for a walk. Bond with a dumpster. Joey Two-Rolls, man. He just bangs out those sherbet colors. Just boom, boom on the wall and I'm obsessed with these colors. I haven't been this excited about a color palette in a while. This isn't even a color palette. This is the color wheel. So, this patch of wall between these two columns is another great space that can be designated for a wall mural. I wanna put this arch rainbow emerging from the back of her couch. What I love about this, you guys, is that it looks like the rainbow arch is going over and then, like, becoming just liquid rainbow rain on the other side with the drip wall. It's like - it's just an explosion, a rainbow explosion! It's so fun! Okay, walls are painted. Time to bring in the furniture. We are taking all of these multicolor crates and we are placing them on this wall. It's gonna feature her guitar. We're deconstructing the rainbow in this room, right? We've got it dripping down over on the drip wall and then, of course, we need the clouds because as the clouds part, the rainbow comes out. Okay, you get it. Science. Hashtag science. We have this beautiful arch lamp. Yeah. You know, kind of retro vibes. So, the plan is, I wanna make, like, a cloud lamp, you know? Like hanging around the bulb since we have the grid already built in here, tie them on and they're already hanging down from the shade. Which, might look more finished. Yeah. Wait, what is this? It's just cotton? No, it's cloud. These clouds are really easy to make. We're using pillow stuffing and this is just, you know, polyester pillow stuffing you can get at the craft store. fabric store, it's super inexpensive, and then monofilament, which is just clear thread. Look what I'm doing. I'm basically, like, sewing it together. With the monofilament. Is this what it's hanging with too? Yeah. Okay, so I'm gonna do a longer piece then. See, look! It's staying together nicely. I'm creating the shape that I like then I'm taking the monofilament and kind of threading it through the clouds. Oh, gosh. Kate, you know, just let me do my thing. Just give me a minute. I don't know. Guys, it's DIY. I don't typically do the DIYs because, you know, I'm just, like, the truck around here. I just kind of move things and hang things, but today, I'm gonna create with Kate, so create with Kate time. Bing! Come on, cloud! Your's looks clumpy! Your's looks like a raincloud! I'm pretty sure my cloud's the best. It doesn't matter, every cloud is unique. Look, I can do anything with this and it doesn't even come apart. Leave it long because I wanna see, like, how long. You might want to adjust, but I'm gonna leave it long, just in case you want to adjust. It's like a puppet show. Then the storm came in! Just tie a secure knot, trim off the excess, and ta-da! You have a beautiful arch lamp and some clouds hanging from it! Beautiful. You know what we need in order have rainbows? The sun! A very important ingredient in the makings of a rainbow. See how we have that really ugly double plug situation over there? We need to cover it. We have so much going on, let's do, like, minimalist art. So, just like, a shape cut-out sun in a frame. Alright, so, the artwork I'm doing is a sun. It's a super, super complicated piece of art, guys. I want you to pay very close attention. because there's a lot of steps to this, I don't want you to mess this up. We want to try to get a perfect circle cut out of this construction paper. So, what we're gonna do is you're gonna have to find a plate. And you're gonna put that plate on the construction paper. Here's the trick - you're gonna trace the plate. Then we are gonna use scissors. You know what scissors are? Okay. Now, amazingly, you have a circle of the paper. What we're gonna do, is we're gonna cut out small triangles. Those are gonna go around the circle. And guess what we got? A sun. Oh, my gosh, Joey is signing his art. That is so cute! Okay, so more DIY art. I was watching one of Jessie's recent videos. She just turned 18 and she was talking about how she had a 'finsta' which is a fake instagram, it's basically the one you have with your friends. But Jessie made a joke about her finsta. She said that because she loves mermaids, it would be a "fin"-sta. So, I got totally inspired by that and I was like, we need to make a piece of art over the sideboard that's going over in that corner. I painted the background the pink color that is over on the opposite side of the room and it's just bringing that color over there on to the sherbet wall. And then, down at the base, I'm using the pale blue that was used in the drip wall and the rainbow mural. And then, I'm just sketching out a mermaid tail, like she's diving into the ocean, into the cool blue water. And then I'm painting this the mint green that is also from our drip and rainbow murals. Once the fin is dry, I am now hot glueing some gemstones because it is not complete without some giant jewels. So just hot glue those on in whatever formation you desire and ta-da, it's art! Kate's helping me put together the couch, sort of. She doesn't understand the way screws thread. This isn't working, brah! Then you're not doing it right. You're screwing into the receptacle. Well, it goes both ways-- No, it doesn't go both ways. Think about it. Joey, that's my outlook on life. Your outlook is to go both ways? Don't knock it til you try it. Do you understand that? Why you can't do it the other way? No, I don't. It was working the other way. Cause there's no threads on that side. Joey is, like, trying to school me on, like, which way to put the bolt, but, you know, I'm an outside the box thinker. So, does it make sense now? Joey, don't quiz me. She understands a lot more, so it's okay if she doesn't get that one little piece. So, let's flip it over. Oh, wait. What? Where does this one go? To go along with our two accent walls, we have two rugs. These rugs are really cool. They're the over-dyed rugs. They're sort of that classic design of rug, but then they just, like, dumped a bunch of pigment on top of them. So, I love that. It's kind of like a play on, like, an old school look. [Joey] Wow, mine looks so good. Mine looks so good! You wanna come check out my rug? Well, I think I'm gonna try my own cuddle. What? Kate? I'm gonna do an independent woman cuddle. It's real good, you sure you don't wanna cuddle? Independent woman cuddle and lounge. I'm good. It's just so freeing and spacious. I could do the breaststroke. My lighting's great over here by the door. I can do the backstroke. Oh, gosh! A whale! This is me stopping us from drowning. What? You're preventing me from even doggy paddling right now. You take the piece of wood. We're hanging this massive mirror with, like, gold paint and these prongs that come off it. So, I'm just gonna make sure it's secure in wall. I'm using a really heavy duty wall anchor and yeah, it looks really cool. We needed a sideboard for the dining room and it was actually a really big piece of wall, so to get a sideboard that is that long would be really, really expensive. So, a nice budget-saving tip for you guys is to get two inexpensive sideboards and put them next to each other. Again, just another pop of color in the space. Functional, she can keep props for her videos in there. A dining room is not a dining room without a dining table. We are bringing in this beautiful table. It's just a rectangular wood table. Really simple, you guys, but because there is so much going on in this room, I didn't want to have a big block of color. How amazing are these? The chairs around the dining table, they are purple pleather, but it's like this matte, and it's taught and they're just modern beautiful chairs. Is there a more colorful room than this in the entire universe? I don't think so. I haven't seen it. More cloud themes! So, this will be the light fixture. This is perfect right here. Okay, yeah, centered. I need to get the piñatas!  Oh! Joey, I'm so excited about this project! Did I tell you about this yet? I'm gonna cut a little bit bigger of an opening and then stick in some of these awesome flowers. Is this a sturdy enough table for me? Is this the stupidest idea ever? You're not even reacting to me having a gold, glitter protrusion out of my forehead. It's beautiful! I'm gonna hang a new light fixture for her. Right now she just has a semi-flush, little nondescript light and we're going to swag a cool cloud chandelier thingt that's going to go over her dining table. [Kate] I might need some rocks. Whoa, Kate! I didn't know it was open. Okay guys, you know I don't like to pick favorites, but I have to say that these piñata planters are maybe one of my favorite things ever. So the trick here with these piñatas is actually anchoring them because of course they're really lightweight, they're not meant to be, like, sculptural planters. So, I have some rocks, which is the perfect thing to weight these down since especially the popsicle isn't normally resting how I want it to with the stick kind of going down. I'm also using some tissue paper to stuff into the piñatas because that kind of fills up the cavernous space below. And then allows the flowers to stick out farther as opposed to them just sinking all the way down to the bottom. Okay. Joey and I are placing sideboard, which is really cool, there's definitely a lot of mid-century modern furniture that's going on in this space. I kind of mixed both modern and mid-century modern designs. Well, if she wants, she can put a TV here, like eventually. Right. But she requested no TV. She just wants a TV in her bedroom. Wow. Good. Beautiful. This is going to be her, like, sit and play guitar spot. So, the ottoman really just anchors this corner and now makes this someplace she can chill. So, do you want equal margins above and below? I mean, I want people to be able to, like, sign it, you know? So, like, split the difference. I got it. On top of the sideboard, I am styling a slinky. It is a giant slinky, you guys. Okay, I saw this online. I was like I can't not get a giant slinky. And then some beautiful pottery. The sofa dance! Careful of the leg. We're placing the couch, it looks really cool. Next to the couch, we are placing two yellow side tables. I like using matching side tables when it's a symmetrical space. The coffee table is awesome. It's just this glass U. I wanted to go with just something, like, airy since we have, like, so much color going on. I wanted a moment of... It's nice when you look around the room to have some negative space moments or some simple moments that just of rest the eye before you - ah! I'm just placing this kind of lacquer teal tray and some nice flowers and a candle. Pink chairs! I love these chairs, they're really cool. They're definitely, like, mid-century modern vibes. Instead of a flower bouquet, how about a rock candy bouquet? Gumballs! Gumballs in a vase because why not? The throw pillows on the couch are so cute, you guys. They're definitely a little bit more geometric. The styling in this crate-shelf is just really fun. I just kind of got her some bits and bobs and doodads and she actually had some stuff already. Now she has this, like, custom shelving unit. It looks awesome right now and she can add in her records or her books or whatever else inspires her. Hello! This bench is, like, iridescent silver! And, of course, above the bench, a unicorn bust. Now, I love how connected Jessie is to her star sign. She just had her birthday, she is a Pisces. And, of course, those are very mermaid-like, so I wanted to give her a little moment of twinkle lights. And so, I am just tacking them up onto the wall in the shape of the Pisces constellation and then wrapping the starry lights around in the formation. Her kitchen is a long, one-walled kitchen. It's just kind of part of this big space. So, in order to designate that area, we're bringing in a counter-height table which can kind of function as a kitchen island. And then we found these stools which are banana yellow and delicious and have chrome bases and just look really cool. I'm bringing in a lava lamp because every kitchen should have a lava lamp. Oh, and a nice fuzzy pink rug completes the kitchen. Alright, guys, I think this room is done. Let's bring Jessie in. I'm so excited! We're gonna bring you into position. Kate and Joey are walking me over to see my apartment and I literally did not know if it was a drill or if we were actually going to be showing me the apartment. Ready? One - We'll say one, two three, rainbow. Okay, open them on rainbow. I have no idea what to expect. One, two, three, rainbow! What! Wait, no way! Wait, this is not my apartment. It's just crazy. What! How? What even? This is--- What?! Do you love it? Yes! Oh, my god! I open my eyes and I see everything I could ever imagine. I'm like, do I deserve this? Wait, the clouds! Yes! This is the coolest thing ever! [Kate] Do you love that? The rainbow across the wall, I have never seen that anywhere. All I can say is I hope I never move because I'm not giving that wall to anyone else. It's mine. Custom piece of artwork made by me. Yeah, Joey made that! That's amazing - very hard to make. How about that wall? This is everything! And you can, like, come and lay on your pouf and just be like - Yes! You inspired this art. This is your "fin"-sta wall art. So I hand-- Where did you get a giant slinky? That's amazing. I know, I know. Huge slinky? You can bet I'm never going to be productive again in my life. So, I figured your friends, since you have such an amazing squad, like, they could come and sign in. Everyone could sign in on this. You could Polaroid, you could pin up, you know. Like I literally started YouTube with a blank wall. This isn't my apartment. Like, this is insane. How great did your drip wall turn out? Come over here! Oh, my god, I'm crying! This is so cool! What? I don't deserve this! [Kate] Yes, you do! This is insane! That is the coolest idea in the world. Isn't it so - I was so excited about this. Who else ever would have the creative idea to put, like, flowers inside of a piñata? You got the aesthetic down to like the perfect, like it's perfect. It's amazing. I feel like it's still my age, but it's also colorful and fun. This is the Pisces constellation. Cause I'm a Pisces? Yeah! Oh, my gosh, thank you! This is so cool! This looks like a studio, like, oh, my gosh. I'm hoping that the room ends up being super colorful, lots of personality, anything that's weird is a yes in my book. Now I finally have a space that really reflects who I am and it really means the absolute world to me. Alright, you gotta write a song. I can play the slinky! Like an accordion! Ready? One, two- one, two, three! She loves it, you guys! I'm so happy she loves it. Like, she's gonna do so many videos in this space. Did you guys like it? Thumbs up if you liked it! Thumbs up the video if you like it! Let's get the video to a million likes. Wait, no, that's too many. Let's get this video to 40,000 likes. If we only get to three thousand likes, it's gonna be pretty embarrassing, but we're okay. But 40,000 likes would be really awesome. I'm giving you five likes right now. Just for being you. Whoa, that was aggressive. Thank you. Also, guys, go check out Jessie's channel. She has really fun, funny, cute, quirky videos. I think you guys will love, so go watch it. Alright, guys, love you. Subscribe, comment, thumbs up. Oh yeah, and follow us on social media too! We'll put our instagram and snapchat info down below because if you can't get enough of us I'm all over that stuff too. And so is Joey. We'll see you on the next OMG We're Coming Over! It's just crazy person poppy, that's what she is. She's crazy person poppy. Boom, boom, poppy. Crazy person poppy. Yeah, but like, crazy in a good way. Crazy cool. Crazy cool poppy, poppy, poppy, poppy, poppy. I just repeat things. 
[Music] hello everybody welcome to another shopping vlog I'm mister gate welcome to my channel and like never see that this block is all about Lilly superwoman i iphone I ask Lou we did two rooms in her place the bedroom and the office builder up on the channel so be a chopping logs are meant for you the hardcore interior design fans out there who want to know complete process of our room transformations some of you asked why we put out the shopping blog after we put up episodes and that is because these vlogs are just kind of behind the scenes of everything they don't really want to give away the design by putting out the shopping log first you'll also me my hair be two different colors during the shooting of this vlog because well I was shopping for Lily plays I also went and got my hair chopped off and colored and there is also a blog up about that whole process so I always like to lead in by showing you guys the mood boards and that is what I'm going to do right now I thought I'd try something a little bit different and show you guys new boards while I'm doing a screen recording at the same time is talking to you guys you could kind of see my flailing hands so girls would oh wait duh subscribe guys you want to be one of our creative weirdo family just hit that subscribe button and when we get to 1 million subscribers part of hash tag mr. gate 1 million we will pick one of you lucky subscribers to win a $10,000 room transformation oh my gosh so let's get into these mood boards and I'm going to show you here the first mood board which is a Lilly's bedroom if you don't know the mood boards are what I build based off of inspiration images that the client see to me so I said to her give me three to five images that you just like it could be the style space it could be just something in particular in the space just so that I can get into their heads on this mood board for Lily bedroom she's a bit image right here the one that kind of has these like sort of persimmon colored walls the yellow bed the pink accents clean lines as you can see also please note the dark gray and the white here within this photo with really grounds these colors so this was like my main inspiration image for Lily's room however she said fun fact I hate orange so I kind of built around this and I pulled out these colors appear this yellow the pink and the purple I actually sent really a ton of images of text on the wall and one of the images was this in it and she would like actually there's something really cool about that but in thinking of what we're going to write you like what about the song anyway if you guys saw the video we ended up doing that Bob Marley quote I really kind of put stuff on a mood board to disease there's any red flags so I put like this sort of mid-century light this that obviously is like tufted and a little more pillowy I put this very like unique looking vanity with the flip up thing and she didn't come back with any red lights like that the only thing she just wanted to emphasize that she doesn't like orange I was like you've got you've got it girls moving on we were at the office the big challenge with her office is that it's really petite and she wants to be able to fit four people in that room so as you can see there's a different vibe going on here so colorful but we're kind of clean with more of a rainbow palette I love this really bold Texans kind of needed blue a little whiteboard wall you will also notice her superwoman logo in black and white and that was a real specific thing because we want to make her custom lit up we'll go to go on the wall then I really like the black and white one because I really wanted to do a rainbow painting on the wall and I just love the idea of the impactful black and white standing off all those colors okay so let's move on to be shopping board for the bedroom now so this is the bed and actually Joey found this one he like helped me on freaking out I'm like they need to yell a little bit I also have this image of this gray linen high-quality Silver Logie Dino I like using when the bedding I did a big patch of this pink on the mood board which is the color that I'm going to try to go for on her walls it's so bold and so decided and then of course as you can see we at the yellow one and the headboard so we need to do the rule of three repeat the color three times to kind of justify especially in a color blocked room when you are just introducing like a random other color and I need to do these other things or modern feeling like these nice modern clean lamps this vanity amazing got the pop-up it's got the clean lines Greymon and curtains because we're going to have pink on the wall I was like really need to let that pink have its moment you can really see the balance of like bright colors grounding colors of the white in the gray alright let's move on to the shopping board for the office they put our logo here with the white which in our case that will be painted and then it will be the black and white logo sign and I'm going to get three of these low back white desk chairs and one high back white desk chair with the higher back one will be for her so I'm really happy with all these things bubble regular shop in stores let me just show you some of the online stores here that I chose to peruse and with Lily like in clean lines I was like okay cb2 is perfect because they're like sleek and nice and good quality I also shopped wet and overstock is a great go-to for me I love to get like comforters it's like eBay insert pillows when I can't find something I'll either use Google shopping or I will use how to like pull stuff from a whole bunch of different sites so you can save images inspiration images and then you can also shop products but you have to make sure you're actually searching in the product section and all the inspiration section because you'll be like I'm going to buy that and it'll be like someone's room and then I also have Amazon here because there's like so anything from like oh my gosh I need a TV now okay guys so that's the deal with the mood boards on the cabin boards and online shopping now we could go to stores we actually have to get these packages to arrive and unpack them and make sure that they're not broken and then everything came in the right color here at living spaces feel good about it I'm going to see what bedside table thing on here just to make sure there isn't anything better than the ones I got already you need a floor mirror and I need a desk floor me Randolph they actually have really cool accessories here under those we need these for her office oh I see form your oh my Catterick sweet you fancied the spices awesome look at this gigantic one it's really cool but I think it's a little too glittery for her but then look at this one you guys I feel like this one might be it all right Cheers desk and woo look at this one that's so cool that is a box lady's desk I ever saw and how gorgeous about you guys okay I do like this night in a lot because it's a really good sign it's really good praise to the nightstands I ordered smaller than this one okay I'm going to seem too happy I mean I can cancel as I ordered okay I'm in pillow land there's a man hiding over there woman no he's hiding but no I'm hiding from all right here is my collection on the car I got these two leaf these things for the office and getting this to the office me me for her death I'm going to go with that rad glass death with the gold legs and then I'm getting me two options for her bad okay I am going to cancel those nightstands that I just ordered on Amazon I'm getting those bigger white ones I have white lamps to go on top and it can be really clean those clean lines fresh fresh fresh I am he in your hat done Edward so I'm here to pick out like a million colors of pink let's go so I grab some like one of pink I don't know man this is hard it is hard color to pick and then I have all of these here you just want them all to sort of be in the same family and then obviously have it mimic this enough that like she's going to see and go like oh yeah that's my superwoman colors so this is very forming go over the paint of Dahlia and I pull these braids this cuz that's like the color of the bedspread and then obviously there's gonna be white going on in there twos which is kind of nice see how they'll all play together okay guys I'm waiting for my paint to get mixed I ended up getting samples of the three wall colors that they like the such an important decision I want to test it so let me show you what I got for those three tests and also for the rainbow wall I went with the lighter ones so thinking about how intense pain usually ends up looking when it's up on the wall and so I went for like as a lighter family and it's going to be the wall color it's just really pretty muted blue and then over here these are the three colors I got for the bedroom so I think this colors so beautiful but I just want to see what it looks like on the wall and then I got this color that's like a super light gray for the lyric wall to go on whatever we want my 16gb DVD we are here we are prepping your parking there's lots of seating and lots of things to unload and I'm going to test those paint samples that is number one on my agenda alright let's go do this might be a sample to see gosh I walk along this is all we have so he oh you do alright we have the pink Dalia there it is we picked it up we're heading back to office now I'm going to go through all of the online items okay see and I all right guys here it is got my box cutter which today is you can I drew the box cutter somewhere but as you can see in this room is enough so as soon as we're done pulling everyone else's life together it will hopefully pull our lives together I found these two different rolls of tape so I'll do like office/bedroom so any boxes for the office I'll put blue tape on any honest if you're gonna fit okay that means to also this stepladder is for the office because we're doing this the way for wall and the whiteboard calendar honors you always get up easily [Music] okay Joey and I are in the car we've a crazy game we have a little bit of time it's not by the hardware store and we are doing that because we want to see if

K I trust her with my life she will do amazing and I'm really excited for this transformation I was pretty pretty clear that I was going to land at 9 in the morning in LA and I was going to open the door for Kate for her and her team to come in to do my room I missed my flight do you have a dog I didn't bring my dog your dogs in Canada okay I'll have to wait to see the reveal what do you think of the color so I have a deep connection with the underappreciated color yellow I'm also obsessed with like Disney like fairytale like I'm literally like a 13 year old girl at heart blue she's good so I have a child I'm a teen mom of a dog and she first walk in Canada her first walk Oh technically I wasn't really allowed to walk her cuz she could get like all these diseases like rabies and legs right yeah and other dogs oh yeah I'm more cycling that's a lot of people arias Joey enough talk and start roll it is time to let Joey to roles take it over because we have a very important project to work on in the beautiful dining room decorated the dining room bye-bye alright so yeah this is the time where I finish everything [Music] okay so your bed is where you sit and shoot some of your videos right like intros whatever majority and you also have those rolls of paper to just great I want to do some kind of like art installation behind your bed I mean obviously yellow duh and I love the idea of like doing a whole flower wall she really is larger than life so making these beautiful gigantic paper flowers are gonna look so cool you know you're just like a big personality so we're not gonna do any dinky flowers we're gonna make some like big keeper sculptural flowers and have it be a whole thing oh you like yes okay so we're just tracing the template and then cutting them out and then once you cut them out you want to cut a slit up the middle of each petal about one to three inches depending on the size of your petal and then you just kind of tuck them together and glue that into place once you have your petals nicely pleated then you can attach them all together and then on the inside we're just creating these little fringy pieces of paper and those are gonna be the stamen of the inside who you look like so Teletubbies Sun Hotel oh yeah the Teletubbies bun or like the oh yeah oh wow it's very a showgirl dun dun Anna and then you can be like a cute little here's real ears you improvisation creativity a love keep cutting alright Adeline you're doing amazing you're our wonderful student so please continue making these flowers because I have to go help Joey with a pegboard I'm very excited about this big feature project we're doing this room adilyn super into like the workshop sort of techie wall of stuff vibe so we're gonna do a play on that we are going to do an entire pegboard wall all of the gear and everything is exposed so rather than having it behind cabinets it's on shelves it's on hooks it's really celebrated so she loves the look of that before peg words these go in so like the pegboard can't be put directly on the wall so that's the reason for us and we're gonna basically go so you hold this over here left left left left left work yep so the trick with the pegboard wall is you need room for the pegs to go through the board so you can't mount it flush on the law you actually have to sort of float it a little bit so what we do is we got some furring strips which are just some thin pieces of wood that we were going to then use to attach the pegboard to the studs I'm so excited to start styling this pegboard wall and the first thing I'm bringing in is a box of goodies from Google store so I am unboxing Google Wi-Fi that's gonna fit on the shelf so seamlessly in conjunction with that we're also hooking up with the Google home which is the perfect device to just ask questions get stuff done schedule tasks and you can get different color faces for it I got a beautiful white color of course to kind of seamlessly go with the pegboard wall welcome to Google home to get started download the Google home app on a phone or tablet you can do literally anything with this thing it uses Google assistance so you basically are just like okay Google tell me something I need to know and to round that tech component out or giving her the pixel which is the Google for CAFO which is super slick takes amazing footage okay so another thing we're doing in here is we are replacing her curtains with lines boom huh Joey's not hanging her ins code not hanging curtains no he's hanging blinds all right guys it's time to roll out the rug adilyn already wasn't like a magical enough person she now has a literal magic carpet underneath her made of Razov gold alright alright alright let's move on we got a lot of things with you we got to build the bed oh my gosh complicated for me this is going to be a project I think what we just need to do is do the lay things out these are all pop pieces I got an H hey we're seeing c1 we'll need these yet I don't know which ones C and C 1 this is C and C 1 C ok I'm getting the phone thing on here I like this job this is a disaster yeah now we need to install the headboard so we have these that can build up and then do these fit the full whip this is a queen-size these are gonna go fill up the vents like cables - yeah that's kind of you basically mount these tracks to the wall and then you can use any amount of the cushion panels to create the height and width of a headboard that you want so I chose this for Adalind because I wanted to really mix in that kind of modern meets like whimsical look in her space because I knew that the pegboard was gonna look very structured all right so you're gonna finish the pegboard we're building this awesome modular headboard system it's really simply attached these railings to the wall making sure you're starting your first one exactly where you know the center of your bed is I'm just going to screw out on the wall pop on the various upholstered pieces and magical giant headboard so a pegboard is actually a beautiful way to organize your stuff like who knew we're using this one that comes white already and it's looking just really fantastic very Pinterest throw the up I do say so myself I'm also creating some custom artwork for adilyn because I want to showcase art as well on the pegboard so it isn't just all gear and so I'm looking up a very cute photo of blue and sketching it with pencil first and then I'm gonna go over it with these watercolor pencils which are really cool you just kind of like scribble and then you can use a paintbrush with water to just activate the watercolor side of it and I'm also doing a cactus which is just a fun little moment and then I'm doing a set of lips she's a beauty guru after all with a little drippy a la Kylie I guess but original to Adeline because of course Adeline would have yellow drool drool and then I'm also writing yellow hashtag aesthetic because she uses that word aesthetic all the time which I love and so now it's stuff on her wall alright so now that we've got the headboard on the bed place I can know exactly where I'm going to place the flowers on the wall just like slap her down and probably like right yeah like right there and blend that land so this is really easy to do what we're just using some wall mounting tapes and just pressing them up on the wall making sure to wait a few seconds so that they're nice and secure I'm doing a sort of haphazard array of the flowers I do want it to look like it was a bouquet I wanted it to look almost scattered in the wind oh my gosh Blue Dog City it's so cute and of course we have to have flowers above blues bed as well but in her accent color sup Adeline love's taking the little instant photos so I'm gonna create a nice that what could be more perfect for someone who loves yellow then lamps that look like a bucket of yellow paint being poured out [Music] the duvet cover and European shams are these beautiful like ruched white flowers it just looks so magical and very like in kind of bohemian civ like we're taking some design liberties and I am okay with it extremely okay with I love it at the end of the bed I'm using this beautiful woven row blanket it's got some fringe there's this awesome drum table I found that of course I couldn't resist because it was all bright yellow she has these amazing platform shoes which are rainbow and I saw them in her closet and I was like these have to be on display [Music] also hello the little theme and I think is probably mad for lik screwdrivers is the perfect size for makeup brushes [Music] oh my gosh you guys dog toys [Music] [Music] [Music] okay you guys I think this room is very complete we have crammed a lot of personality into this room so now I just have to get the biggest personality of them all Madelyn Maureen get a tax cut aline can you come over the pieman at the clock and I'm like course I can come to the apartment at 3 o'clock I'm heading over I'm like speeding it's like a 35 miles per hour I'm going like 36 and then I see Kate I see Joey and then they're like on the count of three open your eyes okay count to three okay [Music] they got a crane took out my room and then put in a new one I'm sweating it's just so much to take in I get it girl you can view from the floor but it might be and how about the tech wall man I was like why not you like a beauty guru [Music] by the way oh yeah but I think it fit more like you know structured like how this I don't think I've ever seen a bedroom with a pegboard wall but only certain people can pull it off I feel like you're one of those people all right you're like yellow you're like yellow buckets hanging from the wall everything yellow really visible didn't come with yellows yellows like random so now you have a living room designed by mr. King mr. King a blue section designed by mr.

today's video and I love it because you can go on and get whatever image illustration anything you want to print your own custom wrapping paper and I'm going to clue you guys in on some awesome ways how to print those different things today and you know I like to make your life easier and with graphic duct you get unlimited downloads of images rather than having to pay for image you can click on the link in the description box below it is graphic Starcom backslash holidays and you will get $50 off a year membership so anyways all images that I'm going to use today on today's wrapping gift wrap three ways our images that I downloaded but there are so many options you can do and I think that you guys are going to be really inspired by just like the techniques that we're going to do so when that's when I love it hmm let's get into it I have marks a neogeo my assistant she's my cat she loves to chew on wrapping paper so hopefully she won't do that all right so I'm so excited to show you these three weeks because I know you guys want to be creative in your own way so two of them you can print on your home computer we're gonna do a cyst occur and then we're gonna do like a pattern template which you guys can download on our blog and then the third way you would get printed at like a copy center and it's really inexpensive so first of all I need to search some images here so I'm gonna put in for the first one like tree snow keywords you know just like something festive oh my gosh this little sprig small fir tree covered with snow okay so this one is perfect so I would just download this comes a very high res Christmas though oh my gosh this is perfect because I want kind of like a vintage Belle and I love that it's like an illustration this is so cute how cool would it be to do a coloring book grab an apron Christmas pattern ooh oh my gosh you guys this is so perfect so what I would do with this is I would repeat the pattern in like some kind of layout program like a Photoshop or you can also take it in to the copy center and they can do it there it's like less than a dollar a square foot when you print it out so this first one is this template for a little gift box you can like form them yourselves and you can put like candies or handmade so so this template will happen you guys to download will have the link you guys can open it up in any kind of program and just put your own photos in just repeat it just lay it out super simple and we have this amazing coloring book pattern repeated so it can print out large scale and you can have it be as big as you want so I have all the images I'm obsessed and now I'm gonna go print them and start wrapping I have got the beautiful Prince now already oh my gosh you guys like obsessed like just look at how beautifully these play together let's get in to this beautiful little box here but as you can see I have the other ones at the ready so Roxane assistant justplease thank you all right she's such a great assistant alright so the first step is we are going to cut out one of these boxes so the red lines are where you cut and then the black lines are where you fold so just make sure you're not cutting along the black lines okay guys so here it is all nice and cut out it is time to fold and glue I mean these boxes are so cute and you can open and close them like you could totally reuse these so these diagonal lines too you also want to fold along because those are where the bottom of the box is you can imagine like a little box usually has creases on the bottom you pretend like you're doing origami and this stiff paper is called cardstock so you can get a whole package of this so I think I have all of my folds done so now I am going to grab my hot glue gun you just glue where it says glue and that last glue is good look you guys it just kind of folds in like this and the tab then goes into that little slice okay so this is number one I'm obsessed all right let's move on to this beautiful coloring book ready wrapping paper and I am going to wrap up a copy of a hot glue gun mask mr. cake book and some beauty marks and what I love about this is obviously the book is all about DIY projects and the wrapping paper is like a DIY and then you could even do like a bundle of markers as like the decor and then I also have these pom-poms on hand and then embroidery thread and then you just pierce through you make your own adorable garland so let's wrap her up okay guys so I have everything set up here now for the third way and that is using our beautiful vintage Bell stickers to mr. cake jewelry pieces here the ray necklace and the rock cuff I'm going to wrap these up in this paper I think I'm going to choose a gold for the big box and then the silver for the small box like how cute is a little stack with in accessories on top oh my gosh I love it [Music] oh my gosh you guys it was so fun it was so quick so easy I really hope you guys got inspired by these

bye mr. gates 
hello everybody welcome with mr. cake decorate today we are decorating on a budget you guys it is bedroom on a budget normally I have thousands of dollars to spend in a room getting new furniture etc but this is going to be about doing some quick fixes with only hook $300 you guys that is such a budget to work on to pull together an entire pattern but we're gonna do it speaking of money I think this video is sponsored by Google assistant actually I'm gonna use it right now because not only are we on the budget we're on a time crunch so set an alarm for 5:30 p.m. done your alarm set for 5:30 p.m. Thank You Pat as when we have to finish the room you guys but we have to also shop for the room who we using $300 I'm ready for the challenge let's go through there is that what you don't even need the introduction you are no listen [Music] I'm escaped so the last time we did this bedroom on a budget video I invented a character who lived in the room because we did it on the sack but this time we wanted to pick a real person somebody that actually inhabits the space so that the work we do can actually benefit company so this is Alex's bedroom she recently broke up with her boyfriend so she's starting Healy over from scratch she no furniture so she's been getting hand-me-downs and finding things etc so Alex we're gonna help you we're gonna do it on a budget gonna be challenging and hopefully you guys are gonna get a lot of tips along the way you guys know we don't have a huge budget so we really have to work with what we have in this room now the things that I'm seeing in this room that makes sense still use are the bed the boxspring which she has we're gonna try to raise it off the floor we also have this dresser here which just looks like it's in good shape enough that it doesn't make sense to throw it away and blow our budget on a new dresser so we're gonna keep this dresser but obviously these knobs are dripping glue not so cute this chest here looks like it could totally work as a bedside table so definitely going to reuse this but of course upcycle it by probably giving it a fresh coat of paint this lamp however and the bedding just looks a little too old we're gonna get rid of these and bring her in some new pretty things or maybe some thrift did pretty things okay so I know what I need to shop for I know what I need to do why I'm gonna get Joey and we're gonna go shopping we're gonna see what we can find drifting whatever wherever on a budget in LA Joey let's go guys I have Joey here with me hi guys he and I are going to go now shop this room which is gonna be a challenge a little challenge which I guess the challenge is also now filming me these excellent shots brought to you by me I think we should go to a third store first three stores or just a place where you can find a lot of different items for like as a cheapest cheapest cheapest right unless there's a garage sale or flea market that's pretty much their stores are maidan you guys know that but I have to throw my socks so let me make a list to keep me in line okay Google Ads my shopping list what do you want to have bed frame and comforter and sheets and accessories quart of paint and artwork okay I've added bed frame comforter sheets accessories the quart of paint and artwork to your shopping list thank you okay now why don't you make me lunch oh I'm sorry I have to make you lunch and decorate a room on a ridiculously low budget next video okay we'll make me lunch on a budget yeah okay so I'm here's the first nurse or so and so I've been doing you guys what kind of style I'm going for in the spoon eyelets like that kind of like Parisian glam Silver's plus my way maybe a little bit of gold which is for eats because when you're shopping on a budget less is more so as I'm coming through this space actually those two styles in mind it's really important because obviously there's so much got to keep a clear head you Roxy this is let's agree about their source equal which stuff and you never know what you're going to get the fact that they have new bugs it's pretty tightly take what's that in the corner it's a bed frame oh my god wasn't word yeah 20 bucks to be sure this is so weird she was into Parisian stuff what though I feel like it's probably a wine holder I don't know but we should get it so here's about just even take your eyes people have a certain that spend on accessories look for larger scale accessories that will feed up more space in the room this is $8.99 but it's gonna like take up a lot of space on probably for dress that place down on our dresser and you can reimagine things like this as a wine bottle holder but why couldn't you like sunglasses holder a scarf holder shall like Zeus cards or something new one you found it go victory lap victory lap or just silver and then this piece really all right so we got bed frame rug brandon paris eiffel tower sculpture a lamp another a beautiful story tarnished trades made it looks like believe antique almost like when you get into the Paris flea market making out cute this little brass pins nine 199 a bathroom tin trashcan it says a bed which i think is bad in France it does not oh my gosh do that budgets out their budget shopping budget on a budget hey Liam you she's full sheep that into a beautiful champagne [Music] they're good awesome five dollars for throw blankets the great impede resting odds are just really love a nice day because to curtain panels and wonderful champagne color wall space to cover nothing on there and we gotta get crafty we've gotta stick budget-friendly cheap if I were to go to the earth store to get a new canvas this size it would be like 25 bucks this is six dollars so we could get this and create like some new cool artwork over this using the sisters for canvas and then also down the scream and we use this pretty frame for something new and cool let's check out okay I'm so happy with how I left England now it's time to regroup so let's check our list let's see what stuff we've gotten and then stuff that we need to still get in order to complete the design show me my shopping list here you go let me check off some of these things didn't get an austere dresser quarter P no accessories yes I need a comforter no I'm through the dresser and a quarter piece so I think we should hit up the hardware store what go yeah Oh Pete Louisville what rename your name is cleaning piece of wood which Joey is going to use make the let's shop also got some really cheap shop rocket and we're also going to use this wood to make some really cool for the draft report Pete and straightening in case I want to do something with artwork or spray paint or maybe straightening I don't know these just good to have on hand it's $5.00 it's gonna stop really quickly to try to get a comforter on clearance maybe a throw pillow but I'll see you back at Alex's okay guys we are back in the room obviously we've cleared out the stuff Joey's working on the construction projects I am going to start painting now a budget saving tip for you guys instead of buying enough paint like two gallons worth to cover all four walls or room why not just buy a quart of paint this is actually a really cool tip for you guys because it's also really cool look you'll see it in some of the other spaces that we've done before and that is painting a portion of the wall I like not dividing completely in pass cuz it's a little bit better of a ratio for the eye I think it's better to kind of work with a more off ratio so this is almost like a third also because we're only using a bed frame to prop up the bed and on this wall it's not going to be super high so I don't want too much paint sticking up beyond the bed but it's gonna kind of give it a headboard look without of course spending money okay guys so close the door and hello this door is just not looking too exciting we have some leftover block paint so why not make a little black insert and cover up the pendants reverse cover up No hey is it gonna work to fix it yeah I mean basically she tried to glue in her knobs or someone did I don't know where the stressors from this piece really just needs like the glue sanded off on the drawers the only problem is if we sand off the glue we may need to paint the drawers well I have the black paint from her kit which like probably won't match exactly this black paint if we have to patch the doors we could paint each drawer so that at least the drawers all match and like they're kind of like two-tone with the dresser yep I can do painting stuff yes you can help me to paint this up and then you'll do the Shelf sure should I just do all of the dis stuff so it's explaining to the knob project okay I'm thinking to kind of modernize this piece a little bit bring in the sort of like angular thing or doing with the wall pane cut shapes out of the wood but like bigger like you know kind of like that geometric shapes like all it could be but irregular can you draw the shapes and I'll cut them then a piece behind it which makes sense we need a little chunk behind it so that it's sticks off just draw the shapes okay I'll make the magic happen okay I will do in here it's kind of cool yeah yeah beautiful basically sand paint sand ain't cut paint and the excess of this is gonna be a shelf next to her bed yeah go do our thing you do you go away where does she live again that's what okay guys I have my art station set up you guys know I love doing DIY art why because you get to be creative you get to put your creative stamp in the room and also hello budget-friendly to do DIY art instead of buying expensive art we have in front of us the canvas which you guys saw me buy at the thrift store it was six dollars and if I got it at the art store it would be probably like $25 for the size so I am going to use this to paint over it's a print it's not some hand-painted beautiful piece of art it also has scratches etc on it so there's no point in keeping it I also have the frame here from the thrift store which I am going to use as a frame I'm not gonna keep the art that is inside of it it's very dated it is not our color palette instead I'm going to use one of these prints I scheduled my sketchbooks a lot and what I love to do is scan those sketches in and then get them printed super cheaply very budget-friendly at like a coffee shop so basically you can get something printed really huge on the engineer printers you know the ones that like the architects use pull it's so great is it's between like two to five dollars depending on the size that you choose so the goal is to elevate these by putting them in frames or for this sketch of the flowers here I'm going to use some of these clips which I love using it's a really like kind of cool minimalist look also very budget-friendly and you can just hang these on the wall around screws because they've got the little holes at the top alright but I think I'm gonna start with hanging this canvas cuz you know it's got dry time and we're under crunch time yeah by crunch time guys look [Music] okay so I'm laying this down and I have a piece of plastic here which I'm going to use to cover the area that I don't want spray-painted so I basically just want to leave like a diagonal corner that I'm gonna spray-paint gold or just like another element a little bit of flair so I'm just gonna tape it down spray paint on the wall [Music] I love how that spray paint is like sheer it's like a sheer coverage right by any last two staples down and oh my gosh guys look at how cute thrift store frame which was like what 399 and the print was like three dollars from the print shop and tada art I love it and I love this vintage frames milk so that guys think we can was art so I've got the thrift store sheets remember they were brand new at the thrift store like how did we get to lucky they look great they're this beautiful champagne color similar to the curtains which is awesome now I have this comforter which I picked up I also picked up really quickly from a big-box store the bedskirt and then probably actually gonna use the pillowcases that came with this comforter instead of the ones that came with the sheet set the shelves in it looks great I love this paint job so yeah make your bed [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay guys how amazing did this dresser turn out like this is like a completely new piece college Joey on speaker phone calling Joey mobile on speakerphone [Music] typical Joey I am calling you to give you a compliment on how gorgeous the dresser looks the knobs are fabulous Joey where the heck are you are you getting lunch of you arcing Amazon love you thank you miss you where are you [Music] [Music] I think we're done I think we're done guys so pretty in here I'm so blown away by what we were able to do with our budget do you guys like it [Music] [Applause] [Music] guys it looks so good in here the feeling here is so peaceful I love that we have the black and white contrast I mean how much of an impact did this painted wall make I mean it really just establishes a tone of design in here I love how this print in our flea market frame turned out so inexpensive and then we've got this awesome throw pillow Oh which by the way I got when I got the comforter this wasn't in the clearance section why I don't know because it's so fabulous and I am totally obsessed with how the dresser turned out those geometric knobs are just so cool and really simple to DIY I use everything in this room that we picked out in the first store together hurt lose the rug that chair and I'm just so thrilled with how it looks a little bit of a splash of graphic art over on this side to just counterbalance the graphic that's going on back here so I hope you're inspired because this is really an example of what a little bit of paint and the right accessories can do to really elevate a room on a budget legit thumbs up for

Cate it was our challenge to ourselves to only use the items that we have in office in our craft supplies and all that stuff and not go out and buy new stuff because we have so much stuff so we need to use it so how cute let's get into the DIY and before we do please be my dream or make my dream come true and subscribe to the channel if you haven't yet it's really easy just press that button and you will be entered to win our $10,000 room transformation giveaway when we reach 1 million subscribers so please do that and thumbs up the video if you like these cuties and enough of my blabbing dreams take us away for these DIY mini dreamcatcher ornaments slash decor you will need pliers flexible wire ribbon feathers you can find cruelty free feathers on places like Etsy a glue gun scissors and/or wire cutters some wax twine or artificial sinew shape your wire into your desired size for the body of your dream catcher and then cut it with a little bit of slack so that you can wrap it around later this floral wire is so nice and soft we used a pair of old scissors to cut it but you could totally use wire cutters we're cutting a second piece of wire because we're going to show you two different styles of these mini dreamcatchers and now you're going to form your circle and use the pliers to tuck in the sharp ends and repeat this step to make as many circle forms as you want take your artificial sinew or wax cord and wrap it all around the wire to conceal it so it looks like a leather covered hoop and then tie it off leaving a little loop at the top for hanging it later you can take another color of artificial sinew or wax cord and cover your additional loops so that they look a little bit different because you know they're like snowflakes or like human beings we're all different and that's great now it's time to embellish your hoops with some feathers and/or ribbon this first style looks kind of like a little bird's nest or a very minimalist dreamcatcher with a little beautiful cluster of soft feathers at the bottom of the loop but of course this is just one way of millions that you can choose to get created and personalize your mini dream catchers for this next style we're making it look a little bit more like a traditional dreamcatcher by creating a star-like pattern in the center of the hoop using a pretty ribbon and you just do this by tying off one end of the ribbon and then stretching it across to form whatever design you like just make sure you wrap the ribbon around the hoop each time you cross over so that it's nice and secure and doesn't slide now just tie off your ribbon to end it and trim off any excess now you can place your feathers dangling from the bottom we are using these larger white feathers and some more of the artificial sinew to wrap around the base tie it off and then secure them to the hoop this is a really easy step the more you wrap the more it just looks very organic and it will also weigh down the feather a bit so it hangs nice and straight I really love these mini dream catchers they're beautiful and bohemian and organic and they're also sustainable to use beyond the holidays even use them as ornaments on your tree or toppers on your gifts and then when the holiday is done you can take them and put them on your wall or hang them in your cubical I mean I could list so many options for you guys but you get the idea I mean basically we just always want good dreams right you guys I'm so into these like so cute and what I love of course is the personalization that you can do the potential for different color palettes you could use metallic feathers you could use metallic ribbon colorful ribbon I mean there's so many options so I would love to see your version of these of course because I just love basking in your creativity so if you do these please post using hashtag mr.

Kate 
hello everybody welcome all my creative weirdos I am so excited about this video we have been meaning to do this for so long because this has been a much requested idea from you guys we are taking a cubicle a plain boring workspace you can kind of see behind me and we are turning it into a cute cubicle aka a cuticle you want to get there so we are going to be turning a cubicle into a cuticle three different ways even if you don't work in a cubicle you can get inspired for your personal workspace your desk at home your desk at work and of course you're going to be incorporating some DIYs that may or may not be with a potato mmm smells weird nope super cute trust me I promise and we're also going to be using of course some beautiful decor items and we are going to be using some amazing organizational elements aka planners because we are going into the new year we have three different styles of planners to go with the three different styles of rooms and those planners are from at a glance which is handy-dandy or small server today's video so thank you at a glance we don't have actual cubicles here we built what was closest to a cubicle look of course I know all cubicles are different but we did what was sort of as close as possible you can interpret for your own cuticles yeah let's get into it okay for this first cubicle let's play with a sleek design and we are going to be keeping with a black white and gray color palette which you can establish with a beautiful piece of fabric draped over an area of the cubicle and rather than a desk lamp we can add a clamp lamp and a fun graphic pillow with cats for some seat cushioning a cube organizer with small drawers helps keep stacks of papers organized as well as some more paper sorting file holders up top a little succulent a wood cup for maybe some extra pens a simple globe for decor and daydreaming about travel and a clipboard with a cool handwritten mr. Kate quote available in our shop let's add a cute pattern to this round cork mat that can be used as a mouse pad or a coaster you just simply cut out your pattern with a sharp knife into the potato no blood allowed and use it as a stamp with some black paint for the desktop styling some essentials like a coffee mug on our DIY coaster a stapler some headphones etc a brass frame photo and flowers in a clear glass jug vase add a personal touch for the other side let's add some life with a snake plant wood figurine tape dispenser candle and of course our planner the planter I chose to style in this space is a minimalist weekly and monthly option that has a really soft leather like cover and inside there's one week per two-page spread for all the days of the week and an area for notes hello grocery list and I also love when there is a back pocket in my planners to store some of my random sketches or papers oh and by the way you can click on the link below to find an awesome at-a-glance planner that fits your style and needs for the new year and the finishing touch of this black and white space will be another fun mr. cake quote this one is showcasing the definition of a creative weirdo which I will layer slightly over the fabric and attach it to the cubicle backing with some simple wood push pin and tada let's take a look at the sleek and graphic space oh I love this cute cubicle design it's so sleek but now it's time to move on to our next style which is cozy and this is for those of you that want to bring a piece of home to work with you using textures and neutral earthy items let's start with a white work lamp pattern boxes for storage and a terra cotta pot with an indoor happy post those plants and some more of our handy file folders and white pottery and some crystal book cans some personal items like a hat and a vintage camera at a cozy look and a full flowerpot makes for no dead petals falling on your head on the back of your cubicle you can use it to create a collage of travel mementos or cute reminder notes written on gift tags instead of post-it now for more plants which you can only use if you have some natural light in your space otherwise use faux plans a bark cover candle frame and some more desk organizers oh and hey why not use a piece of scrap tile as a coaster and a trackpad stand for more texture and home eNOS oh hey maybe sometimes you're a little messy aren't we all but at least you can make a cute with some gold paper clip behind the lamp we can build up our collage with some more nature inspired photos and they are all put up with some more pushpin now let's add some more neutral texture with crystals and the mini dreamcatcher which we will have a DIY video coming up a lot soon and of course our special planner to fit this style let's take a closer look at this beautiful b-positive watercolor planner that we are using in this space it spans a hold 12 months of course with Julian dates and large ruled sections for planning your peaceful world domination oh and tasks oh and I also love it on the right-hand page there are positive messages to encourage your productivity because everybody needs kudos guys so boho I love it and I love to add a cozy throw blanket to the back of the office chair because you might need it as a lot blanket on those chilly days at the office and no we are not done because of course it is DUI war time with those potatoes everybody this time we are going to take a plain linen pillowcase cardboard some sketched out eyes for inspiration and some black fabric paint oh and yep you guessed it up we also have a marker foam brush and a sharp knife lay your pillowcase flat and decide which side eye you want to use for your pattern and then you cut your potato lengthwise careful of your fingers and wipe off any moisture aka potato juice and then you will sketch on your simple eye shape using the marker now let's time to carve out around the eye shape to make the stamp so that the eye is sticking up away from the rest of the potato meet you now stick a piece of cardboard inside the pillowcase to protect from the paint leading through to the other side and use your foam brush to create a smooth layer of paint to dunk your potato stamp in and then start stamping this is an organic handmade look of course like any stamp so if there are any drips or imperfections that is okay it's part of the charm it's cozy I mean are you seeing what I'm seeing how cool is this I'm totally obsessed this is the perfect finishing touch for this cozy and inviting space yay okay let's move on to our last cubicle style and this is a fun chic colorful on trend because we are using a very on-trend marble lamp and that same gray paper organizer from before oh and I love these paper fans that you can open up into full circles because they're super colorful and they're lightweight so they're really easy to tack up and they add so much Flair let's add a beautiful gold organizer some faux peonies in a clear vase and a pink teacup and saucer adds just such a girly cuteness oh my gosh look at all that fun stuff coming in it is a pink party but those pink headphones yes pink stapler let's add some more faux flowers and a base so cute and a feather pen which is just more fun to write with come on let's be honest and a gold chicken tape dispenser because why not and of course our beautiful planner for this piece I love that this planner has a gold reminder of Paris on the front of it Oh oui oui this one features one week four two-page spread as well as one month page spreads so that you can plan and there's an area for list and reminder so you can get as detailed as you want and there is also past and future month's reference calendars for you to plan your next year's trip obviously I really want to travel but let's get back to the cubicle I love the tip for bringing in more color you can use a pink throw pillow on the chair and use a piece of poster board covered with whatever fabric you want you can just use a hot glue gun to adhere it but it's top shelf let's add some really cute storage canisters and foxes and pom-poms in a clear jar and a thrift store oil painting oh and a watercolor print it's just color-blocked cuteness and this brings us to another DIY moment with our potatoes and this one is super easy we're just making a little dot shape to create some black and white polka dot art which you can put in a cute pink frame and it just adds some pattern to a space you could totally do this also large-scale with different shapes for an even bolder statement oh my god you guys I'm done seriously I love all those I don't really have a favorite personally I love elements of each one and I love that of course we infused

[Music] hello everybody.welcome another shopping vlog okay so this one is actually kind of different feeling just because the room that we're doing is totally different it's actually for Megan rinks you guys know her from her own channel and also Phoebe breaks she's all over that so we are helping her with her fed room and so this shopping vlog is all about prepping her bedroom and the reason why it's different is because her bedroom is starting out in pretty good condition and you guys know how that's different because the other rooms we've been doing I've been completely empty but with Megan she has like a beautiful bed already she has a dresser we can use etc it's kind of more about like those quick fix things so I'm gonna go shopping her Meghan and Owen other thing guys she also loved white like she just wants her room to be just like all white very very interesting challenge and also speaking of challenge subscribe super easy click and you will enter to win our $10,000 room transformation giveaway when we get to 1 million subscribers and also follow me on snapchat and Instagram while you're at it if you guys like the behind-the-scenes stuff snapchat is a great place for all of that so let's get into the mood boards first and then it's also a Sunday and I'm about to go hit up the flea market so let's check out the mood board so you guys know the plan and then come along to the flea market ok let's do it alright everybody let's start with the mood board so you guys know this is what I send to the clients to approve before I go shopping for them because I usually surprise them with most of the items so this is Meghan serene and beautiful bedroom and these are two of the main info images just for the sort of overall vibe of her space the overall design will white and lush fabrics and a mix of upholstered metal and wood furniture silver 5 it's definitely like very light-colored if you guys have seen her Instagram she does an all-white theme which we will definitely play up in her room and here's what I'm so excited about you guys do you see this molding that is happening here this wainscoting that is just so gorgeous architectural II does so much for the room in such a subtle beautiful way so we're just playing with a lot of subtleties choose this weird window in her bedroom that's like a tiny rectangular closet window or something it's my theory that the room got expanded and that window was probably inside an old closet and now it's just oddly in the corner of her room though I want to make that more of an architectural element as well since we're kind of playing with that with both the molding and doing some sort of arch shape around it and I also love the idea of updating her dresser or maybe bedside tables with like some brass elements again just really clean with subtleties metallics and then I also love this chair I mean guys this chairs dreams it's from Anthropologie I love the idea of a for a seat cushion so being able to do that DIY style I think would be pretty easy I know Beata chandalier which we have to put over the bed alright guys so here is the shopping board which I still have open in Photoshop because I have been adding to it as I go this is a picture of Megan's existing bed that is amazing here it is so cool high back tufted headboard and I might have did the dresser with some new knobs and then here are the other things that I've ordered I love these two side chairs because she definitely like mixing like traditional items like tufted furniture with then things that have kind of more modern lines but look at these cushions like that looks like a marshmallow that I want to sit on like so those I got it Joss and main those are on the way and then I also got these side tables which I think are so cool they're like you know the state straight lines again she has actually two really cool side tables they just don't have drawers and um so I'm thinking it'll be better her doubts and storage because she has like books and clutter and stuff that kind of builds up and then look at this rug you guys this rug is amazing it's basically like a macrame wall hanging but in a rug although I'm going to get her a new little desk area because she does her makeup in front of her window and she kind of has to move her desk out and then put it back etc for when she shoots video so I thought why not position her vanity and find the window where she wants to use it and get her one of these desks that flips up and becomes a makeup vanity but that way when she's not using it as a makeup vanity she can just fold this down and it won't obstruct the view of the window and then this chandelier is so gorgeous I got this I believe off drawsome name as well and this has wooden beads on it so bohemian and this works amazing hung above her bed okay guys and finally let me show you the floor plan for Megan's room this is just gonna help you guys keep in mind where I'm putting everything right now she's the bed here the dresser actually over here and the desk over here so I'm changing up the position and the layout of her room giving her the giant rug to bedside tables and then those two slipper chairs here the cocktail table here so she has a nice little seating area in her room which makes it feel much more like a master suite and then the dresser is gonna go right here which is right outside the bathroom door and then taking the desk that converts into a vanity and putting it right in front of these sliding glass doors and then a beautiful plant in the corner and that's it now you know all that I know let's go hit up the flea market fern alright here it is guys this is my favorite market Melrose trading post and the day we'll try to get through a deal that look at those angel way I know is our whole that I think that's looming code answers where are those are and then oh and you get goes this way oh oh make you work all right wait why are you looking at clothes are we shopping for her room we are gonna find a month a month whale absorb it I love these old pictures we could just do a collage of like other people's grandma yeah that's cool [Music] if what I love the vintage Russell child I think we've bought a lot of rugs from this guy no different guy my other guys over there I've been here long I've been to this we work at night 15 old trash here what about this one 4:15 [Music] ten oh you up could be easy right what is the story with do they diet outer we circle to she wants all like yeah I thought offer her it was beautiful mid-century fifty dollars for the three is this you how much is this 100 K then trying to buy the displays typical me that's near with a little darlin that's like borderline cheesy to me but she need this there was people watching it up for sale the porthole mirror tray could mounted on the wall doing what our somebody inside here somebody fashion pickup Meghan like someone's great long like just like her dress like me now you offer great table I love me then look look at them looking elk so magical so nice oh oh there you are oh my gosh is Joey [Music] these are maracas sharing pillows look at these on Moroccan all right so it's at the end of the flea market everyone's packing up and I haven't found anything that I like more than that square mirror that we got in the beginning and the wings so we're going to head back wrap them so here's where you're getting your mirror from oh is it gone so we're going to the truck so we grab the angel wings on our way out alright I'll see you back at the car thank you and back for my angel man there's two pair whoo feel like this needs to be on Joey's office door okay angel wings trash can it's gorgeous meeting Joey at the car oh look we came to find me my angels came to get me all of those years Joey okay so I just got my hair done I got my hair or my just my roots done and they blow dry my hair vetti today is my shopping day for Megan at doors right so I head up the flea market got some stuff so I've got to get some lamps I've got to get some other like tabletop items I've got to get some throw pillows etc and so we shall see okay so I think I'm gonna get this beautiful soft woven throw blanket and that'll just add some dimension to the bed and now here we are in lamp land your baggage a king-sized bed so like if I put like small lamps are gonna work too little so we need something more like this sighs oh my gosh I kind of am obsessed with these you guys look this is like a little marble ring in between okay let's pair a shade with these and see how we like it with a shade okay so now I picked this square shade but as I'm looking at this brass lamp I'm remembering that I want to add brass accents on to the bedside tables and my worry is that this color brass is going to clash with the brass we're adding to the tables as a DIY actually really like these think it's like really kind of a modern shape since it's so simple you know that rings are like mid-century but then the shells add a lot of like subtle dimension and of course in different tones of white or color palate is receiving thing magazine mark this is so awesome it's like the wood and the white and the brass is like perfect we could put this next to her vanity yes I do think so I'm gonna go hit up marshals to see if I can find some throw pillows I'm some like tabletop to you dad you know candles are always good for a tabletop styling how cute would that be for the flowers on her dressers like a line above this with like one white flower coming out of each thing this is also really pretty just something about a heavy beautiful clock that just legitimizes a space I think this would be really pretty I don't think with a cool pattern okay guys she does like this little outdoor patio I think we need to get it could go in the room could go out on the little Juliet balcony sauna patio the balcony so I grabbed these which these are called bait dealers that actually could be really cool with those inside or maybe just like a little plant or something here's an example of where you should look in different section so I was just walking by this is like the wine bottle storage I guess she has a lot of like makeup brushes and stuff so look how cute this we feel like makeup brush caddy all right makeup brush caddy here we go joining the other things look at these for these amazing knobs and I want to change out the knobs on her dresser oh so getting nails I'm also getting some faux plants you guys because I've just been embracing them a little more lately since people such a hard time like getting to the store and getting fresh flowers or to being plant alive I thought these are really cute they like look pretty real to me and there a little concrete container i think is super cute so getting those alright though I'm walking across the parking lot now I'm going to hit up TJ Max and see if there's any pillows there alright guys so I'm in the basket section here and I want to get her like some basket options but I feel like it'll be really cool to paint these white ok so I found this platter and obviously this is like meant for you know serving dish ware but I just love this almost like 12 like pattern on it basically exactly like this so I feel like this on the little cocktail table ring in will be so cute just like this with like a candle so Chi I found these like plaid that probably the silver thread now I know I know they're not white but they're like a light grey and I feel like two of these on the bed will be rolling prod I feel like it could work so I'm gonna get these you know I like to test things out I'm testing my own before I couldn't find any other place but I like this story for her bed the metallic I sound like it's not really natural wool textured one I'm also getting this DKNY king-sized comforter shirt he has like nice bedding but I think an added element of another comforter either folded down at the bottom of her bed will just bring that like hotel like look okay how did I find myself in the handbag this is not what I came here for oh my god no chance ooh fringe fringe okay I don't need bad heat go stand in line take your weird creature cart okay guys hello it is the morning of the prep day I'm excited I love prep day because I get to like see the space again because I've only seen it once kind of troubleshoot those last-minute things in my head know if there's any last-minute stuff I've to buy so that's what I'm gonna do today as well as load all the stuff in cuz I still have all that something might happen yesterday okay so this is Marco he uses a gimbal which is how we get those smooth cool floating looking shots and there he goes he's about to fly away ready we're plotting and scheming the molding you guys does this song over here and this is butt crack remember guys that I told you that there's always something that goes wrong well we're just unpacking

[Music] hello my creative weirdo the welcome we are doing another challenge video you guys love these I'm so happy that you do because they're so fun and challenging but today's challenge is not about budget it's about cats taking a cat lady place and actually making it look beautiful and aesthetically pleasing even for those of you who aren't cat people you actually will see the space and go oh I could live there with my dog so we are going to go into crystals living room she's lived in this space for three years she is a stunt lady which is so cool and awesome and she has three cats and she loves them so much she actually has made the room more functional for them because there is no furniture for her there's only furniture for the cats which is pretty hilarious so this is going to be a challenge to make cat lady chic human and cats happy all at the same time can we do it you don't even need the introduction you are no this is [Music] I'm escaped okay guys we are here in crystals living room and of course let's not forget about our three cat clients okay this is equally a cat living room which as you can see they actually have more furniture in this room than crystal does it looks like she only has a coffee table and some side tables no couch no chairs but the cat certainly have levels to climb on and cubbies to sleep in sprockie rope but they're just really not aesthetically pleasing they've got kind of ugly carpet on them they just sort of get beat up and take up a lot of space so the goal in this room at the challenge you guys is to make this into a beautiful living room for both humans and cats so that means giving the cats all of these things that these types of structures provide and put them around the room in a much more aesthetically pleasing way so that is where Joey and his carpentry installation skills is gonna come into play but I gotta go finance so guys let's get going let's start the clock let's go get Joey should I stunt move out of here I'm gonna stunt lady's apartment all right as well hello everyone today's episode of mr.

we all right they have jelly here My partner and everything I have some ideas already brewing that can like be cat happy and human happy cat stuff is typically ugly and like a cat ladies have a bad rap your cat lady your cool cat the goal is to try to like integrate it into the design yeah right so it's like a feature it's almost like an architectural feature so what stores are we doing we're doing car for sure our store because it's gonna be a lot of like custom carpentry haha alright so we know our mission hardware store and then I would love to hit up that Moroccan store see if we can find like some signature piece because I know she loves the bohemian like Moroccan lanterns in particular she like said she loves okay let's go the others are careful I know what I draw so but I've already feel like a cat I want to go climbing in the place but spray bottle you the spray bottle yeah okay what do you got I can walk me through it I think we put the couch in the middle then I did a side view here you know that mirror that we have at the office I think we put that here because it's super like bohemian be filled like a ledge shelf a ram full here full here hole here so then they can I know like loop around to the different RAM this is the wall opposite to the TV some kind of like cabinet maybe like IKEA or something this is the wall right here right I'm thinking me maybe paint this like a darker color and then do some kind of like scratch path with this is her existing coffee table that you had up you know on the wall there and I'm thinking get pieces of wood stain it distress it and then attach it to the top of that coffee table and then you make it look a little bit bigger the dismount well I think we'll get this pieces you just walked all over I'm live in the lumberyard here really buff thank you very much I don't know if it's the lumber or that tight t-shirt but your arms look Jack's Man two pieces of plywood two by sixes long planks and the weird wrap teddy bear what so we'll check out then we'll go to the Moroccan store Moroccan store [Music] magical of this I have stepped into Morocco so her vibes like Moroccan Moroccan influence cuz like Bohemian you know the style which is what she loves has a lot of Moroccan accent especially the lanterns which she told me specifically that she loves and also look at how colorful these things are this place its life that's like giant urns ooh poison emotions these just these filigree pieces stop oh that mirror okay time to window-shop I'm not a mirror shopping hey come on stop messing around [Music] what do you pour you create weirdos what am i obsessed with what am i obsessed with what am i obsessed with what do I try to use it everywhere impossible juxtaposition rugs and crystals brass poof's I've ever seen ever there's Dilip we need a stuffed poof an already stuffed poop because I ain't I don't know time to stuff a booth okay so we're gonna look for like a signature Lantern piece these are all too pretty Joey this one I'm obsessed with like it's kind of like clean lines mark and should we see what's what's the best price they can give us are these so let's check out we need to go to a big box store for like throw pillows and accessories we need to get accounts Joey so actually can you Cruz Craig yeah yeah Lee need a couch we need a truck I found a mid-century modern got stuff on Craigslist for a hundred bucks but it says it's blue and the title and then it's a black in the listing and it kind of looks Brown to me looks like dark gray yeah okay I'm gonna call this offense all of it yeah okay guys we're loading up the car we just set up a home goods and completely filled the car a chair a rug baskets for cubby cat Joey I brought my own chopstick cue the drum montage hold on the Phil Collins ibaka cat lady chic pad bohemian chic colorful cat lady pad goes cat goes okay cat lady goes guys are clients okay there's one human so we'll have one couch three cats will have three cat fun things happening on all sides of the room oh my gosh we're about to hook you up you want to exit exit oh okay bye all right we are doing the upcycle of this coffee table you see a lot of wood in a lot of bohemian rooms and not necessarily like wood like this that's yellow and not happy so we want to bring in some kind of more rustic wood but to save on budget we're gonna upcycle this one we need to cut pieces of this wood so that we can then nail them onto this top and I want to discuss them and scene and then to make this even more part of our color palette we're gonna paint the legs are very fun turquoise color this is upcycle boho chic okay so I marked Center on this table so this really won't work from the center out basically the whole thing that I have this lip shoop shoop you know area bigger so we're gonna do wood glue and nails obviously you could do a pneumatic nail gun or whatever but we're gonna do it the real way the old-school way the Rio an elbow grease way yeah well grease way so line yours up on your own [Music] okay look at the table how cool does it look I love the turquoise I love at the new wood top now the goal is going to be to take this into our more bohemian distressed style of things if you wanted to keep this kind of more clean look you could do a paint or just a clean stain and not distress it but because I want it to look a little bit more lived in like it's on an older piece I'm going to distress it which is actually really fun I'm gonna take some pieces of chain I'm gonna take this drill bit and I'm just gonna kind of create some dents and some sort of beat-up-looking areas I also have some more sandpaper on hand I might like rough up certain areas too so then once I go to stain it with our beautiful walnut stain there are areas of roughness and little dips and divots that the stain will settle in a little bit more and that's going to give it really a much more vintage look all right this is project ledges in lab around a mirror we have the mirror here right and then you have your piece above and below so then we want the cast to be able to climb up to the top ledge right so basically what we're doing is we're cutting holes in these so that they can go through them yeah right so this is their climbing wall they'll have their scratching long and then they'll have a combo climbing scratching wall over by the TV so they need holes to go through the the ledges and ladders so I'm using this paint bucket as the template and then I'm just gonna make a hold of this guy and then use the jigsaw to cut out the hole [Music] I'm so excited about this project I think it is such a cool way to get like a pretty cat scratcher which I know you don't not only think those two things associated but think about this guys cats love to have pieces of carpeting right a lot of those cat scratches are covered with carpet they like to claw on those sharpen their nails so we're gonna give them that functionality in like a cooler almost like wall tile look now it's really cool at a lot of stores of self carpets and rugs they sell samples of them and the great thing about these samples is they're already pre-cut and they're already pre edged so you could do this with an old carpet that you want to cut up but you have to edge it with like a carpet tape or even you know stitch it close but these are already pre finished and they were on clearance for four dollars a piece I would so cool about these as they are the same color but as you can see there are different patterns on each one so we're playing with that kind of like tone on tone mix of patterns which is very bohemian and the other supplies we have our pieces of wood Joey's already pre-cut these to be a little bit bigger than the carpet panels we are going to attach some with a staple gun and obviously these are also pre painted in our beautiful turquoise color so that the surround of these will have like a nice little frame of turquoise and then these pieces will be screwed onto the wall and that is all we are going to make our DIY caps patch panel usually make sure your staple gun is loaded with nice long staples so that they really sink in through the carpeting into the wood so these are nice and secure on the wood because we don't want the cats actually pulling them off of the wood I'm just gonna set up my own little bohemian crafting station look at this guys this is going to be a cat toy project so we have a variety of supplies here some thin jute twine is some peacock feathers we have some other little small feathers beads and pom-poms this is just gonna be a journey of kind of combining these elements together and making something that looks sort of macrame meets cat toy [Music] [Applause] [Music] and then the holes they drop down [Music] ah guys already doesn't look in here oh my gosh I'm obsessed we are running a time let's turn to clock oh my gosh okay so let's just sum up this design right now really quickly she's gotta come in here [Music] I love how we position the floorplan now at the couch here so that you really see it when you walk in it was kind of like the only option looking at the floor plan and we have created a cat sanctuary that I think actually looks really chic in here and we've got that bohemian look going on and then there is something for the cat on every wall in this room there are scratchers over there I just think that turned out so well they look like textured wall tiles but they're actually functional they'll be able to sharpen their nails on that we've got this beautiful sculptural built in over here they can climb all over the little baskets down below for them to sleep in and I just cut up a very inexpensive throw blanket so that we have like matching cushions for each one it was way more budget-friendly than trying to get pillows that were too puffy for each basket and our Arkin Lander looks so good there and she can plug that in and use it as light the coffee table and over there by the wall there we've got the scratchers and more levels and another chair and it just looks so good oh my gosh I could just keep going and going away but I can't we have to leave to reveal it ready ready she's here your Blues and your greens and your bohemian but still clean like totally and like mother like kids their own stunts like this and then 3bet yeah so one of our goals was to sort of deconstruct the classic cat tower right and make it like kind of cool and chic so those are all scratch pads on the wall pretty too these are these are scratched towers up here to begin man this is your old coffee table no way so cool it's all yours all here to say I love what you did with the color Oh hop in it feels so much bigger in here I know and look at your TV you've got storage this is amazing we were doing our own stunts all day long you didn't teach me how to actually fall if you find it a little 3 you're psyched right I am so psyched well hopefully the cat's let you hang out in your room if not you have your bedroom you know you have one quarter of this room right you share it with three other household occupant and I use how cats work you know it's there yes yeah yeah they're gonna like we had to make sure they were represented on all three walls right this is our decorative toy sort of macrame me that's perfect as you know

I'm gonna make it I'm so excited how are your guys Sarah and editing team one have a white board here but a white board is like not the cutest thing so we thought of like bringing the gold from the wallpaper and then I went to this place that made a custom acrylic and we will use it as a white board it's a right larger you know section this is totally yeah yeah but Sarah you're taller than I am yeah but you always wear heels so now someone hold up the level I got it someone come in and draw circles don't move a thing don't move it then oh okay I've ever held a level Ethel oh yeah then catch that good yeah hi guys can't wait to see the couscous room hi-5 yeah it's not the kuku room it's the couscous room I think we should be team working hanging the sign we're gonna have to remove this plastic then like mount it and hold it and make sure that it goes up right Sophia thank you so much for like getting this up a million it evolved organizations if I was gonna know with where who's doing what one its dude just see through heli we're gonna hold this up you're gonna grab those little screwy things and you're gonna put them in there and don't screw up my friend yeah how cool is this acrylic board instead of a white board you can get it cut to whatever size you need drill holes for the standoff mount and make sure to add anchors for secure hanging this was so cool cool exactly what don't we love to rescue me by giving me the car keys and then head out for a fun day with kids and I'm finally arriving at work almost had it call it Ubah Radin okay we could do like calendar here and then this could be for release dates and stuff so it calendar detail would be awesome I guess alright let's set our intention for the day yes to finish it cook to finish the couscous room make it beautiful and functional everyone kiss and break oh I love it hey my data fiends I finish oh you guys I'm calling Sarah Brad and Sofia aka our data storage fiends into the Bob is to give them the new beautiful hard drive from WD thank you because obviously the goal with the couscous is organization so hard drive new hard yards from WG and what's cool about these are than my passport which they they're all different colors I'm getting out what shabby chic fast user there for TV engine Sarah Tara and I thought because they're so small I know you should define them by the color color ah good one guys we also got this my book which is your mine okay awesome cool Celia everyone's going to get one of these on their tasks and we'll know whose it's moved by the color and they're gonna look good which is the whole point of meeting the couscous room look and and function they are really trying it is a back door this is gonna transport me through a different land today dev story of ye wow that is really chic that the cord matches look at this rainbow assortment in here I love like the design of these is really really classy chic who like I love the mix of matte and shiny okay well who's getting what pleasure okay and the blue jelly optimist yo office color all right great yeah here okay well Sophia can have all the hard drives but I'm happy that everyone loves peas and now we're gonna move on to finally finishing the couscous room so here's like the idea is let's chop board right this lovely like lighter shade of chalkboard this beautiful gray you have to season it in order for you be able to erase any Toffler you guys remember that we want to have a full wall where we can brainstorm ideas so with this great awkward paint with the moons and planets that I am about to paint will be the aptly named planet wall get it I want to do a big moon here like what kind of like around the door like I like that it's gonna end like around the door so like you kind of come into like it's like portal right this is the one that I scanned in from the sketchbook you're the best food forever I need to get inspired by my own work I want to make sure that it's clear that it's the planet wall I kind of like this one this sort of like map hazard it's like it's a planet we haven't yet discovered because this board is gonna be all about ideas and things we haven't in a long process on the planet yes there's no limit no to our creativity oh okay we need to shoot shoot all right do you think I should do a galaxy or one of these already love the galaxy I think it's such I think it isn't not if it's a planet wall and then we have a galaxy is it like too many planets but galaxies have tons of planet okay so we'll do a galaxy a flick here going around fence oscillations of creativity all right let me get the ladder oh thank you zero thanks for digging oh you're so strong you're getting stronger if you grow up oh by the way it's your birthday happy birthday to you Sarah yes how are you liking you giant they're awesome I love them both this is Satine 15 and she's great she's doing her job cool the board looks amazing thank you I really I crushed that board I'm really proud of that board actually well what it says on here I'm just a girl standing in front of a salad asking it to be a donut hashtag truth Sophia sweetie yeah are you liking in the drive I like it a lot it it takes all my files and your androgynous do the protector yeah it protects it as long as the drive does it do D I'm saying the to D yeah I like it because I needed a new one because I ran out of space so this is really good I took the yellow I took the black I took the white basically took them all and first sketching the shapes of the moon and planets with chalk and then I will go over them with a white paint that has a really cool chalky finish obviously I could draw this with cha and just leave it in chalk but the point is I want it to look like it was drawn in chalk would be permanently there and like a little bit more like intense hey Kate mm-hmm what do you think of me perfect I think it would be really cool if we could do those on this wall somehow to make this effective I think we need to hang six or seven or three big ones like boom boom boom macrame hanging plants down from the beam in like different lengths braid it down like a Rapunzel plan to look down your tendrils well I finished the planet while Sophia is expertly making the macrame plant hangers out of cotton rope and braiding some nice long length so they can hang at the perfect length from our high ceiling oh and Sloane's neat cutie honey sweetie baby it's helping [Music] [Applause] [Music] well to me finishing touch on the planet wall is to call up the pun and remind people that they can plan and doodle to their heart's desire using the chalk or chalk markers conveniently provided at the table below and to the reveal [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] yes hey you guys oh my

month a month yep okay yeah yeah and I'll get an extra $20 this became for
heroes in the 300 hours because she pulled the gun and ticket folks we only
told the golden ticket when you are seriously in need of help because you
only get one golden ticket a month hundred dollars wisely guys guys guys give ourselves a golden ticket and so on I know so many 300 budgets you can do let me just say
that $300 is a lot for a lot of people okay I
feel really good about our purchases because those are items that this new
couple will have forever so we have a hundred ninety bucks left
yeah curtains for two windows I need accessories I need plans I'm gonna have
to use like fresh flowers we're gonna go scrounge some plants guys the budget
calls were scrounging plan hardware store for like some tile pieces a little
bit of growl to revamp their existing coffee table save it the money we came
to our Mecca BTS because we need frames and we need
accessories and so we pass by vet teshuva BTS one of our favorite places
to shop it's a - bladder it just looks calling for us like that
is like vintage vibe that's so cute they have a bunch of plates up on top of that
stuff over there well ours good eyes Joey good yeah look how vintage cute she these are
great right look how cute oh wait are you sure you don't wanna get
a cowboy hat this everything so this is the final bunch of everything did you see this Leopard
I did see this basket trunk her plans yep
Joey's so many things okay you all give really good are you
design a Nagi red lipstick red lipstick abort abort kit this already looks
decorated let me know I'm here oh my gosh alright so I what about the
TV curtains light we're gonna move that chair bring that into the office or so a
lot of painting to do right okay I gave okay what okay yeah set timer I'm gonna paint this room an
hour Juiz lottery everywhere where your drugs
awesome I feel you're gonna be exhausted at the
bed I'm already exhausted how much smoother
Sarge don't you go it looks great okay so I am going to stain this shelf in
these shelf brackets these are just like really basic wood shelf brackets and
then this is a scrap piece of plywood and I'm gonna seen it a beautiful walnut
color and we're going to mount it above our new old desk Tyl tabletop project we are going to
update this very well-loved coffee table and make it look more chic because it's
bubbling in places and it's just scratched but obviously we don't have it
in the budget to get a brand new coffee table we picked up just some random
tiles at the hardware store and they're all unified by color the color white I
didn't want them to all be the same shape because I want it to look more
like a mosaic kind of feel we don't need to use quick set like the normal stuff
that you smear on to lay tile down instead I'm gonna use some heavy-duty
adhesive to get the tile nice and stuff and then I'm gonna go in like you
normally would with some grout but this grout is black just gonna look so cool
in contrast with the white tile and it's also gonna kind of complement the rug
we're gonna use some of this little half round molding
so this way we're basically creating a frame for then the tile to live inside all right guys so I'm just doing this
methodically as I go they don't want to leave the pattern that I've laid out
here okay yeah I did it jig was five minutes to spare despair on
what to spare on the wall and I painted the walls with five minutes to spare
they look really good but we also like so much more to do
yes we need to bask in our successes for a little bit more than a split second
really they need to get this done we have to make this room worthy of the
bulletin table can you finish that table so your light fixture at least I just
added water to our beautiful dark or how it's me and now we're gonna fill in all
of the gaps with this because our liquid nails I've dried of all of these trials
are nicely secured to the top don't worry I know I just smeared black
all over Donna what but damp sponge is for so once I feel like these are all
really pushed in and I go over with the damp sponge and clean it off gallery wall time okay these newlyweds
have some very beautiful wedding photos the key with styling wedding photos is
not having them all up you've got a limit yourself you would rather this be
the centerpiece and then have the other photos around kind of complementing it
telling the story of a nature romance nature shots um I've taken that I have
on my computer to blow up I am going to pop these now into the frames we got at
the thrift store I'm where we stopped at with yes secure the backing end their
wedding photos blown up taking take these to the drugstore okay okay
Jolie Julie tell alerts me mr. Dolittle timer yep
so let's build the gallery wall around this yeah can I mark it here my marking
here hang on to my finger perfect oh my gosh it looks so good in here guys
what do you think we've taken that vintage eclectic vibe
but it's still fresh with the fresh white walls and all the plants really
bring in a lot of life they better keep them alive
functional couple challenge for them and I know we pulled the golden ticket you
guys but we needed to because we got these big pieces of furniture in here
the light fixture is so glamorous but still finding vibes I hope they love it
it's time to bring them in are we ready are we ready ready oh my god I love that
should we keep the ship it's not too late go ahead gussy your name like
actually freaking out yeah yes so cool yeah yeah because we
were just so it's so much better than anything I would have imagined to do
here and now the big question for the couple because you guys couldn't
decorate this place because you couldn't agree mm-hmm do you agree that you will
flank the space absolutely yeah you guys are two months of your marriage right
yeah I wanna see the same happiness in chemistry ten years yeah you know what
the secret is you always matter how hard make
something work forget to put these our celebration good

that's not a long high tide platform I've been driving since I was five years
old doing are you sure I know no totally I grew up on a farm you don't know you
didn't know me when I was five years old 
previously on OMG without house if you could put anything in there what would you put in dinosaur net straight out water do you think we can do the French whores and then we're gonna drag out all the concrete everything is going all the concrete all along slightly getting rid of the part there's no turning back there's the water it's being pumped out never did I ever think that I would fish in my backyard in the middle of LA [Music] can't wait to decorate there's so much we can make how will it turn out oMG we back house [Music] Kate door humming hello hi oh my gosh he's been meeting you here it's a meeting you you and mom here you guys mom's in town mom's in town you guys remember when Joey's mom and his nephew came in town well today my mom's in town my little Schmo mom and I'm really excited because if you guys know we have a mud hit like a dirt hovel it's to the point where we need to do something with it and she is a plant aficionado she knows all about plants growing up here in California always planting and tending to bushes put her to work we're gonna put her to planning and advise left go play in the dirt okay well you know the front doors this way [Music] join Arlene you bet he's trying to get a few more winks and I am scheduling a video for today got Roxanne by my side it's very peaceful think and mind me my mouse ow what I think you might get my mom it is like 6:30 in the morning and she's already going so I guess we'll get up now what is she doing out there I have no idea I can't see anything but as soon as I get this scheduled we should only go out there because who knows my mother-in-law is in town fortunately we have a place to direct your creative energy this trip because we need some help with that outdoor space if you guys are ever wondering where I got my DIY jean it is definitely from my mom what is she out there yeah share the shovel no what is she she we have paper up on the windows in our bedroom that is only because since we've started the work on the backyard there's guys that show up like early in the morning I'm still slumbering changing so we've done that for privacy things I actually love not having blinds or curtains because we had such a lush beautiful foliage and trees in our backyard I love waking up and seeing that in the morning no mom mom we're not ready yet to do the landscaping mom we've been even bought the plants yet I will be a good son-in-law I will be a patient son-in-law this is the first time that she has visited us since the kitchen and the bathroom have been done she loves it but she's on to the next project before we started had a lot of stuff but there was no one reason to it so now is when we figure out what exactly we are gonna plant in his backyard well I'm worried about your old bones Miss Havisham lose mrs. Haversham it's an old character she knows so much about plants obviously I grew up in California so she's planted many a garden we actually moved a ton of times while I was growing up so my mom always had like different projects going on depending on what house we were living in at the time I mean she's sort of like a self-taught expert just kind of how I am - I'm self-taught interior designer she's a self-taught landscape architect we just have blind confidence in ourselves well yet you look at the superstructure of what's going on here nobody's touched this since like World War one what's a superstructure like the bigger girls of trees here obviously whoever plan and be planning them way too goes together or way too early in the century so mom is seeing that our trees are just like too overgrown that makes sense because they were planted in the 1920s was a Japanese family we have a Seiko palm we have a Japanese maple we have a magnolia tree beautiful mature plants and I definitely don't want to get rid of them because I love the shade and the lushness that they provide so can you help us yes help us mom you all can't move a sickle around and that's a specimen here's what you do you log off this one arm that's not an arm that's the whole tree oh it's not just this arm you see that crotch yeah well you just slice it down the crotch we literally change the plan for this backyard once a week if I have to go through one more iteration of what we're doing in this backyard real crazy also don't you think we need a crane to move the Seiko just a lot of people strong ones maybe it wasn't a good idea to get another opinion going so obviously we took out the pond yeah do you think we ruined the pond the pond was already there it's not icky oh my god what is that cord going into that tree ah probably landscaping lights that the the tree enveloped are we like being watched here's I'm thinking well we've sort of thought this together move the psycho to the corner grass right here we're only gonna live here for probably like another three or four years so I don't want to like do stuff like creeping vines and we're not even gonna be able oh oh that grows fast the pergola is such a pretty area I really want that to be like shaded but by vines so I was thinking Bugan via because I've always loved the beautiful pink purple flowers that come off Mugen via plants but mom saying that those will like fall all over the place which isn't cute could you grapes even within a season or two grapes we're gonna do Bank of steps going down there diagonally and then build beds oh good idea like like I was thinking lavender so mom saying we need to do like irrigation and drip system and pipes is 'cimmanon and she's recommending that we do grass the side yard the struggle is we don't use it as a driveway but we need to keep it somewhat as a driveway that's easy I want to use gravel we went down so many different avenues of like well what if we did this or what if we did that and everything is just like thousands and thousands of dollars I sort of pitched it like I twisted the pitch I wasn't like hey let's have a Scrabble drive I was like hey what if we have like a French chateau chic gravel pathway I want to do like a really chic French white gravel with like winding beds along the edge I'll barefoot that's what I've learned so you say no to gravel you say yes I'm kind of drought tolerant grass I say yes a gravel can we have a drink what about weight draw I do not want to have a giant dirt backyard for any longer than I have to let's go girls I want to do some like vining here too you know the most sunny part of our house is that whole wall along our kitchen and the guest bedroom so I think that would be a really pretty place to put like maybe herbs or something because we also have some ugly things going on on that wall like the hot water heater and stuff which we have to cover where's the Sun oh yeah well but the Sun does that it goes like this it's rolled where it's like this thick so this is in the Sun a lot of the day well that Sal the south wall this is north but in terms of planting this is north Sal I guarantee you this is north yes I should I don't throw nuts out I'm talking about the surface and also we need to clear out like all these bushes like Kate's mom which is like what's happening in here like this Bush is eating this bush like yeah that does not want to be there it's in eating this and then you got a geranium stuffed in there I don't know how to stop bushes from eating each other like yeah let's get it out of there can we please just have a moment and talk about this Bush hack man Bush you guys know this boy I don't think the front yard is big of a priority I do think that pack went bush we've got to figure something out because it is just funky this Bush has been here since the house was built the original idea was let's take it out and let's take this amazing route and like make like a bench out of it or like a coffee table base like file it down and look at it is a glass of right I think I do I trim that back and focus on the barky root thing but look at this it's like a reading nook in here look at that seating your neighbor who can fit in maybe a human okay oh this is really comfortable and I come under here and read with spiders all over you you with no spiders and ticks Joey it's really gross what's gonna crawl under your Bush hashtag save the bush need to honor and respect your elders we put it on life support to be like cut off the main artery and then try to let it live by these new little roots that have gone down into the soil I mean it's great puzzle over there could we make it into a different shape yeah like a evergreen snowman all right well can we go to the nursery and start making some gametime decisions we need a lot more plant yeah we need to start by right mama think about it in the car all right so our cns nursery in los angeles it's an amazing giant outdoor nursery they give you these push carts you can swap around wrap somehow I've ended up with Kate and her mom on the car take us to tree land yeah super the trees oh it's quite comfortable except for the serrated bottom but it's hot out and mana and I need a rest is it possible to do like an English garden with like California native vegetation I feel like we need to focus our energies every kantha I like going like an order like what is the first thing you pick out I know I like certain things I know I like the look of them but I don't know what works where so thank God mom here I think you need a big tree to anchor that corner a fast grower um three trees it's right in the center though it's not balanced so we'll move one of them yeah they convicted so then we're gonna have for treason or macking Oh Jasmine so that's what we could put on the pergola Salome solanum judge Menen yoga sesh I grab one of these I'm not sure which one I grab I'll give you a closer look we're gonna do it grass in front of our driveway should we do zero skate for like the rest of everything you definitely do xeriscape on everything I like this because this is very like hella fornia vibe if we mix this with like like lavender that'd be so pretty umm they have the pendulum alright take a picture see ya so this is for the pergola yeah well on either side of the garage I think maybe two big round pots with something in it what if we had two lemon trees on either side go through those fluff out so we have the lemon trees on the outside and then have fresh lemon water inside the gym we are continuing the lemon water legacy how many would you need if those put a carpet but depends on if you want a high hedge they grow fast or where where do we need a hedge oh man you want to higher than our current fence which is already 5 feet yeah yeah yeah one of these yeah yeah let's just grab one of each thing and then like finds a place to lay off so we can see how they all work together [Music] I love the idea bigger leaf plants with some smaller leaf plans and some more sort of flowy whimsical ones and then of course some flowers I really just like that eclectic look mom this is what I want lavender Oh oh my god this English French Spanish I mean we're gonna have like be City in our backyard though yes yeah honey bee honey bees especially in cities they are endangered because pesticides around and all that stuff do I want to welcome them into our garden he thinks she's cool with bees but I'm pretty sure she won't want to be stung on the rag this one what's this one Joey you scare Schmoll I will come at you with my tiny fists they're gonna sting you because you're bad vibes it smells so good y'all all right so we picked out a bunch of different things everything looks great together the problem is like this is enough stuff for like a corner go excited it's gonna be so whimsical in English and the lavender we're gonna have honeybees everywhere okay well you have to tell me how many of each thing to get so I can place the order how long have you calculated that no can you start doing that yeah hmm 20 no no no no Annie Annie do it Annie do it I have a different

now virtual hawk what is an interior designer the traditional definition of an interior designer because there is a difference between interior designer and interior decorator an interior designer is someone that has more of a macro view of beach planning they're oftentimes we more involved with the actual building of a sea they also do obviously the finishing touches and stuff as well an interior decorator is definitely way more about just those finishing things within an already existing room pink color and furniture and decorative objects etc for the purposes of this video I'm just going to use the term interior designer because they feel like nowadays just renovating and all that stuff you might be confronted with something that are a little bit more interior designer s and less interior decorator s but obviously I do both enter and in soup guys I was really organized when figuring out the spot I actually wrote up everything look at this oh my gosh I feel like I'm getting like a college presentation I'll be your professor cross arms can be a role obviously part one a PowerPoint presentation maybe we'll just edit in so part one how I became an interior designer I think it will probably be interesting for you to know just what my journey was because it is not a traditional journey I really found myself here I do not have my certificate I haven't taken a test you have to take a test and we're going to get approved by the National Board of a thought about ah what is it called when we could smell my nose it's so sweet I bought one so I don't even notice you have to pass the National Council for interior design qualification exam I think I'm calling myself an interior designer I guess by the you know standards of the qualification of whatever I have a past exam however I get paid to design people's faces and decorate and help them renovate and all that stuff in that respect I am a professional so I've been doing this for about eight years now and I wanted to share with you some steps along the way that I think contributed to me being a professional creative weirdo aka interior designer one of those things is I grew up with a very creative mother he was always bi wiring things around our house I also have a grandmother who worked at a so finishing place so I grew up is my mom DIY and all the time my grandma doing art projects of media making faux finishes on wall I quickly realized that all of it was doable and it wasn't so scary so that was really cool my mom at one point hired an interior designer when we moved to decorate a couple of the rooms and how that was a big like WoW moment for me I was like oh this is like a career but someone does it where they come into the home like we can look really awesome so that was a big light bulb I did a lot of art and no school I went to really treated school a welder school shout out while they're kids I did go to college even though I didn't take that exam and major in interior design I did graduate from the University of Loyola Marymount here in California and there I majored in film production which was a really valuable experience because I did a lot of art direction and production design back dressing a lot of those things used to be for your student films they got to decorate faces and also see how they looked on camera I minored in theater I was acting professionally he's been loosening up an IV v and probably watched some really weird funny bad movies that I've been in and the reason why I think being an actress really helps me now as an interior designer in I have to play roles still you know I'm not reading lines etc but I am having to channel different personalities and you design for other people you're interpreting their personal tastes so I have to handle them either room through their eyes really tried to play a character to give them the room that they will like I was always really experimental with my personal style like I've always dressed weird these people would always say that like you're so weird a force now you guys know I have turned that into a positive term because they truly lead but being a weirdo just means you are expressing your inherent awesome unique creativity that's inside of you and being able to direct fun and funky and express yourself through your personal style through your creative projects DIY projects and interior design it's all a reflection of how weird and wonderful you are the birth of mr. Tate started about six seven years ago I started it as a blog his chronicler my creative pursuit family jewelry line and I also started the YouTube channel to just be able to make videos that was a way for me to really see how much people responded to DIY projects and stuff like that obviously and exercise making and feeling and creating and being visually oriented since I was doing so many decorating DIYs on the channel and on the blog a lot of my friends started asking me to like help them decorate their spaces which I was fortunate for free by having a blog and videos here just online and someone found me from the Nate Berkus show and asked me to do some segments on his show so I was my first time being on camera and kind of like showing my DIY projects his acknowledging my creativity was like a big boost to my confidence after the Nate Berkus thing I got hired to be an interior designer on a show called homemade simple which was on The Oprah Winfrey Network I was an on camera and off camera interior designer so then but I being by the blue mama comic designer on a TV show now I really had friends of friends coming out of the woodwork and asking me to help them so at that point I was like you can't be working for free I should start charging so that was when I started actually charging like clients and up hiring assistant helped me do some installs and stuff that they needed help so once I started getting paid by people who are like really trusting me my interior design voice I was like you know what I really want to learn more about history of this I ended up enrolling in an extension program at UCLA legend intensive class and interior design is basically like the history of interior design and it was so fascinating and I loved it so much I love school I could have continued with the two-year program to get my certificate but I literally have no time as you guys know we're so busy with mr. Kate's up and I keep getting paid to be an interior designer that is essentially my backstory if you guys are interested in learning more about me you can watch the draw my life video and also I really encourage you to get houses on mass my book because it's super personal and I wrote a ton about a personal journey of my life so you guys are all integral of link below no pressure so that's it for part 1 and part 2 I am titling how lately my talents determine how to become an interior device these are my tips for you about how to become an interior designer in doing this video I actually googled how to become an interior designer because it's one of the few frugal said earn a degree in interior design past the National Council for interior design qualification exam take pro bono project meaning free projects at experienced fill the portfolio will look for continuing education opportunities like cool Google when do I get paid spend money on school do free projects spend money on school I'm not going to follow Google's of vitamin A to view my kit number one go to school I know such a classic typical bit of advice but if you don't want to major in interior design obviously as now know from my story that my college education really helped me know about interior design because I did film production take art history classes take history classes in general interior design is a reflection of what people did in history so fascinating if you can't afford to go to college I would definitely encourage you to just be like an internet Pro download book read a bunch of different articles and watch as many videos as you can try to educate yourself as much as possible about the history of interior design because you will only be as good as the knowledge that you have number two visualize with mood boards I don't have a project unless I have a move forward and that is where I start the brainstorming process learn how to mood board it's really easy it's really fun you can do it on Pinterest you can do it on Photoshop that spark of inspiration is really what the mood board is about for me it is not the end-all be-all of the space though a lot of times people go like I have my mood board I've decorated a room and I'm like on a computer now you actually physically manifest it which is a whole different story but I am always going back to my mood boards number three measure and create floor plans I look terrible now what floor plans is a mathematical part of being an interior designer but it is so essential because it doesn't matter how beautiful your mood board is or how beautiful the items that you buy for the space are you say don't fit it's a waste of time you want to learn how to make four plans so you can do that with a bunch of different programs there's some that I will link below or you could do it the old-fashioned way you could create kind of a scale you know using a ruler number four get your hands dirty decorating this is one of my favorite tips you know when they say practice makes perfect that is this tip and telling you actually physically interacting with furniture and spaces is the best teacher out there and you will get better and better every room because you will learn from your mistakes from your successes and I am only as good as the amount of rooms I've done like I literally get better and better every single room we do decorating is a physical activity like actually painting and screwing things into wall and hammering things together you might need some help with that obviously I have Joey burly strong man if you don't have a Joey buying yourself someone who's good at that stuff find yourself a handyman TaskRabbit etc and do some free work for friends and say hey do you want decorator taste and I come over and help you you have like 100 bucks to spend we could go to script store and like I some stuff and paint it and knit it enough number five no your work if you are looking to be an interior designer an interior decorator in order for it to be a career you need to make money this is a question I get a lot how do I know what to charge people really the best way to do it it's just charge someone for your time so you could start out charging people's hourly the range is gigantic because obviously there are people that don't have that much experience and then there's people that have so much experience and have like and mean and whatever you could be from $20 an hour to like a thousand dollars an hour so find your sweet spot you can also do a flat fee per project you can kind of like ballpark like okay think this will keep me around 20 hours 30 hours 40 hours to get this room to office rooms get it set up another traditional thing that interior designers will do is if you have a retail license you're registered with a federal tax ID that gives you a discount where you get kind of closer to wholesale prices then they charge a commission on that they basically resell to the client for retail and they keep the difference basically charging a commission on the things that they're finding I don't personally do that I like to find cheap awesome budget-friendly finds so I was always going with the hourly rate number six oh how to spend other people's money that is really hard because you're basically ballparking in what I like to do is create a spreadsheet and I input ballpark numbers of things will be like well I'll probably spend around $800 on a cow put them in and then tally it up you know you can do formulas and spreadsheets so that it'll total it up just be ballpark how much those things will cost but don't stop there remember you might need to pay an electrician you might need to pay delivery fees you might need to pay installers to help you put up certain things so make sure you are putting in line items for all of the things that you are imagining that you to pay for then you will see what is sort of your basic guesstimate initial budget I will tell you that everything ends up being more expensive than you think it's going to be but that is because you are buying everything all at once people usually don't shop like that when they're decorating their space so like buy a cow six months later buy a dining table so it doesn't feel like as much but when your interior designing you are getting everything for that room and one bulk shop though it is a higher ticket but it is basically the same amount of money they would probably otherwise spend over the course of three years one thing I always tell people to keep in mind when it comes to budget and how much would you spend on a hotel you know when you go to a hotel edie it's like a nicer hotels oh this is so nice and luxurious how much was that for night then like add that up and see how my flower cross if you lived in the hotel probably a lot well your home should be like a hotel gorgeous and lovely and inviting and happy and relaxing and all those things you feel in a hotel what is the dollar amount to place on that alright we have reached the end the last tip number seven believe in your talent it sounds cheesy but it is so important as an interior designer you are going to be making creative decisions all the time in stores online with people they're gonna be asking would you believe in your voice and your creative ability to answer those questions and make those decisions and you can do it there is no wrong way to be creative there's no rule your way in this particular case when it's your project is the right way remember that and believe in those instincts it doesn't always go the way that you think it's going to go I make decisions all the time I'm like that's the one that's the rub oh my god oh and then the rug doesn't come in time or a stained or a different color in person than it was online and I have to make a decision to change it you guys know if you watch my shopping videos I am confronted all the time and I just look at it as another moment to be creative okay universe serves me this and I am going to make the most of it and I'm going to make sure that this actually makes the movies better who need in that talent confidence is really seen and you can do it there is no wrong way the creative window and that's so cool alright so if you have lasted to the end of this video congratulations guys you uzoma that means that you are truly very interested in interior design or interior decorating or just being a professional creative person and being able to make money being a creative person so I really hope that this video helps give you guys the tips and tools and maybe some tricks to figure that for your own journey everyone's journey is unique there are so many different ways to go about being a professional in the creative space obviously I am just one person I encourage you to get other people's advice but in closing I just want to end on this note and I truly believe and interior design and decorating is just an outward reflection of who you are internally even though it seems superficial it is a really big important job because people's home spaces offices are environments where they will create and do really important things and then alive how inspiring and functional those spaces are is just crucial thank you so much for watching please subscribe please give this video a

hi cream weirdos welcome to another room on a budget video living room for Haley she is so lovely she's 22 she works as a model but she also is going through a big personal change with her mom having terminal cancer so I am very honored to be here today to work on pulling her space together she's a very magical spiritual girl and so we're gonna be infusing all that into the space but of course with our constraints of 300 dollars and only one day to do it you know the drill and thank you story blocks for sponsoring this video I'm so excited to be using some of those images today for some DIY art so start the timer and let's immediately I'm mister you don't even need the introduction you are no listen [Music] [Applause] oh my gosh I am so thrilled to be doing that I love your energy we're just already vibing together I think we fit perfectly we fit perfectly exactly all right so in looking at this space the thing that stands out to me first and foremost is the fact that you have crystals and incense and candles on your table my altar I love my alts in that we call an altar so I mean some people call it coffee table I call it's definitely very spiritual I think spirituality is very important to me because I've worked so much and have a lot going on in my life right now my mom has terminal cancer and so you know I have to be spiritual and positive for myself and for her and for my family and so we're setting you up with as much support and nurturing energy and beauty around you to really insulate you through that process yeah definitely let's talk a little bit technicalities you have this gigantic cow yeah sofa sectional I love love love having my friends over that's like obviously another thing that keeps me going okay so we like the couch it's in great shape it is obviously very kind of contemporary in line so let's talk a little bit about style so in my spirituality like goddesses and gods are very important to me and that just happens to associate most with Indian and Asian culture yeah so to me I find that influence in a lot of places a bit of a mix I love a mix because we're all of us there's no real you know exact button we can ever describe ourselves with or a mix of everything so I love cleaning with a mix of style and make fun so okay so color wise will keep it fairly neutral in that will keep it kind of contemporary feeling with the wall color etc but because you have these mystical elements like crystals and stuff like that we want to complement those with some jewel tone accents right the jewel tones you'll do but the one other thing is you told me the desk in the corner is like you don't need it I thought I would use it a lot more when I got it but I don't use it we can get rid of it yeah me too okay that helps with the energy flow too right taking away clutter oh yeah having open movement and being able to have that space it's definitely gonna help you manifest faster because you know there's space to work through yeah so openness is definitely a very important key so it's more than just painting walls and everything yeah I mean real that long yes ma'am pam pam we love okay Pam is gonna she's gonna be met with in in this room do it for pam pam starts with a p and so does paint so maybe we should paint great all right so I'll see you later yes okay lovingly she's so amazing such good vibes she's going through so much I really want the space to be so magical for her I want to infuse a lot of that magic spirituality color etc and she has these giant walls so we need a giant piece apart so I was thinking collage art for the space because it really will be a way to bring in some different textures and colors and all the things that she's into into one piece of art and it's perfect because our sponsor for today's video is story box which is my favorite place to go for images icons vectors illustrations so I was thinking how can I cover this giant wall above her couch with a beautiful statement piece of artwork without blowing our $300 budget Donna me collage art basically making a layout of like a planetary lineup of you know different planets in a row but budget saving TIFF I'm gonna print them on a home computer just a basic computer not go get them professionally printed like photographs just have them be regular printouts on eight-and-a-half by 11 I love the idea of having these circular planet like shapes made out of something not planetary like flowers or a tree or a mountain scene or something like that but then represented in an entire planet world shape does that make sense I know it sounds a little wacky but trust me I'm gonna print out all these beautiful images and then when I get to actually DIY eyeing the project you will see what's in my head oh how pretty look at this all these individual roses like these could be some of the smaller planet okay that is magical that cut out in a Sur well downloading that and there's over 400,000 images you can access its 149 bucks for the year membership on story blocks which basically is like 12 ish bucks a month you can also purchase the images individually but you do save at 60% if you do the year membership and you can access all the marketplace items you guys get 2x as a 7-day free trial the link will be in the description below so access it to access your creativity oh my gosh who is this amazing I love this Freya Norse goddess of love and beauty perfect guys should I print out more images to DIY the coffee table we need to do something to this coffee table because it's like marked up underneath this cloth what if I print out more images to decoupage the coffee table so I'm gonna download a ton of these I'm gonna go find Julie we're gonna go shopping we'll stop by the office we'll print these out go back here to decoupage and make planetary magic hopefully I found me a Joey hello Joey hello everybody so the plan is the big statement feature is going to be that collage part that we're gonna make great that needs to be gigantic because her couch Miss gigantic shows that desk in the corner when she said she doesn't even use it's just like kind of a clutter collector in the corner so we should move that and try to put a chair over there right make more conversation area around the table because she loves to have her friends over she loves crystals which I love about her I love crystals so I definitely want to celebrate those really give her way to kind of showcase then who's gonna like a crystal shop for the art project what do you want to do you into canvas budget-friendly we'll get let go you know then beat the wood mounted to the wall first off first or next stop coffee okay first door and then drivers are feeling you need coffee I do need ah be alright furniture [Music] these are so magical this traditional eating your friend levert poof pull out a little bit or you can put your feet up on the couch kind of like this oh that is cool throughout this dancing lady no no no put the swordfish back come out with the mirror the trick with that is just making it not look like your grandma's chair so you want to get that do you want to get that my grandma's cool do you get that like this side table so then we just need a lamp to go on top of it let's get it [Music] I really love your idea about going to like a crystal store yep so cuz they're right by there we should go to pan pipes pan thanks you guys it is like such a magical story okay so I want to build her an intention kit for her new space because we're renewing it with design and since she is very spiritual I think she would love to have also something more meaningful as well if these crystals quartz horse is a good stone it amplifies whatever energy is in the space so over here are all the smudge bundles of like the different stages this cleanses the energy sort of like resets the energy so she can use it on the floor walls and the space or to rise energy up in a way we tow anything we need feathers cuz you can burn the stage you can walk it all right so I gotta buy this okay so we just need to go to a hardware store to get the paint and the canvas material and then a big-box store to just get some basics right yeah and get Curtis rug throw pillows all the soft goods mr. worldwide laughing aliens okay we are there we are back at Haley's we're ready to unload Joey about the hardware up right okay we stopped at hardware store and then there's just some things that I wanted to show you guys we picked up this rug you guys a 4x6 or 49 Tina and then also these are gorgeous that I love when they sell them inside you don't know Alex I agree with plants plants bring good energy but fluid pots can kind of be expensive so my new favorite trick is to buy inexpensive trash cans or you all right so let's do everything up tall ceilings all she'd what color we painting a purpley gray I think cuz you know I like gray this is a good neutral but the cool thing about gray is it's very nuanced so it's gonna be great but like a purple undertone so it's gonna be a very complex grape Joey Joey how long have we been together you know did not just call great many years ten and a half is our decade I don't know I'm bad at math you're good at math okay yeah so we'll paint the wall a purple undertone gray curtains curtains take down those vertical blinds those vertical ones are flooding that's hilarious I know putting the TV on the wall yes you young all mirror about the fireplace and I have that big art piece that I need to do that then you need hang you're gonna help me hang I'm gonna help you hang help you paint actually cuz as room is gigantic you gonna help me paint why are you using the smallest roller possible love you want me to help I don't call it on your painting technique and how dare you body shame my roller how dare you we are only good lives in here I mean I'm very good your bacon and body positivity and roller shape means very good yes very none roller you know what you should be a lot more of a help of you plucked up your own roller and you know what it can be any shape and size Joey okay okay DIY artwork time okay you guys so what I have in front of me is a piece of hardboard and that is something that you can find at the hardware store it's normally used some construction but it is only $7 for an 8 by 4 piece so Joey and I just picked this up from the hardware store and we asked them to cut it down for us to 4x6 so I have our printouts from story block so some of these I just printed out as full-page images and then some of these I cropped in two circles so I took for you guys if you only have a home printer that prints eight and a half by eleven pieces of paper and you want a nice big circle you can divide it onto two pieces of paper first I need to prep the background the deep space if you will where my planets are going to arrange themselves across so these are so gorgeous these so many textures and colors to play with so I need a penis deep space color which last time I checked I think deep space is black and then I'm gonna come in with my handy dandy Mott qoj a decoupage errs best friend and I'm going to attach these pieces of paper aka my planets on to the art and then Joey's and hang on Wallen we're gonna hope that it was great [Music] okay guys deep space is over they're drying and now I am going to cut out my beautiful planetary shades also excited about these and then I have some various circle stencil shapes that I'm gonna use as my round stencils for the smaller planet so I'm hoping that this layering effect is gonna work out but I also did print out these images in this bowl pages so worst-case scenario my biggest planet could just be the size of a piece of paper which of course if you guys are doing this artwork in a smaller scale you will probably want to scale down your planets as well but since that piece of hardboard is so big I need some big planets on [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] deep-space has dried guys so now I have arranged the circular shapes in the order I want we're gonna hang it vertically so these are gonna be vertical rows of planets I want to use a matte finish I'm gonna use a gloss for the coffee table and I also like to have some water on hand because it just makes it that much easier to thin out the glue a little bit sometimes it's just too thick and you want to make the piece of paper nice and saturated and flexible so it really adheres to the surface so this is when the water comes in handy because obviously this is kind of a stiff piece of paper so I want it to be nice and flexible let's lay it down and this is what's so hilarious about any decoupage project is it just looks so messy before it dries but don't worry like I said it's gonna dry clear and then this is where you can use your fingers make sure there's no air bubbles Mod Podge also dry very quickly which is great for our quick turnaround primer [Music] so I'm just gonna wait for it all to dry see how it looks I might decide to do a coat all over the entire thing depending on its the sheen it's just a little bit different so dry darling dry dry galaxy Universal system [Music] oh here is our collage art of Planets I do want to add some hand-painted starburst shapes around and also add on some smaller planets using just the color white which I think will also unify these rows because obviously there's all kinds of colors going on so I just have some basic white craft paint which of course I take everywhere with me when you're doing collage art it's fun to also mix the medium so obviously we use paper and decoupage then adding some elements of paint also create more layers and complexity and just make it look like a higher quality piece of art [Music] yeah that's super cool so I plan on mountainous with standoffs okay I love seeing Oz very contemporary look like about darish yeah okay I have to go to the coffee table you got this yeah thanks techno Scott I got this you know I love it upcycle and so do you we don't really happen in the pledget to get a new coffee table it's in good enough shape except the top is all scratched and it's peeling and whatever obviously she was kind of concealing the peel eNOS with that cloth but I think it's gonna be a much cleaner look more contemporary if this can be a piece of furniture with a decoupage top if you guys have been watching our videos for a while and by awhile I mean ears you will remember that coffee table at our place our old apartment I use images from an art book and decoupage herbal top anyway so basically doing that theme technique so look I found these two pictures of this sort of like rose gold crystals like how gorgeous like look at that texture and there's dimension to it so imagine this just fall over the top of the table so basically the key is obviously printing out multiple copies of the same image I've got these two different images here that I'm just gonna layer all over and obviously I'm also tearing off all of the white as well because that is going to make it look more seamless as well as we don't see any white border just shapes like this I'm just laying down these pieces like I did before on the artwork and I'm going right up a little bit over the edge of the table so that when this is dry I can cut along the sharp blade like an exacto knife and just trim the edge to be nice and perfectly straight you'll screw in the tops going up there yeah [Music] [Music] [Music] nice nice and sealed and I did a ton of coats of Mod Podge on this right so it'll be nice and durable let's put together our positive intentions kit on a table okay all the room color candles aren't presenting all the different what kind of dirty socks are you sighing yeah those really your socks do not smell like this your socks smell like this I would be a much happier woman [Music] beautiful so you have [Music] [Music] place them over here on the positive vibes table our positive intention skit it looks so magical in here you guys what do you think [Music] let's talk through how this room came together we have the black couch which obviously I could not ignore because it's gigantic so we brought in that dark color up on the wall with our magnificent gigantic piece of artwork I mean now we are really emphasizing the height of these ceilings and this coffee table is now such a statement piece and then I just love how we've made the fire please have its moment we have the giraffe over there you know the giraffe only has one horn because I got it for two dollars but hey nobody's perfect and then we've got your grandma's chair is that your grandma's chair but it looks great we've got this beautiful textured pouf here so she really has now a 360-degree conversation area for all of her friends and then it's a positivity kit here to just really bring in so many good vibes I feel it I feel the good vibes in here and I'm gonna go find alien fragran she loves it such a long hallway we need to get you into the right position okay close your eyes now because you'll start to be sleepy 1 2 3 oh my god the table is like that's like crystal I'm steroids oh my I went to a specialty store and we put together a positive intentions kit for you believe color candles and the crystal oh my god and I love the elephant by the mirror right take the trunk up bring fiddler yes and the elephants are carriers of messages so I love that there's an elephant there so perfect yes and then this is one of the crystals that we picked out for you it spoke to me the quartz crystal which is the mag's and amplifier right yet so it amplifies whatever energy is in the space you're right on the I'm we shake did away with your vertical

Give us a thumbs up guys. Weve been working so hard on this house. Oh my gosh It's been three years and you guys have been along for the ride So I feel like that just deserves a thumbs up and we promise this will be a fun episode all right? So let's get the dirty lawn the dirt-y lawn Okay, so let's alright, so let's get the dirt from Brown Okay, well your thinking of that I'm going to actually do some stuff, joey i hope you're better at planting then you are finishing off a sentence We have so much to do in this yard. It's crazy you guys remember it was a jungle before like literally just Overgrown we had that pond so just  kind of a like a mosquito breeder if you Remember back to and we were fishing in the yard with all flooded the moat around our house It's been a journey now It's time to actually get serious about what we're clearing out plant wise since the house is Almost 100 years old I've had you know some pain in my heart about it because I know a lot of these plants have been here for Many many years this shrub is so big and overgrown and it really is preventing us from like Easily getting out of our cars when we park in the driveway it is time To finally say goodbye to the packman bush. I'm sorry. I'm sorry dearly beloved ah We thank you for The bush oh my God Sorry its a big bush wait I'm really sad its a slightly too big bush im gonna give it a kiss its a weird bush, sorry bush it can be weird somewhere else, were gonna preserve this here is the consolation and and I think that it's a Really amazing way to honor this bush and honor the life of the bush. We are going to preserve The root or not the root the trunk I guess it's the trunk of this bush so it's got this epic stump under it that we are going to cut out and keep and Use for something its smoking There is smoke actually coming out of the trunk as we're chainsawing it. That's the crazy thing about this bush It's actually a tree Whoever it was who used to own the house like trained the bush to like fall over like that and grow kind of like that so it has like a spine made out of Iron post and the Chainsaw is not enjoying it we have big plans to Honor this bush by having this root be something that we integrate into the landscaping and beautiful Now it's going to be like a sculptural piece alright, so we have our completely empty yards There's nothing in them we've cleared everything out like everything we've taken the grass out. We trimed the trees back We removed some trees now. It's time to bring in the plants So you guys remember we picked out all the plants we wanted the lavender and the rosemary Etc We did that with my mom you have so much area to cover with the front yard we have the side Pathway with the backyard look at this Look at this dirt path you have to fill up. We got a freaking truckload of plants showing up today here is all our planties Oh my gosh. We have so many more coming This is going to be the headge Olive tree Yayy We got we got a freaking olive tree Rosemary, Lavender, pine Trees, grape vines I'm so excited about the grapes Grapes for the pergola eat a grape eat a grape . It is a cabernet Sauvignon grape It's just really going to add to the shade of the pergola add to the Chateau vibe joey And I just might have to open a winery V nada Senor de Katie welcome to the mr kate nursery Welcome to the jungle the Rosemary Will decorate the front yard, the side path and the back yard cohesiveness if you will Lavender I can pick it and cut it and dry and make little sachets or underwear drawer joey do you want lavender scented underwear I already have lavender sachets in my drawer oh we need new ones oh yay our first visiting bee You're going to love our new Landscaping, we love bees. We just took the lavender off the truck and already theres honeybees like buzzing around Honeybees are a threatened species So welcome welcome all get your furry little legs in on that pollen of all these here  some big leaves.lemon tree Look at that curly Little weirdo right there. Hi, you cute little weirdo   What do you think we got too much? Joey have you seen the size of this yard ,ok just Have you seen how many plants We've just got, it's gonna to be mental? So in the yard, we're doing all kinds of awesome landscape lighting. We just got some cool, Led light We're just going to dig those into the ground shine it up at the tree direction of the tree Secure it in with some dirt And then grass over it yep careful of the light dont karate chop the light Here's what? We're dealing with here. This is my log. We have this giant stump this Trunk stump what are we calling it stump trunk root? Which is covered in Bark and dirt all kinds of bark and leaves on this root? Which we're trying to preserve and make into an art piece We're going to turn it into ultimately a planter to put on our front porch a little homage to the Pac-man tree We're going to take a power washer well not we I'm I have to go get my nails done there we go ahhh oh my god i just got dubree all over me   I've never done this before guys. I don't know it wasn't the right way to do it This thing was so dirty. I was so not prepared Literally a hundred years of grit and grime and dirt is flying off of that I like just came home from work have my work clothes on and now I'm covered in I Don't know what life made quite a bit of a mess, just a little  messy but man  was it worth it Protip next time you want to take the bark off of the giant tree that you just randomly have just use a power washer Pat on the back. What's done is done, and whats done is beautiful Now the task is I got to somehow get it to stand upright Because we wanted to kind of be a feature piece on that front porch. I guess I'm just going to try to like lumberjack one side and just axe the crap out of it and so I can get it level What are you doing? Joey, watch out like flying Debree ow what Debree, debree flying okay? No? I don't I'm not I don't i feel like we need to create a cocoon or like a blockade watch your feet. Yeah So it can be either like but because that looks so much more sculptural up like that if you're going to do this Project. I have my own you're working on the stump. I'm going to work on the trunk new Old friend So we have this old trunk. I got my love of thrift stores and flee markets from my grandmother And I have this old trunk from her doesn't work in the house, and it doesn't really work in the garage either But it's too beautiful to get rid of so I think it's the perfect vessel for a planter vessel sure apparently, I'm not a lumberjack. I don't claim to be a lumberjack. maybe I'll try a handsaw   i Love this idea because it has this tray on top that fits in and underneath There's a ton of room so we can store like gardening supplies ETc underneath and then on top I'm just going to create a little planter i was thinking about doing herbs, but I'm terrible at watering Plants So I picked out some plants, that I only have to water once a week oleander and some succulents And I only need to water those Infrequently, but still obviously get the beautiful look of a lush garden What am I thinking of course this is not going to work the blades not deep enough, a hammer and chisel? so im lining the trays with some vinyl which of course will Waterproof it and make sure that I'm not going to have any leaking water which will obviously cause the wood   to rot this is gonna contain all of that moisture And then I'm laying down some soil and also adding rocks which just aerate the soil and create drainage So it doesn't get too waterlogged Hmm getting the Chainsaw Now I'm just going to plant my plants and Add some more soil around and the finishing touch is adding some moss on top because that's just going to really cover up all this Exposed dirt and just really give it like a whimsical Vintage inspired look and i think it looks really cute boom Standing trunk so now that I got the trunk standing upright I got to figure out how to put the plant in it one way or another im putting a whole in this thing     Also have this little bird sculpture that I've had for so long that I haven't used yet in anything It was like in storage at our office so I'm going to add that and then just some sprinkling of some little white rocks, and I think it looks, so Cute it's like just like a cute little homage to again the vintage appeal of this house Having this little moment spread throughout We can plant one of those pozos plants which just grow beautifully in the shade, oh pretty even though we took out the pond we kept a bunch of the big rocks that were around the pond and We are placing those also Throughout the Garden the other thing is that we got all baby plants so something to keep in mind Is that they're going to grow a lot bigger So we have to make sure That we plant the plants Far enough apart from each other that would give them room to grow and fill in but I'm so ready to be done with this dirt patch front yard and backyard So on the pergola we're going to cover it with Grapevines a nice Wine grape the grapes need to be trained to grow up and over Pergola They don't really grab on to things so you just sort of as They go you take a little piece of plastic or whatever string anything. and you just tie them to the structure It's scaring me a little bit. He's like things that he's on American Ninja warrior Whatever that show is but he's just on the roof of our pergola he needs to behave once the stock get's strong enough. We'll take out these sticks like right now They're too weak and like babies to hold themselves up kinda like you Beg your pardon. I'm not a weak baby That is so rude Joey's making fun of my shmall stature Joey. I am full-grown I'm shmall and mighty be careful What shmall you threaten or tease because I will steal your stepladder. Where are you going with that? Do you really think that taking the ladder away from me is like going to stop me from Being able to get down from this is just a challenge omg Ninja warrior Challenge accepted joey no Joey wait. No don't do anything stupid. Oh my God. It's snapping It's cracking no just kidding it, i take it back I tease him and he teases me, but obviously I don't him to die, and I don't want to have like a Beautiful finished landscape then up Joey goes splat on the pergola floor The shmall has returned with the stepladder go back the other way joey. It can handle a dismount. Oh my God Oh my God. Oh my God totally unessasary grape head the deck looks so good I don't want to overdo the styling we have so much beauty going on in the vegetation in the landscaping I think just some lounge chairs are going to be perfect You know that hotel thing where like you go out to the pool they have the cozy like you know thick Cushion lounge chairs just like yeah, well that's what we're doing here. We've got them inexpensive Ikea whoop They are a different color wood But it doesn't really bother me because we have some mixed woods like you guys know I like to mix metals  inside, so outside I'm mixing wood tones. Why not look joey these mats fit perfectly chair number two yayy, oh it's on wheels when you need to move it or when you just need to work out We also found lounge chair pads that fit perfectly you said that this is Sunbrella Fabric Sunbrella Which is like you know really nice quality outdoor Fabric basically doesn't get dirty or does but you can very easily just wash it off with some water We can just hose them down boop hose them down let them dry on the sun done So then like the cherry on top is putting a nice lush white Towel on it, but not just any towel Oh, I love these hooded towels that you can then put over the top of the chair So it stays in place because you know its annoying when they slide down i also got some outdoor pillows made out of outdoor fabrics as well. I just love the look of black and white stripes I think it's kind of one of those very classic patterns which we could either do that or we could do a full stir But sometimes you want to like lay like this And have a behind your head And then the bolster like this ohhh Yeah Because they're playing with contrasting colors in our actual house paint with the white house and the Darker charcoal trim I think the black and white pattern is like a fun Way to repeat that, maybe a little crystal. Yeah succulent that's what it needed, a little crystal. look what We did we have a pretty yard now Pretty yard, pretty wife. no don't say that word pretty great life We just feel like it's a treat to be here. We can just come outside plop down with our beautiful plants It's really turning out pretty awesome. Look what we did really i Just have the worst aim ever oh it like skimmed you, what you tryna do?  I like aimed for your head and i hit you in the crotch I can decorate your entire house but don't ask me to throw you a pillow out here, it's like the breeze the cool grass under our feet I'm so excited to spend so many moments. Yes, in our yard together continued moments. Yeah, we all of a sudden have this Completely new experience at this house. Yeah like we go out like every day We didn't ever go out there, yeah And now we have like a yard that like we can actually go into and like You know you might find me out here with an easel painting a Picasso now Joey wants to bring out an easel that was not part of the landscaping plan where we are getting close to the final house tour maybe i promise were not done who are we kidding We're not getting close to the house tour we're just going to keep going we're never going to be done We just decided well we've been talking about it for a long time, but it sounds like it's pretty official We're going to do all new floors.

[Music] hello everybody.welcome my creative weirdos so happy to have you back with me today we are making DIY pillows and we are doing it both no sew and yes so because some of you so some of you don't so some of you have sewing machines and are good at it and some of you are like me and have a sewing machine for you but you know so so yep sinus infection very excited to get in to these pillows if you have seen any of my decorating videos you know how much I rely on throw pillows just spruce up a room a couch a chair a bed they are so important to bring in pattern and texture and coziness so making your own is budget-friendly and also really fun because you can use whatever fabric you want and while you're at it subscribe because why not if you haven't subscribed by now and you're watching these videos it's about damn time and if you subscribe and your longtime subscriber thank you so much and so let's get into these two beautiful pillows and also guys bonus just have to tell you they're double-sided they look beautiful from both sides they can mix and match I mean it's just they're super cool so check it out for this first no sew pillow you will need a pillow insert in your desired side and two different types of fabric we are using a natural linen and a beautiful green velvet for a nice contrast you need scrap piece of fabric for an ironing cloth some iron-on hem tape scissors and sewing pins buttons and decorative ribbon and a needle and thread first measure your pillow insert so you know roughly how wide and long it is so you can cut your piece of velvet one to two inches bigger than that insert now for your linen cut two pieces that are the same width as your velvet piece but a couple inches longer so that they overlap each other to create an envelope style opening now it's time to hem those two linen pieces which you will do with a damp cloth and some iron on hem team fold one side of your linen piece over once and sandwich a piece of hem tape in the fold using a damp cloth and an iron set on the heat setting recommended on the hem tape package you can adhere your first fold now here to clean him by folding over once more and sandwich another piece of hem tape between fabric to adhere sometimes this hem tape can be a little stubborn so just make sure you're checking that it's fully adhered before you stop ironing you can also do a finishing swipe over your hem with no cloth on the iron turn to the steam setting to really secure that sucker repeat that process with your other piece of linen creating a beautiful hem on just one side of your fabric the two hems will now lay over each other to create the envelope opening like this now place your velvet face down over the overlapping linen pieces making sure that the two sides that you want facing out are actually facing each other for this next step pin them together in the middle so all three pieces stay secured now use a piece of hem tape along the edge to attach the fabric together notice we're doing this not totally at the edge of the fabric which is why you want to make sure your fabric pieces are a little bit bigger than the pillow insert for this hem allow it now adhere these two pieces with the iron just like you did before if it decides where the fabric overlaps you will need to attach the two pieces of linen together in the area where they are overlapped and then develop it to those two pieces repeat until all four sides of your pillowcase are hem taped together using a numb tape is a great option if you don't sew however just keep in mind it does not hold up as well as if you sew the pillow now it's time to turn your pillowcase right-side out through the linen envelope opening and make sure it looks good and then turn it back inside out again so you can trim off any excess fabric on the other side of your hem time to turn it inside out yet again and insert your pillow insert to keep your envelope close you can stitch on some buttons on the inner panel as well as some loop tab made from pretty pieces of ribbon which are easy to sew onto the underside of your panel just using a needle and thread make sure that both the ribbon pieces are the same length and that they will fit snugly around your sewn on buttons okay let's move on to the solo pillow and get ready to use your machine to make a pillow that will last forever we're doing another two-sided pillow with this beautiful pattern cloth and some more natural linen you'll also need some pretty ribbon sewing pins thread scissors and a measuring tape oh look green nails this pattern cloth we will keep as our solid piece because it's just so darn pretty and this natural linen we are going to use for another envelope opening hello pillow insert very important obviously this one is rectangle but you could totally use a square as well measure your pillow insert and cut your solid panel of fabric to be about one to two inches bigger cut your piece of linen to be the same width as your top cloth but then cut it about six inches longer then cut this piece of linen in half we are going to do the same double fold hems like we did on the no sew pillow but this time we are going to pin the fold together now line up your fold in the center with some overlap and trim off any excess ironing down this double fold will help give you a nice flat hem to sew okay so since this is the sewing DIY let's quickly go over how to set up your machine you secure the spool of thread that matches your fabric at the top and then start your clean bobbin by threading the end of the thread through the hole so that you can hold on to it now I'll place your bobbin in the small spool and press on the pedal so the thread starts spooling around the bobbin a few times and then stop and cut the excess long thread now finish spooling up the bobbin by pressing the pedal again and look at this cute little full bobbin he had a big lunch now follow the directions on your machine to run the thread around and under all the guides so that it flows smoothly with no snacks once you make it all the way down the winding path to the neill read it load your bobbin just below the foot of the machine and slide the cover closed then use the large knob on the side of your machine to lower the needle down into the bobbin well and it will bring the bobbin thread up set your desired stitch and start by sewing the folded hem first and then the sides of your pillowcase together remember that the phases of the fabric should be facing each other for this step and your sewing inch in from the raw edge you should be doing this in the same order as the no sew pillow so a couple inches then hit reverse to secure the stitch before you go back on your merry way forward down the hem at the corner of your fabric make sure your needle is in the down position so you can just swing the fabric around and sew down the next side now remove your pins and tada you have a beautiful hem another step you could do to fully finish the edges to set your machine to an overlock stitch and sew along the raw edge of the fabric at the corners you can do a diagonal cut so that there is less bulk when you turn your pillowcase right-side out and insert your pillow insert now it's time to create some adorable tabs to close the envelope on the back you can do a simple button or more ribbon tabs like we're doing with this beautiful cranberry velvet now you're evenly in from the sides of the pillow and pin your tabs onto the top layer with a little fold to get a nice clean edge now you can use your machine to sew over the pin down tabs to attach trim any excess thread reinsert your pillow and tie them up I love these double-sided pillows because it's a sustainable way to have two pillows and one and these also make great gifts [Music] how cool are those pillows guys oh my gosh I'm thrilled with how they turned out and I just love how you can turn them both ways you can style them where the facts are showing her the friends are showing I mean it just makes it that much more budget-friendly for you guys out there because you can basically make a two-in-one pillow every time you make your own case so I hope you got really inspired by this video remember throw pillows are the accessories of your couch or bed or chair so change them out whenever you need to refresh to your room or you want to change the seasons I mean you can't change the seasons like Genco Feliz what yeah I'm saying mimic the season and if you liked this video please give it a thumbs

[Music] hello guys yes I am against the notorious mr. hate pink wall we're on a busy street so forgive the good traffic sounds but welcome to another shopping blog you guys this one is for Chloe couture and she is amazing if you haven't seen the transformation check out that video probably already seen it so here's the shopping block for you guys and the challenge with this space is that she was a glam Z Gallerie kind of look very like magazine worthy etc but she has a college students budget she is a college student or was or is the challenge really is getting that glam look for her on unapproachable budget so in this vlog I'm going to be emphasizing budget saving ideas to get a glam really pull together look and also it's fifty shades of gray well okay if you watch the video you know this but her color palette is one of the strictest color palettes we have worked with she only want gray wait silver so that's gonna be really challenging to find items you know that fits our color palette because you guys know I do mix metals and all NASA let's get into it and first though subscribe guys you guys know we are on our way to a million and when we reach a million we will do a giveaway for a ten thousand dollar room transformation imagine the possibilities let's get into the video hello everybody slay guys all play I want to start by showing you something fun that is a new program that Joey and I have been using for floor plans it is called smart draw it also comes with these little lists and things where I have templates of different items that you would normally see in a room and you can like click and drag them in you can resize them to be whatever size you need etc so this is Chloe's floorplan and as you can see it is a huge room and basically calling it a great room even though jelly wrote living room up here let me just change that real quick because it has a living room a dining room and then I'm also going to give her a little office area here this is a fireplace by the way so Jessie you guys know right now this room is empty except for a dining table and like these little tiny plastic dining chairs that she has so this is basically two rooms in one and we are working on a college students budget so we are going to get two rugs a couch chairs coffee table side tables another little accent table for this chair desk desk chair console table dining chairs and then of course art for these giant walls and curtains too now you know what the overhead for film looks like let's dive into the boards alright mood board number one I want to show you guys a that I go on sometimes with clients because not always is the first mood board that I send the one that we end up with so what was funny about this mood board is literally all of these photos except for the furniture items that I pulled are from Chloe's apartment board she had a Pinterest board called apartment gold and sure enough I sent it to her and she said you know what she was very sweet that way she's like looking at these images of all the gold and like the cream colors and realizing that I like more like this image the silver and the gray tones which by the way there's a branch here guys let's just take note of that branch so I was like totally cool this is your room I hear ya how about this so then this is the second board that is very much governed by these cool tones so that is what we are going with here very strict color palette like I mentioned to you guys just whites and grays all tones of gray so that's why I was like this is literally the 50 shades of grey room like not because it's you know bred room of pleasure or whatever the hell left called no because it actually has 50 shades of grey that are going to be going in there so I replaced the rift tough two chairs with these really simple chairs and I like these of course because they're gray 80 of clean modern lines like she wants this stump I'm so inspired by I really want to get an old wood stump and painted silver to make an accent table because she loves this table here but this table is like thousands of dollars so I'm gonna give her like a smaller version and also I love this reference for a sculptural art piece like a branch that is like backlit somehow or may be lit with twinkle lights or something the little starry lights and then I also love this art here and start here so something that has kind of a movement to it a very organic look I'm calling it cozy glam here but you guys I kind of come up with a new word instead of cozy glam I think it's organic glam because we have the presence of these wood textures but the very glamorous color palette and shiny shiny items and then these are some other items that we are getting from urban home who are kindly giving us these items which is really helping with the budget so we're getting the sofa two chairs this lamp and six dining chairs which is going to immensely help with the budget but I still have to get rugs and accessories a desk and a desk chair etc so let's go shopping so now that you guys saw them move forwards and you saw that I want to really try to do one of those Wood stump tables I'm going to hit up the salvaged wood place that I actually went to for Ava's wood for her headboard I'm going to hit up that place and see if there are any stumps I can get some wood stumps so let's go check it out these are amazing look at these these stumps are perfect we can paint them like silver we need these done all right yes stumpy we found you this coal is I'm telling you like really infiltrating my brain I only have a certain amount of energy left so um I think those tree stumps are going to work I'm going to probably just get one because again budget I couldn't lift it get it into the car anyway so now I'm at HomeGoods to check out some rugs there because I went online I found some rugs that I love the style of but the budget again is really the key here guys so I'm gonna head in and look for some rugs that I'm hoping to get around like $300 because I need two of them and I found some rugs online that I love but they were all like around like $600 and the size is also really important when you get area rugs so I need those 8 by 10 so 8 by 10 at a good price is hard to find but let's try here we are in the rug section so over there the 5 by 8 so 2 small we need the 8 by 10 and I'm seeing some 299 which is great 399 that's a little bit because I need to so we are looking for the great homes we are looking for the glamorous ooh I like this a nice shag but it's a little bit of a blue tone I'd like to get one this little later 299 and that's really pretty great with the white this is pretty of course $4.99 ok wait this silver shag is speaking to me because she wants gray and white and silver and here is a silver shag rug in our budget for under the dining room table probably maybe oh my gosh okay alright we're finding option ayat this is good oh here's a

her on beauty break on her own channel and new show on Hulu and she's the master all I mean of course look at her she's also really smart and so funny she has such a self-deprecating sense of humor which I adore she was like I like white I want it all white I wanted to be very quite I'm obsessed with like white and light colors like shell and ivory and off-white cream I'm just like naming things from like say yes to the dress welcome to the all-white episode do you were coming over today is gonna be fun no matter what so incredibly excited for them to be here like as like a and like a fangirl thing and then be like my room's gonna be decorated which is not something that I know how to do what's a little embarrassed to show some of the technical things that I haven't fixed Wow yeah I love your weird shower curtain okay I was honestly very very proud of that because it was like such a random small window the fact that I found those little rods Chiron and shin rod a really weird window but I think its eyes I probably the worst thing I've done is this is actually a fun space because already kind of decorated we're really just all in the place she already has some beautiful items I'm sure it is an issue that a lot of you face where you have a bed you like maybe you have a dresser you like but you just don't know how to tie all of those things together I'm the kind of person where I like things to all be like neat and orderly but at the same time I also will like start fixing something and then not fix it all the way I think probably the worst thing I've done in this room with that I love you like pseudo fireplace instead of using like cord protector which I ordered from Amazon I just picked this blanket that I got put it to cover the cord yeah you try I will give you an a - thank you I feel like this whole room is really representative of somebody who has great taste you know like what you like I don't think that you're in a situation that a lot of people are in which is that you get to that point where you bye bye bye bye bye uh-huh and then you're like okay it doesn't look pulled together yet did you hang it burns you're talking with the fact that I miss with loops yeah I missed a loop it was a long day and I saw that and then I was like we'll deal with that later now that was six months garage setting everyone's expectations really low this is like a new exercise for us because like a nice stuff so we're gonna just give you a couple nice things and pull it together I already have those like big pieces of furniture because I've lived here for a while and I like no I need to sleep and like sit I'm really excited to see how they take the pieces that I have and how they would like actually decorate them we have a really cool project for your wall huh and you're gonna help though there okay I'm really Andy oh yeah I know how to use a paint roller like I'm here to like show you up yes oh I love it Anne oMG wacko challenge oh yeah I'm Meghan how are you at moving king-size bed I honestly don't remember how this even got in here great grab my bush wash you I like the you or boy socks to bed that's what I need you got really big feet so we got to move this out which I'm guessing is hefty whoa that is heavy maybe when we take you out today you can go do your laundry oh how are you good it took us all for everything under way the first thing we're gonna do today is we are going to make a very custom fake wainscoting behind her bed on that giant wall the longest wall in the room that is unbroken it's only broken up by that weird little window which we'll get to later she's got glorious high ceilings which are awesome so I think placing the molding at around five foot up off the floor yes my height we'll just use me as the sizing you ever shot a nail gun shot a nail gun not a real one I did it to show um oh okay I'm a guide and I think we know we're doing let's go shoot some nail guns I've never used any sort of like power tool I only have a hammer and it's like small I think it's like a children's like kid one so okay there we go did it you look pretty comfortable with the nail gun I feel really comfortable a lot heavier than the fake one yeah yeah we actually don't need it yet the clean beautiful elegant way to add texture to a wall is with molding normally it would be a whole background of wood in this case we're actually just gonna do the trim and then paint the wall a different color in the rest of the wall which is going to give that illusion that we have a full locks wainscoting oh really it's just a really cool DIY hack I've become aware to think of textures and things like that so if you want to do like a lot of colors no colors is your color science all right so I love the whole look of molding you can do up to like a chair rail height but I think we go like a 5-footer and what's cool about it is we painted a different color like an eggshell white which is like a glassy and finish and the other big thing is this is a rental and we don't want to like do anything permanent so the good thing about this is we're just gonna use the nail gun you could just take the pieces out and they'll just be little nail holes use tap tap tap with some patch when you're ready without you're good so the look we're going for in this room is a really simple shaker style we're molding we're going to make it so that there's a small square on top and a larger rectangle on the bottom and to do it we're just going to make three rows so you got your top your middle and your bottom and then we're gonna do the verticals between first things first you just need to measure and cut megan is already coming in very handy I can see she's gonna be a great handyman assistant today you just like actually told me that that's probably why you would never work out Megan I thought you said you were gonna like do everything what Joey did you just forget 30 seconds ago when I helped you measure Jane stop distracting okay well what am i doing um we're gonna measure and then we're going to tape we're gonna cut once you have your line marked where to cut wrap it in a piece of painters tape and it kind of seeps everything's sandwiched together as you're cutting one with so I'm wearing these very trendy glasses and I'm using a power tool and I have a lot of control and a lot of power and they seem to trust me which is good one two three Megan is hilarious she wants to just get all wrapped up in these projects with us which I love she is game and she's wearing a flower crown princess in bell-bottoms with a nail gun I don't know how you could get more goals than that guys make it did a great job she's hired see how she doesn't that nail gun next so to get the molding on the wall we're gonna use the awesome laser level to make sure that everything is nice and straight that's your music video oh my god yeah no it's not it's her spine okay grab the nail gun Megan so there's a safety on the handle so you're gonna like how did it like down now pull the trigger [Music] can I please get the validation from you that I've done the best out of anybody who's ever been on this I mean I don't play favorites but you did a really good job I do so good he's septic so she's killing it at the saw at the nail gun like this is amazing we could totally just have her do this by herself I'm fully confident in you so I'm happy to just leave you to do this project but no buts Julie I want to do some with her outside I want to take her out into her beautiful little backyard she has and do another fun project because Joey's got this and he's really fast with all the songs and stuff and we don't got a lot of time today Joey take your power tool I'm taking the child are you lost this custody battle I don't even get to argue my case you don't have one all right I spoke too soon the girls are leaving I guess my dreams of Megan finishing this wall by herself or not gonna happen today but it's okay this is a fun project I'll tackle this I made sure and measured all the molding I knew that the window installment is gonna be three inches around so now it's all on the wall and all the cracks I'm gonna fill in with a simple caulk cau LK so we have that near little window in your in your room and I always feel like when there's something weird about a room there's two ways to go back so you can either let them fall away get about a Yaqui problem or probably exactly or you can celebrate it and think of it transform it instantly human difference honestly they were like so upset about the tiny window even knows the tiny window just a tiny window like why are we all freaking out this is a challenge like his head like okay it's weird because it's a little rectangle so what if we created kind of an arch a FAC rounded oh my god it's so cute whatever we do the wind is gonna be great cuz I even really notice it before when I was looking up inspiration images for this room I wanted to bring in a lot of different texture and mosaic tile is one of those amazing beautiful old-school ways of bringing in texture right you with the grout you have the beautiful stone arc ceramic or porcelain of the tile so this is going to be such a cool project so all you have to do is measure the shape of your window make sure you have those specs correct we are using a compass attachment for the jigsaw which is just the little handsaw it's really easy to use it has like the tiniest cutest little brain you ever seen yeah okay okay what guys missing something cannot solve without safety Golisano ah Joey are we alright with the safety goggles does it make it safe they snap back on you're not gonna get any cookies without attitude I'm sorry I want cookies oh he just turned so nice oh okay great alright so the caulk is dry I'm just gonna sand it down a little bit I'm painting all the edges I'm going to do the roller in the middle and a paint brush on the actual wood pieces and it is coming together if you don't slow the other time when you hand me a power who will you have to assume your responsibility I'm a loose cannon we don't know what I'm gonna do [Music] yeah so now let's do a quick coat of white paint gasps girl so this round is perfect now we are going to set a mosaic tile I did a mosaic class for like years in elementary school so we've got marble squares porcelain little disks these look like they're what the size of a penny like an opening they have a like penny tile this is mosaic tile which usually comes on the netting but we're just pulling it off the netting so that we can create our own pattern we are just using a tile adhesive it's an acrylic adhesive and we're just applying it with a spatula making some little hash marks on it to create a little bit more texture for the tile to wrap onto and obviously mosaic what's so great about it it's forgiving yeah it's random it's organic yeah I love it I'm so excited so now we're just letting the tile setting dry and um you know beggin baits and cookies she's like a fabulous baker oh my god oh my god yeah wet make it like your smile oh that's so cute are you guys serious right now I go outside and the girls are literally having a photo shoot you don't eat your food get take pictures of it first what well then he's enjoying you guys they're taking so long hey and I have been incredibly productive and really great time management so now we're just waiting for the mosaic to dry and I have previously made cookies because I'm gonna stock up and I just like want people like me so I'm like forced food on them oh my gosh these cookies aren't on me I want a cookie come get cookies no that's our boy I can't call me one day you trust okay bring you to everyone you know they evolve over and you know what they're - good one - great oh wait check if there's a name on it did it survive the flight hey what maybe a forgiving maiden you're forgiven I don't need your forgiveness for myself for us thank you now that the adhesive is dry I am just adding some grout it's white unsanded grout over the tile now of course I forgot my big sponge and like grout spatula but it's okay I'm improvising with a putty spatula and some paper towels I'm still thrilled with how that project turned out I love it now at the time the show where then you're like okay Megan we're kicking you out I don't really have anything to do so I'm just gonna go hide in another room literally just sitting there banished the princess to her courtyard while we finish decorating her room you Oh oh my gosh the molding looks amazing Joey did such a good job a little window piece will fill right the wall looks incredible it definitely looks like two different surfaces total optical illusion the only thing that would make it feel more awesome if it had a sweet light fixture right above it so that's exactly what we're gonna do oh you got the rug in here too so we rolled out the rug it's amazing it's so soft I need a little break I want to cuddle with my lady oh hey turn this way Oh like a wolf flutter enjoy oh hang on Joey you're taking this cuddle a little bit too far how do we get out but we gotta unroll it that's the only way the first we were to do is install that amazing custom window piece that's going to fit right into the molding hopefully so we're just going to screw it in the wall cover the screw holes with a little more grout oh no no no no your budget my time work now that window is like the glory moment of that corner which is so great so Meghan built herself this weird cable fireplace so the goal here is to hide all the cables get rid of the mess get rid of the clutter I'm gonna take this little shelf she has up right now we replace with the more luxe more sturdy piece and that's gonna perfectly complement this giant TV that she has on her wall so hanging a shelf under your TV is actually really easy because you have your TV mount which is all the in studs you can kind of look at that to your studs are I got the trusty dusty laser level so I can just laser right at the stud I'm gonna know exactly where to drill these in cuz this is a heavy shelf this is some hefty wood to run the cables I just got my two inch drill bit drill a hole behind the TV drill the hole behind where the cable boxes are cables begun making out the dresser by her bedroom doors when you walked in it was just right there we're moving her old dresser into the other corner of the room because we're gonna make a seating area on that other side we're gonna upgrade the dresser a little bit change out the knobs is the master suite after all and a suite is not complete without a seat oh man these are so cool hey Wow forgive me that table oh that's amazing yes what is it really that happy yeah so I brought in this little coffee table she can sit in there in the morning she can read it her socks on her shoes on her tie up heels whatever she's wearing that day well I think we should do a diamond no no no no well you only next ah I will find you a job to anchor the wall above those two amazing chairs I am placing this beautiful pair of wings that I found on their handmade by an artist at the flea market here in LA I found the local right around the corner so there's a local artist represented in her room guys I don't have to incur today Megan thank you for hearty having a very nice curtain rod I'm just gonna fix one thing and that is the weird loop that you left off for some reason this mirror that we are putting over the dresser is so cool it has a natural age to it wasn't almost like a mercury last thing going on and then on top of the dresser I'm styling elements that she'll need and also some decorative elements she had all of her makeup brushes and just different little like mason jars and canisters and placing a couple of her perfume bottles in there but obviously she can put her eyeliners in and all that stuff I'll leave it up to her we got to bring in a plan and this one is a snake plant it's easy to take care of don't worry Megan and Joey's potting it perfectly in the corner I mean we could have done this outside concrete with a little bit of wood so we have the wood going on in that corner and then the wood of the chairs going on in the other corner and we are repeating some things styling the bed we are adding some beautiful sumptuous setting some beautiful linen pillowcases to go on the European squares some king-size pillows that you sleep on we also have to add some throw pillows to the bed I found this really awesome vanity that has a flip up mirror and you can store all of your makeup in side there's also drawers it's like a lot of storage in this little thing and it's perfect for her so she can flip up the mirror when she needs to use it and flip it down and keep it nice and clean what's so cool about the sanity is it also came with a stool but I don't love the fabric that's covering the stool cover I think we can do better I got a throw pillow around the same size as the top of the seat when I ordered it I just noted the size I'm just taking the pillow out sticking the seat cover in before I attach it to the base I'm just stapling it down onto the underside and then just reattaching it to the base using the screws that a came with and tada this shelf under the TV is great I'm just styling it with items her side tables are really pretty let's just keep them we're just going to clean them up stow some of those books in the Shelf under the TV I'm also placing a magazine rack that instead of putting the magazine I'm putting a throw blanket in there but that's also a really great place for her to keep some of her books and other things that accumulate on the side table so it's a nice place to tuck those away I think we're ready Megan it is the reveal right now and I'm like so excited but I don't want to look this anticipation is killing me and I feel like I'm gonna cry is the door open yeah Cory walk forward walk forward wait I feel like I'm gonna cry I'm so excited okay yeah one two three I don't want my eyes forever it's a good world [Music] we'll go [Music] how good does I look now oh my gosh is so cute it's a really easy to take care of oh my god whoa this is so pretty the bed that is like a big-girl bed it is it makes die look I'm not yeah it's a gorgeous ground up oh

previously on OMG without house I'm going to Jack out all the competition is it raining non-stop ever since you got that driveway out the working we finally have some zinc up at our place any honest crazy indeed because I wanted to be black the last thing you say down yeah final Japanese you know what we're painting it straight flat one you can a lot Oh can you decorate there's so much we can make how will it turn out OMG [Music] okay torque humming okay okay what what what we're that we're about guys we have it we have a really exciting path today what I'm so excited we're going to pick the color of the house Oh why aren't you excited that's your reaction this is what are the biggest you'll ever would just make exterior of the house and the trim color great thank you this is what I'm dealing with here you know it's been a long process I just want to paint the house already I know there's so many details you guys owning a house is a lot also subscribe alright let's get that back on mm-hmm and let's go get some something in common we got done no but we just watch first and then comment okay great you guys have your agenda we have our agenda let's get into it the driveway is done I'm so glad the old concrete was all cracked and grows and we had this weird crazy plan so you guys know it has been so long that we've had like muddy moats along our house because we just were so badly timed with tearing out the old concrete the cement truck is here they're pouring the driveway look it's enough it's wet my god we should go out there and designer names in it we leveled it out more so that the water is creating away from our house so if there's ever a big rain it will all travel out of our yard and Judy's strength the other thing we did is drive it which is really cool it's kind of an acid treatment off the top of it so as it dried we were able to then wash off a little bit of the top texture so rather than the concrete's drying super super smooth it instead exposed the aggregate which is like you know the little stones and the little pebbles that are inside concrete it kind of exposes that texture a little bit more and it's a really cool kind of modern look while still being subtle enough to fuse to the vintage just feel about the gates done it's got the trim it was so nice with the stain it goes so well with this darker gray tried way it looks awesome we have so much to do at our house it really is the manna and probably the biggest project surface area wise is transforming the color of the exterior of our house all right so we're talking aina doc oh yeah okay you're going to stucco over the stucco snoozer coat stucco because we have a cottage cheese house our stucco is so old from the 20s like crumbling if they try to power water like sands off the pain is just going to crumble if it's to go over with like a glue code yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so they have to so basically our goal relation is basically our goal is instead of painting our house white we're going to use more stucco to make it black all right so the stucco we're using is going to already be tinted so we don't have to actually paint the house we just pick the color of the stucco we're going to use oh look here is the texture right we are we doing a brick or stucco I don't know well we'll figure it out I think always picking out the color okay so hearing what I did all right I went to the paint store and I got samples of a trim color and then I also got samples of like white paint color so that we could just be nice white like a white stucco would look like because I really want to do like a light house you're the lighthouse oh yeah already the color is just something that I really dislike it's like a weird tacky saturated tan and we haven't even painted the trim yet either which is like this really ruddy rick reddish color i know we're going for a white for the wall and like darker trim so do she's got like a light-colored house the reason why you're sitting like because I like to be presented with options what is a special sign sir oh yes well tonight we have a nice fine choice of stucco may I recommend the white go I do like the glacier like stucco however I combined two colors hmm no actually kind of a nicer restaurant so well then you would accept the nice custom order no that's like a mid-level nice restaurant with its epic afford it's like chef tasting so I'm doing like a normal cafe because we live in the middle of LA and there is so much sick we have a lot of carbon pollution and it just looks dirty all the time this is why we need a smooth coat stucco because all of these bridges are gather like that oh absolutely much pollution yeah I mean look look at that ooh there is so much dirt on this house we have not been good house washers Oh so that's my lease of it smooth it's not gonna quick look at that good not how it gathered there look at how thick that is dude this is like a topography it's very mountainous we've got the Himalayas the Sierra Nevadas the Rocky Mountains and then like all of Mars just all over our house I'm sure in like the 1920s when they originally did this there wasn't as much solution but now that our planet is dying because global warming is real my asthma right now the smooth tool is going to be way better it's going to be a good solution those we're not going to have this sort of dirt on the house anymore instead of painting you can stucco the outside of your house so you basically do like a new smooth coat over an existing very textured coat yes it is a little bit pricier but I think it will make such a difference having less of a textured house we won't up the power clean it okay so these are tests for the white option because these are just a bunch of different ways they're going to look the same no Joey done reset on dripping you're dripping or drooping make I know well we use a pollution rag on it well what are the rag do I have you want to donate a shirt I think we should plan out our testing strips so you do a square up we haven't tested whether or not it makes sense to smooth those just loose coat stucco is more expensive than just painting the house I know but if we paint a light color over this texture it's just going to get dirty again and then we're going to have like a marble house no no no good there any cottage cheese house are gonna put the goal yeah so make a square up there only get clear right here yeah we're using paint to pick the color because we want to just put it on the wall and see how it looks obviously ultimately it's going to be stucco nothing from literally just working out giving it a nice flattery coat I don't know what you mean by fun walls or anything like that was literally oh my god calm down Siri oh wow it's a really fresh and everything up I mean how big of a difference if we thought our living room color was that this stucco color the cockiest of the khaki oh man I can't wait our house is gonna be so long me full fresh so no this one is white Pete yours is Carrara oh yeah that looks good oh wait there was a third way this is winter morn all right you want to put winter morning up above that and I'll start with the trim I feel like I need to believe in the name of the paint's it's going be like covering my entire house sort of like what vibe do you want your house to be you're hot to be like oh yeah winter morning are you later out to be like Jessica cut it out are you aware house we like babe babe why key I don't want our house to be that sounds a little too much like a NASCAR eighties movie I'm leaning more towards Carrera it sounds a little bit more European Oh a half more like it didn't occur we don't live in a spanish-style house no I'm just try to think of like what an English story look calm community screaming wind time on land long for the shrim we're going with like a black flash gray we have four different grade gear we're going to try out see which one we think works at that all right this is cavernous this is our first trim color Oh cut cabinet would actually work real well with Carrera we put it in strength of cavernous this is a very Hollywood name it's celluloid celluloid not to be confused with cellulite when it's very annoyed you mean like that's what films made out I know it's celluloid welcome to in gelatin I don't feel I really want to go with kind of that more English look where the house itself is later and then the trim is darker right black on a piece of meat that's what it's called yes it's cold ah they like like waiting for creativity yeah skulls on black so this one is called legendary grey forgot the color together okay okay I'll think of the colors I like even clothes you like no Khanna 302 is a time one two three cavitus Carrera you didn't say anything I haven't decided yet so like I'm feeling like the cavernous meets the Korea revive it because it's kind of like being at the pub and Liverpool where I used to play with the band and we'd have our pine from the cabinet there's going to be so much of it around all the windows I don't want it to be so so intensely saturated black is just too dark agreed so celluloid Carrera I think I like the celluloid color for the trim and then I think I like winter more okay sticking celluloid winter morn they all the way they look black I don't care well we know we want to do the front lines black so I have the mark raping tree just painted mark right now doing it from a gun you'll accomplish specific folders oh yeah baby get it baby in this movie alright especially the front game we have these old lamps that I have on a timer they go on when the Sun Goes Down it turn off and so come up because we have black spray paint on hand and it just seems like a painting for today we are going to read 63 paint all around the light so are you gonna dismantle the top of it yeah here's the thing got a nice day super for you my video it's a light chicken soup Wow but that does not add add I was like the Pope nope when are we going to have a female Pope let's do my channel we are going to tape off these old light halo perfect I guess we're just going to paint them kate says we can just spray paint on which like I'm super into you because they that's another place that we can save some money we'd have to buy a new lighting you do this one I'll do the house I am going go go on then get going when just things line up get going then this is child through and paint crews yeah Oh God spider webs wow that was like an extended family of Fighters yeah writing it down there like this weird like rusted color and it has like a reddish tone to it and I'm so sick of the reddish tones going on house I want these just sloppy black and elegant we got a really nice quality gray paint that is meant for exterior and mess to go on metal so I want to make sure that it ate as well as the steel etc so we're just doing a nice smooth coat of the spray paint on and of course making sure to clean it beforehand [Music] I got the glass baguette who would have thought that these are actually so beautiful I mean I thought we'd have to replace these that just saved it's probably what like thousand bucks Joey there's still like copious spiderweb Allen was yours to tend to Facebook so rejuvenated how do you feel good not yeah I know the answer for the light I love of your life look so cool you guys like that's why I love craving like it just has the ability to so quickly transform so many things and I think that this is a huge talking and then to top it off because they match the mother for the doors but on some cast iron handle that have a thumb latch which basically is like a piece of metal that goes through the gate get the thumb pops it up on the other side I love the black is very and the beautiful grand Mel it's done these are everything like they're so cute and these were totally custom-built obviously if I saw the planks before that they were just vertical but now we have this beautiful art trim it's going across the top and then down around the side and it really completes the gate it's really true to the style of the house oh my gosh feeling so much more like established now no we need to still get the intercom here I definitely still want some sort of like doorbell or intercom system or something there so people feel like they have to come and ring the bell there as opposed to walking all the way up to our front door because our front door is right by like our dining room windows and Hennessy in I'd rather that be a more protected area literally if someone comes to our door like a solicitor come to our door we will have like the TV on will be talking someone knows we're there they knock the door and then we'll just like sit there and we won't open the door she's very anti solicitors we're going to be like okay this happen what time they're gonna go hello Oh doorbell damn dog hello I'm gonna say please be your name Joey the pool boy you guys the backyard I'm sorry sir we don't have a boy like hi okay well I guess I won't come in because there's a handle there but clearly they don't want me to come in

previously on OMG without house the tile is the biggest part of the renovation that we're doing we just called it about the cement tile so it's a porcelain slabs porcelain slab it's a quarter inch thick and use it for countertops we have the poopoo palace we're gonna actually put an arch on this little walkway to make it match the arch theme that's going on throughout the house I'm washing my so wash my back got it [Music] can't wait to decorate there's so much we can make how will it turn out OMG we pop house [Music] Kate door humming bitch do you so sick I'm sorry Joey Joey okay Joey's got a nice boozy drippy cold everybody says that renovating is super stressful and we started out really excited and I think it's like getting to us just a little bit this week but we're in the homestretch we're gonna walk through some things today that we still need to do get some stuff done try to power through this call to make sure and subscribe guys because we're giving away that ten thousand dollar room transformation along the way we're gonna give one thousand dollars away to charity every time we hit a new 100,000 subscribers all right what's gonna do oh gosh so much to do we're shooting on G get excited hey-oh so flat fan bang alright so every morning I get up at 6:30 to let everyone into the house a plumber the electrician today I woke up with a cold but I'm not gonna give in to it I'm gonna keep pushing it will watch the snacks you gots next what's thick can you just feed me one peas please I'll skewer it with my noon hey what are you doing I'm looking at nipples online Oh Joey what do you really do shower nipples do you want a six-inch or a 12 inch nipple what we were in the garage with our plumber and he said where is the nipple said excuse me the nipple okay call the nipple I don't know who named it shower head connector that's what it is nonetheless I've got a search 6 inch nipple on Google which by the way just add the word shower to that search I mean I need a gold or brass right you Joey no you ill t yeah right let your Bamonte a or your vas not a ha let's go growl I mean I also really want to clean in here because this report Dexter's plastic is not working for us in here so we sealed up our room with the tunnel made of plastic so we get to the master bathroom from outside without letting all the dust and debris from the construction into our bedroom we did not move out during the renovation you might want to when the guys walk by they're just these weird amorphous shapes really we're like in a TV show Dexter where you like plastic to everything before like murdered everyone get your nipple yeah ordered gonna be here in two days oh my god get a nice gray pasta with a little bit of pasta right there so we've laid all the time in the kitchen we've set it off quick set used our spacers everything looks perfect use a sponge to make it nice and clean once we've got it in the cracks such a cool color gray it's a nice way to really highlight the shape of the tiles to add a darker grout so this is sanded grout yeah we're gonna use unsanded in the bathroom I did this with my mom when I was little did you argue this with your mom oh wow are you serious alright we'll meet anymore who's making that run why do I have to go to the hardware store I went to the hardware store to get the stuff in the first place Joey I have stuff on my hands nice bully with this that feels like my body do you know this phrase called Rory in grey don't worry yeah that's my future yeah which was what color black Joey loves back to the future but he thinks that the DeLorean was black DeLorean back to the feature was definitely not gray yes it was like silvery grey that's it that is a bet that I will take tenfold that's a little hardware store I'm looking it up right now so excited to me right right I'll see you in a little bit ah you can never compete with me about color hello a black car with the right light on it is going to look gray bye Joey I love the ravine the black and white from the original 1920s bathroom into the master bathroom as well I've got to seal these tiles you need a special dry treat sealant which needs to be applied over a clean surface with a brush making sure there's no bubbles making sure to seal the sides and we're also going to need to do coat on the back that needs to happen before it gets up on the wall we had the poopoo Palace at the end of the kitchen which was closed by two doors there was a window in there which was blocked because we had our washer and dryer in there so we took the washer and dryer out he took those doors off we made a nice arch to match the arch on the other side and also we're installing a fake cabinet front on the base it's a great use of space way better than what it looks before so I gave one of the guys the cat door to put the cat door in and he thinks our cats are like dog size so I'm gonna lower the opening in the wall we'll just have to patch in the top so that the cats can just walk through it we enter in Germans go click on shaker so I really wanted to change the faces of the cabinet in our kitchen because I do not like the molding that is on there right now shaker is basically just a super simple one clean square molding around like a flat surface panel so 25 by 32 and a half the issue is getting all new cabinets is expensive so Joey found this website online where you can order just the doors and you can order them to size they special order them they get delivered in like a week it'll be 12 7 16 for each door invalid entry just put it in decimals okay well I don't know what 7/16 is investable figure it out I'm not doing email fax or email thank you there's a conversion chart right here great cool we don't have to fight basically you just measure the openings and then add an inch to each measurement so that they all hang over about a half-inch around if you're doing two closing doors when I make sure and have an extra eighth of an inch in the middle so that that's clearance for them to open close it's so exciting we finally have the farmhouse sink set into countertop it's so much better than the old sink we had it's just one big basin as opposed to two so this is there what's going on the rest of the holes so we got that water spigot yeah there's like toothpaste because we like to drink mineral water like spring water we are getting a special pump system where we're using the actual bottles of spring water you can get delivered but they're gonna be pumped through a spigot we prep the surface for the countertop guy to come in and install that porcelain I'm really excited we is there like a terminator movie where his arm gets knocked off and it's like yeah okay okay what he gave me no massage no here take this that window is looking really good yeah I just need to clean it although that we installed it without cleaning it or anything did we check for the germ a toppings it doesn't undermine doesn't look you saw there was no drop in if we had to tent the house after all this we already tented the house when we moved in yeah well that last for her it does Duns entire house like Google learning how do you waterproof a shower okay cool every five years all right well we're good as long as there's no termites in the like seven-year-old window we brought in did you see any turbines in the seven-year-old what are we runnin I mean I saw some termite damage and you didn't bring that to anyone's attention I'm bringing it to your attention right now so Joey now you're checking in in the master bathroom so many advances have happened it doesn't look like it but really truly it has been out the subfloor laid tile is starting to get laid in there we're gonna do a white grout we'll just keep it nice and fresh and clean looking we've got the little cavities for the medicine cabinets cut out those are going to be delivered I ordered some wood ones since there's so much white we've got a niche cut out inside the master shower which is going to be where we're going to store or shampoo and conditioner I feel like we could probably get new trim like I don't want no need to put this pizza Oh trim back on so let's throw this out what's great what what are you gonna use the restroom wormans got inspect isn't it weird that they seal the poop chute with like a plastic bag looking good looking good me actually looks like crap but come on a wall alright I'm so sorry you're sick I love you you'll get better mind over body mind over body here we go so okay great mind over matter yes mind over body body matter well we got a lot done today we conquered that renovation weariness and we're still trucking there is no choice but to keep on going cuz we've got

previously on OMG without house if you could put anything in there what would you put in dinosaur net straight out water do you think we can do the French whores and then we're gonna drag out all the concrete everything is going all the concrete all along slightly getting rid of the part there's no turning back there's the water it's being pumped out never did I ever think that I would fish in my backyard in the middle of LA [Music] can't wait to decorate there's so much we can make how will it turn out oMG we back house [Music] Kate door humming hello hi oh my gosh he's been meeting you here it's a meeting you you and mom here you guys mom's in town mom's in town you guys remember when Joey's mom and his nephew came in town well today my mom's in town my little Schmo mom and I'm really excited because if you guys know we have a mud hit like a dirt hovel it's to the point where we need to do something with it and she is a plant aficionado she knows all about plants growing up here in California always planting and tending to bushes put her to work we're gonna put her to planning and advise left go play in the dirt okay well you know the front doors this way [Music] join Arlene you bet he's trying to get a few more winks and I am scheduling a video for today got Roxanne by my side it's very peaceful think and mind me my mouse ow what I think you might get my mom it is like 6:30 in the morning and she's already going so I guess we'll get up now what is she doing out there I have no idea I can't see anything but as soon as I get this scheduled we should only go out there because who knows my mother-in-law is in town fortunately we have a place to direct your creative energy this trip because we need some help with that outdoor space if you guys are ever wondering where I got my DIY jean it is definitely from my mom what is she out there yeah share the shovel no what is she she we have paper up on the windows in our bedroom that is only because since we've started the work on the backyard there's guys that show up like early in the morning I'm still slumbering changing so we've done that for privacy things I actually love not having blinds or curtains because we had such a lush beautiful foliage and trees in our backyard I love waking up and seeing that in the morning no mom mom we're not ready yet to do the landscaping mom we've been even bought the plants yet I will be a good son-in-law I will be a patient son-in-law this is the first time that she has visited us since the kitchen and the bathroom have been done she loves it but she's on to the next project before we started had a lot of stuff but there was no one reason to it so now is when we figure out what exactly we are gonna plant in his backyard well I'm worried about your old bones Miss Havisham lose mrs. Haversham it's an old character she knows so much about plants obviously I grew up in California so she's planted many a garden we actually moved a ton of times while I was growing up so my mom always had like different projects going on depending on what house we were living in at the time I mean she's sort of like a self-taught expert just kind of how I am - I'm self-taught interior designer she's a self-taught landscape architect we just have blind confidence in ourselves well yet you look at the superstructure of what's going on here nobody's touched this since like World War one what's a superstructure like the bigger girls of trees here obviously whoever plan and be planning them way too goes together or way too early in the century so mom is seeing that our trees are just like too overgrown that makes sense because they were planted in the 1920s was a Japanese family we have a Seiko palm we have a Japanese maple we have a magnolia tree beautiful mature plants and I definitely don't want to get rid of them because I love the shade and the lushness that they provide so can you help us yes help us mom you all can't move a sickle around and that's a specimen here's what you do you log off this one arm that's not an arm that's the whole tree oh it's not just this arm you see that crotch yeah well you just slice it down the crotch we literally change the plan for this backyard once a week if I have to go through one more iteration of what we're doing in this backyard real crazy also don't you think we need a crane to move the Seiko just a lot of people strong ones maybe it wasn't a good idea to get another opinion going so obviously we took out the pond yeah do you think we ruined the pond the pond was already there it's not icky oh my god what is that cord going into that tree ah probably landscaping lights that the the tree enveloped are we like being watched here's I'm thinking well we've sort of thought this together move the psycho to the corner grass right here we're only gonna live here for probably like another three or four years so I don't want to like do stuff like creeping vines and we're not even gonna be able oh oh that grows fast the pergola is such a pretty area I really want that to be like shaded but by vines so I was thinking Bugan via because I've always loved the beautiful pink purple flowers that come off Mugen via plants but mom saying that those will like fall all over the place which isn't cute could you grapes even within a season or two grapes we're gonna do Bank of steps going down there diagonally and then build beds oh good idea like like I was thinking lavender so mom saying we need to do like irrigation and drip system and pipes is 'cimmanon and she's recommending that we do grass the side yard the struggle is we don't use it as a driveway but we need to keep it somewhat as a driveway that's easy I want to use gravel we went down so many different avenues of like well what if we did this or what if we did that and everything is just like thousands and thousands of dollars I sort of pitched it like I twisted the pitch I wasn't like hey let's have a Scrabble drive I was like hey what if we have like a French chateau chic gravel pathway I want to do like a really chic French white gravel with like winding beds along the edge I'll barefoot that's what I've learned so you say no to gravel you say yes I'm kind of drought tolerant grass I say yes a gravel can we have a drink what about weight draw I do not want to have a giant dirt backyard for any longer than I have to let's go girls I want to do some like vining here too you know the most sunny part of our house is that whole wall along our kitchen and the guest bedroom so I think that would be a really pretty place to put like maybe herbs or something because we also have some ugly things going on on that wall like the hot water heater and stuff which we have to cover where's the Sun oh yeah well but the Sun does that it goes like this it's rolled where it's like this thick so this is in the Sun a lot of the day well that Sal the south wall this is north but in terms of planting this is north Sal I guarantee you this is north yes I should I don't throw nuts out I'm talking about the surface and also we need to clear out like all these bushes like Kate's mom which is like what's happening in here like this Bush is eating this bush like yeah that does not want to be there it's in eating this and then you got a geranium stuffed in there I don't know how to stop bushes from eating each other like yeah let's get it out of there can we please just have a moment and talk about this Bush hack man Bush you guys know this boy I don't think the front yard is big of a priority I do think that pack went bush we've got to figure something out because it is just funky this Bush has been here since the house was built the original idea was let's take it out and let's take this amazing route and like make like a bench out of it or like a coffee table base like file it down and look at it is a glass of right I think I do I trim that back and focus on the barky root thing but look at this it's like a reading nook in here look at that seating your neighbor who can fit in maybe a human okay oh this is really comfortable and I come under here and read with spiders all over you you with no spiders and ticks Joey it's really gross what's gonna crawl under your Bush hashtag save the bush need to honor and respect your elders we put it on life support to be like cut off the main artery and then try to let it live by these new little roots that have gone down into the soil I mean it's great puzzle over there could we make it into a different shape yeah like a evergreen snowman all right well can we go to the nursery and start making some gametime decisions we need a lot more plant yeah we need to start by right mama think about it in the car all right so our cns nursery in los angeles it's an amazing giant outdoor nursery they give you these push carts you can swap around wrap somehow I've ended up with Kate and her mom on the car take us to tree land yeah super the trees oh it's quite comfortable except for the serrated bottom but it's hot out and mana and I need a rest is it possible to do like an English garden with like California native vegetation I feel like we need to focus our energies every kantha I like going like an order like what is the first thing you pick out I know I like certain things I know I like the look of them but I don't know what works where so thank God mom here I think you need a big tree to anchor that corner a fast grower um three trees it's right in the center though it's not balanced so we'll move one of them yeah they convicted so then we're gonna have for treason or macking Oh Jasmine so that's what we could put on the pergola Salome solanum judge Menen yoga sesh I grab one of these I'm not sure which one I grab I'll give you a closer look we're gonna do it grass in front of our driveway should we do zero skate for like the rest of everything you definitely do xeriscape on everything I like this because this is very like hella fornia vibe if we mix this with like like lavender that'd be so pretty umm they have the pendulum alright take a picture see ya so this is for the pergola yeah well on either side of the garage I think maybe two big round pots with something in it what if we had two lemon trees on either side go through those fluff out so we have the lemon trees on the outside and then have fresh lemon water inside the gym we are continuing the lemon water legacy how many would you need if those put a carpet but depends on if you want a high hedge they grow fast or where where do we need a hedge oh man you want to higher than our current fence which is already 5 feet yeah yeah yeah one of these yeah yeah let's just grab one of each thing and then like finds a place to lay off so we can see how they all work together [Music] I love the idea bigger leaf plants with some smaller leaf plans and some more sort of flowy whimsical ones and then of course some flowers I really just like that eclectic look mom this is what I want lavender Oh oh my god this English French Spanish I mean we're gonna have like be City in our backyard though yes yeah honey bee honey bees especially in cities they are endangered because pesticides around and all that stuff do I want to welcome them into our garden he thinks she's cool with bees but I'm pretty sure she won't want to be stung on the rag this one what's this one Joey you scare Schmoll I will come at you with my tiny fists they're gonna sting you because you're bad vibes it smells so good y'all all right so we picked out a bunch of different things everything looks great together the problem is like this is enough stuff for like a corner go excited it's gonna be so whimsical in English and the lavender we're gonna have honeybees everywhere okay well you have to tell me how many of each thing to get so I can place the order how long have you calculated that no can you start doing that yeah hmm 20 no no no no Annie Annie do it Annie do it I have a different revivalist lemon tree yeah um we have a bug is it a bee no doesn't look you yeah thank you bye Leon stay back forever be my baby oh I can't believe we have to cut off a tree limb that's okay it'll be happy oh that was so sweet of mom and help uh we're very lucky to have her cuz thank God we do not know what we're doing but she does so obviously we need to buy a lot more than what we just gathered that was just sort of like a one of each type thing we're gonna get those ordered we're gonna really figure out how to make these thrive in our front and backyard and I'm excited yeah I'm excited to

P's studios in to our dream creative space this season we're hitting the road with the perfect sponsor Staples Tomiko are the offices of our fellow entrepreneurs who need our help it's Maidana so we are headed to creative teaching press a company created by a teacher mrs. Louella Connelly 50 years ago with the mission of making classrooms more fun by providing teachers decorating supplies educational books and products to inspire their students jen is a digital marketing expert brought on by brandy who is the head of marketing to bring creative teaching press up to date with their social outreach the marketing department works in cubicles and is currently lacking a proper space to create content like photos and videos for the teachers so we are going to solve that issue by converting what is currently called their library but it's basically a glorified storage room into a speed or the entire marketing team can spread out and test their classroom decorating products and teaching tools Joey and I are proudly accepting the challenge of making this room teacher shoes brandy and Jen head of marketing head of digital marketing and your job is to basically make sure all of that stuff out there sells all the books that you guys move from here down there it's out there this is going to become the creative space you need like a mock-up classroom because we want to know how the teachers are gonna use our products every day so you need to like play with the products use product they are like working on that you have spaces to photograph the product and to do social media videos more video content and more social content we're like we're in the same business oh my god no and teachers spend so much time in their classroom it's hard to find inspiration to keep going every day really help the teachers be creative and be inspired so they can do their job better it was started by a woman Connolly to give her kids to get them started with writing and here we are 50 years later I have a concern you guys don't look like anyone warns you that you're gonna be painting so part of office goals is we're all about putting the team to work so you guys are teammates basically you're technically your boss technically okay so we're gonna leave you guys to do the painting by yourselves does we got other stuff we got to do so drop cloths paint rollers if you need anything maybe you'll be able to find us here we go juicy breasts yes so I guess they want us to paint by ourselves I mean you want paper to make us some like DIY smocks maybe some resource no awesome [Music] I like seen on TV that you're supposed to all right create a show right now the room was a library but you guys have cleared out the marketing team is just in cubicles so this is gonna be their creation plays we still let me give them hook storage to display their mana this is gonna be a pork wall and why do we were kids desk because for the teachers and their officers are actually out here but they'll have any place to create so like that's why this is another creators right so thank God this is the meeting table but then these are all on wheels a long wheels wrote something they can moving around or these are display case and then we're displaying their historical stuff that's the way we're gonna do is take out the drop ceiling and like have like a cool rock ceiling underneath it okay no way no have got like industrial oh yeah no that's gonna be awesome drop ceiling gone all right cool count to 30 let me down welcome to the formula no no I don't want to breathe no reason I want a gentle blow right kids right there [Music] [Music] I love these DIYs this is so cute okay wait I feel like I need it let me add some embellishments to this okay what would be a good painters name for bread I don't know but I'm the big deal the thing is not about me this is about this wonderful space that were created yeah oh my gosh Joey be careful of the wall Joey [Music] hey Jennifer I say the warehouse is a pretty fun spot I'm sure it's probably a little against the company rules do you have fun out there but welcome to my home away from home thank you look how cute you decorated everything this little taco that I made out of order you may not corners that's so DIY yeah this is also borders this is where I shoot all my photos on the floor so no longer afterload I gave you a homework assignment I wanted you to pull something like the historical product because it's so cool this is a fifty year old company I definitely want to make sure you have some of these historical items displayed in the room this is are very very very fun oh my gosh look at that little recipes to help you with creative writing prompts in here yeah monalee the woman who started this whole business yeah three this was just like randomly on the bookshop yeah so we want to like I just love the artwork oh yeah American history scenes are here and this may or may not have inspired is that why you were that time this is just so much filing just very already Russian so these are our very first graduates of stickers wait these are the first ever scratches like a fruity candy smells I don't know what oh gosh okay precious cargo precious cargo keep working see you later okay so now that the ladies have finished painting great teamwork and I've got the original historical products from Jen we've got to get into this space get that feeling out bring in and install all the furniture in decor items from staples and just totally transform the space into something they can actually use okay then go probably oh my god you know what it's the same height is out there in the warehouse but also like there's no walls of IDing the rooms up here cool so we should just do something with these they do sell like different tiles you could put in something like new and clean just freshen up cuz this being a seductive well that's free can do is we've got time for this but Tambe we've gotta find real solutions this is cavity written all over it since one of the main products they make here our borders and decorations for bulletin boards we want to bring in the display racks for them to work drop their collection so Joey is mounting the tracks directly to the wall and we've painted them the wall color for a more seamless look and above that we're gonna mount an awesome custom-made Sun from stable okay guys so we have those recipe cards that are pretty much inspiring this entire color palette because it's just like a neutral cardboard box and then a little bit of yellow I want to celebrate that yellow with a Sun mural but a very basic one it actually is inspired by something that I did in my bullet journal where I did just this like little half Sun they have so many cool products and so many different colors that are gonna be constantly coming in and out of this room I say come up with new things we need to make sure that this room is pretty much neutral with a little pop of nostalgia from the yellow from the recipe something like this Sun just like super basic brighten up their classrooms because they bring a lot of brightness and light and we don't have any actual windows in this room so it's kind of just a reminder that the Sun exists [Music] oh I love that we're hitting the plug hey plug it's your lucky day you're gonna get a little yellow on ya [Music] [Applause] Joey what the rules of yeah that's great good this is the light cover me just cuz fluorescent lights are no work but they put it in there I'm at least have prettier flirt window yeah okay so Joey here's what you're gonna do you're gonna put that on the window then you're gonna take it down then you're gonna get a little alright ain't it all round then you gotta go and paint the Sun then you're gonna paint the moons and they're gonna wave it everyone that's gonna get down on the windows so I was just sketching this in my bullet journal to practice you know here and here and then what do you think about a periscope in the center put a quarter in to like see over the cliff and then a maybe a little sign up here that says like take a closer look at what we do like invite people over to look through the window down there so chewy like [Music] oh you should see when I'm drawing go away Jen [Music] create teach like and I wrote this and you scan it in yeah create teach inspire and now it's up on the wall should be a font maker I am these are going on here to then hold the product which they used to have in here but now we like integrated to play better [Music] whoa we're doing two of these yes I want to do to them together here and then another one over there Oh Julie what I think we're done roses new ceiling tiles mean such a difference they've got storage here they can shoot videos and photos and those tables can roll around they can have kids come and visit and approve of the artwork okay ready one two three [Music] you can turn your eyes Wow so would be Wow and we did the custom sign for you guys I wrote [Music] can you see how that I have inspired on this way yes the right way and not just like hanging out somebody that's right should we bring it everyone else oh my god yeah okay one two three [Music] these are roll-down sike so you can roll the paper down and have different backgrounds you guys are awesome yay - Zeke has been accomplished I love how we've celebrated mrs. Connolly's original teacher recipe cards with the pops of yellow while also giving the team an entirely functional space with all of the staples products like bulletin boards to display their decorations ample meeting space for brainstorming and backdrops for their social content for teachers everywhere [Music] [Music] okay go can I sit down in your seat I've always wanted to be in the kitchen I'm closing creative teaching press deals we got the stripes here this is gonna be real big this year we're gonna put some stars on the stripes I'm gonna write that down in here totally nice cardigan oh thank you yes thank you 
welcome to office bull all one of these and we took you behind the scenes as we transform mr. P studios into our dream creative space this season we're hitting the road with the perfect sponsor Dee fold to make over the offices of our fellow entrepreneurs who need our help in the final episode of office goals on the road we are heading to abrams artist agency where we are making often schools happen for two important members of our team our agents Amanda and Jade who have worked with us for over six years now helping build mr. Cate into the business that we are today we get to help them pull together their lackluster personal offices as well as the green room which right now is an empty and unused office but we are going to turn it into a welcome room for the agency's clients when they come to use the digital studio and green screen room for the creation of their own content oh my gosh you guys can't believe it how do you guys define your job we look at it as really just like helping our clients grow businesses it's just a little bit different than typical talent representation you're talented but you're also a brand in a business and that's kind of how this specific department works you guys are the deal mate you're the deal maker yeah we bring in the money so the goal for today is we're gonna make over both of your offices plus we're gonna do a green room cuz you guys have a digital studio where you come in and film if you or if you're having events here you guys need like a place for a backstage area pretty dress exactly with their stuff some snacks yes let's start with our offices okay all right let's go look at your office is very woodsy are you wait where you're at sea a little bohemian you're like this is a dining team when your clients come in they sit on the bench yeah I mean if I'm taking like a one-on-one meeting in here I will but I tend to not take meetings in here for that reason probably we have identified a problem here I was feeding King Spanish you have that like one look at that whiteboard I know one of the challenges that we're gonna have in both your spaces is that this is a big corporate building so we're not gonna be able to paint the walls so we gotta figure out how to solve your issue that you have right now which is your walls are kind of empty painting the walls without painting the walls okay what do you think that means art projects art project I know it's you know there's some an area I know something might be Domino yeah we know the structure of this so that's a really healthy plan yes it is about anything in my office but we have a sort of plant that might not be doing we should show you please stop we're gonna get into these more later ladies I have a plan Oh a money tree I'm free which you guys got at the same time yes I mean this is this is like an and all five dollars worth of money tree all of the agents have a but gene is very competitive and so Jays is not dying okay so let's go there to chase winter wheat we get it your office is basic it is oh not a bad way seating we need yeah but we're gonna make it better great and let's go look here office yeah very different vibe yeah very different vibe that a man is yes hold the phone Oh God can we talk about okay vintage don't touch it it's vintage it looks disgusting sugary mountain museum not sure about that we are in fruition yes let's talk about the things that you decided to bring into your office tried to pretend like I was gonna go modern and I really didn't think about sizes oh you picked your own yeah I did and then eating wise you have a chair I want to couch but didn't get around to it hazy about the dartboard got the different money goals yes I love that there's a basketball hoop on the wall oh yeah speaking of money your money trees this probably should be the focus of my money you got that the same time America okay an exact time actually and mine is flourishing but you have another money to your itthere that's that's my assistance I also bought him a smart pot so that it grows faster than everyone else something off its all oh so you're cheating is cheating that is not cheating you also one of my favorite things I've ever seen which is a foot hammer yes what yes it's so important to Oh Mike okay you get Paul Paul oh my gosh listen listen we're gonna need a lot more than that hey you want to do business with mr. Kate I'm on the phone with someone important if you want to do business with mr. Kane you got to show me the money great future come on in guys so this is an empty room yeah the clothes rack is basically the inspiration for the entire mmm great okay let's do some art projects shall we that's it that's all we're talking about it's empty we need to me now let's do it hang out alright are you guys ready to get crafty this very big overwhelming I don't know how many stick figures I can draw on this a lot is it just gonna be like self portraits like we just yeah that would be quite okay so we have three colors here because we have three rooms right we're not allowed to paint so the solution is bring in as large of a canvas and cutter bolts to establish some color a little badass smart each crew is gonna have a canvas but in a different color so we've got color number one which obviously we we like to recycle paint guys you can use this color so what is that that's a great great great great it's like a taupe I think that one's Amanda I do too [Applause] that's me I like that one yay look at how well these also complement easier together so we're gonna leave you guys to go into plans for the rest of the rooms if you have any issues or questions just figure it out oh oh scream and then okay so I think they put that stuff in there okay let's get to work oh yeah good start okay Amanda you're doing such a good job you've covered so much of the canvas you want to try you don't try okay I got it seems like a lot I got it Oh cozy though right now they work in their offices so obviously desk is really important but they also have meetings in their offices they have new clients come in they have other agents come in and chat with them so yeah we need to provide seating in both of their rooms so we've got chairs for a manned out with a cool coffee table I know that Jade specifically said she wants a couch so we're doing a couch in Jade so it's not a thinner bench as the coffee table rub oh there's also gonna be a rug and Amanda's in Jade's case she's only gonna get one cabinet whereas in the man that she's gonna get to but Jade has her fridge so we'll Nestle the fridge right there so we'll make this sort of a little snack area storage area with cabinet floating shelf above same thing here for Amanda and little green the biggest challenge in the green room visits the sigh we really only have a room for two big chairs so we're gonna do the same kind of thing with the storage cabinets and then I'm gonna try to work in the clothing rack they out there now plants to fill in the area by the window and then we're doing a neon sign in here right yes I'm so excited about that I want to hang it down in front of the canvas which walls are the cameras going at all through this wall and jeez this wall and Amanda's and then this one's gonna go here above the cabinet this seems good great where do you want to go while they're finishing painting I'll take you anywhere in the world on our little date anywhere in the world anywhere in the world so we all die for that we're gonna go play in the digital studio that sounds ominous [Applause] [Music] patty do you want to have a picnic in front of the Eiffel Tower [Music] no but you can make a new backyard oh I get to go get you banquette can we go something's off sure make you go on the climb gone you love mountain climbing no it's already like climbing Mount Everest to

really bad thing oh my god alright good job guys thank you synchronize oh this one's just like like a cool muted grey are you ready it's a hesitation because you just don't like doing art or you're not good at it or what the above he likes to win and so if she feels like she's not the best at something I don't like if she's like not into it yeah that's actually very true thank you you know I totally understand then that is why I don't play sports at all now you guys are the money makers that's true the deal makers the money makers and you guys know that I like to do art that means something in a space that reflects the people in it what's going on and that's because oh I have the secret ingredient to today's artists about to come and she's like hiding behind you each have the same amount oh my god of mine right now it also says it's not the money it's a joke I think we should all go out and see what we can buy with this really so I love the idea of doing like a shadow box we're gonna do like a filling up of money so we're gonna take these and kinda you know give them a nice little judge and we're gonna stack them up so it'll be like a growing pile inside okay wait but it gets better it's in my back pocket well that's worth celebrating yeah I did do a pile of money in the getting kind of rough nicely in the top so get to it get to the money crumb okay [Music] Benjamin Franklin yeah yeah okay where are we out here do you need more I like I said I like it I really like more of the negative space Yeah right I really like that all right all right to tomb P bedrooms okay you're working in the other side of the building for us yeah go working in the kitchen alright so we'll finish these and then do everything else we painted the wall with one candidate all right so we know where this is going centered or that so you can just hang it up got it hey I really wish I had a voice it's really annoy I can talk low yeah but it's right in the middle holy they're gonna come try to like rescue us they're gonna think something's wrong alright so each room has a rug each room is rough we do a rug cuddle sprint but I'm gonna run to the next room [Music] Oh doh oh boy rusty lock the door [Music] [Applause] okay all right let's go finish stuff in the green room okay Wow we were taller taller than I am jelly what what is that off-road vehicle you are using on the wall that's kind of like a it looks like an ATV I've been on a quest for the past five years or so for a stud finder that actually works because I have like only three stuff on each boy and I always end up just having to go on like knocking a door because they just never work but now in Illinois that's what is serious well what does it do it'll show you plastic non-ferrous metal ferrous metal wood live electric and the wood with the nail plates or screws sounds awesome yeah what's arithmetic ferrous metal steel stud cast iron pipe nail plate screw etc non-ferrous metal copper aluminum Janet remark because this is exciting to me okay sometimes if you screw in the wrong place you could really make an expensive accident that's what she's that [Music] [Music] natural wood [Music] look at this look at this sleek modern it's actually a bench but in an office this was a great solution for coffee table because it's so narrow right because it's pretty small no I'll have the Das Kapital score and what's so cool about these giant canvas is I mean we're allowed to mount them on the wall and like bring them up yeah but if people aren't allowed to do that they could just lean them against the wall or you could like put a bench underneath and prop them up higher all right I'm gonna put whiteboards on the wall for both this room in that room yeah I'm not floating shawls we're not way to have throw pillows of course you have a throw pillows oh boy words thank you look at that look at that Anna throw blankets cozy [Music] the Lenny tree is gonna go on how new fridge

other technical items and we'll be back in the room Joey oh my gosh Joey Roger I'm making this
bed the most magical thing within what like four hours is bed the most yes we
need to make this Pinterest tumblr twinkle lights goal I don't understand
what's going on with the headboard I think she was trying to make it feel
like a daybed for the sake of budget and time we're gonna keep the bed frame keep
the mattress eise's and take away this headboard because this is just gonna
conflict with our twinkle light replacing that overhead with something
magical you ever done so with the books and all of our papers tucked away he's a
student work oh yeah we also have to paint everything yeah because this page
is just not happy our time okay guys we are really
spending the majority of our time on that bed in the room because we really
need to make it look as magical as possible but I can't let a bedroom go
without a DIY piece of art today I am doing something that's actually from the
book a hot glue gun max I need mr. Cain I'm going to do this burnt paper art and
I'm actually gonna do a little bit of a twist on it in the book I burn the paper
but keep it kind of more minimalist neutral without adding color but since
the room is so colorful I have my watercolors on hand and I'm gonna do a
wash of color over the burnt paper design this DIY does involve fire so
Boop cue the disclaimer have water on hand adult supervision we are going to
be using a lighter so lighter pot of water my watercolors for later I have a
big pad of paper here and then I of course have a frame I'm going to put my
art in after I'm sure you guys have made snowflakes before this DIY is very
similar to that idea and you can get as creative as you want with the folds
alright this is my weird little folded napkin my lot of water on hand I'm just lighting all the corners Center
poles as well so here we go all right so now this paper is fully saturated and
wet but you know what wet paper is great for watercolor paint so I'm gonna use a
big Brush because this is a big piece of paper and I really just kind of want to
do a wash of color over the papers opposed to any kind of design Julie you
look so good in here though so this is basically curtain in total we have one
two for the window three four five six seven eight nine ten I quit I can't do
tanker Joey but things like the Everest of Korean comeback Joey we are creating a DIY way to paint this
curtain rods from the ceiling the endpoint of our canopy we need its hang
from some eye hooks you know just a little screws with cooks which Joey's
putting up this wire is nice and flexible but it's also strong because
obviously we want it to stay secure to the ceiling Joey we're ready to put this up on the
ceiling okay okay watch the ceiling oh sure she put these down it's true in
the stage oh you're a my guardian angel I don't Joey I'm trying to Steve mean
okay guys the art is dry get out pretty so I'm just gonna put this behind the
mat and get it up and off okay so let's Lana is we're gonna run
into me the lights down at the back and then up over and across to this broader
and a wraparound so they're nice and secure that we're gonna use these
handles to cover them up they're gonna run underneath if you're gonna be
plugging in a bunch of twin blades plug them all into a power strip so when we
leave for the day you can just switch them off going wow what a beautiful
feeling okay here's the thing I'm not crazy
about fire safety but I'm paranoid I'm paranoid even though these are LED and
they're like low power they're probably completely other
percent fine I'm screwing this little eye hooks into the wall I'm stealing it
so that's from the fabric I do appreciate your parents all right very okay
natural fiber for our bohemian queen flip it Oh
some of you asking the colonics what is a rule out putting a rug over carpeting
and the key is just to make sure that is a heavy rug and thick rug either a shied
or an axial fiber like this that doesn't pucker and buckle and if you're gonna
put a rug over a rough that means you got a real lady into the rug cut off
usually only reserved for old do you have magical bed deserves a real cuddle
area see where I want to show it do you see through the Big Dipper of shushing
right there down here's a tip guys leave the tags on as you style your throw
pillows make sure you like the look first before you remove them nothing says welcoming colorful room
like a little bowl of candy guys when you are styling a daybed especially one
where you don't have bedside tables a tray is like an essential thing the
little candies color in a little mug and just some napkins alright guys so I
think we're done what do you think I just love how this all came together
fully brightened up the room with the white walls we brought in more
established furniture that's more size appropriate she had a really small desk
before we found one to fit perfectly in the speech that really feels now like a
little study nook away from the bed we've got the beautiful credenza with
the doors so that all that clutter that she saw before on your bookshelves
stowed away behind doors yeah we don't see it anymore
we mounted her TV I really love the DIY artwork I think it brings like a pattern
that you kind of see happening over here over to this wall let's just have a more
this bed we created such magic with the twinkle lights and the fabric that was
key right these curtains diffusing the twinkle
light so you don't know right away that they're just holiday lights that you can
buy really inexpensively so this whole project you could do for like 150 bucks
we will plan over in the cords to bring in some greenery over there and I love
the curry with beer I mean I just love everything more importantly I really
hope that too laughs it Joey went to go get her Oh
souls are so much sorting in your log that recently aside where there's all
kinds of shells in there move your books you can put clothes in there whatever be
on the wall I know it's Mountain the walls are different colors I think they
were beige before me and even though you love color I wanted this to be the star
yeah and like brightens up but yeah room and I DIY that right there I just want
to be home it was a tree there's clutter when you aren't bad you want ideally
you're like oh yeah look now you have a tray to eat your my good grown up robot still maintaining
myself yeah this magical blessings sandglass whoa I don't know like my

previously on OMG without house we are starting demolition today this is like been so long making rock those are old contractors on this project there's not a big moment I'm so excited to be rid of this place what happens that I have to go at some point in there I can't go in there it's just a porta potty all right so we'll go pick up the tile tomorrow [Music] [Music] can't wait to decorate

million subscribers and also don't forget with every 100,000 additional subscribers we get we will be donating a thousand dollars to charities that help find homes for people in need so I mean it's all worth it and watch us get some tile let's tile it up Thailand style let's go Joey Wow oh my god this is hexagon this is what I want for the kitchen floors this is real like marble this is expensive the original bathroom we have those little tiny mosaic hexagons I want to like honor that the tile is the biggest part of the renovation that we're doing because this is really where we're establishing the pattern the tone I found a place rock mill tile and stone in Los Angeles they have exactly what Kate's looking for took a hard deadline my mom's coming to town with my two little nephews right now we don't even have a guest room because everything from the cabinets in the kitchen are shoved into the guest room and it's all taped off so we have two weeks to complete this project last-minute tile the floors last-minute countertops last-minute backsplash a lot of last-minute stuff hey are you doing good I'm Joey Joey meet John Clark hi Clark hey Mark is here and he is our beacon of hard surfaces we just called it about the cement tile oh yeah so basically they're everything it's everything I want it spotted one right away that has tones of gray in it I knew that I wanted to incorporate cement tile into our kitchen and bathroom it is an old-school way of making tile so it honors the sort of old-world history of our house oh my gosh go ready what do you mean looked it up online okay I'm a designer an old thing so normally tile has a long ish lead time we don't have time for a lead time yeah we we stock these okay a lot of times when you're buying these materials in bulk you have to order them with a lead time because they don't just have stacks and stacks of tiles I'm taking it as a personal challenge to be able to find things that I love that are only available now most of these patterns are in stock really yeah you get buy them today and pick them up tomorrow this is a historical tile so it's made all over the world what they do is they create a mold from metal and then they mix the individual colors and they'll pour it into each slot by hand let it dry and take the mold out and you have the encaustic test so the color goes down in about a quarter inch deep these were made in Vietnam Oh why is it called French and caustic tile it's part of the history of the tile because I was looking at that it that was really popular in England it's popular all over the world we have an English storybook house so I'm gonna play up the English popularity I think Henry the eighth like them we also like women and I like any wives so we're not totally trying to be like him but like and then I want that one must must that one yeah yeah now we're back ordered on that one no I am sorry Fleur I know that'll be in in September did you eat it's out of stop are you kidding I'll go to Vietnam okay so will sending it no do you guys do countertops too it was just so pretty this marble I really want marble but it's so expensive we've always talked about how cool would be to have marble surfaces in our place but marble so expensive so temperamental you have to maintain it it can stay and it can etch so it's better to go with the porcelain porcelain marble yes it's imitation marble what is it like small tile no no they're big slabs - shut up ten feet by five feet oh my god I need to see who what kiss your slab porcelain marble is here today Clarke is telling us that there's this new stock that is porcelain slab I've never even heard of it if the old needs new it's perfect lead the way all right oh my gosh is this it this is it so it's a porcelain slab someone's slab it's 1/4 inch thick and you can use it for countertops and use it for countertops wait is this Calcutta this is the Calcutta I want that one how is the durability compared to like quartz longer than quartz this can even go outside yes he is so loud she's like pushing the sales guy who does she think she is would this work with undermount sinks you can't do undermount sinks but it's a little trickier so we have up we have a farmhouse sink for our kitchens that'll work you can't do rounds really for a sink you yeah you need a you need a square where you have the sink oh we did this backwards learn from our mistakes people I mean I'm standing on it right now so it's just fragile in like the fabrication install perfectly fine if Kate jumps up on the counter no problem me I don't jump I'm not like you know kid Diaz your cocoa boots get up there yeah whoa there Clark it's like a sacred place you're yelling let's seek why is it sacred got it can we get this now yes fantastic done okay moving on four floors awesome countertop good oh you were cut from a mountain I feel your energy I'm getting kind of like a fake version of you but one day you and I will unite small mosaic you know like a wall what shape a third floor hexagon hexagon Oh easy it's right here so for the kitchen floors I want to honor the tradition of hexagon tiles in the original 1927 bathroom in our house being a little bit of a modern edge by doing a dark grout line you're a dirtball like us do a colored grout it'll help you out no you're a dirt pile you're cute small a little dirt ball you're my little dirt ball ever see this size for our master bathroom floors because I want to stay true to like 1927 I like all white of those the tile the bathrooms gonna seamlessly go into the shower whereas before we had a step up now it's just a one flat surface which is gonna make the whole place feel a little bit nicer oh wait you guys I saw it takes about a week to get those can you rush it yes so you can rush it to help but we can we can shake on that I'll have it delivered to the job site tomorrow yeah oh my god we go from a week to tomorrow we came for um we're paying for it all right we're gonna have a full car can we check out let's check out Clark we don't got any time to spare right I guess I will be making some phone calls finding another place in LA that has in stock black and light and cost a child hi I was just looking on your website that you have the Fez style and caustic tile do you have that in stock okay amazing do you have the there's like a black and white Fez it's called Fez I need like like 104 square feet it's for shower you have it no my gosh okay I want to buy it like right like right now this is such good news you guys it's meant to be there's this other place that had black and white and caustic French tile which will be really cool with the mosaic tile that's going on the bathroom floor project tile and countertop done Wow [Music] you're like this should be like the next jewelry collection all made of these later what hi Riley ring poem Hut septum you're not even looking we're just putting quick-set down you just use your trowel to make sure it's not just a big glob because you want there to be some air in between the little levels spacers the spacers come in different sizes we picked a bigger spacer around a 3/16 so that you'll be able to really see that gray grout in between oh yeah that's that's plenty Joey I'm adding as I go you put the dough on the floor and you give it a smearing now you take it the thing with the comb each side and you make a nice pattern I'm better at this control yes let's look at the backsplash tile encaustic Tyler hand poured molds and they pour the different colors of clay or in this case cement down into the mold so the pattern like goes down rather than being a painted oh yeah yeah and then in the 20s they use mosaic tile we've got the old english and the 1920s when our house was actually built happening together and then we're going to have the Calcutta porcelain on the countertop did you know that there was a freaking flyswatter right here oh I thought it's like flash broken would have been helpful many times once I've using a magazine when a fly comes in the air you you use my magazines we had the poopoo palace and we're gonna actually put an arch on this little walkway to make it match the arch theme that's going on throughout the house we're going to make a base cabinet where where the litter is going to go in a nice countertop the lining machines used to share the poopoo room with the cat's litter but now we are moving those to the interior closet so it's going to be a really nice chic laundry room on its own all right into the back oh wow happening I know you're sitting with it we're gonna sit on a toilet and look at the shower how crazy is it that that's the old exterior wall of the house purple we used to live in a purple house all right let's look at this tile very cute so creamy I love it when it's on the mesh to such an easy installation these are the small hex tiles actually come in sheets so you don't have to install each individual tile which is really helpful classic floor tile a classic mosaic like another bathroom we have the mosaic know we have to go pick it out I literally have called every single tile place this is more encaustic tile yeah it's called Fez can you use it in a shower yeah we have to seal it with a impregnating sealer so you asked her if we can use that tile in the shower guys I literally looked at this picture online and order them off the picture on the phone here's hoping they look good when they get here it's gonna be a loud corner but it will be cool because like all of our fixtures and accent pieces are really cool pieces so when you look in the shower rooms like dang dang oh you know what's gonna be so cool is the seamless floor yeah the fact that like it's just gonna be all one level into the shower yeah versus we had that big step before yeah you're gonna take a shower with me thank you Joey already showered this morning you think we both feel to fit in our new small showers rain head all gonna be amazing I'm just gonna imagine shower because like you make things happen by imagining them it's small but good things come in small packages right oh my god do that oh my god underneath it is like an ivory and I want to go white with the house the original color was like a no-no oh I know this color at the house no or this color no you also have to get a window the other thing that's happening in the bathroom is we are removing those two sad little tiny weird frosted windows that we're in and we're gonna put a much bigger single window Joey turn the water off what it's too hot we're in the shower scene yeah yeah and I don't get the fighting okay get me I'm washing my so wash my back got it I feel very showered you're excited about those floors mm-hmm can you take the glasses off please mmm okay fine I'm so excited about those tiles and I'm really glad that we found the other encaustic tiles I can't believe we got it all as quickly as we got it I know I mean most people are waiting like months for that stuff when you put your mind to it you can do anything exactly like subscribing to our Channel and helping us being a part of our family we're gonna try to get to a million subscribers by the end of the year someone's gonna win a $10,000 room transformation with every new hundred thousand subscribers will donate a thousand to charities

I don't even know what I just said ok! You guys saw those beautiful floors we put in the white walls the white painted rock Ceiling those with shingles or gym  is like trick down now We got our prx performance system like the treadmill we built an amazing hotel gym in our garage But we still wanted to be multifunctional We want to be able to go out there and sit out there because it's just a really beautiful spot in our back yard be like an indoor outdoor yard to hang out in when we have people over countertop seating area a Seashell Hybrid workout chill area Definitely want to have a conversation area in there, and we've been loving working out here. So yeah now. We need a place to like sit and enjoy But also like if I want to just come out and put my feet up and watch a game Whatever happens, but yeah, I feel come on put your feet up watch Some reality TV. All right we have less you countertops No, let's put the crystals on before any furniture because we're gonna be up on the ladder Oh he can again alright so from the glorious vintage Whitewashed Ceilings that are going on in here Gonna hang our chandelier It's actually the chandelier that we used to have in our dining room for in here We just had to have it rewired and retain so that it can hang lower There's so many, Little Doodads on the chandelier wipe these off You you you know real life. I want to go Joey's putting on the cups to the chandelier I think my job's hard that's not a good look for you If you think your job is too hard, why are you singing now? Wait, gilly we need our fear mana you guys remember we put up in our dining room like what three years ago these finger condoms Are killing my circulation can you just please appreciate how beautiful? Mrs., please appreciate how purple my thumb's are those little finger condoms to put on the crystals make sure they ain't get any fingerprints well I don't know where the finger condoms are still practicing unsafe crystals All right, you know this channel is Gonna get pregnant here Some work some don't I don't know we're just testing some matching it looks like some bolts Go out at different times And you trying to get the matching ones joey these were the bows who were in there this bull was too big This bulb is too small this bulb is just right. I mean you guys know how it is It's it's difficult to always be matching My eyebrows don't match why do my chandelier bulbs have to match? We have so many crystals to do good because I have plenty of stuff to do why I mean crystals. Don't worry scoville trees Yes, trading. Go trees Gladly Joey can go do this fine. I? Have no idea where the instructions are for the chandelier swinging no idea where exactly the crystals are supposed to go It's hot hazard Crystal extra again This is a really fun job though guys dealing these crystal They're faceted and so beautiful and they create those prisms rainbows on the wall like I'm very okay with this job. It's a pretty Chic setup for a gym think it's such a beautiful contrast the ross ceiling and then we have this like Bellini chandelier it is quintessential juxtaposition You walk into a gym. You see a chandelier, and you know those people mean business But the one thing you guys aren't seen today. Which is something. I think we're gonna do is install a whole wall of mirrors we're gonna have a cut the mirror company come in and Install it so that it's all fitting perfectly around the already installed weight machine that'll eventually have like one of those full walls and mirrors so you can see yourself pump and iron and Kate can see yourself dancing, so while Kate finishes putting on the crystals. I'm gonna get the little countertop Kitchenette area Thingy you don't really need anything like a sinker stovetop or anything like that back here It's more so just to have the surface style and use and the storage inside the drawers in the cabinets, and then of course The fridge that is basically Gonna be where Kate's drink fridge is Gonna Go because it's too far for her to go inside to get a cold beverage She has to have a drink fridge in the back also, eucalyptus towels because I just really want that it's cool. I'll enjoy it She's gonna put eucalyptus towels in it. She'd better be the one restocking those Waited oh, I love that medium gray tone. We don't really need like a big normal-sized countertop So I got some shallow depth cabinets that come with legs you can adjust and level thank God because guys this is garage is Totally unlevel I mean it was built almost a hundred years ago and things settle especially with earthquakes and stuff like that There's about a million problems That have to be solved with this whole situation 1 million That was very accurate I like about what it said a little bit. I'll get it Don't really want to be putting anything on a sloped countertop. So thankfully Joey will be able to level it out You wanted the big the big the big man or Jammer Which throws everything off you mean the big fridge? Yeah? This is hardly a bank, but There was a smaller one that would have fit. Why are you telling me this like I didn't plan this entire thing with you Well I plan this butcher. I just want to show you what I'm doing. Yeah, please Joey You're doing I built a really cute little stand for the fridge so that it all evens out I'm Gonna Let the fridge you slide in the cute stand And you pick it up a little bit more. Well, they're wobbly I'm gonna kind of cut tetris this fridge situation cuz it's a different size and the cabinets go back to your stay I'm gonna make a custom toe kick. That's gonna go under the cabinets and then kind of duck down under the fridge It's that way the top of everything is pretty level I got some solid wood for a countertop that I'm just gonna cut down to size Shelley Yeah, you asked me to help you and I are still measuring I got stuff to do Any in a countertop with 69 inches wide by 16 inches deep so I'm just gonna measure that up clamp down some straight edges So that I can get a straight cut on them for this guys I want to make sure there's no Nick's or gouges in it because you want to be a really clean edge So I actually got a finished blade. It makes a finer cut so you have less Imperfections in the cut and I'm also Gonna use some painters tape to just Take down on what I'm cutting just in case because it'll keep everything flat while the sauce going over it and will minimize any extra splinters that might happen Yeah, you saw it. I saw it here first. Are you anchoring this to the wall? Yes? I'm Asking scatter top is good A little kitchenette this is perfect We got one thing of cabinet doors that have drawers inside And then another bank of shelves and they've got the cabinet doors on them and they're a beautiful kind of medium gray tone which is playing off the grays that are in the Bamboo floors that we have the Eco-friendly sustainable Bamboo floors and the floating shelf to be grave, you could do that too sir. Thank you Yes, I got work to do a sea shelf. I'm gonna decorate Do you do a conversation? Like you know where you can get cozy. Yeah This is the first area to do a little seating setup Yes, of course area rugs are perfect to designate space So there's really soft shag rug with some splashes of color in it is the perfect thing to center a seating area around what? You oh my gosh, just small little rug in the world oh Like a you rat joey sees a rug and it's time I guess for a tunnel kate thought she could get away with rolling out a rug Yeah me I mean and especially a small cute rug like that like good. You're my small. That's a small run I'm coming in okay, but he's so sweaty. I mean it. We haven't installed the air conditioning out here and yet How about we do blow me away? He wants me to blow one on him. He wants me to blow on him So there's literally a rug cut all this was Marta's like a rug pass out with Joey. Just squawking at me It's beautiful. It feels good - we could stretch on this rug this could be our stretch I want to make this rug better is if this room wasn't 90 degrees so I gotta finish putting that Acs ah? Get on up Joey you got an easy-To-install It's California. It can get toasty we're gonna go ahead and bring in some temperature control when you don't have central A/c You have a couple options one of them is a window unit kind of an eyesore They take up a window But what you can also do is you can do these? Wall-mounted units that are also gonna be a lot stronger than those window units, and they're just a little bit cheaper They kind of are more up out of the way, so I found this cool brand online called Mr.. Cool. My eman I was like you're Mr.. Cool, Mr.. Kay, and they sent me one I'm gonna try putting it on it supposed to be pretty easy to just mount on the wall so the Ac that comes with a very long amount of refrigerant cooling Electrical wire all the stuff that's in the little Thing clearly I have no idea ones. I'm out. Okay. Don't let it bend. Just feed it through Okay, well it's loose. You have to feed it through though I just feed it through as I'm pulling push it like let that side of your hands holding fall onto the bike I mean, it's it's not gonna unfurl like you're gonna have to unfurl it on the other side okay, just Put it through the hole okay push it through push Okay, well do so go fix it. Go is it Done Ben. Oh? It's just gonna mount onto the wall on the mounting bracket that we've screwed into the studs now. We will be able to have Climate-controlled work out some of the Ac you know they're around a really simple floating shelf So that way we can put some plants and stuff by the window But a bing bada boom but a shelf so this shelf is perfect a little low profile moment I can style it and have some design elements over there alright, so around the world. We're do it's really cool furniture We got our blue. I think they're like velvety Kate probably those it's like a micro suede Fabric kind of velvety they have a nice high back So they're really like comfy to sit in it can place them wherever you want No conversation area is complete without a little table something to set your drinks on this cocktail table is perfect just a little round lacquered white top within a wire kind of Geometric base that has some airiness some negative space going through it. It's just it's perfect for the flow of the space I Get to stock the fridge. I have an array of coconut water Some protein dreams you know things you might want on hand while you're working out refreshments the letter the water fridge Remember Lemon Wanna, remember how much joey loves on the motor here cup of coffee me, too, okay? I don't drink coffee You are what do you drink lemon water? Lemon water, it's my thing in this house. I want it to feel really like you're walking into a Five-Star resort just take water and lemon, but you got to cut up just right They're gonna start selling my lemon water some omg lemon water Call it : gem ins oh N oh My lemons so to prep our chilled scented eucalyptus towels I am just saturating some clean white washcloths and of course I'm doubting this water with a lot of drops of essential oil Just going to saturate the towels and wring them out and then roll them up and put them in our beautiful fridge to chill Do you want us to keep any? chicken in the fridge All right, okay on top of the countertop I'm just gonna style some plants beautiful vases crystals you guys know I have an obsession with Crystals this amethyst is So gorgeous. It's honest, and it's just as such good vibes I need to have a crystal nearby on the cocktail table and placing some really awesome coasters These are like black and white striped marble I love bringing in a little bit of the graphic element because we do have so much black of the Exercise equipment around I don't want to ignore that fact so bringing in little bits of black and white kind of justifies those other Necessary black elements that we in the gym. I love to meditate I really honestly don't do it as much as I would like to and I feel like it's also because I don't have that perfect Place so this pouf is a hoop of my dreams because it isn't a floor poop where you're like Just supposed to put your feet on it, or you know sit around like a lower table. This is like a giant Poop and it's braided jute fabric looks really durable, so obviously we can sit on it while we're working out as well We can move it around It's really like lightweight, but I'm just gonna add some little fuzzy things cozy things and you better see me meditating on there I love the yoga mats easily accessible too because we can take them and go out onto the pergola and do some outdoor yoga on a beautiful day so that an array of Planters these are all indoor planters beautiful tones of green and kind of bluey teal and a sort of dark Grey we're going to set this big palm on the stand and that's going to be in the corner oh This gold cactus face is the cutest thing ever you guys know I like things that have a little sense of humor one small this little old Cactus when you pop plants in a pot that doesn't have a Drainage hole you want to make sure you put some rocks down at the beach Because that aerates the soil and creates drainage so that your plant won't get all waterlogged and Moldy once I fill up the potting soil around these plants. I'm also placing some decorative rocks on top I just really like that look for indoor plants because you're gonna have the exposed dirt And it's just like a it's a more finished look I loved wall hangings because it's an alternative to a framed piece of art or photograph, so this wall hanging. It's great It's an woven it's got our accent color of the dark blue With a little bit of the white which you see on the walls, and it's just a nice soft texture Amongst all of the other like harder workout equipment. It's just bringing in a little softness waiting in the color Palette back there All the grays weights. It's kind of like box Hands color Palette We might put mirrors behind The treadmill as well and do a molding piece like we might kind of do an L shape of mirrors but for now I want to put a framed piece of art on the wall just something that has a little Text reminder of what the space is supposed to represent for us which really is relaxation and health I'm taking this beautiful handmade piece of paper It is just a deep blue it has texture on it And then I'm taking the wall paint that we use just a pure white wall paint and a brush. I'm just doing a cursive breathe lowercase cursive It's a very obvious just reminder to breathe. Oh, you're working out That's always good, and yeah, one-hit wonder because I don't have another piece of paper it's just be nice to open those doors in the morning and see the sign I love it. I love it against this darker blue color It's bringing kind of our Accident blue color over to that corner of the room so and I just leave it there I don't know if we're Gonna do mirrors There for now.

coming over oMG Wakko and we are about to get so Wakko today we are at the boss girl's office aka the Holy Trinity Grey's albick mamrie Hart and Hannah Hart oh I mean like YouTube royalty Queens Queens I'm so excited I'm such a fan of all of them I respect all of them so much they're all such hard workers so for them to entrust us with their office space is just it's big it's a big deal really big guys if you haven't seen our other own Zuko's make sure and check them out and also subscribe cuz there's so much more awesome stuff coming your way yeah make sure to check out their channels but first let's get into this bit into I mean we asked our studio it's so crazy oh my god oh my god no hi my name is mamrie Hart I have a youtube channel called you deserve a drink my name is Hannah Hart and I have a show called my drunk kitchen hi I'm grace Alden I've YouTube channel called its grace together we're best friends who share an office that needs yeah our office is not like a better word cute yeah it's for lack of many words a giant trash can it's not the most inspiring space we apparently avoid it it's kind of like a physical representation of a hangover Wow what is this place we liked it because we all spent time in New York and it feels kind of New York LA yeah that's the potential to be a really cool hip office space but right now I've kind of used it just more of its like a storage facility yeah it's just a glorified closet we should a ton of stuff in our own homes and I think we all had like the mutual concern of wanting to be able to separate our houses from where we do most of our production so this was supposed to be office slash production space slash another reason for us to spend time in the same physical space together oh I totally get it when you're an entrepreneur it's hard to like have those designated lines I really like all of you so much and I'm having to channel three personality usually it's just one personality that I'm kind of trying to vibe with and like decorate but the fact that you guys each have to shoot your own individual videos in here and work in here I'm telling you it's been a challenge [Applause] little expectations that you guys can just take out our garbage we'd be like thank you Oh goals our office space shooting space meeting space basically like take us seriously as business women space well it's still a little storage yeah I have a giant inflatable penis that I have just dying to get out of it you guys have a name for this space we were calling it in vanity farts for a minute manatee farts on three yeah so the first project we're gonna do with the girls is painting we have all the plastic laid out oh my god can only mean one thing my wrestling r1 wall that we can pretty much paint in this entire room because everything else is brick we're not going to be painting brick because once you paint brick it's pretty hard to get it back to its natural state okay so we are gonna paint three different shapes on this wall have this idea to do these geometric shapes behind white boards but I don't want to tell them that the white boards are gonna go over these are gonna be those cool glass stand off white boards cause it's kind of good for them to have low expectations cuz I don't know move even better when they see it trust me it's gonna be cool the shapes are just a baby that's gonna develop into an adult you know uh I was not prepped to make babies this is the baby they're only scheming this project to like age four but by the time it's all said and done this is gonna be a full-grown adult it's gonna feel like an adult space I actually don't really know what I'm saying my mom never had the sex talk with me and now I'm thinking you probably shouldn't have the sex talk with your kids so we're gonna make three shapes the center one's going to be bigger the two side shapes are gonna be a little bit smaller our three colors are here they're nice muted tones so we're looking at three paint colors a very very flattering pink a blue and like a gray white uh-huh yeah it's a very muted sophisticated Americana theme oh yeah I find them Pleasant but not intrusive I would never ever have chosen colors like this either what are you guys hacking from here yeah this has been like a big problem since we actually moved it so we're gonna do a straight line at the bottom when you use painters tape it doesn't always give you a clean cut line the trick is painting first with the original wall color Wow filled in any bleeds that could potentially happen with the other color and then you'll go over with other and then you'll have one quit line thankfully you guys have the white wall color so we are taping off these shapes now what's really cool is we're just using the laser level to get a nice straight line at the bottom and then we're going up on right angles on the side but then on the side pieces we are just going a little creative weirdos cockeyed hannah and grace are giving each other paint tape jerseys oh are you getting wings yeah yeah she's getting a version of wings I don't know what she's doing but I've heard a lot of ripping her a number one I'm just inspired by these abstract shapes so we're painting over the tape line it's going into whatever areas would bleed and sealing up those bleed areas so we can go over with our beautiful muted tones and we're gonna get nice crisp geometric sheets so here's the big decision what color where I kind of like the white pink blue let's do it okay and then I like to lead you into the room like they remember it yeah in our Moines I don't know a lot memory that made perfect art it goes [Music] I'm having a hard time conceptualizing what the end product of these geometric shapes is going to be and it's a real trust exercise because some we just painted a bunch of shapes on our wall all right the next project we're doing with the girls I'm so excited about this is hilarious you guys can't kind of warned us that there would be a hands-on DIY project inevitably in our future but we've got our hands not our hands okay so don't worry there's fun stuff going but on behind your Dola we just gotta find that you guys would like a nice blue tarp wall like for a shooting background or something yeah I think it looks great I always love to do personalized art and a space because well multiple reasons one you don't have to get clearance you may be yourself we get to individualize and have it be something original and also something that you can work on together and count the question is is are you down we're down no really guys yeah well I was English I mean I could represent their sense of humor because they're also hilarious and they also just laugh so much when they're together so we thought a funny piece of art and what's funnier than fun yeah that is so true we all have them and there are butts on this wait a minute are we actually gonna differ but some paint and then put them on this campus [Music] we were trying to figure out something fun and quirky to do on a big canvas and Gaeta had the genius idea of making them do butt prints I can't believe that we're painting with our bus yeah and this is coming from three people that have done some of the dumbest things on the Internet today in the last seven or eight years of us creating content and still today somehow Kate and Joey were able to make us feel uncomfortable I personally expect you all to just go bare if you're if you're too much of a wuss no you have these beautiful leggings there or we also got disposable leggings if you can but how do you get the pain off your butt you got it we have towels or water water I'm ready to put on the most flattering leg wear of all time white leggings on the dr. game hallelujah yes thank you I'm so excited this is so weird and so fun I would personally go full butt to the campus but then that would be pretty gross and you might have some butt hair on the campus if they don't want to put paint on their bare asses which I totally understand we have some you know very cheap leggings on hand they can wear so this is like a charcoal gray so not a black black I love when you're painting with your but you want to be subtle yeah I think we roll okay on everyone spot which I feel like will be a nice bonding experience let's do it Lissa for sure I know I would go on the cheat oh great oh boys are out exactly Mary is painting my butt and it's so cold and wet and I have to say I never thought that this would be something that we shared as an experience as friends I don't hate it I know it's not the words I never went to theater camp but I feel like this is a trust exercise and we're in why is it this way paint each others butts with paint and then in a synchronized dance stick our butts onto a canvas one two three and let's see the masterpiece it's like a Scandinavian inspired minimalist butt print I think three is good I think negative space is good I think have so much brick this is our nice patch of like clean white here yeah actually I think we should kick them out yeah yeah rub our BOTS so now this is the time when they make us leave and we don't get to see anything until it's completely done which is really nerve-racking yeah I'm gonna be hiding in the bushes for the next couple hours so best of luck Kate it's a big space and you've only got one afternoon you're a little person all right so all right lots of the roster do I think we should uh dinosaur mm-hmm what's that for Bronte no okay all right we have to move oh this is a long room I know no it'sit's no joke I think we should divide and conquer I agree so I'm gonna deal with finishing this wall okay so whiteboards on here the glass whiteboards on here the sconces sconces write me Murray's bar flagging layover at floating shelf above we got rub couch but art side chairs etc I'm not doing all of that you want me to do all that when you're trading one dinosaur I mean it's there's lots of uh contours take a well at least have the white boards and the lights up by the time you get back I thought it would be really fun to spray-paint brontosaurus gold don't worry I got main reason and so I'm priming it with white primer and then springing it over with gold look at those haunches oh you love blood chest and I'm doing the same thing to the basketball hoop Anna pinned a basketball hoop when they were sending me there like inspo images and I was like okay of course I love the idea of having little moments of fun and humor throughout the speech what we're doing on this wall is we have three different sized whiteboard we have one that's really big that's going to go in the middle you have two smaller ones and we're going to mount them to the wall with standoffs screw em on boom done they have these sort of just basic commercial light bulbs where the sconces are so we're going to get rid of those and put a new really cool sconces that just bring it a little bit of personal Flair they're going to continue to dress up this wall it's going to be a really cool space got it yeah all right so to finish this piece of artwork we're just going to make that wood frame trim it's just a really simple way of cleaning up these canvases in such minimalist but in the room we are moving in this amazing rug Wow look at this rug I know this rug is so gorgeous okay I love the muted tones were really playing with muted tones in here again trying to kind of pull away from that really saturated brick color hand-made wool rug Wow let's be expensive why do you have to see because I want to know if I'm gonna have an expensive rug cut or not I'll take you on a date I mean it's a nice rug okay got it for a great price let me take you on a nice night it's a nice nice rug date here we go away I wasn't mentally prepared for this I wanted to see the rug but I always forget that we have a rug cuddle don't resist ah because all right hmm you can smell the natural the masking wall shut up it does it's like see you let's go we've waited I'm giving you love eyes [Music] oh we have this really cool pink couch that is both funky and fun looking but also really nice quality really comfortable oh wow I mean this has to be my dream couch I don't have to say it this is my dream couch it's so soft and it has tufting on the bottom but clean lines like mid-century dreams come true the coffee table is a marble slab coffee table with brass legs very minimalist but really heavy just a nice piece to anchor this conversation area I am so excited about these odd numbers right 1 2 3 oh my gosh these accent chairs they look like kiss it like Liz but they're blue and they're velvet and they are pleated and they have brass legs and they're just dream clouds breathless yeah I love how these sheep turned out yeah do you love that amazing whoever hung those whiteboards in a really good job very straight brink good job good job all right so let's bring in the desk and so yeah so we have the countertops that are gonna need desks and then the file cabinets drawers storage they requested storage let's do it yeah okay so oh wait what I don't want to drive with the fell apart all right so we're reading the countertop dust and the way that we are anchoring these is with drawer yunus they're just a really light gray and it's really easy to put in these counter top desk we're just gonna lay them over the top tada they are stabilized and then you're putting trash cans in between yeah I have like little cute little trash cans to go in between these chairs are awesome they're so cool-looking they are comfortable and functional they wanted more comfortable office chairs so this is the perfect blend of mixed modern styling these des is really easy I'm just placing a few personal items like their books they all like books it's so cool some really cool dry erase markers and erasers and of course some personal touches a picture of the three of them on Hannah's desk and a feather pen and then I have one final touch plan for brontosaurus when I was looking at her I was very inspired by her very long neck and I thought a rhinestone choker just put really flatter her aspect all right so I'm mounting a three roll paper psyche on a ceiling and basically it's going to give them options for different colors you know when you see people doing videos and they're sort of in front of just like a solid background color a lot of times what they're doing is using one of these they can change out the colors as they go if they want to try something else and it's just got a really cool like pulley system on so you can raise and lower these sykes it keeps it all organized very pro very cool I think it'll be really functional for them over in the corner we are placing the round marble table what was their sort of conference room table all right solid it yep so Center under the light yeah yeah I know it's really nice it was that crazy house I think what we're gonna do is we're gonna make this corner the area where they can like eat Mora's like a dining area because it's next to the kitchen so over this dining table I'm gonna swag this awesome gigantic chandelier Gold long dust real looking it's just perfect it's gonna also put a lot of light in this corner because this is a dark corner because there's no windows over here okay like placing this chair it's really [Music] grace actually requested a barber chair we scoured Craigslist we found this one it was yellow it had like slash marks in it it's vintage we got it reupholstered and now it is just this beautiful piece she asked for a barber chair here it is customary upholstered so that is going to go on the white bike on a free round rug side table plant zebra mugs oh yes zebra mugs and I want to style this with the white rolled down I'm just gonna hand paint a hanging plant on the white side I just love the idea the paper backdrop phrase can do whatever she wants she can paint on that and establish like a cool scene and then what's so great as they just cut it off roll down a fresh new piece this is about where we want the eyes to start right yeah yeah I like cascading down yeah on the wall we're gonna put a really cool neon sign we're just gonna mount that to the brick and now we have our dining area ah see you it just looks so cool in that corner now like that corner has just taken on an entirely new life in memories corner we're building her bar set up because she does all these videos with her bar setup which is really great this piece is just epic okay it's glass on the front so she could like write on the front with a whiteboard marker she wanted to like list her menus and this can become her desk with this really awesome stool when all those tools so pretty if she can sit here work on her laptop and then obviously also have her videos shot here as well I am accenting the bar with vintage glassware at course like a nice little ice chest and then behind the bar we have a floating shelf with Joey put up thank you into the brick not easy and then on top of that I'm putting a handwritten you deserve a drink that of course is named Ray's a book title and I think just also a good sentiment to welcome people in and then of course Montessori it has to make an appearance here on the shelf with her choker [Music] so this office space came with like sort of a little bit of a kitchenette setup they had like a counter top with some base cabinet kitchen needed to be pulled together it was just kind of like a crop collector kitchen and you know Hannah does a lot of cooking videos and so what we're gonna do is we're gonna sort of build this out for her to be her set look Joey I really often quote shout out to the trier this is something that Hannah said we got this really cool kitchen island it's got a stainless steel countertop on we also can move around for ease of filming and it also has a butcher block that you can put up so that it can become like a counter table so you can pull up stools or just have extra surface area look at this vintage copper saucepan isn't it cool heck are these balls oh oh my god I'm obsessed with these Joey give me what are they they're those great they're on driftwood and they're the like acrylic grapes I have been wanting to use this for so long and now I can because we are in the kitchen so I'm just dialing that with some other pots and stuff like that yeah this part is looking pretty awesome I know chef station is complete without her super cool cutting board and sharp knife so probably my favorite part of this room is actually not in the main room they have this side room that they were using as their like conference room / dining area this adjacent room is the perfect place for a dressing room they have those two armed laws which are chock-full of costumes we're going to lay down a nice furry rug put in a dresser we brought in a little vanity stool we have a beautiful round minimalist mirror above there a storage bench in the middle it just makes it feel more like a closet when there's like a little ottoman a floating shelf which of course we're going to style with some of their cute weird things and then just some other little accessories I also drew this other little champagne glass so I drew that little thing and we framed it and yeah this quote I love this is from mamrie which is if I can pop a birth control pill you can pop an allergy pill but I just love that there's little elements of humor throughout a beautiful space the last element we're doing in this room which is kind of the most epic element in my opinion is the golden basketball hoop they call me mr. Golden Boy baller with this Kiwi lover this may be the coolest thing we've done to date you walk in and you see a freaking gold basketball hoop in the middle of room I know I love that mirror come show me your basketballs go air dribbling she's great at air dribbling fourth quarter nine seconds ago Keith brings down ball down the court Subaru's shoot I lived [Music] oh it's time to reveal a little girls I'm so excited this was a really tough room I know Kate's been super stressed about this room she's been waking up at night freaking out but I think she did an amazing job oh my god they make us close our eyes to walk into the room which first of all with our trust issues already this is insanity yeah I'm so nervous but also not that nervous I'm just nervous that I'm gonna mess it up Diane's walking into cuz she wants to see the space she's gonna be working in the space with them oh my god oh my god the guy one two [Music] [Applause] [Music] welcome to the boss girl's office Oh Oh oh my god it feels so cute Oh creaking I'm my hands I god I gotta try sitting in one of these oh yeah this is a chance I love it directly under the sunlight also did you see that this plant is beautiful give a plant a snake yeah yeah we take care of it RIA Polster but look so I won't be cool come back here like you're sitting and look how cute our whole offices we look like actual adult Wow my God look so professional oh my god oh my god obsess 50 70s glass great [Applause] there's a little arm then you're looking always storage and when you guys need to get ready for your videos oh my god wait a MTV Cribs God did you draw this yep dad oh right oh yeah you they're so precious yeah I love it I'm all your words my hand this exceeds expectations oh I'm glad it was a vector joy you guys are all so awesome and firing every area you're in feels like you're in a different space as the gold basketball hoop in the center of the office yeah the crown is design with a slam-dunk ah here we go what did we say this place was called again any Tharks ready good job man any parts on three one two baby five [Music] [Music] oh we did how right is the Holy Trinity there's so many parts Vinnie I love it they just make me laugh so much it would this was such a high-pressure space for me just because there's three people Joey had to like drill into all that brick like we we worked our mental and physical muscles like whoa on this space and I couldn't be happier that they love it so much right because we have more OG lapis from your way plus some other awesome new interior design series and other things we have two new series last second seasons a series that we are gearing up to do that we're both so excited about the whole team of mr. gates really excited about so you guys please check those out when they come out if you guys if we get 200,000 likes Kate will go on a roller coaster that goes upside down nope don't I don't like those guys Oh Joey can just flip me upside-down how about we do it perfect okay great and guys go check out all of what Hannah Hart's Channel mean rehires channel and grace Helbig channel and subscribe adapt uh thanks for joining us I turn around let me just do that you're all with nicely fabulous squad this is the most vulnerable position I've ever been in on the Internet and then saying a lot yeah exactly Wow you owe me go in the middle cuz mine might be the full butter that's fine that's okay

painting I don't understand did it pop it pop it I will tell you I wanted a piece of art that's gonna be like symbolic mm-hmm of our working together on this renovation oh that's cute right so like DIY art all about the fluidity of our relationship woman we flow together we work together no we're out Oh either do some all for me you look sad indeed I don't understand what we're doing he tell me well fortunately we're gonna pour drops of paint on the paper and then just like moving around what's the glass work take my hand pour like drops don't drizzle it that's good now doing here now that's our walk Laurie yeah how big we can touch each other that's good it'll be a lot of paint but why are you doing more white because it's gonna be beautiful because of light yeah so that one's gonna be really runny and now a little oil these so it'll be interesting to see but yeah do some like little dollop to that boom okay great great great great so now let's pick it up together or fluidly letting the paint move all of our color palette move in together and slow and together just like me and Joey go through life look what the gold doing it's like because it's oil base it's beating up there look it's marble yeah this will be a cool wallpaper not totally blending to change the color more so creates like a marbled effect so we're both celebrating that Calcutta marble that we have on the countertops and also bringing in all of the colors that are in the room I wish the gold looks more like gold and less like chocolate looks like a melted sundae yeah this is really a melted Sunday delicious kind of like our relationship really we're just kind of like messy fluid people and you just see where it all takes us we're just gonna lay this out to dry so that it really hardens because obviously the paint's pretty thick and then frame it in a nice black frame with a white matte and the black will bring in the block from our faucets in the sink and it's just all gonna work together with our color palette I love this addition it's like the most luxurious pupu palace a pet has ever had I know we got a new bathroom and so it is a kitty yeah so one of the cool projects in this kitchen and we're super excited about this were crazy cat people is our poopoo palace that we're building for the cat so we are upgrading [Music] fact that these are facades is so great it's just so much easier to clean up around the litter and everything we have the tile all the way under there we can open the cabinet doors we're going to install these fake toe kicks okay you look more like a real cabinet and we'll also help with the smell no Winston we're not ready for you but isn't this great this is an ultimate cat master bathroom this is like cribs for cats guys okay you go down you gotta work for your people room you know it's an important lesson to learn the worst Foreman who yells at us the whole time take what's in another room so he doesn't after this little wild so Winston they're going outside you go take a nap somewhere and then come take approval later okay so now we got to install on the back of the door can we take a moment to just appreciate the fact that we put a vent in here all we did was take a laundry room vent is a standard vendor you can pick up at any hardware store there's ventilation going to the outside from within the group of Valis sorry I'm not stripping I'm telling you hear me that's Griffith their goals are to you back back back back back back now back back up back yeah no Matt take off take off those threads fits like a glove oh my god that's amazing yay and here look all of the litter bags which are ugly and not in our color palette are now stored in this basket I love bringing the element of wicker and wood just touches a bit into this kitchens a nice warm tone this is such a great solution for the litter it's tucked away and no one is the wiser what are we going to use this countertop for I have plans for there what are your plans my plan my plan oh you plan I have plans these are the old Turkish teacup with cat don't drink that hmm bringing in elements of nature especially in a kitchen is a nice texture we train the cats oh yes the cat's paw is done now it's time to let Winston take a little test run Winston you're gonna be so excited look go ensues Winston got your pass to the spa go ahead check it out leave us a good yelp review he's spending a long time in there he's maybe doing a business I'm gonna give him some privacy because his bathroom after all it's his master bathroom he looks really pleased with himself the poopoo palace is open for business so we love mineral water because it gives you the minerals that are essential for your body soda drinking tap water or filtered water so we have these huge glass jugs that we don't want to give up but they're so ugly like you don't want to put them on the countertop so Joey found these pumps and it's perfect because you stick the pump down into the big jug and then we're running the rubber cord back behind the cabinet so it's completely concealed and it's going into this smaller spicket that's right next to our bigger profit and we just turn it on and it pumps the mineral water right out of the sink it's amazing the other thing we're doing today is finishing the laundry room we are moving the laundry room into the hall closet because before we had the stocked washer and dryer in the kitchen so now we move the laundry to the hallway closet we put them side-by-side and put a countertop on top we're putting shaker wall cabinets white with the same gold handles that's perfect go-girl of this thing is so happy okay verbal I found a really inexpensive pedestal table it has a beautiful glossy white base and it totally transformed that table that Center is that centered under the light of the light of the light oh yeah no no but we're towards you just go towards you just love it hey there's up there's a label on that stone good move this is from like the 1800s oh it's not centered that it looks a little bit hmm good okay so now I have to change out these chairs hey I know you like these chairs so when you move but I think you're gonna like the new ones too oh no oh wow it's a dinner party hey no they gotta go they gotta go they're too big for in here they're also ugly kind of you saw we did your freakin bathroom Winston and rocks and trust us you'll like these new chairs we're taking these out with or without you I think Marcus and is protesting she's doing a sit-in do you want to go in the garage but you can try it Kate found these really cool slim chairs that are super sleek they look nice and cozy aren't they so cool they're vintage Danish cheek from like the early 70s Wow completely like feels different in here with the slimmer table and the like low-profile chairs yeah like just cleaner and more open the whole goal with this is to sort of make the breakfast stuff feel a little bit more Airy it's got all this beautiful sunlight and white tile in the breakfast nook we are replacing our old DIY art I thought it might be nice to change up the symmetry a little bit and do like a sunburst mirror and then the phases of the Moon DIY it looks so cool I love that it's the Sun in the moon well I feel like I'm the Sun in the other phases of the Moon I'm the Sun all-powerful and Kate's the phases of the Moon she's intricate you never know what face he's going to be in you're a little bit more controlled by the lunar you're a little bit sweaty er yeah I'm just so thrilled with how this whole room is coming together the rug is actually a really nice moment having a kitchen just to have a nice element I really wanted to go with a natural fiber because we have so much tile and this jute rug is perfect it feels so good underfoot finishing touches on the countertop and I'm bringing in a nice white vase that is holding gold kitchen utensils I'm changing out our old stainless steel toaster to a white toaster so that it goes with the rest of our appliances I don't really want anything else on the countertops just a fruit bowl that's a beautiful glaze gray clay it has a darker be really in line with our color palette really minimalist just keeping it super clean and Zen looking the other thing we have on our countertop is our espresso machine which is a beautiful ivory white color so it works perfectly with our other white tones appliances and that's it on the stove I'm just placing this beautiful marble cutting board that I found it's just a nice little moment to place the spoons on there dirty cat salt and pepper shaker okay so just very minimal accessories and it just brings them in just on the back of our vintage stove it looks so cute dish towels are really important you know and have on hand flowers to finish office is like my dream kitchen we put so much work into it I'm really proud of the choice that we made I think we stayed true to the vintage quality as how those

Hello my creative weirdos! Welcome! We're doing another bedroom on budget video and today we have a wonderful participant. His name is Drew, he's 27 years old, He is a music teacher and a tutor, and he just really needs his place pulled together so he can welcome both students and hopefully some dates. We have three hundred dollars and one day to shop the room, and we also have an HP Spectre X-360, who are kindly sponsoring this video today as well, and this thing is beautiful and sleek And I'm also gonna gift this to him at the end of the video (shh) don't tell him. It's a surprise. Don't worry, it's not part of the three hundred dollar budget, which is good because we have a lot of work to do in there. Okay, let's start the clock! Ready, let's go see the room! Knock Knock I'm Mr. Kate! Hey, you don't even need the introduction. You already know who this is. I'm Mr. Kate. I'm here. I'll take a look at your place I'll stop by for a while and help you find your style. We'll laugh and we'll paint. Mr. Kate I'm Mr.Kate Drew! Hi! Hi You're like our first dude in a while. Hey Hey Tell me a little bit about your history with interior design. Zero. Oh, okay Yeah. Shoeboxes are now my filing cabinet; Uh huh TV I found on the street. I love a good side-of-the-road find! That's the theme of my room, side-of-the-road stuff. So I know that you teach music, I teach photography, which is awesome. And you have your students come in here. I don't want them to come into this room But, sometimes we have to. Right I don't want them to be scared of me, and never come back. Really! So that's like an actual conscious thought (it is) that you, so we definitely want to change that. We want to make this a space that you are not embarrassed - That would be great about. Yeah, that would be great So a masculine space that is welcoming but neutral colors. Neutral. Okay neutral neutral and now I don't mean to pry but Can you tell me about your love life? You're dating life? My dating life. I meet someone I like and then I map out like--Wait. They'll eventually have to see my room. That's that's not gonna work. So that just sort of stops it right there. Oh my gosh, you like put the kibosh on it, because of your room? Oh my gosh that is huge. So this space could represent a lot of changes for you in life. It could. It really could. I'm so excited! You have places you can go today, right? Because I want you out of the room so that you can come in and see it *beautiful*. So that means you gotta get out of here, okay? Go Drew, I love you. Go, goodbye, have fun. Bye, Drew see ya later, no peeking! Okay guys So let's sketch out the floor plan, shall we? I'm gonna sketch it out and that will also be really helpful when we go shopping to know what we need to get. Okay, so we have a rectangle room here, and obviously right now his bed is on this side... I really like to place the bed on the long side of a wall, I think it kind of ends up making the most sense in a bedroom and then I think his headboard is in good enough shape and we don't have a ton of budget obviously to get a new one, so let's reuse his headboard. If we can budget it to get him a new, newer old TV that would be cool. So, maybe a flatscreen mounted here across the bed. Now he has that dresser which is a Highboy. Which is in good shape so I think we put that over here basically where the bed was... And then, of course we want curtains! Curtains, curtains, yes. No more blankets on the windows, and then I think we keep the desk actually where it is I think we give him a longer desk so maybe something cool like out of plywood I love that look, it actually looks really cool and kind of minimalist. And then, let's mount a guitar on the wall. So that's the plan! Now I gotta go find Joey. Okay, so we're in the car, and we are kind of wrapping our minds around this shopping extravaganza we're about to have... Definitely want to get him a new TV. Found one. What you've been searching? Let me see. 42" for $40. Oh, that's good. Cash only sale. I got cash. Picking up the TV first order (Joey: first order of business). Okay guys, so we're now at the Sky Apartments building where he has the TV that we're gonna pick up. Joey just went inside so hopefully he comes out with a working TV... Success! Does it work? Yeah, it works. Did you test it? Yeah, I tested it. It's uh, it's big. TV done. Now we just gotta find everything else. Yeah! Guys we are here at the Helping Hand Thrift Shop: Vintage and Collectibles. Very excited, there's already stuff on the sidewalk, which makes me feel like this is a very full store because they can't fit everything inside! So, let's go see! Oh my gosh those are rad! Those lights! Those vintage old school with like the kind of like a leather finish on it? Should we get him roller blades? No. Should we get me roller blades? No. Let me see if I can get these roller blades on... Joey. Joey. Joey! oh my gosh. Joey! Seriously? JOEY! Joey, oh my gosh, guitar pick storage. Sure, no? Like, he really doesn't have like homey stuff in his room, you know?Those are cool. Those blue ones right there. These ARE cool! Oh my gosh, they're all Shakespeare. Oh my gosh. These are a dollar. Frames... All right. We do need accessories to style, you know? Look, how cool! Oh yeah, that's cool. How rad is that!? Oh my gosh, look at this! How cute, he moved to California from Missouri. Yep, so maybe he passed some cactuses on the way...(what?) Okay, great. Wait Joey! Look, a filing cabinet! Should we use this as the base for the desk?(Joey: Yeah, okay) Maybe we can paint it like the wall colors, or something. Hello? Hello? You got everything we need? *lots of banter over phone* Hello yeah, I think I'm ready check out. You ready to check out? Yeah. Okay great. Okay so, thrift store down! Got stuff!!! So now we're gonna head to a big-box store and get bedding. We need a chair. I'm gonna see if they have any rugs on clearance. Yes, a new light, because he has a fluorescent light in his bedroom. *noo* We don't have much money left to spend. I know we're getting really tight on this budget. It's crazy how far it goes... And we need to save money for the big sheet of plywood so we can do a cool desk - let's do it - And then let's get lunch. High-five! Boom, so we just hit up the big box store and scored, scored, scored! So the rule there is go straight to the clearance section or the returns area and see if there's anything that you can find a deal on. Which we did! This rug was only on $30 look at these neutral tones right neutral for Drew. And how about this chair, ladies and gentlemen, Look at this beautiful Bistro chair! You can put it in his room as an accent chair and it can also be for his students. More plants! Cup for his pens, this was just a mob... More clearance... Candles, two candles. A little notebook... I love this too, look how pretty that is, and then very important beautiful gray sheets, look at these! Pretty, classy. Yes, look at this beautiful comforter. Neutral and gray, and then I'm very excited about this basket!!!! $9.99 *score* and it's so cool! Look, it says laundry on it. And then look at these beautiful curtains, and then I love this pillow... Just one throw pillow. We only have a budget for one throw pillow for the bed, but I really love this pattern. The only thing we have left to get is hardware store stuff. A great budget saving tip for you guys, go to the hardware store and already have your cuts in mind and they can pre-cut it for you there, so you just can leave with the pieces and then screw them into the wall, you don't have like an expensive tablesaw. Alright, well can you just draw the desk how you want it to look so I know how to get the wood cut?
Want to go to the hardware store to do that? Yeah, all right I'm thinking we use the new chest of drawers as the base for then a new desk.... That goes like in to the corner. And that'll be nice, look WAY longer desk so that he'll have room to sit here with his chair, but then if he wants to have his student sit next to him in the smaller chair! Cool, but then I also want to build like a backing for the desk that kind of goes up and then we have maybe some like little red shelves, so we could either have like one ledge shelf in the middle or we could have like one here. Alright. So we're gonna hit up the hardware store, get the wood, and then maybe a little lunch? And we will see you back in the room! Wait Joey, [(Joey): what's up?] I like the backside of this headboard better... Look, it's not the same. No. This is like the stripes, but then on the back  it's just solid. I think that's like a cleaner, that's more Manimalist. So plan, here's your pointer stick. Oh. It's the window rod. Oh, thank you. Alright, so plywood desk going over there. TV mounted there, our new-old TV. Newer old TV mounted. Oh, also some kind of DIY guitar mount over there. New curtains, ring rod, his highboy dresser here, and then I have a DIY Clock project. I want to do it above this. That's gonna go here. I think, since we have the leftover of that dark gray paint we should paint dark gray here. White. White. White. (white on the other walls) Popcorn ceilings we're not touching, obviously no, but change out that light. By the time you're back, I'm gonna have painted, installed the desk, mount the TV, curtains on the wall... Sounds great! How much time do I have left? *sighs* Okay, we better get going! Okay, DIY project time! My favourite time. We are going to be doing some music themed DIYs for this music teacher, but you know, keeping it Manimalist, keeping it cool. Not being cheesy with it, right? So, I saw this clock online that I thought was so cool. It's a clock where they use the music notes to signify the time, so like a quarter note, then a quarter note, plus a half note, then a whole note, whatever like they basically use the notes to add up the numbers around the clock. And I thought that was so cool, and it looks very Manimalist, we don't have the budget to buy it, so we're gonna DIY it. Okay, so I have here in front of me one of the frames that we thought of the first store, very inexpensive. I've taken it apart, and I took out the glass because we are going to be using a clock work That I'm gonna put it behind and then drill a hole through the middle and then attach obviously the hands on and it can run around on the front of our piece of paper here, and then I'm going to draw with my pretty calligraphy pen the music notes just very simply, in black, on this kind of aged paper that was already in the frame, already cut to size, thank you thrift store, and then this is just my template. I'm gonna sketch it out lightly with pencil first, so that I know that it's centered and I like it and then I'm going to poke through with my sharp knife to feed the clock work through, and then I'm gonna go over with the pen and erase any pesky pencil lines after I'm happy with the look. I'm going to replace the picture hanger that was on this side. I'm going to put it up here so we have something to hang from at the top, since the clockworks going to be right in the center. We need something that sticks off the wall about the same amount as the clockwork. Now it's time to attach these little beauties guys, I'm a clockmaker! I'm like Geppetto and Joey is my Pinocchio &lt;3 Now I just have to put it back in the frame. I'm just gonna use a frame surround, leaving this open, of course, and no glass in front and put it on the wall ,oh I've got a saggy hour hand, I'll fix it. Okay friends, we have our chest of drawers here. It's a little beat-up, but I have to say it looks a lot better than a stack of old shoeboxes which is what Drew is currently using for all of his papers. So, I'm not a huge fan of this green I mean I like green, but this green is a little bit bright for our neutral color palette, so I want to paint out these drawers again. I do have my sander on hand to just get rid of some of this peeling paint. How much time do we have left? *freaks out* One of the most pleasant sounds on planet Earth. Great, here we go. Wait can I get to put it up please? Here you go, friend. Nice and secure on the wall, yes! I love it so much! It is minimalist, manly "manimalist" and we have the celebration of music from the guitar here, to our music clock over there and he had a dresser, that was already in here, that looks so much cooler now with the brass accent. Our amazing laundry basket that was so cheap, and then I love the asymmetry of the pendant light over the bed. It's like you know a kind of cool twist on a bedside lamp. And then we're using our side chair as a side table. And then this thing with Joey built is just so rad. It has such a beautiful kind of whimsy. An then of course, I hope he's very excited about his gift. Where is he? Drew, here's your chair Alright, Joey. Do you have Drew? Yeah, I got him right here. Okay, come on in! Alright Drew, ready? I think so.. See your new bedroom. *freaks out* Oh my god! Wait!? Let's go!!! This is an actual room now. You're a real boy, you can have your guitar lessons in here. How did you build this? It's one piece of plywood. Isn't that great!? Hanging guitar!! Isn't that cool? Now you're legit! *laughs* Awe, how cute!

chic Alicia love funk ring retro pastel anyways we'll get into it let's go swimming oh wait but thumbs up the video oh my gosh thumbs up the video subscribe the video feel me would be wet all times hey guys my name is Alicia Marie and I have a channel on YouTube where I do lots of lifestyle sometimes comedy sometimes make it some fashion videos and I recently moved my room that kind of doesn't make sense right about it I mean ah so you guys know we usually paint faces and that takes one day we get in there we tape etc we paint the walls we remove the tape lamp BAM moving the furniture I mean I say wham bam it's a lot of work guys but wallpaper is even more work so yesterday we actually came over here because we had to do a little prep for the space okay so we're on our way to Alicia's house it is our wallpaper day and photography day are you Kelly yep just general general prep day well beaver obviously takes a while to cut and glue etc so you need an extra day time to get that done also we're going to take a picture of Alicia by her pool that we can blow up and put above her fireplace mantel in her bedroom and we have our line of a pass and our ball so fall into the water audience I love I love that like ya love ya you're the best mermaid ever so I edited it really quickly on the computer and we sent it off to get printed we're doing something really cool in her room so we're going to take these darker grey wall to make them really cool by putting on a marble mural wallpaper so this is like one wall worth of the wallpaper because obviously we have this molding here and it's going to go above the molding not like charts very technical which is why we need an entire day to do this oh my gosh here is our first panel up it looks so good creeper air behold [Music] hmm imagine yesterday went great we have the wall prep we're going to show Alicia the first of her two reveals which is our starting place fuckin reveal people we're going to now just show her what the wallpaper looks like your own little taste revealed no ha oh my god I got excited I got really excited I am excited I'm excited it tell me you handed this or just oh my god or so as I hand this does we're going to do the artwork rate your foot nap your vibe it's like palm tree yes super retro pastels what I tell people yeah but then you have like this help attach sort of classic elements yeah I mean coding so the town is going to be to sort of embrace like classic meets mid-century Palm Springs but I feel like we need the center because I feel like we're tired because yesterday was a very long day getting all this wallpaper up ticking the walls painted you've never been prepped for today or about to pick up the energy we're going to do awesome things Kelly at this point I'm in the car with all of you want to tear that her kicks are the kind of dream they'll kick us off your father's life let's go do some DIY in with Alicia you take some fun no no but now you can show me they know good work we need a mere four but it stuck to the van is right in front of her window and we didn't want to get one of those vanities with like the mirror attached so what we're doing is we're actually going to make a custom stand for a free-floating mirror that we bought like like urban outfitters table saw which is kind of dangerous I think I'll probably do the sawing but can you trace that on a piece of wood I sure can do we have a pencil or powder we're going to take some wood we're going to measure some triangles and then put some angular slits in them so the miracle spit down on that so obviously the trick with this is making sure that the angles right and that the pieces of wood weigh enough and like hold down the base of mirror right good yes panting with this yeah that's for drywall but it's working fine Joey yes do you feel ever done run your very rough base on that and feel it it's great oh my god we need that Joey yeah I love it it's so much better because like like I always frustrates me that those makeup mirrors oh yeah for me you've been great thank you excited that excited time to take a leash out go into hyper gear and finish this right no pressure guys but I'm really excited I got a cheer-off adhere oh good dear well oh I didn't make up cheers I just did them so G Oh going to edit goodbye guys and have I don't even this move we kicked me out but I have some editing to you so it's okay so the first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna switch on all of her switches and plugs she is a tech girl so we're gonna give her all USB plugs because in today's world like if you don't have a USB outlet on your plug what are you doing we're putting these awesome LeGrande USB plugs are super easy to switch out and you don't have to have a big butt charger obviously the first thing you want to do is going to make sure your breakers off so there's no power go to the switches and then you want to double check that with your voltage checker you're going to notice which wires are hot which wires you're neutral which wires are ground you're going to snip those and then you're going to take the back of the new USB plug and look at your strip gauge your hots going to go in the hole marked hot your neutral or your white wire is going to go in the hole marked white you're going to just screw those tight you're just going to make sure your wires are all tucked back into the outlet box and then screw the outlet into the wall beautiful now we just got to put the front on [Music] we can put wallpaper on the so they blend oh my gosh that's gonna be great basically you're going to find your pattern and put your wallpaper paste on it all right boys all these so we're using the LeBrons witches where you can actually take this little piece that comes with it and either paint it or wallpaper it which is so cool because it blends in so much better and it becomes an art piece all right you have me none yeah I mean when I finish this pink because I went over there whether it's a little bit of pink no finish it party consider going tonight you are micromanaging me so I'm just cutting out the wallpaper roughly decide okay okay I got a beautiful walkway take the adhesive paper off of the wall plate with your wallpaper square on it Oh beautiful custom all plates all around what can you do uh-huh failed scenario my friend here starting with Rob no biggie Thank You rod cuddle time I got my dancing shoes on you guys know how many rugs unrolled we've done we now can do it backwards I'm sorry basically just like one of those dogs you know for they like to stand there trying to cover it up with their backseat human don't do that I don't feel it but Joey's nodding the TV on the wall there's a nice little spot that we're going to put it we're going to put a dresser underneath we're going to put them TV a little off-center but we're going to hook her up with a really heavy-duty TV mouth and she can tilt and pull it out telescope so it's a swivel mount that way when she's laying in her bed which is just a little bit off-center from the TV she'll be able to tilt the TV ins have a nice angle to view it you want the curtain I love linen curtains or something so dreaming about women and don't worry guys linen is supposed to be a little bit wrinkled it's just a beautiful texture all right so we're going to bring in a bunch of furniture now go away see we've taken that Alex for that that tall tower that just didn't hit the speed and given her this beautiful dresser where she can store all of that excess makeup because after all she's a beauty guru in the corner I'm placing this like rattan chair it's beautiful it's actually similar to a chair that Alicia have hanging in her living room it's one of the natural tone and so I like the repetition of elements throughout the space because if someone comes over they see your living room they walk upstairs they see a similar style on the chair and placing some furry pillows and a little throw to just make it more code and at the foot I'm using a pouf you guys know I love my boobs and this one is a beautiful pale pink alright so we're going to bring in our vanity piece which is just a really cool would kind of mid-century piece going here no fall beautiful your body in front of the window that we're then going to put our DIY mirror on top of so excited about Oh too much chair it's so cute the great thing is because she uses this vanity since smellin like her vlog because you put their makeup on on the blog so she can now move this around whoa buddy oh very white room is making me run I need a Wainright heat for you to Pat me down thank you thinking being innovative thank you okay there's all kind of funny I dunno it's like like the fourth quarter of the game coming to the sidelines why are you so cute down like I'm not to be tall on the vanity I'm placing this elbow very minimal kind of industrial lamp with a bear ball but this bulb is faceted report Joey what have you seen is meant cord rope having elements like that paired with the more minimalist industrial or mid-century things we have going on in this space make them a happy family also in the ban against leaving a cactus Alicia specifically said she loves cactuses and is one spa which is great because it doesn't poke you and also it won't die so now we've got to get the bed in place this bed it's amazing it's a beautiful pleated very sixties inspired a kind of healthy beige velvet the pleaser gorgeous about Grass Lake it's a king size bed which is perfect for this room [Music] when Alicia said retro I immediately thought about me on I wanted to get her a neon type feel but with something very peaceful Souls like this be a really fun DIY so I found this neon LED lighting so basically a long cord that where the LED is encased in this tubing so when you turn it on it's so bright it looks like neon alright so we want to go 80 inches up on the wall right to click above the bed and then have it be kind of a little line like a wave like pattern or if you think about like you know sort of like a drifting off to sleep hopefully we can cut this with summer we're going to try what is the unplug yeah this is like a squid and octopus never been easier to just make your own neon creation low power easy to manipulate and giving my huge quantity when we on Soundwave right so you got your general area right unplug it okay I'm plugging in oh yeah look there's a little scissor mark hey Ronnie oh my gosh you're like you're cutting an alien I know it feels in flesh you do I feel like I am doing a little surgery oh it just hardened you need me - did you hear that you like release ear CD flash ah it's still word but so obviously we need to cap the end yeah okay so we have a silicon silicon when you plug in that little guy actually hello dryer so we're putting silicon piece in the cap and I'm pushing it on and then it also came with this vacuum sealer thing Sara Lee I need a blow dryer I'm utilizing our new mirror on the cold side it feels pretty good great I need that we're about to shrink wrap oh it's going to clean Oh drinking is drinking like curling up and it's actually really satisfying blood is so frizzy and that's what's going to seal that end and now let's get it on the wall alright so we're just using some basic mounting brackets of a hardware store that we spray-painted whites and sort of put it in place where we want it right there yeah this is so cool is so custom I love that if LED it's not going to get hot it's just like glowing and so retro and really kind of highlight some movement that's going on on the marble it's wrapped on top of the bed we are bringing in a brand new king mattress okay get that side right I cannot believe right now this is the most amazing scientific development I've ever okay swaps the bed's dirty I don't like that house you're going to tear the okay that we're about to find out friends it's a pyramid rest came from you know how can a leash up with this awesome king-size bed like that scoop and you just slice open the package and it takes the biggest breath of air you the king green I understood how this world making noise and transforms and joking laughter it's truly magic oh girl I don't want one of these myself you owe me - hmm the bedding for this bed we're going really simple I want to do all white so we're doing nice soft feet and then a linen do they cover with a pork do they insert some king-size pillows you want to make sure you get king-size pillows your king-size bed please thread the width of the bed and then one throw pillow I know one and this throw pillow is really cool it has the same braided texture as the rug but it's a nice pastel kind of Mabi pink and it looks great on the bed the finishing touch and it space has to be a picture that we took yesterday which came back from the printers hot off the press guys literally hot off breath and it looks so good we had it blown up overnight and then we're just going to make our own acrylic standoff alright so here is the acrylic great you drove us home extra turned out amazing well in order for Anna's photo I wanted to keep that minimalist look so perfect thing for that also DIY is to use two pieces of acrylic you can get these cut asked any frame store any glass or any place they carry acrylic and then you want to use a plastic or acrylic drill bit and drill the holes for your standoff so this is the back piece so let's sandwich it with another piece yeah we need to get this centered so Joey and I are just placing the photograph on the back piece of acrylic and we're using some apps free mounting tape just secur on the back we're just going to make it way easier to came in on the wall using these beautiful sand off you [Music] and we're going to sandwich that between the two pieces of acrylic putting it all up on the wall simple minimalist effective brings in the vibe so the standoff just creates a nice depth and it just does exactly what it says it stands the acrylic off the wall a little bit and so the back cage is going to finish off with some final decorating touches so the light storage boxes are great she can put labels on the side she can write in cute cursive whatever is inside of them and I'm accenting around the white storage boxes with just some beautiful ceramics of course in our pesto accents at the foot of the bed I love placing a bench which is a really nice area to have an extra seating moment opportunity we have the really composed furniture of the bed and the dresser contrasted very nicely texturally with the chair and the bench we're having another natural-fiber moment with this awesome square floor pillow I'm putting in a new light fixture of course you had this sort of deep kind of you know right on a really cool industrial looking chandelier and some filament bulbs just complete the look [Music] I totally put some finishing touches in this space some small accessories some side tables some lamps let's bring her into our new chic hotel inside her house Alicia pad it's time to reveal to Alicia

myself I was like no no no we want to does not show your face so that it's just like the vibe right this is the vibe of the room it's better than how I thought it was looks hear how she feels change I believe and I finally have curtain minority so my neighbors can't open them I left them a little linen wrinkly because I just you know the dream you gotta let us write the baddest oh and I'm so obsessed leg yes so gorgeous oh I feel like it ties the whole room together this is not feel like my bedroom and feel so big right yeah the most people know this I have way too much makeup but and I

have for like immediate access makeup in those stores and you have obviously all these you can do organizers or whatever and then I did some white little boxes in there it was like for all that excess like this stuff you're gifted or whatever sit in there and then was like a cute little label or something alright on the ride oh my gosh this literally looks like a hotel room and it feels bigger

remember when you did this last time and you literally gave yourself such whiplash Joe to roll good how do we close okay bye-bye paint the wall will let's go way to rolls take over this painting and Chloe and I have a fun art project to work on let's head to the bedroom you have big giant walls mm-hmm and they're great and they need big giant arch yes they need some love like because there's nothing more depressing than seeing a big giant wall was like a tiny piece of art it's a little bit of a challenge to bring her some large-scale art that is going to really suit the size of the space so we are budget saving on this large-scale art by using a piece of finished plywood we primed it with just like a white coat of paint how many shades of gray do you think are here it's about 50 maybe 15 15 shades of gray and then we have this thing that's a scraper okay and then these are so cool these are called stand off and what you do is you mount them on the wall and then this goes behind the art gets sandwiched in between these two little things so it's gonna kind of stand off the wall a little bit okay I need to do an art project like I feeling under art classes why don't you come over here and help me start dolloping okay so we're taking this piece of wood and we are placing dollops of paint all along the side that's so pretty they're all beautiful and then we take a scraper tool and just scrape it along and squiggle it a little and that's it literally drag the paint across the wood piece and it looks so cool what's cool it's like a waterfall gray yeah I'm gonna go across I'm gonna hand it to you the friendship stroke friendship stroke [Music] just run all the way off the board beautiful it looks like sedimentary rock right like rocks that kind of layer themselves over millions of years we're doing it in 15 minutes I love how this looks yes let's add some of our glitter the art looks amazing we are finishing it off with some glitter which Chloe is so excited about I think I'm such a glittery girl and like for the longest time I haven't been letting my glitter shine through because I would like everyone likes the like nude and like that kind of lover but I'm letting it shine through okay I'm glad your essence shine through Beryl we are also using some silver leaf and it's these beautiful really lightweight leaves and we're just tearing off pieces and patting them down with our finger I've always wanted to try that leaf method and it's so Z Gallerie which is the vibe I want to go for this little submissive is doing really great at this project I won't have to take her to the Red Room of pain which is good for both of us because it's not in our color palette so art turns out so cool I'm so happy about it it's really big which is great because normally a giant piece of art like that would cost a lot of money hey guys we made art how'd you do that Nicole just talent you're born with it we don't give away our secrets Chloe yes with all your furniture went away did your TV go away yes it did I thought you guys were getting me a TV is that happening not part of the deal here you don't have a TV yeah you're gonna get to go get the TV I have to go buy a TV oh my god okay can you do that I think I can handle it sorry thank you I had a TV before when they first came over and now I don't have a TV but I think they thought I had a TV so today I'm going to get a TV let's move on we got a lot to do Oh pretend or on vacation we're having a romantic dinner out what would you like for dinner what are you cooking um filet mignon you uh hey I don't eat steak second one is blaming young poop it sounds real girls lisabean a me okay now you two pretend okay you're in a African drum circle what's under this blanket don't you want to know I

for 45 misses wait what I'm building this far in only 46 years every night yeah yeah I Why to the rescue we found this amazing Wood stump and we're gonna play the silver it came from I'll reclaim wood place where she like treats everything that comes in so if there were critters in here they are dead so the process with painting the stump is really easy we're just standing it down first creating a smooth surface we've removed any bar and then we're going to seal it with a primer and a stain blocker and then we're going to cover that with some awesome silver oil paint so that when you walk in you just see this massive piece of silver wood oh my gosh can I do the first slight you can do all the slides which wow it's putting a coverage though oh my gosh this is gonna be so pretty you know how I do everything and my long nails and never break that I've loved one oh my god later Brooke on down I did work a nail and it bled oh my god Jolie sympathy oh let me see no I taped it up oh that's my hard core you can go do something else I got this I got this you think you copy so Joey's got the stump project I am going to head out and spray-paint LeBron we need that organic glam look so this is perfect it's the right size it's large and scale so I am just standing down this branch and then spray painting it white with a primer and then going in with you guessed it silver and it looks so cool it's really just coming alive and this with some LED twinkle legs is just going to become its own sculptural element so while I'm out here spray painting I'm also spray painting the base of this lamp that I found which is a tree branch like looks so cool it's so in line with our theme and I'm going to put it on the opposite side of the room of the tree stumps and we have that wood playing throughout yo we're not ready for you I was trying to cut out of the girl okay I got it you leave circle the city closed without the TV but we are not done with the room yet so thank you Chloe be on your way to a coffee shop we will text you when we're ready all right guys a favorite time of the week its rug time Oh huh I love it it's shy lay down lay down and submit yourself to the rug puddle

charcoal gray kind of tweed fabric the couch and the chairs and the dining chairs are all from urban home they look amazing what's so great is that they're beautiful really nice quality but they do not break the bank we need a coffee table here complete the conversation area yes white with silver coffee table ladies and gentlemen welcome to the show you are here in these 50 shades of grey room no no no it is not a painful place it is a beautiful multi-tone place and cut this film lamp it's kind of one of those tripod style like old film lights and of course picking brass but we painted this over because no warm metal allowed lift and carry and put the desk in this chair is awesome it's like fabric / plastics thank you right there please thank you can you bring me more things please look flush so for the art they painted on a really lightweight piece of finished plywood the way we were going to mount it is when you standoffs which are little metal tubes that basically prop the art piece off on the wall gives it a little dimension so we're just going to drill in six standoffs put it right next to the dining table it's going to be an amazing feature piece of art super luxe and totally DIY Oh mg mg you know like legit the art looked so amazing you guys on the wall oh my gosh I am blown away this looks so expensive legit skis if I saw that in like a D gallery or something like I would easily believe that it was close to a thousand if not more I'm jumping a mirror up on the wall adds reflection in space [Music] yeah I think this dining room area is pretty much good to go Wow Nick and sneak Christian Grey would be proud I'm also doing a sketch of like a Couture girl like just something really simple and an evocative of just kind of her you know glam makeup stuff curtain time I didn't bring a ladder I'm an idiot so I'm gonna get these up here oh there's a better way to do this Joey pleat turns are done oh um something's not right we got a flooding problem gay no why are they like that the measurements were correct what's going on did you put them upside down put what upside out the brackets oh yeah maybe you did please do over did you see how hard it was for me to get those up there okay well do over and please stand on a chair apparently I was using the wrong curtain rod and current brackets I'm gonna rehang the curtains because it's my favorite thing in the world to do to get complexity and design you know those spaces that you see and you go oh my gosh this looks like a magazine you really do want to challenge yourself to play with tones so rather than being so strict with yourself to stick to like one shade of grey if you decide that grey and silver are your color palette do every single shade possible because that is what's gonna give you that really layered beautiful look you can also set your table so that it sort of lives set which looks really welcoming and very like magazine I'm using a silver velvet table runner a vase candle holders and a long tray that I found at the goodwill you guys yeah it's important to reuse and also to stay on budget and Tara you have a glamorous table the branch looks so cool I'm just twisting these twinkle lights around and it's just such a beautiful sculptural element I'm just accessorizing the top of the console table with some beautiful items a candle holder and this big chrome picture that is just so glam and I could not pass up but I found it in the clearance section ok behind the couch we are hanging some prints and these are really beautiful black-and-white prints they just look really crisp and glamorous and then on the couch we have some charcoal gray pillows and then a beautiful beaded pillow it's kind of a velvet and it just looks so glamorous the stump looks so cool you guys oh my god we're placing in the room it looks so amazing it's such a showpiece I'm just placing a core geometric orb the stone Marbley piece but they complement each other I'm a coffee table and placing this plate tray which is so cool it has a sketch of a rose on it a long glass tray with three decorative beaded balls if this was a planet I would live on this planet and then visit the other two furry white pillows essential I'm just placing a framed mr. kate quote the room looks amazing i'm so thrilled with it we definitely have 50 shades of grey in here like i feel like we have like 100

just like hand over the control to someone else I know it's kind of silly because it's just an apartment but like I really hope that Cait created the image I was going for I trust her so yeah I guess let's go see [Music] 
a little creative weirdo the welcome we're doing mr. K decorates on a budget and I'm so excited about this room because this is something that you guys have been asking for for a while it is a studio on a budget and so today we're doing Britney she's 21 she works as a waitress she lives in a studio apartment and has a lot of stuff but doesn't really have any cohesive design or color palette and we have $300 but I don't know if we're gonna need to use all this because she has so much stuff it's gonna be more about like reworking and giving her some flow and a color palette and all of that let's set the timer because we only have one day to do this and let's busy Brittany you don't even need the introduction you are no busy [Music] [Music] okay Brittany you have a lot of stuff yeah you have a lot of hearing it's beautiful thank you you're naturally curly right yes how it comes out of my hand oh my god me too I mean it's hiding today but we're curly girls or curly girls and we also have something else that is a very much alike and that is we love stuff yes when I lived with my parents I had like a like two bedrooms I had my bedroom and then the guest bedroom to spread my stuff out in so when I moved here we've got condensed and just kind of thrown where it fits got it well yeah I mean a studio is like three rooms you if their office you have your living room you know entertaining area and you've your sleeping area and your storage area of a dresser real close it's very broken up right now and I just want something that's like all together all unified cohesive gonna make sense and it's like a little bit more grown-up than what I have right now let's talk about the rest of your because you have a closet their wardrobe but I still don't have enough room for like sweaters and pajamas and like random stuff like that if you like all colors yeah I grabbed a tweet towards blue the most but I have like blue gold orange and yellow are super fun too and then you also have art I see that you've started a gallery wall yeah but I ended up having so much like open wall space that I spread it out everywhere it was another gallery well you and Pony with your cap on yeah yeah what does it mean it means fatty and Japanese okay so I think I know the plan you have to go to work right yep okay yay so that's good you'll be away because we want this to surprise and enables have to go shopping oh my god rooms over to do oh I believe in you thank you I need it I need it all right sleeping okay bye she's gone alright so looking at this floorplan the biggest issue is that she wants to keep the futon and the bed which are two very sizable items in this size room but she has this closet here which is like kind of a little alcove it's got the double doors I'm thinking if we can use that as usable space in the room I may be taking the doors off and putting the head of the bed in there we're all of a sudden changing up the flow in here that becomes the bed section and then we have more room to play with the futon becoming the couch did I just say a lot is a lot of stuff we're gonna learn to do well do by doing go shopping I do Oh the budget do one budget hungry too budget thirsty do be thirsty for some budget fine so what's unique about this piece is she has a lot of stuff I feel like the key with studio apartments is making some items multifunctional so sometimes like a bed can also be a couch but she liked having a bad and a futon couch because she has friends come and stay over all the time so I'm thinking we need to make her desk her vanity by putting a mirror above it gotcha but she doesn't have a big mirror so we need a big mirror yeah we need curtains choose awesome windows in there I think that'll really bring the AIA yeah and I think we get her some new bedding how do you feel about reworking a bookshelf that is currently standing tall and vertical I want to turn it on its side to make it a long low bookshelf that means that you need to work it so that the shelves instead of going this way when its flipped oh this way yeah that was the answer I was hoping for so basically we're not getting anything big is just all about the flow it's all about the flow it's all about the floor plan and it's all about unifying those items that she has with a color palette so it's all about paint can you better flow us out of it good will here I come you got the will I got the way I got the budget I'm gonna slay I need a fun some crap and make it cool we got a paint and then find a pool we're going swimming hey guys today's video is sponsored by honey no not that kind of honey Kate

Kate let's join honey comm backslash mr. Kate now let's get back to the video honey [Music] you guys know that I think the only way we're going to free up some space in there and create areas in that studio is to put the bed into that alcove so I think we should really anchor that area with a darker paint all right so the colors I have here I want to do a dark blue for her alcove OOP and then we'll also use the leftover for the bookshelf tip okay this one's more sophisticated I think great uh-huh midnight sky has a nice smokiness to it and then I for her dresser which is now white we want to give it a sophisticated color Grand Boulevard I think so you sure you want to let her in there okay so we have our two beautiful colors here I think we do metallic gold and then I like the idea to me like a an opposite color I think the yellow with this blue tear the vintage orange chair she loves so much so let's not forget there is gonna be that presence of orange so I feel like the yellow is the nice in-between color [Music] that's nice right little more modern shape I want to go into the clothing section seven idea okay so you know she has that vanity stool though okay well she has to because it's cool and it's covered with like kind of a faded fabric right now I'm thinking we could recover it and it's on a big school so we could use like a dress no I like the other one better yeah okay I'm Haley and she eats something reflective what is this briefing in this bowl is it the right size I want to get frames she kind of attempted to do a gallery wall but she didn't like fully convinced her than the fully commit to it with her so we need some more frames so I can do some more DIY art to add to what sure you have that one's in good shape yeah finds and then we're finding all of the bells and whistles all right well I'm not hating this oh my gosh I you really know because I do think just leave these he's like I would like to do some fresh flowers for her on hoody one yeah I mean to be honest for the record I don't think that we really need to get her some fake flowers no you mean you dumb jokes I'm gonna go for the jugular tomorrow night frame right I wanted something else round for this so we have the clock and then maybe something like oval around looks like a lid okay guys so got our paint we've got our spray paint and so next up we are going to go to like home goods or IKEA or something to get bedding and curtains and curtain rods and then like that's it good job good job it's already so spacious with the bed out of here so the bed's going inside that okay yeah so our only option I think to like make it feel more open designate areas in here because this is a studio we do futon slash couch they're keeping the food time keeping the futon she loves this round ottoman one of her favorite pieces in here so curtains curtains TV TV here not Murphy Betty Valerie wall above the futon no not no Murphy bed because we don't have the budget we don't have this wise we don't have the time also I don't think that she wants to have to pull her bed down but like it's kind of like I said the problem from the beds of the head of the beds are we going yeah that's like a little alcove and I have a DIY plan for above there I want to do gallery wall above the futon so we're gonna use some of her art that's her past and her sister oh and then her vintage chair here so first things first yeah this about paint me as drive to being the dresser Oh anyone to do the bookshelf yeah because the bookshelf is in there let's get going here let's go a lot of guys do Joey sushi oh my gosh it's a tiny piece of sushi reupholstery time so guys she has this little stool here that goes with her vanity it is seen lots of butts and I think maybe some cat scratching and I think it will be really fun to reupholster this and what is key about being able to easily Rio pulse or something is the ability to remove the cushion which I already obviously unscrewed usually you can flip it over and then just see if there's screws attaching the cushion to the base which there are that way you can set it aside and reupholster just the cushion so I am just gonna go straight over this fabric that's already here it's already got the padding and the batting there's no point in me taking this off just to cover it up again all right so what we're gonna do is we're gonna find a great spot on this dress there are some seams in here so I just want to make sure that those are lining up okay so I might actually do it this so now I know how I want it positioned so I'm just going to staple on to the bottom the key with reupholstering something flat like this is just making sure that it's nice and taut but not too taught that it puckers so usually do opposite sides to make sure that it's nice and secure on one edge and then I do opposite sides on the other edge and then I work around to the corner and then of course I'm going to need to trim all this excess and snippety bippity bop whoo-hoo look how cute guys and then I fastened it back on here a new revamp upcycle stool for your butt [Music] [Music] by the time I have her dresser here and I have the bookshop here so the plan is to bring them in to the space again in a new different way this dresser is in great shape the paint job however could use some sprucing up which is why we have our beautiful blue color that we picked out together and I have her bookshelf here which obviously is a vertical bookshelf but the plan is to turn it on its side so that it becomes horizontal which will be much better for the space instead of one random bookshelf sticking up in there the problem is the shelves are going the wrong way so Joey is going to have to work his construction magic but I'm gonna get to painting because I don't know how many codes we're gonna need to do look at these handles they are actually really cool kind of distressed handles which is totally her style so I'm gonna leave these white I think it'll be really pretty so I just need to remove these take the drawers out paint the color let's see how it looks guys [Music] [Applause] hey how's it going that looks beautiful are you done with Alko feigning just very small alcove you want me to take this stuff over yes okay so are you clear about what's happening with this yeah you're gonna go have art projects to do I want to paint that mirror I have whole gallery wall to build there you go great do a great job [Music] guys we have a gallery wall and fortunately Britney has a starting out pretty well because she has things like this awesome piece of art that her it was her sister who painted this we are going to build around this and obviously we have our predominant blue here some green and yellow and orange those are our colors guys yay thank you art piece we also have our other things on hand from the thrift store we have our clock that's bringing him a little bit more of a modern feel but a nice round shape we have this golden disc that we're just gonna call a little mini golden mirror that Joey found and then I want to do a quote because I noticed she has a couple quotes in her bathroom and at her kitchen so I want to bring in the element of text his that will give it a more updated feel so we have like the vintage artwork next to then a more modern quote so the other thing that she had is this really cute painting of Coney Oh her cat but I just think that this isn't a big enough frame for this amazing fat cat so I was thinking it could be kind of cool if we took this painting that we got from the thrift store which is open there's no glass here and took out this canvas and put it on here kind of feeding modern art with the still life of the flowers behind Coney oh just kind of sticking out I think it'll look cool and very collage II and very kind of found object flea market meets chic Ness by that we're going for how cute such an easy fix [Music] and look pony Oh frolicking amongst the flowers how cute let's take this old frame that used to house pony oh and put some cork in it so that way it just becomes a little mini cork board should you like pin up another quote or pin up one of her polaroid pictures [Music] it's perfectly and it's really nice and thick so I don't now need the backing for the frame you just basically use the little tabs that were there before holding the backing in so last let's do in this black frame from the thrift store a quote and I want to do a quote about dreams because I noticed she had one about dreaming in her kitchen so I'm going off the theme so I'm gonna use a pencil to just line out where I want the quote before I commit with my pen and then I'm using my favorite brush pen you guys this is the Pentel pocket brush pen I've used it for years now to get that kind of brushy look it's very imperfect which I like because I am NOT a calligraphy artist by any means [Music] [Music] okay guys we are going to DIY with some spray paint and I've got a lot of items in front of me all of these things are hers this mirror is the mirror that we found at the goodwill so I want to unify all of these items because as you can see right now they're not really telling a story there isn't really a cohesive color palette and that is really what is going to make that room feel like it's decorated and designed and there's a point of view in there so we're gonna use these knickknacks to further reinforce our color palette oh my gosh goodbye ugly thrift store mirror hello glam see anything with like a detail on it like this sprayed all gold look so cool you want to say about six to ten inches away from the object that you're spray-painting because if you get too close it's gonna get drippy and that's not the look we're going for and it's also really hard to clean up [Music] kind of looks cool like partially painted oh so many cute pictures ok so Britney is a big fan of these little mini and stacks Polaroids as I am as well and I'm sure a lot of you guys are and I feel like this our nighttime sky above the bed is the perfect place to put wait for it wait for it wait for it so these strung up then with these clips onto the Strand is just going to look so dreamy in there and really kind of anchor the space even more because she doesn't have headboard and it's just gonna be so close thank you so let's do it [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] our gold gilded mirror like remember how ugly that was you guys just a few hours ago and now it is the crown jewel of her new little vanity it's so cute in here what do you guys think [Applause] [Music] we have really opened up the space there's room to move around now it feels like this is the bedroom area there's areas in here and guess what we only got rid of one piece of furniture her desk so now we're using the vanity double as the desk I feel like that's a great compromise in here and I feel like this room is so cute it's so vintage inspired we definitely have the essence of Brittany in here her collectibles all of her knickknacks but now they're like prized possessions I can't believe we used everything it's pretty great babe oh my god are you ready yes okay and we're gonna count to three imagine your space before ready yeah yeah [Music] do you recognize that place that was your bookshelf yeah flipped over and redid the Shelby in it this is a pretty big solution to put your bed headfirst in here so that way every not of your TV [Music] [Applause] [Music] like from the couch so you know easy storage and so one compromise was the desk and the vanity became one okay right cuz I had to slim down something and we're gonna be able to get that low yeah but I feel like it works so much better God did this all for under through their box yeah no way yeah yeah you made it easy for us cuz we didn't really have to get a lot of stuff well I'm your walls already P Joey didn't have to paint obviously paint it in there and just make that look so your job and let the twinkle and all your big I took the pictures that were all around around your kitchen and on the frames and then just meet them one epic I can't believe how well this works to like yeah a good solution because like the bed was like the entire corner I know I know and so you still have your big bed but now you have the space to move around and fold this out your beautiful chair you can pull that open the colors are all any of my stuff and I love the handles it's like so cool it's amazing I literally can't believe this is our place [Music] [Music] we finally did it guys you have been asking for a studio apartment design and what better way to do it than in a day with less than $300 I mean look the it was clear when we walked out of there how pulled together was color palette pieces and so guys make sure it subscribe we got a lot more of these coming this year and and we want to hear from you what you want to see next so leave a comment let us know what you want us to do next on a budget and

hello everybody.welcome oh my gosh my creative weirdos I'm so excited to have you here with me today because we are doing DIY gifts which I love I know you guys love because Courtney's DIY for holidays it's just more personal it's just fun too so we are going to get into a lot of fun stuff and thankfully this DIY is in line with our theme here at mr. Cade studios which is all about a sustainable holiday because you guys know we have so much stuff in our back rooms we're trying to inch our way through all of our supplies and usually have as opposed to buying new stuff and we're also getting to use this really cool new printer by HP who's actually our sponsor for today's video tada okay thank you and what are we making today we are making DIY gift boxes so these are really fun way if let's say you're giving someone the gift of like a trip or an experience or a gift card or even just like a memory box it's a really fun way to personalize and put some little different trinkets that kind of tell a story when they're all together in a box and it's a really fun way to receive a gift so I am going to make something for my sister that is spa themed I want to take her on a sister spa day and then out to dinner which I think will be really fun so this box would be kind of all about celebrating our sister relationship Kona know we have the fun DIY to get into I'm going to go over all the supplies so you can see what items I take in that we just have on hand but they're also really for you guys to find at your local past or maybe you also have them on hand we have one of those slide top boxes and paintbrushes and white acrylic paint some beautiful tape this is a washi tape paint brush for the stain some ribbon some beautiful soap some other things I'm going to put in the box and why is my phone sitting here because I'm going to actually print out pictures from my phone on the printer and I'm going to use some of these adorable papers that are actually stickers that you could either just use them as printed photos or she could use them and put them places she could even put them on the outside box whatever that's the plan guys let's get into the actual staining of this box now this one I had on hand like I said you could really easily find these at the craft store they're just unfinished pinewood usually they're made out of and it's gonna look really good to stain it and this is a cherry stain I have here but you could pick whatever colors mean you like so I'm gonna stand on the inside of the box first to just kind of get my technique down a bit it's a very subtle kind of reddish toned and with stain you can do multiple coats this is really pretty this will go well in my little sister's home you guys know my little sister Tasha the gremlin I call her the gremlin the soundtrack so you can see the difference here stained rock stage you whoo all right our beautiful stained box is dry and now it's time to start filling the box which is the fun part so I'm going to load some of this paper in to the HP Deskjet printer here and what's really cool as a printer Auto to text the size of the paper which is great because you know like an eagle in the settings and hey fun fact guys this is actually the world's smallest all-in-one printer I am the smallest all-in-one perfect anyways so I've got my paper loaded in I'm going to open the app that goes with this printer and select one of my photos I created a photo album with the pictures that I want to print my little stack for test and I like this picture I'll start with and you can actually crop in the app which is cool which I'm going to do a square crop because I like when it prints out and kind of looks like a Polaroid you know with like a bigger border at the bottom and now I just press print oh okay it's printing below so obviously this is just one picture and I'm going to print out a whole back which I'm going to tie it with a cute little ribbon so I'll bet be getting two more printing all right so I've got my amazing stack of photos already printed and I want to add some other items and stuff off again to kind of make it a whole experience for her we love this piece of place here in LA called Mota so I'm gonna take you out to dinner to a pizza place but in order to express that idea I'm gonna give her something else that she's been wanting which is the mystic ate pizza necklace which you guys probably know it's just a really cute little tiny slice pizza with some crystal detail on it I'm gonna package it a little bit differently and I thought it was a really cute idea to hang this little sketch that I did of a pizza but it's missing this lay so now I just have to print oh my gosh Miguel commute okay love it alright so now I'm going to have this little piece of scrap cardboard here I'm going to make a spoke so few times and use the scissors okay so now I have my little cute Etha cut out and I'm going to fit my necklace now just kind of around it I'm going to use scissors cut so the chain lays in and then I'm just going to take the excess and just tape it down so that it keeps it nice and not tangled when it goes in the box along the back I'm just using clear day so I want to do something cute on the top of it and I think the word escape is like a really great word because to me that's what a spa day is you're kind of sleeping I'm going to use a pencil to sketch out the word first so that I like how it looks before I commit to my paint y'all fit okay I like how this look so I'm going to just put a dollop of my wife's feet here and this is freehand painting which I like the look of it I think it looks more organic and done I have these three paint brushes on hand they're just different thicknesses but they all have the tapered points which looks like a calligraphy brush which will just help me get that kind of look to the letter oh my gosh okay so this is looking really cool and next step is to get all of my beautiful items into the gift box I have a layout here a beautiful grid of the photos that I printed you can see here I just folded up a piece of gold tissue paper and put it here at the bottom of the box only because I'm going to be putting some moss in and stuff like that so it's just a good way to protect the bottom of the box I am going to arrange little bed of the different pieces and the moss is good to use because the box is deep so it's just kind of filling up a little bit of that area you know I'm going to collect up my pictures okay so I think the top picture I want to be this mama and baby pig because well it's basically me and my sister my mama and she's baby pig and they're just so cute and I took this picture while we were together in the Bahamas so I'm going to take this beautiful cranberry colored velvet ribbon and I'm just going to do like a little PEZ of tie around the picture all right I have my cute little stack of photos here so I'll put these in first okay so these pictures look amazing flap we're gonna add some little beautiful other items to just kind of complement the whole story so I have these beautiful handmade soaps this woman who runs this business called five golden apples she can make these she sent me a huge box of them so thank you look at these beautiful colors so I'm just gonna tie these up with a little piece of twine and I thought this little pressed pink rose here like so now all I have to do is my beat the necklace perfect right there so some of those little trinkets are just like really beautiful to have so these pretty little amethyst and rose quartz and just clear quartz just kind of kicking out around these little items I just have to finish it off with another little printed moment for my little mr. gremlin sister please enjoy a spa and pizza day with me big sister so this is what I will just place on the top of this box so when she opens it up she knows exactly what this story is telling done so you could add a bow around this box but I kind of just loved it like this expanding Turks inside of you can wrap a ribbon so that's sort of the gift experience I really had so much fun building this box I hope that you guys got inspired for your DIY gift I think that obviously there's so many options for how to personalize these boxes literally everyone in your life could get a box like this just different little trinkets that kind of speak to them or speak to your relationship with that please let me know in the comments do you think and if you have any ideas or you do this
