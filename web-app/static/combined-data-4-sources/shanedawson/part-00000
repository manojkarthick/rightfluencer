exactly hey man that's be like I'm a straight guy Qaeda hey man hope you had a good holiday I may or may not have watched 14-minute vine compilations of yours because I'm a fucking creep that Sunday because I made vine that is true I did lay in my bed and watch like a gimp you didn't scale it the guys played a real reason no no I'm literally saying no I want to do a bright future the real reason was because in your pictures it was different pictures of it you came across very like intimidating kind of creepy and like very like and the second era dish and I fucking hate YouTube and hate all the ships I do talk like that yeah so I wanted to also still make sure that like you weren't like ribs oh and I saw one vine that you probably weighed like 30 times more than you do now yes and you were just and I was like me perfect this could work yeah so that's why I wanted to look at your body and make sure it was obtainable yeah well it is good news the good news boys okay oh you said oh God oh yeah this is Beckett hmm a beautiful man watched me for 14 minutes I gotta be honest I'm the opposite of creeped out hello Shane oh no but don't know what that is you listen to what you said hey okay okay first of all a beautiful man yes you are you still are you stop it he's very handsome I told him all the time oh my god oh I can't wait Wow that actually meet my heart mouth oh ha ha hey being a beautiful you are not only insanely attractive but I love your bio and what is it not true yes like what you said about what you're looking for one of the few guys I've seen on here but is Allah we would have beautiful the inside as they are on the out it's chair like an amazing person inside granted I don't know you might be a sociopath either way to come entry no the fact in my words were not only well received but we seed it all by you so it's a great deal thank you for telling me that hey also I gotta apologize for making your heart stop oh no I don't know oh my god I don't think hearts are supposed to do that have it kill dude it's no you know what I'm saying it they're still to you that we can eat load all the chips nowheres believe me that's not going to stop me or us you know what I was saying it in like a tool sort of way but honestly definitely casually for now I'm going to come this is good so I edited with I think hearts are not supposed to do that have it killed you know it was actually needed sometimes I think I'm dead it was a nice shocking jolt to wake me up dark yeah still Garrett how did you Sunday my sunday was great in a nutshell I crafted and ate a burrito to my favorite activities youth that's true crafted in eight you know I literally did nothing I actually can't think of one thing I did I took a shower and I keep saying I'll do it soon it's 10 p.m. this little morsel is the conversations we have nowadays oh boy oh it's getting rough sighs it's all sneak peek I'm a laid-back guy with very few pretensions I'd rather lose a finger than consumer microwaved burrito I allow myself just one burrito every weekend not sure why I would never microwave a burrito cut to you eating shit you find under the cow I did find something under the couch last night a box of cheeses um as for your nothing day I'm proud of you okay now I'd like to discuss your face I love to say I said that oh no don't react like back to look what you said okay yeah the game was really you better read it word for word what your changes thank God I mean you're gorgeous so I could put up with a mile of microwave burrito how weird I was just going to discuss you your face oh okay you just tossed it right back I kind of like you discussing my face but for now let's focus on years hold on I need to emotionally join you hang on let's take a 10-minute break all right it's not so often I super like a guy what Uncle Sam okay sexy okay it's not too often I super like a guy based on one face photo alone but you have zero words in your profile but your face transcends all that I could feel one of those I'm so sorry don't do it Oh God I could feel one of those Harriet the Spy style compilation notebooks from cover to cover with how much I like the details of your face [Applause] that actually I like it was creepy but I liked it because I'm not Harry despot - okay now my heart is completely melted on the floor and I'm going to tender my fucking new here is where it'll paws are the most horrible horror stories of him on tinder that things between me and between Rylan those creatures I'm sorry I mean those nice nice people I did it in yourself he doesn't know what a super like what that's true until you did it and it's super made we're gonna super killer it look easy okay I'm gonna call him that on here but I've got a question before I go I understand you're new to tinder so if this strikes you is off-colored I get it and we can continue talking here but these tiny words on this tiny screen while they only go so far what I'm trying to say here is I'd like to take you out on a proper date you should write Conor Francis new poetry fuck da pitch-black silence okay and I promised that in real life I will neither stop or melt your heart I was trying to say like I'm not going to kill you thank you you're welcome Oh a visit where it's really dark does it really yeah oh I don't know what's happening I said of course I'd love that and then I said also it's not fair that I got to Google talk to you and you didn't get to stalk me by the way just let you guys know when I'm on tinder I use a fake name what do you mean nude Shane but I think I have either big last name or no last name my full name is Shane Dawson and I have a very weird job I just wanted to be upfront about it because I know a lot of people are turned off by it but if you're not then I can't wait to have a breda with you now this is my way I'm saying like hey whatever but also seeing what your reaction was because if your reaction was like okay I knew the whole time I loved your video I would have been like a match no no no that's Jabba here was your reaction hold up the very same Shane Dawson that I've been told that I physically resemble about once a week for my entire adult life this is very ironic and endlessly amusing so I didn't realize when I saw his picture I just thought what a handsome guy hello but when he said that name because once a month to Mike oh she knows a Jane Austen well I said oh my god that's amazing and here god you're way more attractive than me I like the way they got left in the womb for Texas Oh God does that happen with me when babies you're left in the wooden kitchen Lord it is more than this this static you know I'm hands-on thing no I don't find your job to be a turn-off and I do not find you anymore less wonderful than I did at the start of this conversation damn it that is funny though huh I don't think you understand how often I hear this you just mean by night you're very sweet that is pretty amazing though and not surprising the universe is super funny but next it is sweet tight my handsome overbake twin twin night my taller more conventionally attractive older brothers little brother oh good you came up oh yeah cuz I have a little younger than you I was like whoa this is great like I finally found somebody that's like normal but still sad and like physically kind of looks like me this could actually work right and then I give you my number you didn't text me for literally a week now I don't remember details like this I'm not like big on the superlight games like I'm not like yeah you gotta wait three days and sort things so I don't know what I was up to okay so then they texted me and then we were just like finally texting like I think planning a date or something but then we started sending each other like videos bagging for pictures and like we have them all so the first video you ever sent me because use that one first when if you were at some bar or something and then you sent me a video now one am i well thirsty Oh close it [Music] sounds stupid concentration hopefully [Music] oh he's literally like 18 feet away he just ran first of all connect to take you but I sex appears ghosty it is the safest I know brave with his cheese good I know I'm sorry we're helpful circle it is because now we don't know what's coming in I'm scared why because hounds go go hunting yeah you might not get out like whenever now so then I sent you a video the next day okay first of all hi ready second of all um I have done manual labor okay you don't know shit you know my life you don't know oh wow I guess you like made fun of me and said I don't know how to do labor I think I was moving or something what if what if we figure out a hobby that we both like doing and then we can do it even okay now then I think I told you if we don't figure out a plan to meet up and have a date I'm going to kill myself or something yeah and then you sent me there oh I wonder 6:00 a.m. oh my god we don't figure this shit out I'm going to kill myself I get it um I I don't want you sending video messages I like via messages but a will admit to not finding suicide jokes very funny um so maybe refrain I mean you don't have to refrain with me I got a sense of humor I'm looking forward to our date by the way then it will be good and it's been a few hours really if you think about it those are the last dumb words ever spoken by Karen but it turns out that his ghost is still insisting on taking you out that's sweet off he's off doing some right now oh my god maybe over team itself but he'll give you the details of your date tonight later this afternoon that's sweet I don't hate that I hate that we were sending each other like YouTube videos like I always like Russia and then you were like the book no no that was very sweet and I liked it I was scared but I liked it so then I sent you a video of me very sweaty I feel a judgment and I feel like because I haven't had curry you're almost using that it was like like I had high school I remember this now you wanted to go get curry for the first date and I said no come on remember that would give you a homeless diarrhea and I was expecting like you know just five so I was trying to eat it all right and then we started finding each other weird what is this this one point eight seconds long one scared look

we're on the same level is like James Charles and Gigi gorgeous have you ever peed your pants like every week but because 73 questions is always so scripted I thought why don't we do one where we

your thoughts on it so you know how I did that video where I confronted Blair yes this one's a little more intense so I want to do a video where I talk to dad okay I think that's a good idea okay so you think it's a good at I do absolutely what do you hope happens from it maybe just closure to the past [Laughter] you know you're a man now honey you're building your home and your family Oh No [Music] so I think it's I think that's what I would hope for honey is just a new beginning you know you've got Ryland and you're building your family and he's your father he's family yeah I mean that's how I feel too I'm still scared though well we don't have to get into the whole divorce aspect of it because that's a lot but I mean how do you feel now because I know that like 10 years ago this would never have happened well for so many years after the divorce there was just a lot going on raising kids just a lot of challenges and stuff and I think as I've gotten older and I can look back on it and see my part in it is well you know we were very young met him at 17 married him right out of high school he was young so I just think we did the best we could I had issues and things in my life as well yeah I think that's what I realized when I got older was that like both parents probably had issues and I was so close to you that like I just saw him as this monster which now I need to figure out who he actually exactly so I was thinking you've always kept pictures and photo albums and things like that I've never looked at that because like I have a weird thing about childhood I just don't like looking at it but since I'm doing this I should see what it was so let's get some pictures let's look and hopefully I don't have a nervous breakdown [Music] all right okay I think this is probably the last one I have oh my gosh I'm a horrific a panic attack so oh my god that's actually your father and you that's me uh-huh all right oh my god I look like him oh my god wait is that you guys yes I literally look like him oh yeah is that my penis my glasses on them because I oh my god triggered I make an O shape not a snake so I kind of wanted to oh my god that is so weird well this is this is mentor this is what I was just talking about this is where I'm gonna meet Ventura is probably my best memories honey oh my god well those were his favorite pictures so I am I enjoy I enjoy going to pattern oh my god it's the one time in my whole life I took my shirt off swimming was I ever skin well you go up and see grandma and I think grandma kept giving you cookies there you are at the promised you but I want to show you as far as you looking just like it but if you go through and you you know you have your nest basin [Music] why was he skidding he also struggled with his weight and then when he I think was in high school he lost his weight and started lifting weights but look at the grin honey oh that one's crazy yeah I mean I think if someone looked at that they would just say oh that shame okay well I need a diarrhea and then I am going to go see dad do you want me to take him your nudes or you just stop mom says hi all right wish me luck oh I love you son and I'm proud of you all right okay so I just left my mom's house and that was way more emotional than I was expecting I had never seen those pictures of my mom and dad at their wedding and seeing my dad hold my mom's face and how happy they were like really fucked me up I had never seen my mom and dad happy before in my childhood so seeing that picture definitely changes things it even more so makes me want to do this video because I want to have a relationship with him and I want them to have a relationship to you know like I want to have holidays where my mom and dad can see each other because I think she misses him and I hope he misses her all right I'm gonna go inside and kiss her Island and hold him and hug him and tomorrow's the big day [Music] okay we are on our way to Ventura Beach this is a lot yeah that looks like the one from one ounce of kids I did oh my god oh my god oh my god I see it too this is so weird I'm sorry I'm scared [Music]

don't have the licenses wait so you're not okay so they just told us a scary story I couldn't film it cuz we were backstage he said the six flexes legitly haunted my little boy who had a blood disease and he came here and then died not here close but they said that he still roams around and security guards see and people that work here see him he's a little boy with blue blue shirt dark dark hair and that sometimes the right operators will see him in the corner of their eyes when they're closing down and they'll let the ride go one last time yeah and she couldn't we couldn't film her saying it because they took us those like abandoned old ride that was his favorite ride that's up there drew do you believe my kind of big shot but supposedly that's where he hangs out they said he was in a wheelchair at the end of his life and that's the only ride you can get up to so if we see a ghost kid in a wheelchair we're spooking her oh yeah Jacob she says she's gonna take us to where they spot him the most do you believe no am I the only one that believes the Halloween there's a little boy is that Jacob I'm so gullible okay supposedly this is where Jacob gets spotted the most although I'm the only one that believes it is not here that was one who been spotted the little boy so it was right under here wait so you believe this I know many of you losing him you're laughing I don't like dog who was like can I go be with him but just kind of like anybody lose vibe down that do you see anything I feel weird am I the only person that believes us no I feel like you should behind me [Music] I don't believe the blood disease thing I think he died in the right oh he's not touching me maybe he doesn't stand me we'll find em Jacob I asked him to touch my hand okay this is getting creepy get under my cloak Jacob James trying to get a diet coke and it's not working we think it might be haunted this is the scariest thing that's happened over okay so we're not supposed to film the maze we're gonna try to sneak our camera and hopefully we don't get kicked out crew do you think we can do it he can sleep their camera anywhere the fuck we want okay we're going into a maze really creepy house looks a lot like my creepy house are you sure wait where do we go where are we going oh my god what is that oh my god you snort he's snorting like a pig at me that's my big brother okay so this maze is called toys a terror once again I don't know if I'm able to film I'm gonna try I felt a connection that was good drew how do you feel a lot of fun you had a connection with that one girl we're in some like weird Club thing I don't understand mother blamed Ruth's favorite song and he's very excited it will stop all right gonna go down [Music] [Applause] [Music] come on patina [Music] how did you die how did you die blood disease what's in a blood disease where's your wheelchair picking win a bar that was insane just the thought of the cart flying off and all of us dying that sounds like the most horrible that note would be the best ending of this video so we couldn't film obviously because my camera would have flown and killed somebody but they do do they take pictures or something what do they do they build us sharda monetizing away okay so we just found out that the front row did not have cameras I love fun time let's do it before the video start like making out for you cuz like you made that fucking choice I'm sorry I'm in a bad mood okay now we're about to see our video it better be good oh my god that's crazy we put a dead guy oh my god fixing

probably not anywhere with rollercoasters cuz I'm done make sure to go over to all of their channels they all have funny videos up to my dress a scary night we're gonna die on the freeway bye I'm cereal [Music] 
guys guess what we just did a podcast with a little pony very Abraham time it was my birthday so we had a lot of birthday surprises I had a lot of special guests Wendy Williams might be involved it was a lot I'll put a link down there it's not Clara consulship friends but hey guys I know this is supposed to be a scary video with scary music and a candle and all of that but I am so excited right now I literally am shaking today is the day we are finally going to talk to Lu Mikayla now I have been talking about little Mikayla for a year is she real is she fake all the theories about who this person actually is and even some of you guys have made videos about it yeah she looks like a freaking cartoon character like what's good girl was good like you look like a freakin Simpson cartoon character like if if you're real who doesn't make up now for the last year the story of who is little Mikayla has completely blown up I mean there are hundreds of articles asking who is she who created her what is the story behind this girl Huffington Post which is a huge website even said lo Mikayla instagrams latest eight girl who's confusing the hell out of everyone even news channels on YouTube were talking about it just check out what Philip DeFranco had to say the internet scene is be confused if an Instagram girl by the name of Lil Mikayla is a real person or a cartoon let's look at some pictures and not a real person boom done sound don't know how anyone was confused look at her look at any other woman that's ever in the frame with her but then Phil says something that actually was pretty deep and I might blow up Mikayla is as real as every other Instagram model you follow is as real as me for a lot of you what I mean by that is if we never meet each other in person I really only ever exist in your phone your computer your TV screen literally everybody in my life has been talking about this person even some of my YouTube friends have 17 theories I just cropped the freaking case of low Michaela whoever is filming for Michaela is sitting on the right side of the runway sitting right next one with a green hat on and next to a girl as well so I found the video if you go all the way down on her Instagram almost - at the beginning she has this video right here at Paris Fashion Week just invited to my first show thank you and Sophie Madsen's to do at Paris Fashion Week so if you go to this video right here with aunt Sophia knots and ready-to-wear Paris Fashion Week right there there's the orange scarf and there's Lola Kayla there she freakin is right there filming on the phone to upload to the Instagram crack the case before we get to the interview I just want to break down a few things so there's a new theory that I did not know about and it kind of seems like it might be real there's a girl named Nicole or Garrow and she's a 3d graphic artist and just take a look at her Instagram page yeah some really impressive 3d art but also a lot of them look like little Michaela and then if you look at a picture of just her it literally looks like lil Mikaela before they added on like digital features so is it her is she little Mikaela and this is one of her art projects or is this some bigger plan is this a gimmick created by the record labels because the music industry is struggling right now so did they think creating a digital artist would somehow blow up and make them a lot of money because that's not the first time something like that has happened now I'm sure some of you guys remember the band Gorillaz yeah this was a virtual band all the members of the band were cartoons and all of their voices and instruments and everything was created by one guy Damon Albarn was the brainchild behind her illness he sang all the songs you wrote most of them but a lot of people don't know that they think of the gorillas as cartoon band even in Japan for the ten years they've had their own digital popstar her name is Hatsune Miku and she literally is a pop star who performs live using a hologram watch [Music] yeah literally a hologram people are screaming it's crazy but it's awesome and it's genius and if you like that's what the little Michaela thing is now the biggest question is why do we care and why are we so interested and fascinated by it and feel kind of weird about it well that's because of a theory called the uncanny valley now the uncanny valley is a hypothesis the human replicas which appear almost but not exactly quite like human beings make people feel eeriness and revulsion just looking at a robot or a digital person that's too realistic literally makes your insights feel something most people feel uncomfortable a little anxiety a little fear and a lot of people feel that way when they look at pictures of little Michaela now there is a line so basically if a robot or a digital person doesn't look that real people feel comfortable and they almost feel happy but if it gets too far and it looks too real that's when people start to feel uncomfortable so I'm going to show you a few examples of the different lines now first I'm going to show you a video of a child robot now this does not look that real so you should probably just feel nothing yeah I mean it's kind of creepy but it clearly looks like a robot so you probably don't have a feeling of fear okay so this next one I'm going to show you is a little closer to the uncomfortable line this is a video of the robot getting some dental work time I mean it still looks like a robot so I'm not completely over here yet but I'm still way more uncomfortable than I was when I was watching the kid now I'm going to show you the full side of uncomfortableness now you're probably may expect me to show you some crazy robot that looks just like a person I'm gonna show you a clip from the video game where the people inside of it looks so incredibly real there's something off and I don't know about you but when I see clips of this it just makes me feel weird just junior so you've picked a name on one of Michael but seeing is we're having a girl that didn't work well keep Michael in your hip pocket that way when he's are better Oh beautiful do you see what I mean like it's super real but there's something off but it looks crazy real like if you squint your eyes that looks like a video of a family sitting down at a restaurant but then when you really focus you're like wait no there's something wrong that is way over here on this side of the line that is where little Michaela lies now that leads us to today I'm expecting a phone call from little Michaela I literally can't I'm freaking out but let me just okay so before we get to the phone call I just need to like process this with you guys let me explain how I imagined this to go firstly I do not think lo Michaela is going to answer the number one question of these who are you I think she's gonna ignore that I think she's gonna be like I'm Michaela and I'm gonna be like yeah but like are you 50 Rome and she'll be like no I'm sure like it's gonna be like that but I don't even care like I just need to hear a voice I need to talk to her I need to figure this out so I know this is probably gonna be frustrating because we're not gonna get all the answers we want but I'm hoping that this will like get us some of them and I know going into it gonna be annoyed and I'm gonna be frustrated but I'm still saying yes to the interview because it's a little bit Kayla and I just I need it and I am so so nervous so I'm gonna turn off this camera and I'm gonna wait and the next time you see me be on the phone okay guys she just texted me saying she is calling in like a minute I'm freaking out okay okay I have my questions here I'm gonna get all Diane Sawyer on this girl so I'm gonna record the phone calls so the audio will actually sound good because she oh my god I genuinely am I'm sure okay okay so first of all you sound like a girl you don't sound like a group of fifty year old guys no that was like the rudest comment I ever got I'm not so 50 year old man like excuse me bench no that's me okay so I listen I have all my questions written out I'm really really nervous this is the most excited I think I've ever been and I'm gonna hit you with really hard questions okay okay I'm ready okay so number one who are you this may be shocking but I'm Michaela I knew it but are you a girl who is digitally enhancing their pictures on Instagram so look thank so I keep getting asked if I'm real or fake but I'm really here I'm really talking to you I'm really gme people i'm just trying to make some great art and make the world her less that was a very strategic so what you're saying is you are a real person I'm talking to you right now so maybe you do facetune or digitally change your pictures who doesn't photos who does not edit their photos you are making this very hard okay so you do digitally enhancer pictures that is confirmed who doesn't question number two why didn't you want to show your face in this interview why did you say no to Skype or in person why did you want to do a phone well it's not really a trustworthy place out there especially for those who are different I think a phone calls a good entry-level point and what's better than a phone call these days okay okay um why did this take so long to put together we've been wanting to do this interview for months so what made you finally decide to do it well I decided a while ago but just never really got to it I've been working on my music my modeling campaign you know shit takes time so it took you a long time to put it together there are because you're making music which makes the theory that maybe there is some company trying to create a digital popstar make sense how did you jump to that conclusion I mean listen this is probably the biggest theory and my personal belief is that yes maybe you're a real person but maybe you have a good voice and you don't have like the look and maybe a company is trying to make a digital pop star because Digital pop stars will never age and you can make them prettier and maybe you're saying something about like the world of pop culture by being digital like there's a lot of theories like I think the intellectual stuff that I've read is really thought-provoking like the idea that being commentary on what's real and how the Internet is changing relationships but I think people's interpretations of me say way more about them okay so I'm gonna go through a list of people who people think you actually are and then you tell me if it's true okay love it okay people think that I'm little Michaela true totally true theory has been confirmed second one Nicole roogie era who is a 3d digital artist people think that that's what I'm doing okay the other big one is Darth Vader she's so cute some people think that you are a promotion for the new Sims game the suit is pretty good so you know shots fired okay all right now you've been promoting a lot of stuff on Instagram like clothes and music and candles and other stuff so some people think that you were created to promote stuff I would never say that I have promoted anything everything that I've worn or tagged that's my style and it's usually something that my friends have made or collaborated on I've never been paid to promote anything so where are you from okay Downey so like South LA oh hey I grew up in Sedona in Long Beach so you grew okay interesting so you grab next to me okay so if your front down you then tell me one place that you liked to go exclaims that is so weird and specific because that is true but you could've just googled that but that was fast okay next question music okay so you started putting out music and it sounds very heavily auto-tune almost like a robot thoughts I'm just trying to express myself I hate that we always have to label things but I guess that's just how the world works I mean listen I'm gonna go back to the beginning of this just ask one more time is little Michaela an actual person that I can meet in real life and she will look like her Instagram pictures that you get to meet me in real life you will see what you see on my Instagram I just don't like really want to get into that right now I hope you can respect that yeah I mean listen my main thing and I told you this in the first time we ever deemed or emailed or anything but like if this is a situation where you feel like unattractive or there's something like that where you're afraid to show your face or there's something and you're hiding it like just know that honestly if you were to come out and show your real self I don't think people would I think people would embrace it I think people would freak out and be excited and love you even more than they do as a virtual looking person I know I got some really devoted fans that got my back through everything but when the time is right I'll share more interesting listen if you do some damn interview with dr. Phil or something where you show your real face and you don't come to me first I'm very mad okay look deal well thank you so much for this weird interview I don't I feel like I got some answers but also not really but either way it this is a incredible moment for my life thank you thank you Shane you're the best oh I can't wait to meet it's over I'm sweating okay let's let's talk about that I need to talk about this first of all let me just say I felt like that went better than I expected I was not expecting her to answer anything I was expecting her to be like a Robotboy or like Siri or some shit and be like no yes Michaela like that I was expecting so to hear like a real girl's voice was trippy so I think Mikael is a real person like I think there is a real girl but I definitely think that there was somebody else behind it mainly because the entries were very like calculated and like PR style a she like didn't answer my questions but kind of did and then threw me off a few times and I don't know all of that felt very like calculated but then at the end when I brought up like maybe she has a deformity or maybe she's like doesn't like herself and created a person like she got quiet and then she was just like listen I'll explain later like so it almost felt like that might be it but I don't know I don't know this is all so weird I'm so uncomfortable I literally have the chills so long story short the interview was a success coming up I feel like we did it it was fun I talked to her it was weird do we get all the interest no was I expecting that no but my final wrap up is I think Mikael is real I think there's some somebody behind her I think they are trying to make her puff star and I think they're trying to make some kind of a message like about facetune in digital enhancement what is real and what isn't real I think it's like some deep heavy F shit but listen I might be wrong I don't know let me know down the comments who do you think will Michaela is what do you think AHA I don't know I feel like I should be mad I feel like I should be like hits the interview didn't really answer my questions but I also am excited that I did it and I talked to her a lot of emotions all right you guys I'm gonna go I don't know what this was hopefully you enjoyed it if you didn't give me a thumbs up and haha alright you guys make sure to subscribe my channel hit the notification bell below because I make new videos every single day and if you want to sell my other conspiracy theory video that's out but a link to a playlist or top description but don't want alright you guys I'll see you tomorrow tomorrow's even real bar 
you make me laugh every time I watch a video every time I talk to you every time we talk in text even texts make me laugh and that I cherish and yeah you up it I have everybody up but thank you for being entertaining and funny I can't tell hey what's a viz yes welcome back to another creepy video now I am warning you what I'm about to talk about is going to make you literally check every single inch of every single room that you go into for the rest of your life because today we're gonna be talking about hidden cameras all around the world there's over 250 million security cameras watching us at all times on any normal day where you're just walking around outside you're probably getting seen on camera between 75 and 300 times and these cameras are everywhere they're on every single phone every single street corner every single business every building anywhere you could imagine there is a camera now I know that's a lot of cameras 250 millions a lot but you know it's not included in that number the millions and millions of hidden cameras that's right there are millions of micro cameras filming you all day every day in places that you would never even suspect oh and by the way anybody can do it you can literally go on Amazon and buy a micro camera for $13 so today we're gonna be talking about some of the scariest footage that's ever been captured on a hidden camera now I'm just warning you some of these stories are incredibly triggering and dark actually all of them before we get into the video I just want to show you how genuinely terrified I am I literally have all my webcams covered with the tape and I also will never get naked in a dressing room but we'll get to that later okay so this purse story is insane and it involves a locker a renowned physics professor a businessman and an insurance agent they were all busted for hiding cameras in women's locker rooms that's right locker room hidden cameras there's some people that they're so incredibly demented that they set up hidden cameras in locker rooms when you're changing and you're vulnerable but the scariest thing is these cameras are almost impossible to find so there was a girl named Mia Walker and she found out that this was happening to her in her locker room but the way she found out was because her mom found the camera I was just standing there I was like mom what are you looking at and she was like there's a camera in there and I was like what do you mean Mia had no idea that for four months this woman was secretly videotaping her and the other youngsters getting undressed in the locker room that's insane her mom is literally waiting for her to get changed and then sees a camera lens flare and then finds the wire and finds the camera I mean that's some way detective stuff now think about how truly terrifying that would be to find a camera in a place that you change every day and you're completely naked not knowing who's recording it but also not knowing where it's broadcasting and the saddest part about this whole thing is that these cameras were planted by a woman who has children of her own I just thought how could a mom do this to another mom this video actually shows wanka pocket in the act of setting up the hidden camera but says the video wasn't for her she was having an affair with a guy who got a sick perversion out of watching the material now the fact that she was planting the cameras and recording the locker room for some guy does not make her not guilty because Melissa and her boyfriend had a very smooth operation going his name is Carl antic and you can see him prepping a camera which he later gave to his mistress it was like organized crime like they had a system now because they were caught with four years of a legal locker room footage they were put in jail for a long time they got a combined 20 years plus in prison and a lifetime of being on the National sex offender list but unfortunately this happens a lot and sometimes it's not a stranger sometimes it's somebody that you thought you could trust there was hair this 16 year old says she caught the girls volleyball coach secretly videotaping her he's pled not guilty sir do you normally tape young girls in locker rooms are you just a locker room pervert next time here Haroon please have a towel around yourself while you're changing underneath or at least do a look around the room and make sure you don't see any camera lights inside the locker silence oh and by the way it's not just lockers detectives are investigating after hidden cameras were found in women's bathrooms at three locations in the Florida Keys the miniature cameras were found inside coat hooks that look just like this one that's right bathrooms are a huge target as well a camera could literally be anywhere okay so I'm not exaggerating when I tell you what I'm about to show you is one of the scariest videos I've ever seen and it's not because what we know about it it's because what we don't know watch what happens as a man drives down in New Jersey free road in the middle of the night what's going on can I help you with something oh my god I have seen that video a lot and every time it gets worse I mean book promo not on purpose a faceless man with what looked like a hood walking towards your window not talking and then they start muttering something and going for their pocket and then there's a car next to them like is that a victim did they already kill somebody uh so many things are going through my head it's just all bad so the guy who recorded this had a dashcam and his name was Ivan and because he wanted to save other people from whoever this man was he decided to warn the other people in the city immediately tucked-in knew something wasn't right he called police as he sped away I could have been mugged I mean I don't want to think of the worst-case scenario but that's what came to my mind one after I left and called the authorities now listen if you're ever in a situation like this please keep your windows rolled up keep your doors locked if the person on the side of the road has a serious problem they can talk to you like a person and say hey I lock my keys in my car if they start muttering to you and you can't really understand them and they're going for their pocket and they literally have no face keep driving I just watched that video and I think about what could have happened if that guy didn't drive away in a night bat bat bat bat keeps me up at night okay I have a question for you now what if I told you right now in your house underneath your couch that you're sitting on or your bed that you're laying on there could be a potential bomb that could explode at any second and kill you and your entire family in an instant well if you live in an older home that has an old boiling unit that is possible watch what happened to this child's playroom because of a faulty old boiler it's a nightmare for so many homeowners explodes this video of one of the kids was shot in the playroom the same day as the horrific blast yeah literally a bomb could go off in your house with no warning now I don't know if I have an old boiler I don't even know what I would look for and I'm too lazy to drive but it's actually serious like this could kill you and everyone in your house just look what happened when the Mythbusters tried to show you exactly what kind of damage an old boiler could do yeah that can literally happen right underneath my couch now I did some research on this and boilers actually explode quite often and most of the time a security cameras or hidden cameras and houses captured the moment in fact in Boston in 1905 at the Grover shoe factory there was a large-scale boiler explosion that resulted in 58 deaths and 117 injuries now obviously there's no security camera footage because of when this happened but these photos are shocking look at how it completely leveled out this building yeah the entire building gone so maybe look into whether or not you have an old boiler underneath your house I guess I should do yeah not usually this is around the time of the video where I tell you something that's not that scary or something to kind of ease the mood but that's not happening today because it's gonna get darker and all of these other stories combined now what you're about to see is a man being interviewed on the news they're asking him about his neighbor Lauren Giddings she went mysteriously missing on June 26th of 2011 now honestly the interview looks pretty normal pretty much what you would expect from a typical news interview but do you notice anything off about it anything weird no no no one has seen her since Saturday I haven't seen anything I mean I've always seen noise outside but there's people walking behind know if that guy seems a little odd to you it a little awkward it might be the fact that he's just an awkward dude or maybe the fact that four days earlier he walked into Lauren's apartment strangled her to death and then chopped off all of her limbs and her head with a hacksaw okay now this is where it gets literally heart-stopping now remember up until this moment they're just asking him where he thinks she is because she's gone missing but then during the interview she tells him that the body has been found the body that he hid in a trash can after he killed her so as you're watching this clip just remember what's going through his head is oh my god I am going to get caught man we we just don't know where she is what about I'm in the like the parking lot area I know they've been doing a lot of that that's where they who has recovered the body or whatever they recovered from their body had you heard anything there how'd you get Medina huh I mean we don't know if this is the same person you know what I mean like they took out a body there earlier we don't know if it's a person that's how we're trying to ask people what they know who live there I think I need to sit down okay Oh oh my god every time I see that my heart stops like when he's just like I'm going to jail oh my god they all know now the reason that people started suspecting him in the beginning of this interview was because in the first ten seconds when he was talking about Lauren he used the term was yeah long was my neighbor um we're just trying to find out where she is at this point was if she's just a missing girl and people don't think she's dead and why would you say it was now this is a massive story it's insane and I could do an entire video about it but for the sake of time I'll just tell you that he did not end well for him you heard that girl sure did that's why you're having this massive meltdown right now cuz you can't live with yourself can you it's overwhelming you end it tell the truth Steven he was found guilty personally because of this interview and he will be in prison forever now I know what you're thinking Shane what does this have to do with hidden cameras he was on a news camera that's not hidden well during the trial a video surfaced it was a video taken by him standing outside of Laurens apartment looking into her windows right before he walked in to kill her now once again there's nothing graphic in this video but it is nightmare-inducing especially since you know what happens after he finished recording I can't say enough how happy I am that that mm-hmm I have a lot of words I don't want to say I'm just happy he's in jail forever at least that's a little bit of justice for Lauren Giddings all right now let's lighten it up a little bit let's talk about demons and ghosts caught on camera now there's tons of videos on YouTube that are clearly fake or slightly staged but I still click on every single one now most of them happen in a long hallway or in somebody's bedroom in the middle of the night with night vision or my favorite ones which are like the baby monitor cameras where it's a ghost hovering over the crib so what I'm about to show you could be another one of those fake hoaxes but it could be real I don't know I have not watched it yet I wanted to watch it with you guys now this one's super viral last month I purposely didn't click on it because I wanted to watch it with you this is supposedly security camera footage from a Christian High School in Ireland now the school is called Deer Park Christian Brothers high school and supposedly it's one of the most haunted schools in the world now supposedly the way the story goes the principal found the footage and he freaked out he put it on the internet for everybody to see I know everybody's wondering if it's real or fake well let's watch it together alright here we go I'm already creeped out just because it's high school oh my god wait I need a posit I never jumped I never like flinch for some reason that got me so maybe it is real or I don't like this that's also me in high school after I've been shoved and locked in a locker but let's keep going Oh God that one was weird that was weird because if the door just flung open I get it because you could just do that on a string I guess but it was like things were thrown out of there like what kind of budget does this high school have that one to me seen the most like possibly real but let's keep going that made my heart stop that was weird right that felt demonic that didn't feel like a ghost that felt like a demon I'm gonna ruin that hold on that Oh cuz I can't figure out how they faked that I mean maybe somebody was in a green-screen suit but like once again a high school they can kind of have at our budget I don't know okay here's my thoughts if there would have been one last thing I would have a hundred percent thought it was fake because that was it like there was no like demon face or you know ghost like in all that fake ones like there's always something like that because there wasn't that one actually genuinely here weirds me at all oh my god I'm sorry I just got really dark with it and I was thinking about like school shootings and like things that happen at schools and death and the idea of a school being haunted seems possible considering that's where oh wait oh my god sorry this is a whole nother video but high school is something that everybody thinks about all the time I still dream about it every night pretty much I still think about it every day if I died would I go back to my high school are all high schools haunted oh my god okay I'm I'm closing my computer well there you guys go that was a rollercoaster all right you

way and I was mad at her for a long time and it has been viewers there's a lot that's about that all right let's see how it goes okay oh my god I'm so nervous so I just parked outside of Blair's place I am like actually really really scared I don't think I thought this through I don't know how it's gonna go like I don't know if she's gonna be excited and it's gonna be like I missed you and like hugging or if it's gonna be awkward and she's gonna be mad like I don't know I haven't talked to her I want to cancel I would literally I'd merrily I've said literally ten times why am I doing this why am I doing this what is wrong with me okay all right come on in texture oh my god oh my god oh my god I just texted her she's coming oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god I'm genuinely gonna cry I'm so scared I can't believe I'm doing this why am i filming us I don't know it's too late actually should oh my god oh my god oh my god I see her I see her walking oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god hi hi I don't know if I'd okay I didn't know yeah little bit cleaner oh this is so weird that I'm filming this I'm sorry I don't do this but this is so weird hi hi what do you mean you don't do this like I don't do people's reactions like meeting you that's weird yeah but like I'm not meeting you like rimi ting you God how many years has it been a long time like I was trying to think about this I feel like the last time we saw each other was that some sort of be there like VidCon or something like that but we didn't really like talk to each other it was more just like a like hey and then cuz I don't know what this is gonna I didn't tell and okay I don't either what this is I I'm shaking what this is Wow okay there's a garbage truck but it's fine okay so what are we doing so my whole plan was I wanted to start a series where I reconnect with people from my past you were my first thought because the you are such a huge part of my life and because I have wanted to reconnect with you for so long and I was like I want to do this on camera because I want to have it forever that sounds weird but it makes sense well okay before we like get into everything how do you feel do you feel weird I don't feel weird I feel a little bit confused I don't know exactly like what your motivation is for doing this and that kind of like scares me it's like am i opening myself back up thinking that like I'm gonna get my best friend back and then like if you're just trying to like do this video you know it's like is this just for a video and then like I'm not gonna see him again for however many years no so I don't do that I don't even film my real life like ever anymore and that's why I'm like is this real life no this is real life and we're gonna get into it I'm gonna turn the camera off and then when we come back we're going to be talking more I don't know yet I have no idea what's happening we'll see you guys in a second okay we are inside the apartment what am i doing no in all honesty I turn the camera off we came inside we talked for like an hour just like catching up about it's been how are you talking about I know I know so we talked about like a lot of stuff but we didn't really talk about like us so we're gonna get to that and I was like we should film that part okay so let's talk I wrote some stuff down so here's the situation and I already told them about this and you already know about this cuz we've had a very awkward conversation about it a long time ago so we started hanging out and we had a mole we had what I thought was a moment and maybe I was wrong so I want to hear your sensitive the moment was we were hanging out I don't remember if it was the first time or whatever you talked about it in your book you read that are you kidding me of course I did like everyone sent it to me they all knew it was me I didn't use your name low you said like a YouTube beauty guru that I used to hang out with who has a sister that like also does use but yes you talked about this in your book that was not our first time hanging out it was actually a while into us hanging out because we were already into the chicken Dino nuggies phase of our relationship remember we would go to Ralph's and get a bag of it the dinosaur did not get one and then we would come back and watch it doubly pardon kaki worries no you said relationship chicken Dino nuggies phase of our relationship remember be me you said our relationship our friendship our relationship I don't want that why won't be hanging out in my room and set up the living room you brought me up to your room now we only did it by the way at this time I never kissed I had never done anything I never even been on a date so I wasn't assuming this was a date I was like oh I'm her friend like this is so fun I'm hanging with a pretty girl I got a look at her like this is fun you know what this is the night that I got my new DSLR camera my Rebel t3i and we were trying to figure out if I should film on that or if I should keep using my Sony camcorder then we imported the footage onto my computer because you were trying to teach me how to do Final Cut Pro and that's where we leave we're on your bed I'm sitting on your bed right yeah you sit next to me yeah I'm the laptop I'm gonna reenact this don't catch feels okay you're me and I'm you right okay so on oh my god that's so hard and then you when you zoom out I didn't know that you yeah you padded my arm here and you were like is so hairy [Music] so okay so you did that right and in my heart like I literally felt like I was gonna barf I was so nervous and I didn't know what to do and so I just kind of like took it I kind of like petted your leg or something I didn't know what was going on and then we just hung out and we laid in bed and you fell asleep as usual I remember that yeah I fell asleep next to you I didn't I believe they're all mines dude okay and I didn't know that until I read your book and that's what I wanted to ask if that was true or if that was just to make the story more interesting but what happened that morning is you pretended to be asleep for like a second and then you woke up and you were like oh I gotta go I gotta go and you ran outside and you into your car and then you immediately tweet it you immediately tweeted and then delete it do you remember that something like I just spent the night in a girl's bed for the first time oh yeah and I sweated not only through her sheets but through her entire mattress yeah and then you like deleted it immediately but I was awake at this point so I was like scrolling this later I was like what does he mean he like slept in a girl's bed like because you did but I didn't see it like that like to me we were already so far into like the brother-sister like friendship zone that I I know but like timbi it wasn't like oh my gosh you guys left over like it didn't and it wasn't even like a possibility in my mind that it was gonna go to something else some her me saying things like that to me it wasn't like we slept in the same that it was like we fell asleep but any features good and I agree and looking back as an adult I look back at that as like a cute episode of like Glee or something I'm like oh that's a sweet the sad kid like thought he whatever but in the moment how do you explain the touching the petting and the missing I don't remember that I still dream about it and I may explain why this was such a thing for me personally like just being honest so I grew up the fat right like really fat and I lost weight in to LA and you were in my entire life the first girl person to ever touch me that way and it might have been nothing to you it I might have a brother said you think but to me I was like she's leaning on me she's petting me oh my god and like it like blew my mind because I was like wow maybe I'm not ugly oh that makes me want to cry me too I mean if you asked me to do this do you think you led me on I would say that there are definitely times that I probably did like taking you home to meet my family and stuff which was do you remember why we were going back to my house well what's gonna do okay so part two of this saga so that happens right I'm like oh my god I'm in love with her oh my god and it's like we're like going grocery shopping together I okay so we were like a married couple literally right but we haven't kissed nothing right but me and mine in my head I was just like we're taking it slow she says hey you want to come home to Tennessee with me or hey come home and like meet my family everybody wants to meet you right I was like oh my god meeting the family so we go to Tennessee we were picking up yeah I had to fly home and get Teddy and you were there when I was booking the ticket and I remember being like oh my gosh do you want to come with me like my whole family wants to meet you everyone wants to meet you do you want to come with me like we'll make it fun we'll go to Dollywood you were like you were like yet you booked your ticket like right then yeah so we go we go it's great we come back home and I'm still feeling weird that like I still felt like there's I don't know what's going on right this went on for I don't even know that's how thing happened in Tennessee you know I don't have enough I here's where a picture comes in okay bring out this picture now you don't remember this I don't remember this 9/11 no why who you shouldn't look at me with love eyes and everybody knows everybody knew it all my friends my mom everybody said it there like she looks at you like she loves you right so me wanting it I'm just like yeah what's going on why aren't we doing anything I'm gonna show this picture tell me this does not look like you're looking at the love of your life if you saw that picture in a movie what would you think was happening on the other side of that card I really did show them show them all they see it okay I can see what you're saying like I'm not gonna sit here and be like oh no she doesn't like you well in real life it was forward right we finally I'm like I need to I need to talk we need to talk so we park a car in your car in a parking structure and I'm just like what's going on what's going on and you basically were just like I see like a brother you're my best friend and then I was sad now you didn't go home immediately because I got locked out of my apartment and you refused to let me sit there by myself but you were sitting there like with these like angry but like sad but also like kind of mad eyes that I like didn't know how to handle it so I was like trying to teach you how to play bubble spinner on her phone fire you live it we have a few years of randomly seeing each other you started dating somebody whatever whatever whatever but we never fully like really talked about which is what we're doing today we were still friends and would like see each other not to the point where we were like going to the grocery store and like mittens sweetie and Dino chicken Emmys every night and remember we have song that we would sing as the Dino chicken nuggets we're in the microwave but do you want to know a secret you don't like them I don't like them you picked those cause you liked it I thought you liked it here's what I think we should do let's go let's go to soup lane to do like Souplantation okay so we're gonna go to Souplantation and we're gonna talk about where we are now who were dating now and also I don't want you to think that I'm actually like weird or awkward or mad at you or anything like I genuinely love you so much and we were so young and this is like really cute to look back except for the sweating thing that's just embarrassing actually so much so much I don't have that matches anymore well now let's go to the mattress kidding let's go eat I'm hungry right we condone chosen a more depressing place to do it okay wait I want to talk to you about your relationship in mind but feel like we should get multiple angles recording no okay so let's talk about current relationships before we get into that let's talk about the fact that one of the other things you did that made me think you liked me was we were walking by Hot Topic when my old shirts used to be there I'll show a picture here and it said Shane Dawson is my boyfriend and you're like oh my god I could get that stared I was trying to support your t-shirt set on topic I didn't dare without your pants and then when you left your friend was like you guys are so cute no I wasn't even with you when I bought that shirt and I did a giveaway I got another one I was trying to support your new line at Hot Topic we weren't even together we went in and looked at them a lot but the time I actually bought it all right fine I agree to disagree but let's move on to now okay okay so who are you dating what you like does he suck okay No you'll meet up and you like does he have a six-pack is really super ripped and like super athletic and looks super cool and like wears backwards hat and it says like tight now I mean he has a good body that's good I mean it's good do you want to see you can we see him I mean dick pigs are really let me show this yeah yeah all right okay I mean he looks good yeah I'm glad that he is good for you and I'm really happy for you and I hope you guys work out now he looks very nice he's a good person for me you're in your own relationship also like not weird anymore so I'm dating a guy yeah which like a lot of people asked me they were like did you ever like been set did you like you know you did talk about the male but my question maybe you were interested like I didn't think you were gay or anything no but I was like maybe he's interested in like trying it out right speaking of butts we're gonna finish our meal all right it's that's it I mean I don't know how do you feel it's good right yeah I mean I feel like really friends again right I hope so I think so I think so I thought you were gonna hate me that you're gonna be mad at me I thought you're gonna slap me or some why I don't know I was just scared I thought you were like mad about the book I don't know no I wasn't mad at all the only thing that I was like worried about it that you were gonna come on here and be like why did you lead me on so hard when like in my mindset at that time I didn't feel like I was leading you on and like as an adult I can look back you see maybe some of the things I did could be portrayed that way so I was scared that you were just like - still mad at me all these years later not so I was like scared to reach out to you and I've written you so many like texts and stuff that I've just never sent you felt like you lost like your first love almost in like as much as you felt like that I lost my best friend in that moment and so I was so scared that you were still gonna be mad at me and if I reached out to you I didn't want the reaction to be like oh yeah it's good to hear from you but let's talk about this let's talk about how you like fucked up and how you did all this crazy stuff to me and I didn't want to get into that because I just wanted to remember our friendship as the good times and stuff and I really didn't want to have it like a solid goodbye I mean I agree and I wanted to do this because of that like I I kind of was using a video as a way to just hang out with you and see like if you hated me or not and I'm happy you don't I don't hate you leaving no I know what I mean there to make like because I remember no we used to always get the cookies from the grocery store we put them on cookie sheet and stick them in the oven those documentaries or something oh my god that was a day oh no that was really really really amazing we ended up hanging out for hours it is now nighttime and it just felt really good to reconnect with somebody from my past who I really really care about and it was awkward as fuck but I like that I don't know I really enjoyed doing this and I hope you guys liked it cuz I really want to do more I want to talk to somebody that hated me in high school I want to talk to family members who I haven't talked to in forever I want to talk to my first hater on YouTube like I want to do this type of stuff and I don't know I hope you like it if

nervous I feel like I just got into wait am i giving you the look [Music] 
hey what's up you guys um so today is kind of a hard video to make because I never thought I would make something like this but I'm gonna do it because I know a lot of you guys will be asking because you're gonna be seeing pictures and stuff and tweets and I just I don't know I just want it to come from me me and Garrett are no longer friends and that's because we are no I'm sorry to clickbait but you got to nowadays on YouTube kidding we're not friends goodbye okay so here's what's going on you guys might have already seen the tweets I had pictures that we've been posting but this is really exciting we officially are starting a company yeah and there was always seed to this like I feel like right when we first became friends we were always talking about making really cool stuff together and doing all these things and so it's always like maybe someday but now that day right so let me explain what happened so we were sitting down and we were talking about it we've been doing so many videos together lately and we've having a lot of fun and I was like what if we do more like what if we make bigger videos and what if we do like Halloween specials at you and what if we eventually make a movie or a TV show or something like we work really well together yeah and we have a lot of ideas so many ideas so then we were just like sitting by the fire and I was like should I jump in I know but really we've been kind of talking about this for like a year so that's why are we happening so here's the point and as of now we have just kind of started making more videos together you guys have probably noticed more scary videos more ghost hunting type videos but then there's other stuff like for example I've never done merged I mean I did a long time ago but it's just thing I never really cared about you fucking love emerge that's something that we're cooking up right now is merch and we came up with much really cool ideas and they're like cool and weird if I'm excited about that work yeah working on some short films Oh Gary's stuff damn damn damn damn damn I know we can't say that much but goddamn I'm really excited I just have daughters oh I'm like super stoked about everything we're gonna do right now calm okay so here's the steps that we've been going through which is really exciting first we decided that we had to find an office space to work out of and the first place we looked at we really really loved and here's a clip of us checking it out well what do you think I love that they aren't have diamond scratches biggest patio I've ever seen in my life and we felt like in love with that place and we were very scared about getting it and we tried really hard but your turns out that we got which was the first place that we found and we were so obsessed with it and it's ours and here's the moment of us hoping to do it for the first time oh my god oh my god oh my god this is a big moment what do we do I don't know my reaction our next step of our lives together Oh oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god t10 oh my god look at the kitchen I'm gonna fill it up with so much food there's no fridge that's a problem there's a microwave looking heat at burritos there's something blocking the window so we won't jump out it aha big mural we we should literally just like have it be my ass we were even thinking something like oh I don't know projector right there right there so we're there right there like watching Ricky Dillon life-sized my mind was infested Brooks territory you're right Tessa I'm sorry oh my god we should have Tessa come over and fucking shape all over this place okay in the psychic we know come over check to see if it's it doesn't fit all right let's go upstairs buddy like a fun like MTV Cribs day okay so here we have a little filming room we're gonna have some fun stuff in here over here we have more demons scratches laundry do it a little editing room mirrors gonna avoid those alright let's go up to the next floor and this is going to be the brainstorming palace suite a nice bathroom a nice tub this is nice because like when youtubers come over to collab we can be like want to get the tab Tessa bring a bathing suit Tessa we're getting in the tub wow this is a lot of walking I'm right thinking this purchase more stairs oh there's more cuckoo okay get my steps in we're gonna at least there's no more stare oh my god that's so scary Tessa it was good to be home tonight let's leave okay so step two is designing it right so we decided like we should go get some inspiration so which is this really weird store that has like a lot of props and a lot of them are me I was so in love I'd never seen this place it is incredible oh my god it's me oh my god has toothpaste that's not me oh my god but it has to be an express sign that's me oh my god the big bird cage we could remake the Taylor video we need her no we need the registers and I'm oh my god wait that's his excuse this anxious all we need she's mrs. shook and he's mr. quaking oh my gosh literally current mood I don't like how she's judging me doesn't she look judgmental yes being rude well you don't leave my karaoke song tackle you got it's my life no doubt activity nights we I think we should get her cos like look like you could put her like in the editing room be like oh you're not done with the Edit yes you're already leaving oh you think Jake Paul got ahead by leaving early oh we can do her nails we can do a nails like Halloween you are so gay I'm just asking this literally looks like your parka no it doesn't I guess it does we we need an office phone oh my okay literally pick it okay what is that shape please please please oh I just want to look up and see how in HoN in an office and a bathroom we can have a Hell in HoN bathroom I love everybody that comes over can take a picture with the horse it could be like our thing got your potato phone got your bob potato and I got my girl I'm 30 any ideas I mean I guess it's my mood oh my God look at her Shane don't just use it use your finger it's not hers her over there no really look at it with the sandals and everything we could dress her up for the holidays like it a little Santa hat am I going crazy okay we all get everyone in forget here Oh surely nobody cares she's being kidnapped hello she's available $100 that's literally have my three pager so the next step is figuring out a name for the company now we don't have like a solid vania um but we definitely came up with some ideas at Chipotle hmm okay time for a company lunch you know where we're going boy Chipotle because it's free company lines I've never actually read the back of this oh my god what hosting events for up to a hundred people what have we done that we don't know start the office in the Chipotle that's not a bad idea well yeah this figure I just wanted am I gonna get a salad Oh looks like you already failed that oh thanks I'm good okay so on a real note we need to think of a name for our company I'm having a moment with this that's the biggest Brio favorite receipt in my life not big enough that's our company no we're big we're big enough what about two Breda boys it's all done put the phone down extra guac diet fun what are we do big - oh my god - big ladies you know - fat queens productions fat shook Oh moms are those women or the thighs big legs okay it's really cheesy but it's how we met shirt on laying down on the bed uncomfortable tender moments incorporated no what did you do to get my attention super like that's super like because like that's how we met you super like me and that's why I opened up your thing because I wouldn't it before cuz your pictures were a mess oh wow you finished it yeah I'm all done that was a very large curry thanks thanks champ really Pig oh yeah but it was a thousand calories probably thanks thank you so much try fun hanging out with you girl okay so now the next step is designing the office and making like really cool and different we kind of aren't great at that but I have a gay uncle yeah and he lives close by well I do he is and he's got good taste and he builds homes all the time so yeah we met with his uncle and give him our inspiration okay so we are here with carrots unfold and we're gonna talk about design which is amazing it look at this house come on look at this beautiful so we have our inspirational pieces here that we want you to kind of design around all right but we also have you know just for all of our business deals nice potato phone but don't worry we also have Dennis he's like he's too inspired he's getting emotional oh my god I they can't even speak amazing but don't worry it's all wrapped around this huh what's such taste it's not as crazy as you guys think really Mike I've seen it work really yeah you're gonna make this work that's exciting because honestly this is real it's not a joke we love it I make this work this is my challenge and by the way do you know which one is us like which one are you holding in which one is this I'm gonna go with potato and gratuitous sex P he knows me so well so we're gonna go over some design stuff and we're gonna make this place amazing and I trust you I think you're gonna do a great job and I think you're really gonna give her a space to thrive in here's my inspiration I was thinking a nice Taco Bell sign or one of the accent walls was this now this is a lot but I like the idea for the living room something like this so you see this killed a poster but it's bleeding so it's just blood splattered all over the walls uma Thurman when you're speaking our language oh you're gonna go with that one huh nice looks good looking on Craigslist are we oh team Ted would never do that but alright okay so now the plan is to design the place and show you guys the process in future videos and pick a company name and figure out what a first like project that's so exciting about this is because like we've never done this before but that's exciting we're just we're just jumping in and seeing what happens and we just we have a lot of cool ideas and we love one another and working together and I think that'll be really excited doesn't hear that too often but no I mean that's gonna be really exciting and fun and we're just gonna figure it out when you'll be along with us for the process yeah I kind of want to do that like I want to film the process of us putting the other company trying to get sponsors trying to get money to make a short film or a series or something feel like it might be kind of cool and fun to like be on the journey but don't worry this isn't gonna turn into like I don't know it's not gonna be different from what I'm doing now I'm still gonna film in my house it doesn't

company is going great see you guys later bye [Music] [Applause] 
hey guys today we're going to be taking another trip onto the weird side of YouTube and I am so excited because today we're gonna be talking about something I've been fascinated with for years we're gonna be talking about real-life vampires that you heard me right these are people who consider themselves vampires they drink blood I think they don't go outside people make fun of them and think that they are crazy and I relate to two out of three of those so first we're going to be watching some real-life vampire videos and reacting to them let's do this I drink human blood as much as I can [Music] mine's mayonnaise I have a lot of thoughts but let's keep watching there is definitely a difference between drinking a man's blood uh no females but a man's blood to me has always been thicker in some way me Michelle's preferred way to consume human blood is straight from her donor I always make sure it's from somebody that I'm close to that's good like do you see somebody walking down the street you're like damn I bet that blood is don't come to my main grade because bitch I'm giving you that thickness oh god oh my god my stuff the pain doesn't really get to me I'm pretty used to it you know maybe they look at my hate comments I'm more focused on the aftermath err during you know the prod of the process of you know the feeding if you know that made my asshole clenched let me by the way just say I'm not judging I am all about people doing whatever the fuck they want oh my god vampires went on Tyra I'm ready so you drink people's blood correct right how do you get the blood from people okay the blood is pulled from the vein of course what they Lancet usually hook that's me no like I need oh that's it okay yeah that's usually timers like okay good cuz like I'm on my period right now and like the flow is heavy so just know this buffet is not for you okay this guy's name is Logan South who is probably the most famous real-life vampire to check it out hi everyone my name is Logan south and I am the eyes are making me feel things this is also giving me flashbacks to when I used to shop at Hot Topic number five do you drink blood yeah sometimes there are actually a few different ways of feeding I do have a donor whenever they say eating something in my body like shrivels up maybe because I know I'm food like I'm afraid to go around these people because they're gonna look at me like I'm like I'm walking big back to them the first and foremost is what we're all familiar with why did that turn me on does he have a girlfriend is he like single what's the situation away I think he's married this is called a royal wedding oh man bitch yes ah yeah Wow why did you come into this yes turn the corner killing it Oh bitch gasps oh that's pretty oh that's a big-ass house why aren't there fire is richer than me is it because my videos suck I hate myself [Applause] [Music] what you're gonna give me the lead up to you guys walking into a bedroom looking like damn Tim Burton characters come to life and then you're gonna say to be continued well I want more Logan south so I actually reached out to Logan and I said hey you want to be in my video and talk to me about your life as a vampire and he said yes so here you go here is my interview with a vampire okay guys I am here with Logan and Daly the vampires oh my god hi okay I have a lot of questions first I don't want you guys to just explain exactly what you are you say you're vampires does that mean you're really vampires is it more like a lifestyle or cosplay lifestyle quest Joyce and cosplay you know that's more costuming and stuff like that but not as far as being a vampire that is something that is innate what a vampire is some of the requires an external source of human energy so would you say you were born a vampire is this something that you realized at a certain point in your life so I believe that it can be passed down from parent to child but it is also something that you come to understand in the process that we call awakening wait okay so you're sitting there and you're just like the normal kid he's like I don't like going outside I don't like the Sun I kind of like blood and then you have another wait giving so what does that feel like constantly feeling thirsty and had anything to drink in days and I would just choke down as possible order and nothing was replenishing that and I was no longer able to go out in the Sun like I used to for me I was actually discovered by a coven of vampires now in high school and they came up and said how do you been experiencing these things and I said yeah so they explained it and you just clicked in my head but it goes throughout your life you're constantly learning about yourself I learned to feed what originally now I have learned multiple paths from feeding so I can feed from energy sexual energy from a room for ambient seating okay feeding I'm obsessed with this so you talk about getting your sources from different places one of them is blood how do you get it on a regular basis you have to find somebody is there like a tinder for blood like how does that work first of all you find a donor that you can stream that you can access to the you get a full blood work done on a whole panel writing nice we have donors that we we have a screen that are important to us that we share to the bonds of relationships with so you find your donor and then is there like a ceremony do you guys like just hang out watch Big Brother and then like say let's now question about you said it's not a lifestyle and you don't like that word but there are going to be a lot of people watching that are gonna be like super into it and intrigued and want to like try it out for themselves how do you go about that is that offensive to you if I try to be a vampire for a day is that what the vampire like stuff as long as people understand that there are two different things where vampires to do both but are actually vampires and little vampire lifestyle we do that and there's people there vampires that wear a t-shirt jeans and rock at the corner store like the two are not the same can I see the context can I see the fangs can I trust when I see you I take the exact color and shade using professional great dental acrylic and I know things like your venture that too yellow would happen to them very real and they smile on right over your natural teeth please see if I can lean in nice and close for you oh my god Wow oh yeah yeah get in here girl yeah so okay question about your guys's relationship when I was watching your videos earlier without sounding creepier perverted like all I wanted was to see you guys have sex so have you ever thought about a sex tape and is there like a sexual side to this vampire world and how do I get involved I wasn't saying that the members is itself a inherently sexual thing but for some those who take sexual energy it absolutely can be you know as it turns out yes we actually run a fetish club here in Austin Texas called BAM suddenly I have tickets to Austin two-story club with black and gold and chandeliers and stripper poles and private rooms and it's BYOB you gotta bring your own bring your own way we don't serve any liquor on premises never play a play rooms upstairs that people can engage in whatever illicit activities they've decided on that month and we have you know all the four medias and furniture and such so st. Andrew's cross if you really wanna get strapped up there that's in front of like other vampires and they're just booked wait what well sure yeah it's a fetish club this is the kind of thing that happens in a fetish club people have sex people like a lot of the people I sorry I'm clearing my schedule I'm clearing my calendar I'm more of a serious note do you get me fun off like when you're walking around town or are you well-known so people don't really make fun of you I haven't raid that other people that I don't know have had that experience I feel the best that's inherently wrong we don't usually have that happen I had a lot of people that respond to me with fear and in a lot of cases that's because I want them to because there are some people that I don't want to be talking with some people that I can see you're inherently rude or bigoted or racist or transphobic or homophobic and I want that person to go away right and so I'll turn on that little extra thing that I have to make them lots of how do I incorporate that into my life because that would be great huh another thing is we also do a lot of a charity organization we volunteer at the children's hospitals and the food bank so it takes away that extra reasoning that people have to bully or to make fun or to be rude well thank you guys for talking to me I feel like this hasn't shed some light I'll go no but I think this is really cool and interesting and hopefully this opens up people's minds a little bit and it's not a lifestyle but if you're into it you can kind of join the lifestyle right oh wait you stopped everybody well perfect I will book my ticket to Austin today okay so even though Logan and Daly said that being a vampire is not like something you choose and it's not really a lifestyle I still want to try it so I'm gonna force Riley to do it with me and we're gonna be the new king and queen of the vampires okay so I thought it would be fun if we tried to be a vampire couple because I feel like we have a lot of vampire qualities like for instance I never go outside I fucking suck and also he literally has fangs like those are real Halloween stores are shut so I have a bunch of stuff here that we are going to try out for a new vampire in life babar Hall creepy music now okay so first I have a top hat which I feel like is really fashionable and will also distract people from my face perfect okay so for you I got this costume it was the gayest one I could find honestly I'm into it I feel like I'm gonna be serving a look yeah no you're really gonna suck in this oh my god you're gonna suck my dick no this is mine I got the guy who looks like Michael Jackson also here's a little bit of blood on his shirt because he's a messy eater and it says one size fits most so I probably won't fit I also got this like black vampire fan because I felt like I'm gonna be a shady vampire oh you think I'm the suckiest youtuber obviously you've never been to VidCon I also got the dog a costume and the cat a costume um I don't think this is gonna go well but they're definitely gonna bite me in for him suck my blood so we are going to transform into vampires let's run down at the outfit first of all the Hat is killing it does not fit my New Jersey the shirt is quite revealing you can tell I never go outside by the color of my white skin but I'm kind of feeling this panic at the disco jacket like my Wikipedia bio just went from by to gay now let's get your look you look like an actual predator who is going to go to Hot Topic and show people your balls also I love that like my house already has vampire decor well except for him give like your best vampire mating call that honestly was everything like my dead white dick just came alive so I don't have things so I bought these but they were too complicated to figure out so I'm going to try to put them in my mouth using a glue stick so I guess what I'll do is just take the glue stick I got it cut works when your dollars through a vampire huh oh my god hey don't get your clothes they're really showing how yellow my other teeth are I love this it's giving me a lisp okay so now that we have our fangs and I outfit it's time to try some blood something I got on the Internet this is the vial of blood now supposedly whether they have a live but the publicly that tastes just like blood but it's not actual what are you ready yeah so let's just crack this baby open I want to kind of feel it how it actually look oh my oh my god actually it does taste like blood the sweet and salty like you know when if you cut yourself okay in my Twitter saying oh if you cut yourself it's a little bit salty but this has a hint of sweet but it does taste like blood okay me when I'm like a fucking blood review channel sweet involved a - oh wait no I won't put her on you may be the porno on your neck sexy music now [Music] one solid lick okay that's my new single okay that yeah that tastes like blood I tasted my own blood a lot I need to get post of a thing that's kind of fun like honestly honestly the blood it not that bad have you ever fucked on Kenny no okay let you work for as a kid but out of the kid I would get bored so then I would take penny and I uh we're very different no one can relate wait we gotta let me put the animal copy move on we need the rest of our squad Oh [Laughter] oh my god in a terrific cuz he really bites me all right you're gonna put on new no come on cheeto oh my wait you think it is top hat okay Oh [Laughter] we are taking a family portrait now bitch come on so the whole family oh my god happy birthday oh wow how did he magic guys go oh you enjoyed watching me explore new lifestyle in general I just want to say I find this stuff really cool like I don't want to look like I'm hating on it making fun of it I get it and I think it's kind of cool to might be involved in a community of people who you relate to and you can you know just kill them so what does that mean when I was trying to say before my pets tried to leave the earth was that I think that we should not be judging people based on what they do in their free time or how they express themselves or our community that they consider themselves a part of and that's part of the reason why I like doing this series and I think it's really cool so goats then Logan some love and let me know in the comments what lifestyle or weird side of YouTube I should explore next all right you guys make sure to give this video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and you want more also make sure to subscribe to my channel right down below get the notification because I make new videos and if you want to see on my other weird side of YouTube videos I did one where I talk to a furry and adult baby and I even tried out ASMR I'll put a link to a playlist right at the top description below alright little vampires I will see you tomorrow keep sucking [Music] [Applause] 
you spend a lot of money on your clothes and I don't almost this whole look I got from like a really crappy store on Hollywood Boulevard it's like ran by someone who talks like this everybody fell off the back of the truck conveniently and so it's like $20 they think this was like 15 so do you think it's stolen or do you think it was on a dead person hey can I do it sure yes first of all that was too straight and you can't even clap right all right I know you've seen all the tags going around YouTube boyfriend buys my outfit and I'm sure you're very confused as to why I would do this number one I don't buy clothes and number two I don't like my body so why would I show it full frame in a video and I wasn't going to do this video until he recently was like I don't want to go out in public with you you look a mess that's not exactly true but I have been telling him he needs to step up his fashion game so if I step up my fashion game he probably just means wear shirts that don't have Taco Bell stains all over them or holes for the past three years you love my holes so here's how this is going to work I am going to crawl into a hole and another panic is that it's gonna be great so I am going to let him go out into the world I've never been there I don't know Lisa and he's gonna buy me a few outfits and then we're gonna come back here and try them on and I'm honestly terrified like what do you envision for this body well you know I'm actually gonna try to get things that you will wear realistically every day every day bro know you hate shopping you have panic attacks when you go shopping so I actually feel good about shopping for you without you fuck that's so true last time we went shopping we had to go to a wedding so I had to go to Macy's to get an outfit and I started crying in the middle of the store and ahead to leave and that's what I said we're shopping with him again the truth tea is cold all right so let's do this okay so a couple of questions hey how much am I going to spend well I usually spend zero dollars on clothes so no I'm gonna need at least a hundred and fifty aha this is not a brand deal okay I'm thinking you know what bet whatever you want I trust you I'm just gonna give you my card I'm not gonna give you a limit but like if you go over a certain limit that I think is too much we're breaking up great no pressure at all okay so I need to know a couple of things like what are your size of the shirt sizes um first of all I just want to show you like what my current style is I like this one because you can see that you pull a sweat it just reminds me that I need to go on a diet if I won't be shorts because they have a nice little hole right here oh okay so sure sighs whoo that's triggering um let me just ask my bag of chips okay hi wow that's big okay keeping it real I'm going to say if it's like a t-shirt a large he thinks like a dress shirt give me an extra large because boobs no you actually just have like some chest muscle you have been lifting five days a week I'm your thing right okay pants wise that's a dark subject I'm gonna say 38 ways times 30 long what are you I'm right of 28 30 so double bad what about dick size what do you mean I don't need your teeth for mosquitoes I'm not getting you a speedo I'm confident because my speedo size is well you can get by the child section one last question do you want complete looks or just pieces you can throw together do whatever you want if you want to get any pins or buttons or even a pop socket do whatever you feel but just don't give me these because they're the gayest thing to me I thought you're wearing them innocent yesterday Archie went shopping you have all the outfits I have not seen them I can smell them they smell new and clean and I don't like it alright so a bunch of different stores and I didn't necessarily get outfits because I don't think you'll ever wear you got no I got no food but I did get a lot of different things so do you want to start with the first door oh my god I'm so nervous okay what's the first door a wasteland it's like a bougie goodwill first of all wasteland is what I call my ass and I'm ready okay so I found this shirt and although yellow is not really Shane's color this reminds me of this green shirt a lot so I'm gonna give this a try I also found it is this awesome shirt with a bear drinking a coca-cola but it has this huge as a rip in the back which i think is a deal-breaker which is such a bummer that is first of all what is that dick sucking face this results in us breaking up it's been a good run it's been a great class oh my god I see colors yeah okay start with the yellow these prints are hiding in this fashion oh my god okay first we have I'm trying to convince this I know I've never seen you in yellow but it's very reminiscent of your favorite green of my great shirt yeah and it looks like cheese so when I dropped cheese on it you don't see it okay all right loving this are you sure this isn't like a Harry Potter thing because like the champ I've never read harry potter okay so that's the shirt oh you got me another shirt yeah so this shirt I'm obsessed with and you're gonna wear it do not never [Music] if this was diet coke and I'll think you to never take it off it's just made literally everything about that is me the embarrassing sunglasses the dad body there's all in the back and I almost didn't buy it because of that so you can't wear it in public you don't know me okay I love these shirts let's do a quick little fashion show it's bright [Music] you know I don't think yellows your color is so me I know I'm not being mean it's just too bright all right look number two come through it actually is really good I love it no actually it's very untracked little bit are you gonna fold your arms like him perfect all right next door okay I went to Urban Outfitters and I got some goodies for you what Urban Outfitters doesn't carry my book so I'm protesting them I'm for sure getting this Shane also loves spreads so I think that's a good option but I also don't want to get just graphic t-shirts I need to get something that he'll actually look nice in as well all right here we go okay all right we're starting with oh my god I love this this actually literally says daddy before you wear it I think it would I kind of like it I want to see you in public with that hat I actually this this is great what else God all right sure oh my god oh my god I'm gonna cry oh my god you probably don't even know I'm so excited it's a friend's shirt but it's my favorite episode of all time I knew that I'm gonna marry you that's when you're supposed to I know me too oh yes good thank you I know all right before you open these shane has had one pair of black and white shoes since I met him so this is just another pair that's a different color than I hope you're aware okay a nice gray nah nice shoe look like something a grandpa would wear I was thinking the opposite I was thinking they kind of look like the easies what did you just say you know how like athleisure is in style I was thinking guys later they don't know what any of the word you're saying me well these are Yeezy who are you having a stroke all right and there's something else right now this one isn't the fanciest thing in the world but I honestly think you'll wear it possibly every day it's very big no I know I'm a big bitch okay I like it's great simple it's nice feels good no hole so I'll change that smells like smells like they don't carry my book all right all right fashion show come on oh don't mind me I'm just a daddy taking a walk in my friend shirt with my uses you're easy but they're not easy is there New Balance are they comfy yeah I mean I look like a nurse let's go to the WBT or sit on the couch yeah I mean do you want to see like the shoes in action yeah okay I think you're right there's shoes my grandpa would wear every time I start to like my head you take me back down all right okay this do see shirt oh it's a little like tight and thick but I like that football way it looks like it's just pussy but I'm also already sweating you can literally see that I just put it on it's not going well all right what do we got next okay so next I went to gap which I don't think you would ever shop at I don't have any gaps anywhere the reason I went there is because you have no outfits for a date night or a night out on the town so what you're saying is you want to take me out correct I came into gap to get something a little out of the ordinary for him if we go on a date night or something so I really wanted to get him a nice button-down and maybe some nice jeans that he could wear on a night out on the town you know what I'm saying here we go about a year to happen have never seen him wear a pair of jeans in my life there's no reason to try these on and if they fit he's going to wear them okay let's see these are slim huh no how do you see my pinky you've got 36 on 38 the 38 were literally this big yeah I'm gonna kill myself the 38 were like five times the 36 so I just know literally welcome to my pants okay what's this I love it done no it's a light sweater for you to wear to date night or to a rehearsal dinner to wedding okay all right I don't hate that what's next okay you have something similar which is so weird can I tell you the story behind this shirt that I have what you wore this shirt that's similar to this on our first date on their first date yes that was his shirt oh I deserve it all right what else underwear because you wear the same pair of underwear and buried a row I didn't say everyday yes you did there's so 25 alright fine fat shouldn't show - the underwear no he's doing an underwear shot okay who's ready to go on a date look at the jeans actually do fit cute do you feel like the guy on the side of heaven who went to jail for molesting kids I've never seen it it's so good how are the underwear oh so I'm wearing the new underwear doing a full shot yeah so the underwear uh are good I mean they fit nice and they're very soft very soft my penis has a lot of bones yeah so next is the sweater I got you I can see that no I don't like it oh it's itchy oh it's itchy no it's not with your ex it's like actually like making my art it's like making a cringe oh my god it's like a cream shirt if I can't shop for you who can no one shade up in shop no okay so I guess it's time for me to pick my favorite I'm gonna go the yellow shirt I knew it I saw it immediately but that's also because it's the same as your favorite shirt so it's baby steps like I'm never gonna wear I need the other things ever again yes you're earning all of them actually you know what listen I'm not gonna burn all the clothes I'll probably just give them away but I feel like we do need to burn something so I have a game for you go up to the closet pick any shirt of mine that you hate only have 30 seconds it's a clown shirt no I'm not doing that one find another one 30 seconds I'm counting down alright what did you think so I just found this one but I haven't really seen you wear in a long time but I just don't really like how long it is I disagree I think it covers my ass but if that want to burn the baby we're gonna burn it Thanks alright here we go the ritual of the burning shirt goodbye bad style alright here we go oh my god wait did I just you put the fire out alright then I'll just burn it directly oh wait I think it's working oh the first and only time my fashion has ever been lit oh wow ooh that smells like my sweat any

sorry I'll dry off while you figure this now let's do a meal and a dessert okay that makes sense is the goal to make them puke or is it to make it the best thing we can I think the goal is to make them puke into the pan cook it and then we eat it let's cook okay so where do we start what do you think we should make like a souffle I think that's a loaf with my alright here we go fries make sure we get like a good base we've automatic shins oh it's gonna be really cheesy no I don't just don't overbeat to begin well I feel like we need a layer so maybe like this layer is like cheesy starch and then we'll do a layer of meat and then we can put in the drizzle or all the sauces together and then put it over like icing okay so we need a biscuit some in this pizza mmm actually I would eat this out of this on a Saturday night when all my friends on Instagram hanging out and I'm alone me a couple chips oh great you just do it one-handed oh my god if salt Bay was obese wait what else like try and like put in some doughnut let's do it yeah where you have to tweet our concoction to Gordon Ramsay and see if he'll roast us yeah Gordon Ramsay's gonna literally kill himself that's good for this round right oh jeez let me get like a sexy drizzle mmm [Applause] I think that's good right yeah what are you doing your concoctions taking too long no you're not allowed to eat this you have to wait till we put it all in a blender I think I'm a serial killer like I want to put my hand in there and buy mine anymore okay so we just dump our in it right yeah all right okay if anything comes out a [Music] little liquid Wow it kind of just looks like Thanksgiving everyone just pretend it's Evan yeah oh my god maybe we should do big cake pops hmm what do you think boys sneak peek oh yeah berry corn does should we mold it yeah oh my god you can see a little bit of like the meat of like the pepperoni in the corn dog I think I'm all the sudden freely looking guy should we cook it just a little bit you want to actually not put in the oven or that's too stupid yeah let's cook this bitch up okay wait before we put this in the oven I think we should inject the center Oh fun I feel like we could all do more gravy if we wanted to good idea or frosty you want to do a frost or you want to do great let's take a boat grab your frosty on you choose both yeah ready oh my god oh my god oh I am going to bust excuse my friends oh my god literally inject into my mouth Oh shove it in yeah Oh R that's alright gravy time oh my god when we're doing gravy Oh if you Instagram that people would like it oh that is low-key amazing wow it looks like Cookie Monster's good luck in there love being a housewife so we have like our starchy one in the oven when we need like a meat layer right yes we've already pureed so should we do something else should we just mush it with her like a mortar and pestle was just like oh yeah like a No No chili dog in play oh yeah oh that's what we're doing oh we're beating it that actually doesn't look that bad never mind this is horrible yeah when your mom goes crazy impacts you at lunch I think if I just like turn like this burrito and just almost like squeeze it out like a toothpaste tube now the crunch wrap is very like delicate and amazing I feel bad to do this but there's another tortilla inside you've never had a crunch rub no oh my god okay it's fine well it's fine I'll get past it piece of fried chicken yeah exactly yeah whoo what Big Macs the whole little patty in there you wanna do we could use a pepperoni if you want good idea oh wait but I think we need a little liquid so let's do the fruit loop okay just like to get it although to me it smells really good it smells just only like fruit loops I just sweat in it oh my god I forgot about this is it working oh it's rising who does the smell it's not even on its rising by itself I'll hold it okay I don't think we  up your kitchen too much that's the second layer so I think that we should do the same thing put it in here and then put it in the oven see what happened all right here we go a second layer coming up or what should I scoop it that's what you hear actually and then look you could just pack it with a container oh my god that looks like a camp see you famous pie with that blue wow it's like the end of the world okay dessert so we have all of our little treats here so what are you thinking yeah we're trying to bake it again no it's gonna be a cold dessert should we make ice cream how I've seen a technique before where you just put everything in a bag smoosh it up put some ice in here and just roll around in ice okay it might make ice cream it might make cold vomit either way you guys are eating it I like the pink donut I think that has a lot of fun colors a little cinnamon so now I'm gonna let you do the honors of pouring in that frosty that actually looks good hmm so I guess just crush it with our hands just like this mmm I think that's gonna work okay plop this in here more ice yeah I will put in the freezer oh great while we're decorating our cake I think we're like slowly actually going crazy and getting delusional to thinking this is gonna work okay here we go all right okay you know what hey blue name right this smell actually like gave me an instant headache I think we just made like a war weapon this is a disaster Oh oh my god oh my god this is the moment of truth and then we just left I think oh my god huh oh my god it's really pretty here the blue on top really makes it for me all right there we go something in the middle right like a middle layer chips oh interesting a little crunch this actually looks like something you get like a fancy restaurant for your cat I think maybe we should just like [Music] okay we'll just use it as a nice thing yeah yeah like a topping that's cute oh my god this is beautiful have I lost my mind Oh time for squirt all right I'm thinking we just mix them all together in here and they go up my recent

disgusting okay yeah I think you will no no no no no if you feel like you're going to die just tell us yes we can that all right this year Cheers oh my god very gravy I just realized this looks like the most gross low-budget version of worth it No did you swallow that how is it flavor not the worst texture okay the worst thing by far I'm sorry it says is the Wiener schnitzel the gat corndog flavor by the ton pastures Oh the pepperoni is a good way to go to give a pepperoni on yeah thousand familiar flavor well I'm happy but you guys kind of enjoyed it and don't worry there's dessert all

use my fingers oh my god oh the texture okay cheers to us first class hmm I like it I like it greatness all week all the fast food together and nobody throw up no one threw up people came close but I think that we narrowly skated by I feel like we did a good job I think that the horrific part was probably the Meech layer and that's what I didn't really get a lot of but the like starch layer tastes like bean dip yeah it kind of just tastes like something that you're crazy drunks pill-popping aunt would make yeah totally guys hopefully you enjoy the head over to Sofia's channel check it out we did a video over there where we're giving dolls makeovers and I might kill mine give you a lot of fun go subscribe don't forget your thing I don't know whatever and thank you guys for letting us kill

oh hey what's up guys my name is Destry welcome back to WTF five I know what you think that's true what a magnificent suit where can I get one no well you can thank my aunt Kathy for this beautiful thing that I'm definitely not gonna wear once and then throw away unrelated side note I thought for today's video in the Christmas spirit we would count down the fight worst Christmas gifts ever given to someone also if you're a terrible gift giver like my aunt Kathy and admittedly the rest of my entire family this video will also double as a guide of what not to give someone for Christmas this year number one inappropriate gifts well have that one person in our family or friends that likes to give us the most incredibly stupid or inappropriate gifts that are never practical for any real life situation it's like they get off on you opening up a gift and being so embarrassed by it that you have to do like one of those forced laughs you know like ha ha ha thanks Uncle Dave I love it I'm so glad you gave me a sign that says no gay sex I'm so glad that instead of a real gift you got me a Kevin James workout DVD by the way that is seriously a real gift that you could give someone but jump ok stop stop it um some other terrible inappropriate gifts you could give someone are canned unicorn beet and it's even better about this one than the actual product itself is the reviews of the product on Amazon do not eat too much of this stuff at once I had the rainbow runs for a week the entire complex smelled like hopes and dreams I think stick with fresh I highly recommend Tom Riddle brand unicorn state which arrived still oozing restorative blood we all have that one friend that constantly complains about never getting any action so why not throw them a boyfriend instead or even better why not give them deep masturbation kids I wasn't aware that you needed a kid for that I mean I've been doing just fine left in here I'm gonna rail you so hard later want to teach your child how to shave early why not get beat you can shave the baby tall what look like who invented this it was like this is a great idea I have this revolutionary idea haven't you ever water to shave a freakishly hairy ginger baby act no you think that's bad check out the any carpets no this is not a carpet specifically for cats these are reusable pubes that you can attach to your how do I make this ad friendly your nono square I'm trying YouTube yeah why is this a gift imagine opening this up what is your reaction Kathy I know how you've always wanted fumes so I can't even finish that's good anyways moving on number two Regan's okay so I'm pretty sure this one is obvious but for those of you who maybe don't know don't give someone a we give the only is it just the laziest thing but it's essentially the gift equivalent of giving someone herpes I don't want these are bees but there you go enjoy imagine if you can do that know like send a gift to someone like oh another present let's see oh no put these herpes in here now I'm getting a cold sore so I'm some of the worst we giving story as I was able to find online we have someone getting ly gifted their own copy of Suicide Squad on DVD that they had given to their friends we gift it to them by that same friend well I would rather give shave a baby than that that is terrible I know what you're doing and don't you dare leave a comment down below saying look at this sicko he said he'd rather shave a baby watch suicide oh God let's take oh oh why am i watching this guy where's Shane man I see you don't you do it my brother received a guest gift card from a family friend for his birthday but there was no amount written down so he stopped me guests to check the amount 58 dollars and 12 cents Wow how generous there's no way that that cards already been used it has to be just so awkward to be Khatri gifting like what do you do all right Marcus this one is from me and Deborah enjoy oh um this is actually this same Polaroid camera that I've given you guys for your baby shower I don't I don't think so we definitely bought that um yester week yeah it even still says happy baby shower NIC and Deborah right there I don't think that's us I mean that could be anyone named Nick and Deborah number three prank gifts so these are without a now the worst kind of gifts that you can give or get from someone else because not only is it just thoughtless and stupid but half the time they'd already been real gifts but of some of the worst prank gifts we have our people packaging potatoes and iPhone boxes so they think they got a new phone but I'll guess what nope just potatoes Wow even worse people packaging aphids and 100 layers of trash so it takes 40 minutes to open it oh my god that's so funny said no one hey you know how much you wanted a new iPad for Christmas well guess what we got you the next best thing and etch-a-sketch in an iPad case Wow thanks dick I'm pretty sure no one's been excited about getting an etch-a-sketch for Christmas since the 1920s it's one of those gifts that you use once and are like wow cool and then never use again you want to know the world's quickest way to be single kid your girlfriend a jewelry box with the sign in it that says lol just kidding oh here's a fun one crap for Christmas I got you twenty-five dollars with a lottery ticket I went ahead and scratch them off for you you won two dollars gives that two dollars Merry Christmas Nicole cool I just won't let you know that there is a slow burn waiting for you in Hell thanks to the internet we also have thousands of videos of parents breaking their children with terrible gifts say Jimmy I know how much you wanted a hoverboard so here's a single rollerblade I just love how much this dad is enjoying torturing his kids I feel like I could have worded that better then there's the dad that gifted his kids hand soap and a single rice cake and the kids reaction is just great why is it a joke there's your gifts I really feel that kid well I really need to start thinking about what I say before I say it don't you dare poke that and send it to my Twitter as a meme [Music] then we have some kids opening up onions in a toilet brush and I'm gonna be the comments on that one so that you guys can't you know make fun of me so suck it kids witness burst I can't win number four gifts that aren't really for the person receiving them so if you're wondering what this one is it's one of those gifts that you give to someone that are really for someone else this can be your dad getting you a present like that that's drag got you this Xbox happy Christmas no way thanks dad no problem except I'm gonna be playing at 90% of the time and it's gonna be my room okay bye more like this type of gifts where it's like hey so I got you this awesome awesome screwdriver of a tape measure and also a single screw and now that you have all that I was hoping maybe you could help me fix my car build me a shelving unit and also at home for me Olivia you want me to build you a home with a screwdriver okay don't forget that screw I got you that's gonna get you real far you know about twenty-eight thousand more of those at boob we got ourselves a house my friend some some would be worth stories of these we have someone getting their nephew deodorant apparently someone was gifted a book on how to give good oral sex AKA v least subtle way that you could tell your partner that they're the worst of it but babe I thought you liked when I chomp on it yeah totally apparently someone got wrinkle cream and they're stalking but there were 14 out I got this one in addition to just being the worst gift is also a league if my grandpa who are to use like half of it okay you go Sydney I used half of it on my balls and they're not one bit less wrinkly wow thanks grandpa no problem probably number five just plainly awful gifts so this is really the category that might grab as gifts really belong to because we're talking about a person who thought it was a great idea to give their grandson a large pain of unusable blasts like bless her old frail soul but what kind of a person thinks that getting their grandson this snakes on a plane soundtrack is an okay idea Thompson would be worse too plainly awful gifts we'd have any pets just avoid getting people pets again unless someone asks for it no one wants to be put in a position where it's like here's an iguana isn't it cute you're gonna need to get a terrarium for it and I eats five little cricket today good luck another great one of calendar especially for a year that already happens that is actually happened to me yes it was my grandma how'd you know it wasn't just like from a single year earlier it was like big rabbit this calendar is from 1952 oh really yeah it says here on the cover and it was kind of obvious when there was an ad for a new toy sweeping the nation called mr. Potato Head another example that someone submitted to Reddit was a purple brick literally just a brick that's painted purple I will say at least some thought whether this gift you know like like it's not just a brick so what actually took the time to paint this thing which is already better than like 90% of the gifts that I get you know at least it has some practical use you can put flowers in it or you could put it on a shelf I guess wow that's two things already holy crap this is the only two things so anyway it's hopefully you guys enjoyed this guide on what not to gift someone for Christmas I'm gonna go burn this outfit so I'll see you later also if you enjoyed this video make sure to give it a like and also subscribe to this channel I will be doing these every single week but before you guys go eat a lot if you went and checked out my newest adventure vlog on my channel where I did a photo shoot in a haunted cemetery anyways I wanted to do something special for this episode so I'll be giving away one copy of Suicide Squad on DVD to one lucky winner what's that you know you don't want it oh okay well okay don't get rid of this thing I'm totally joking it's going in the trash where belongs that's a guy's don't see you next time for another WTF 5 thanks for watching and Fairwinds [Music] 
hey what's up guys my name is Destry welcome back to you WTF 5 an attempt to make YouTube not demonetised every single one of these videos I decided to try not to say the f-word five times the first two sentences so if I add frog ly at YouTube anyways thank you so much to Alice in wanderlust for the topic of this week's video if you like to leave a suggestion for a future WTF 5 video make sure to leave that in the comments down below but without further ado for today's video we count down the top 5 innocent people that were sent to prison number 1 Daryl Burton I've never done something horrible and gotten away with it for example I once poked a hole in my friend's condom as a practical joke and nine months later and his son Steven was born sorry David I am the reason that you now pay $500 in child support a month haha God we'd be surprised to know that a lot of the time innocent people are sent to prison for something that they didn't do well the real perpetrator of the crime is out there still probably still committing crimes well such was the case for 22 year old Daryl Burton who sentenced to life in prison for a murder that he didn't commit as one night in st. Louis of 1984 a 26 year old man named Donald ball was simply getting gas at a gas station when he was shot and killed weirdly this wasn't the only time that he had an incident with a gun at this gas station and was actually shot a year prior from a rival gang yeah I don't know about you but if I was shot at a gas station I would not return to that same gas station that I was shot it seems like common sense a month later two witnesses identified a local man named Daryl Burton as the assailant of his shooting and despite having nothing to do with the murder he was arrested and charged based on the damning evidence that he was around during the time of the shooting yeah no murder weapon no motive just oh yeah he was around he was around man I don't know he had to have done good enough for me case closed so Daryl get sentenced to life in prison in just five months into it one of the two witnesses that claimed that they saw Daryl commit the crime decided out of the blue to recant his statement and basically be like oh you know what judge you actually wasn't that guy so Daryl was freed and lived out his life happily ever after the end is what should have happened but instead after numerous petitions and now one of the witnesses on Burton's side the reinvestigation finally happened which found Burton completely innocent and it was released from jail in August of 2008 after just 24 years in jail what the hell how do you mess up that badly like what do you say as the justice system to a guy who's just been in jail for 24 years for something that he didn't do hey so we're we're cool right have fun with your remaining years number two Michael McAlister in 1986 just two years after the first story on this list another 22-year old man named Michael McAllister was arrested and charged with sexual assault simply for looking like the guy that actually did it apparently what had happened is that a woman was assaulted by a man in a mask and held at gunpoint but luckily she was able to lift up the man's mask to reveal some of the guy's features as well as a red and white plaid shirt that the guy was wearing when she then reported to the police the police sketch was then drawn up which are always 100% accurate ma'am is this the man that attacked you oh wow yes that that is that is that is him that is him you've really solved and thank you so much and based on the sketch of a man named Michael McAllister who lived nearby was brought in and identified by the victim as the man that assaulted her coincidentally during the lineup McAllister was also wearing a red and white plaid shirt which was really not helping his case so because of all that he was ultimately arrested and sentenced to 35 years in jail Wow that is the most unfortunate thing I've ever heard did you guys like my acting right there wowie that is truly unfortunate no seriously that that sucks but shortly after Michael was sent to jail a detective was investigating a man by the name of Norman Durr who's been committing several assaults in the area and actually been followed to the apartment complex - the assault took place so he was actually brought in in question as well but even when the victim was shown the photo of Norman Durr as a possible suspect she still chose Michael McAlister over him and so he remained in jail thankfully at least Norman dirt did receive three consecutive life sentences for the past sexual assaults that he did so that's good I guess but a 2004 McAllister was finally released from prison on parole but had to register as a sex offender because I'm sure you probably have guessed by now in a DNA test conducted in 2013 it was proven that Norman Durr was the actual perpetrator of the crime and Michael McAllister had nothing to do with it despite having spent the last 27 years in jail oh can you even imagine like Weeki probably not even 27 yet so just imagine that your entire life was spent in a jail cell yeah can't even imagine so anyways McAlister was finally released in 2016 and was awarded a million dollars for his 27 years in which like yeah that's great you know at least are giving this guy money unlike the last guy on this list yeah we can't give you any money box out would you like a hug and perhaps it's the almost empty bottle of Powerade its the blue kind sorry it's hella gay unfortunately now he wasn't able to spend much of his money because he died of natural causes in 2017 number 3 Richard Jones Sir Richard Jones is a man from Kansas City Missouri who was convicted of robbing a woman outside of a Walmart in 1999 and despite there not being any DNA evidence or physical evidence of any kind the word of a single eyewitness who admitted after the fact that he was quote high on crack the people you come across to Walmart I love it next time can we do a top 5 weirdest walmart people it's gonna be hard to limit it to five people but I think we could do it yes the man that was high on crack said that he may have seen Richard Jones robbed the woman and so he was arrested and sent to jail so obviously Richard was like what the hell I wasn't even at Walmart why would I go to a place that literally smells like babies in the ass of a 90 year old woman with a leaky anus so while he's in prison he reaches out to the Midwest Innocence Project and you know tells them his whole situation basically says that young there might be someone in this area that looks like me who's committing crimes and as it turns out that is exactly what it was not only was the person that was actually committing these crimes also named Richard but here's a picture of Richard and here's the picture of the guy that actually did it literally the same person never seen the movie the island where they clone people this looks like that this looks like they just cloned this guy and one of them is the good one and the other one is out there committing crimes weren't even there yet if you've seen them to be Judge Dredd there's actually that exact storyline where there's a clone of a guy and that clone is the evil one so that looks like this situation I'm sorry about the movie references but what is this the same guy so two years into investigating this the Midwest Innocence Project are finally able to get a retrial and they were able to let the innocent Richard go on the evil one is still out there somewhere but not after already spending 17 years in jail even more hilarious is the fact that the prosecutors said that he couldn't press charges on the actual like evil Richard because a trial with a single eyewitness who said he was on crack wasn't enough to convict anyone oh my god are you are you sure I'm sure I can think of someone who might disagree with you but how weird is that like same city same like hairstyle same name same facial hair like I don't know that's just that's crazy number four ready Peter and Brian nickel burns so there's been a lot of stories on this list of just cops making mistakes getting the wrong guy this time they come intentionally falsified evidence to convict three brothers of a crime they didn't commit that came to be known as the Perth Mint swindle which obviously sounds like the name of an alternative Christian rock band hey guys were the Perth Mint swindle this song is called my hands are not for premarital relations Sanford praying but the Burkman swindle happened in 1983 when six hundred and fifty thousand dollars of gold was stolen from an Australian Goldman and the single most daring heist Australia has ever seen afterwards with no immediate suspects officer Tony Lowen doubts he pointed to the three brothers as a possible suspect for some reason where they were found guilty and sent to jail for twenty years while in prison B brothers tried to get their case appealed saying that they were obviously framed but only after already serving eight years in jail where the brothers finally released on parole in 2002 nineteen years after the robbery had taken place officer Lewandowski admitted to fabricating reports and forced the three brothers to give false confessions by having them beaten during interrogations so yeah whoever actually did this crime was able to get away with it essentially because this one officer wanted to pin it on these three innocent brothers and like for what reason like what did they do well anyways before lewandowski could actually be processed and sent to jail as being leave literal worst cop ever he was found dead in his home from an apparent suicide man I really want to cut this guy out for being a Butthead but I really don't want this video to be de Bono to us oh can I say wanker is that YouTube from anyways the brothers were finally compensated nine hundred and fifty thousand dollars from the years spent in prison for the Perth Mint swindle is still unsolved in this day what's pretty cool though is that in 2012 an Australian TV show was made about me permit swindle called the great mint swindle and you guys just gotta watch this trailer because it's great how far was this detective willing to go I just gonna take the scary narrator voice in an Australian accent seriously the most daring heist destroy he has ever seen the most earring heist Australia's ever seen the best part though is when they list off the costume brands Bolla toddler sass Josh quant art and Shane Bourne want polar kikiwaka choo whistle make drizzle fizzle big names an Australian Hollywood that you should clearly know I'd probably watch it if we're gonna be honest with each other I'm totally watching it today and finally at number five Arthur Allen Thomas so while being convicted for a crime you didn't commit probably sucks a great deal of giraffe taint imagine being convicted twice for the same crime how what what yes Arthur Allen Thomas a farmer from New Zealand was convicted of the same crime twice after the 1970 murder of Harvey in Janette crew and when I was researching this story to actually figure out why the police even arrested this guy to be good with the only thing I could find is that the police literally arrested this guy because he lived in the same County as the murders police in that count here like do we have any suspects yet well they do the deranged son that just escaped from an insane asylum ah who has a previous record of buying guns and shooting them into the air shouting I hate my parents but I can't find him anywhere so I met that bomber did it well I'm not following your logic there Frank but let's go get that son of a bitch so Thomas was arrested and during the trial since there was next to no evidence he was released only to be retried a few months later as new evidence had surfaced on a rifle shell from one of his guns in the garden of the couple's of state fortunately after further investigation it was determined that the shell had actually been planted there by the police as extra evidence to frame Thomas that hurt my throat dramatic gasp but in 1979 after nine years of being imprisoned he was finally pardoned by the New Zealand government but no charges were made against the officers who falsified evidence and there was no apology to his time being sent in prison so what the hell New Zealand I thought you were supposed to be nice yeah freakin Lord of the Ring and Maori warriors and cool accents hspeed night it seems

guys we just did a podcast with Brandon Roger oh my god it was so much fun it was fun we talked about a lot of offensive things you're going to be triggered hey what's up you guys yes welcome back to another conspiracy theory video now I just have to give you guys a huge warning this video is going to involve some incredibly dark and deeply disturbing theories and some of them aren't even theories some of them involve suicide hurricane Harvey and child molestation so I am warning you upfront this is going to be very very intense and possibly triggering a video and if you want to click off and leave I completely understand for those of you who decided to stick around I want you we're going to be talking about the dark dark world of child molesters in Hollywood so first let's talk about Elijah Wood so Elijah is a huge actor and he's most known for the Lord of the Rings but he's been in Hollywood since he was a little kid I mean do you remember when he was really little and he was in that movie flipper what's his name his name is Phoebe well not that long ago he came out and said that he believes that there's a conspiracy to cover up all of the big Hollywood agents managers and directors who are molesting young actors okay now first let's talk about a documentary that came out a couple of years ago called an open now this documentary talks about all the child abuse that goes on in Hollywood that nobody talks about it was even marketed as the film Hollywood doesn't want you to see now this isn't just some random documentary that some like crazy conspiracy theorists like me it would have made this was directed by Amy Berg and she's been nominated for an Oscar for another documentary she made so clearly she knows what she's talking about and the stuff in this documentary is you'll get signed by a label you can on Disney Channel you know what kid wouldn't want that right so there's a bunch of stories in the documentary about child stars who were molested by their managers and their agents and there's even one moment or one of the child stars is secretly recording his manager while he talks about him molester I remember the Adam ever did anything with the guy before it was not interested at 12:00 now one of the most intense parts of the documentary is when it tells the story of a man named Brian the heck now Brian Peck is an actor that's been in a ton of kids TV shows you might remember him from all that pickle boy his pickles taste bad well allegedly while Brian was filming these kids TV shows who is also molesting in 2004 Brian Pett was convicted of a lewd act against a child and oral copulation of a person under 16 now in the court documents it says he was charged with 11 counts lewd act upon a child sodomy of a person under 16 sexual penetration by a foreign object and many more well he served 16 months in prison and then he was released now you would think after that he would be banned from Hollywood right two years later he was back on TV and not just any TV he was back on kids TV that's right after being convicted of molesting a child they put him on a kids show so in 2006 he had a part on the suite life of zack &amp; cody and the creepiest part he played the voice of a mirror that told underage kids how they look [Music] okay these are the nicest things I own what do you think of this one [Music] [Laughter] yeah literally the voice of Emir you can see his name in the credits they weren't even hiding it and the things they had him saying as the mirror honestly feels so creepy after you know his past I'm here to take you on a little trip come on step in to me okay thank you been going to nothing on the glass cleaner trust me on this sweetie have I ever steered you wrong before yeah and then there's even a part where she goes inside of him look the scariest part about all of this if you go to his IMDB page he worked a lot and most of them worked in shows and for some reason nobody cares nobody's firing him nobody is saying no they are letting and work now we're gonna talk about another person in Hollywood that continues to get work who is a child molester have you seen the movie jeepers creepers it's a movie about a monster that finds people eats them and sucks the meat right off their bones and what if I told you that that movie was written and directed by a convicted child molester that's right victor salva was convicted of sexual misconduct with a twelve-year-old boy in 1988 now this is where it gets crazy the twelve-year-old boy that he molested was starring in a movie that Victor was directing the movie was called clown house and it was a horror movie about three young boys who were being hunted by a group of psychotic Klaus and if you watch that movie and think about the fact that the main character is actually getting molested by the director it makes it even so the star of clown house was 12 year-old Nathan Forrest winters now while they were filming the movie Victor the director would ask Nathan to stay after they were done shooting for some extra rehearsals now during these rehearsals Victor would force Nathan to have sex with him and while they did it Victor kept the cameras rolling he wanted to keep the footage for his child porn collection now eventually may --then told his parents what was going on and the cops raided Victor's house they found a bunch of child porn including the tapes now Victor was sentenced to prison after this and only had to serve 15 months that's right 15 months for literally raping a 12 year old that he was filming in a movie what well you would think after that he would be done nope seven years later he directed a huge movie called powder yeah a big-budget movie that was in theaters was directed by him and it was produced by you guessed it Walt Disney Company yeah the same company that employed Brian Peck on the suite life of zack &amp; cody after he molested kids now they're giving this other molester a huge budget movie well then years later Victor went on to direct Jeepers Creepers and when you know the backstory but a figure and what he's done it makes that movie extra scary especially the part where the creeper is on the back of a school bus and he's licking the windows while he looks at underage kids [Music] while now Victor has a new movie coming out Jeepers Creepers the rain while people are pissed so pissed that they even canceled the premiere of the movie and now it's not even getting like a wide release I think it's literally only going to be in one theater for like one night well when Nathan Forrest winter has found out that there was going to be another Jeepers Creepers interview by the man that molested him when he was 12 he said this it is my belief that we as a whole in this country have been too afraid to face such an unspeakable topic and continue to turn a blind eye which has allowed these predators of our children to go unchecked for too long now Nathan is lucky because he's alive a lot of child stars who were molested grow up I can't take their themselves one of the most famous child stars who took their own life was jonathan brandis now when he was a kid he was in so many movies he was in the neverending story movies he even had a huge part in the original it and he was incredibly talented [Music] [Music] while years later when Jonathan was 27 years old his depression got to that on November 11th of 2003 he hanged himself it was awesome to us now he did not leave a suicide note but his friends believe that his depression is about his waning but many people look back and wonder what happened how did an actor so good grow up to be so depressed Oh a 1995 he talked about the fear he had losing his career it's a really tricky time I've seen I've seen guys my age my friends that I haven't been working for a year because they got off a show or they did a film and it came out didn't do so and whatever it has never been confirmed or suspected that he was molested as a kid but honestly I would not be surprised just look at some of these professional headshots that they had him take at such a young age yeah shirtless and definitely under the age of 18 and look at this one though everything about that photoshoot makes me super uncooked now once again I'm not saying he was molested but it definitely was being taken advantage of a lot of ways and unfortunately it ended now this theory that Elijah Wood was talking about but there's tons of child molestation going on right under our noses is still around I'm not gonna go into it because I want to get sued but I have heard so many stories of people that I know who have been on sets with young people who might be getting taken advantage of and then when you bring it to the attention of the executives or the people in charge they had like a crazy and they act like it's not real but I think in Israel I think it goes way deeper than we could ever imagine I mean just like the poster for the new descendants to Disney movie says long live evil and evil it's definitely alive alright so moving on from one incredibly triggering conspiracy theory to another we're going to be talking about hurricane Harvey so hurricane Harvey has been one of the biggest disasters in history so many people have lost everything and many are fighting to survive well recently all the news networks have been reporting non-stop but not just the facts they are trying to get as many stories as they can CNN in particular as people questioning what their motives are some people think that all they care about is ratings and not the actual survivors just check out this clip of a CNN reporter talking to a survivor but y'all try to interview people during their worst times like that not the smartest thing to do like people are really breaking down and y'all sitting here with cameras and microphones trying to ask us what the fuck is wrong with us well then something else happened on CNN and it was bizarre look at this get out dude so while the CNN reporter was talking a truck drove into a body of water and the guy started to drown so then the reporter ran off camera and went to see hold on I'm trying to get you a rope and then he saves the guy and instantly starts interview experience this man just accidentally drove into a ravine that looked like a road didn't it yeah a lot of people think that this was faked and that it was staged so CNN could get big story and get more weeks so first I want to show you the clip of the reporter running to go save the guy and check out what colors Sean sees where yeah khaki shorts okay well now let's look at the clip of him actually saving the guy welcome our shorts is he wearing now all right so you know ma'am yeah very confusing literally khaki shorts and down my pants so did they cut the camera when they turn to the sign and then put him in a different outfit and save the guy or was that a stunt guy there's a lot of questions now listen I am the world's biggest conspiracy theorist and I love venom this one I do not believe now I believe that CNN has faked a lot of shit but this one in particular is very touchy and also there are these some evidence to show that diary so CNN is saying that the reporter and the producer of this segment were both wearing the same red jacket and you can see it here they clearly are wearing the same jacket so they think that the person in the khaki shorts was actually the producer and he was standing watching everything happen now I believe that I don't think this was fake I do feel like it was weird that he interviewed him right afterwards but CNN should not be surprised that were questioning this I mean how are we supposed to believe anything we see on the news considering how low they'll go I understand what the microphones then they might babe all right last but not least we're gonna be talking about something that I have not heard about be getting an update on Marina Joyce so as you remember about the 2016 save marina Joyce was taking over the Internet so Marina was a youtuber that make videos in her bedroom and back before the Safeway and joyce thing took over he was pretty normal hi guys I said that I would do a glitter eye makeup tutorial for you guys because I think people like to look at my place who you guys and I really want to show you guys how I do my like glitter eyes I think it looks awesome alright so she talks a little fast little quirky but definitely nothing worth worrying over well then a year later videos like this started freaking everybody out hey guys so today I'm advertising star you and I'm advertising their clothes so this is me just advertising no codes now that video has 40 million views mainly because people were so confused how did this normal girl turn into this robotic person that's when the theory started blowing up the main theory was that there was somebody keeping Brina captive and they were drugging her and forcing her to make videos to make money because most of the video she was putting out at this time were all sponsored by weird companies and then in this shot you can see she's filming with the product there's a hand on the side of the frame holding a cue card what to say and yeah I love you guys so much it's the clothing company that I'm advertising and this is the dress that I'm wearing yeah creepy and that's just one of the theories there were millions well then she did an interview for DeFranco where you could tell maybe she was just dealing with some stuff people stopped worrying and started thinking well maybe she's just going through it well then I didn't hear anybody talking about her at all and it's been a year I decided to go back to her Channel and see what was going on and I was shocked Joyce is normal again hi guys today's video is talking about am I pretty enough so this is based around society and society's beauty standards and I just wanted to talk a little bit about how everybody is beautiful yeah she's speaking clearly she's acting normal she's also making videos about topics that are important and interesting I mean look at this one she's even more normal in this one hey guys today's video I'm doing how I did my makeup in high school and this is just an emo kind of look so yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this week what why is nobody talking about this why hasn't nobody like oh my god Marie Joyce is a person again I mean literally a year ago she was like this and this is my garden I'm going to show you around my garden and now she's like this hi my faithful people today I'm doing a video called facts about me wait what was that Illuminati confirmed now I'm just kidding but in all seriousness that was very intrigued by this like this girl seemed to be controlled by the Illuminati or the government or drugs and now she is literally fine totally normal know what he's talking about it and nobody's asking hey what happened so then I went to her Twitter to see what she was tweeting about and see if I could make me drink message her and do an interview with her and then I saw this she recently tweeted life is very hard and I'm so sorry if my life falls to pieces and you don't see any more of me anyone now this broke my heart for so many reasons first of all this girl went through some shit like we don't really know what she went through but she went through some shit and then she got her life back together she started posting normal videos again she seems to be in a good place and now there's something going on so I feel like now more than ever we need to show her support just send her something some kind of love because I felt like she would there's so much year ago the whole internet was Colyer crazy fake and this and that but then nobody talked about when she caught it back together and what she like became normal again well dammit I'm talking about it marina Joyce I ain't proud of you I don't know what happened I would love to know more but I am proud of you for turning around and making videos affectionate messages I'm sorry that was cheesy but I just wanted to talk about well there you guys go that was a lot once again I just want to say I'm sorry if this triggered anybody but honestly as a victim of abuse myself I feel like it's important to talk about it if you don't it just keeps going unnoticed and I just felt this video so hopefully you guys enjoyed these conspiracy theories and hopefully we didn't understand too much you want more dog theories like this please let me know give me a thumbs up and also make sure to subscribe my channel hit the notification bell because I make new videos okay and if you want to sell my other conspiracy videos I'll put a link to a playlist for the top bird screeching oh I have some more fun ones so not like Taylor Swift and Harry Styles and happy ones alright space I will see you tomorrow don't read everything you see 
hey what's up you guys okay I have to be really quiet because Garret is in the other room and he has no idea what I'm planning so I'm told him that today we were just gonna do a dumb makeover video and I was gonna like give him some new clothes and it would be funny but the secret is I actually have a blind date coming over to my house tonight after the makeover and he has no idea so Garrett has been single for so long and he always gets matches on the apps but he never actually follows through with them so I decided to take his phone when he wasn't looking I talked to one of the matches that he matched a long time ago and never talked to you and I told him to come over tonight so I really hope this works out this is genuine this isn't fake like I genuinely want this to work out so it's not really a makeover it's more me getting Garrett ready for a date that he doesn't know is happening and he's probably gonna be pissed and don't want to be friends anymore let's do it yes today I'm going to be fixing him no I don't need to be fixed maybe just a touch here's the thing I think you do have oh my god what am i doing can I leave or are you gonna say like the bones of something salvageable you have something it's like Jurassic Park where he's like dusting off all the fossils and he's like I see something big Oh big no you do have something here it's just hidden in like rags you know okay I don't want you Disney but you're like what's the princess who's like homeless and then the rats come and make her dress and happily yes you are the homeless Disney Princess and we're gonna turn you into the Beast oh he's handsome I want to be same okay so before I show you my inspiration for this makeover I asked you to bring some of your favorite go-to clothes so that I can critique them so I did wear my favorite shirt which is my PlayStation shirt remember how we talked a lot about why you're single the reason is this shirt when you have a pig on your shirt it's available now Dotson okay oh wow this is one of my favorites so I got you this shirt it has lobsters on it this was back when I had no idea what I was doing about Shane is this weird I brought my favorite underwear it's clean I just washed it now looks like something you would take a selfie I'm in the mirror like perch your little you're welcome oh this is my favorite I just bought this shirt and I really I'm sorry you don't wanna I can't stop and then I brought these pants because well I just like orange rust orange is one of my favorite colors that's Brad that's chocolate brown I like earthy tones we have a lot of work to do I was not expecting this much let me grab my phone okay here's my inspiration so you have to trust me okay I'm good here what are you doing you're not putting me in this I'd rather die hear me out what I like about this look is the confidence which I don't have that next okay sorry that was a joke but this next one is real hear me out I'm not sure so I'm looking for something that's a spice of color and just like a smidge of I'm the most annoying person in the world now this is for your hair can I see it oh I've been wearing hats a lot lately because I just cut my hair really short nuts in that face did you cut it yourself well Shane I do it up and it's kind of nice your hair's not bad but we need to figure out something to do with it so I was

that needs to happen you just don't change I don't even know what to say I'm actually kind of scared to I literally don't remember his name I think you'll be there you'll be there and I'll be there what's the first thing you're gonna say I this is not gonna go well you need somebody be on my own that I would like to fucking down [Music] 
I know what you're thinking Shane why is your skull wearing a queen crown and the answer is I'm crazy and also this is not gonna be a security video so I'm just having some fun into the scary table but this definitely is going to be a little scary because I think it's illegal and I might get arrested that's right today I'm going to be attempting to buy views and likes now over the last 10 years of being on YouTube I have heard so many rumors oh this person is only popular because they bought views in the beginning when that person has a bunch of fake Instagram followers I've even had people come to me thinking that I was buying views like thank you for thinking I'm smart enough to know how to do that but I'm not I still don't know if it's real because how does that even work like is it real views is it people is it babies like do they just put like a bunch of phones in a bunch of babies hands in the nursery or like in the hospital like right after they're born and they're just because if that's the case then I love it I love babies and I love retweets so today I'm going to be going down the rabbit hole of the Internet and trying to see if it actually works right so before I started filming I did find this video by a girl named Hannah doorman she said-she about 100,000 views on a YouTube video it worked I bought 100,000 views on a video of mine just to see what happened it worked I've got 100 thousand years in fact I've actually got 103 thousand views on it but the one thing she said about it was that all of the views came from not America like most YouTube views come from America the UK but when you buy them that's not the case 21 percent came from Brazil 14 percent came from Thailand no views from the UK no views from America I'll link the full video down there I was really interesting go check it out but she did not explain how is she bought YouTube views like she didn't give away the website so now I have to figure that out and I know you're thinking Shane aren't you gonna get in trouble for buying views on your channel like isn't that technically illegal and what I would say is yes that's why I'm buying them for my mom's jail now if you are not where my mom is an influencer my mom literally gets more Twitter interaction than I do let me give you a peek oh my god first of all my mom has over 50,000 followers why does she always say it's so hard to find a man girl check your dance all right let's see what kind of content she's posting okay dog in a pool oh that's right my mom got into a Twitter beef with one of the Real Housewives she said hey Lisa Rinna damn she added the bitch you may have been rude to me just now in Ventura Boulevard but guess what bitch I've got Shane Dawson's mom so I got over it quickly 9000 lights I love when my mom turns into a drama account and let's see what else selfie with dog Oh God picture her and me back when I used to look like Garrett more dogs dogs a cat dogs dogs dogs dogs dogs so clearly she doesn't need me to help her with Twitter but she doesn't need a little help with her YouTube channel now my mom's YouTube channel is called mama Dawson and it has 7000 subscribers now that's okay they're all portrait what's this one thinking of you bubas side no my mom has a name for her fans get on her level [Music] invented carpool karaoke invented carpool karaoke where she's not singing along she's carpool listening [Music] same relay [Music] that's a laugh I think that's a Christian bow but we love a good father son in the holy bow okay so this video has 6,000 views so my plan is to buy a hundred thousand more wait call them before we move on I just want everybody should know that my mom has Sam videos [Music] can I pay to delete that video okay so now let's figure out how to buy it and that video of you okay the first website that popped up is called a build my views org okay looks not legit looks like something I would have made when I was 12 online journal $90 for five thousand views that's it a hundred thousand views a hundred and forty nine dollars that's it for a hundred this can't be real what is this I buy quality YouTube views today but where do they come from Oh frequently asked questions are these views real every comment on my video why are people watching this yes space exclamation point these are real people who have taken the time to view your link over a period of time we have grown a vast amount of a fillip as babies this is babies it's literally a baby farm can I slow the process down what does that mean can I get less views okay should I do it ha what if this isn't real like what if they're gonna hack me okay whatever let's do it fuck it I'm gonna buy my mom a hundred thousand views I want James Corden to be Scheck all right I'm not gonna show this part cuz uh you know I think it's illegal so I might have just bought views online all right so we'll look at that a little later let's move on to Instagram okay so I was trying to figure out a person I could buy Instagram likes for that wouldn't life get ahead of me and I thought about Rylan sister like she likes me a lot she wants Instagram followers I feel like she won't be mad let's look at her account all right so here's her page four name is Morgan ooh you know but her page is better than mine how many followers does she have just 5,000 listen not bad look at her life but curse Damon on the building if I post a picture of me standing on top of the building that's gonna be the last picture I post alright so if I want to buy likes on one of her pictures what would it be oh wait up hold on see I am going to buy lights on a beat picture because I think it's funny and I also think she'll get a little scared like imagine like waking up and having 10,000 likes on your foot picture that just makes me smile okay the most popular one is called insta boost gram this will look slightly less scary no it's scary there's literally pictures of babies I'm so confused you can buy a hundred thousand followers out of stock dude all the babies died okay I really want to buy her followers but I feel like that's taking it too far so I won't do that let's go to likes 10,000 likes but I love that there's a disco only quality likes what does that mean no need to like others me okay alright let's do this Add to Cart Instagram name okay I'm gonna fill all this out and not show you because it might be illegal but we might have just purchased ten thousand likes on a picture my boyfriend's sister's feed hi welcome to YouTube that comes lashade nice to meet you okay I do want to try buying followers for some Instagram account so I did see an account the other day and it's real and it's just called it Shane's green shirt six followers no pictures and I have no idea who runs it so let's blow up their phone notifications alright I'm gonna use the same website I'm going to buy 50,000 followers I mean I'm not going to because it's illegal we'll see how it goes ok Twitter so I want to buy retweets and I thought of a perfect person so one of my favorite fans ever she's been with me since the beginning pretty much is a girl named semi Terra now she is so sweet I literally like flew her out here to be on my podcast I just love it alright so let's look at her Twitter oh my favorite youtuber director author and podcaster is at Shane Dawson you forgot my role model but that's fine alright let's go through her tweets I love her pin tweet bitch socials I love this use a Pinterest wheel of a queen of all social medias alright let's see what her actual tweets are so far I'm just seeing a lot of retweets I'm having trouble finding an actual tweet Oh oh my god don't be a fake-ass bitch that's a favorite okay I think what I'm gonna do is I'm just going to buy ten thousand retweets on her pin to tweet because when people go to her page I want them to be like bitch got a lot of retweets should I tell her though yes I'm gonna tell her I'm doing this because I don't walk like her phone to blow up and then her being like what's happening so I'm gonna send her a direct message and be like hey I'm buying you ten thousand retweets don't ask okay well that's fine a website okay I click on the top one with growth twig growth ya know this looks sketchy as fuck Wow $49 for 10,000 followers but from where I'm still so confused how it works okay here we go using our groundbreaking proven tactics just got this up building in another country full of babies clicking on their phones we know what you're doing these inactive followers have full profiles and our backs wait what inactive are these dead people you might literally buying dead followers like our unist I'm going to put that on our drivers licenses now like organ donor think follower how fast is it deliver ten minutes siming only shook all right let's buy her too retweets I guess oh my god I mean I don't know did I do it or did I not do it if I go to jail for this I'm ready I need a break okay so to review I bought my mom 100,000 YouTube views I bought Ryland sister 10,000 likes on her feet I bought Shane's green shirt 50,000 followers on Instagram and I bought City Tara my superfan ten thousand retweets on her socials and I guess I will check all of this later today and see what's happened see you in prison okay so it is like three hours later and I am about to check and see what's going on alright let's start with my mom's video so last time we checked my mom's video is at 6,000 views let's see what it's at now oh my god 20,000 views who are these people I love the idea of like some people in another country being forced to watch a video of my mom on portrait mode apart listening to Christian music in the car that's a money well-spent right let's see what's going on with Rylands sister's foot picture what is my life so before it I think I had like 300 likes oh my god oh my god 2600 lights way let me refresh oh my god oh my god oh wait what's going on why is this

just texted me what's happening huh what do you mean my sister literally just texted me saying what is happening and she sent me her photo with literally nine thousand likes okay wait caller [Music]

let's see if that went up and followers before it had six oh my god 300 303 it 307 it's going up it's going up slow though it's been a few hours alright let's look at these followers are they the same that's a baby that's an actual child this looks real Victor this looks real is this real is he dead what happened to him she looks you know that looks like low Michaela with boobs you look good though robot Sims are killing it 355 okay alright I literally cannot believe this is working I thought these were gonna be scams I mean they are kind of they're currently probably draining my bank account there's currently somebody in another country like I got Shane Dalton's car oh let's look at cemeteries Twitter her retweet before had 13 retweets now it has oh my god this is so funny okay I'm gonna DM her and see if she's okay I'm gonna tell her to film her reaction I'm gonna need that wait let's look at it again what's about now it went to 20,000 I think they only bought 10 when they give me more dead people that I paid for okay I think I'm gonna let this sit for a few more hours and then I will be back with the final update and all of my money in my bank account probably gone okay hi I have zit cream on my face and I haven't showered today when you literally are becoming me okay do you want to see the final reveal of my fake followers oh yeah when you're me and James Charleston okay so you already know about your sister but I did end up buying her 50,000 more followers I haven't seen if it's work yet okay so let's start with my mom's video last time we looked it was it 20,000 views those a few hours ago see what it said now anyone could be famous my mom is a viral sensation in India that's in credit call her she might not even know that she put up this video mom do you remember the video you posted thinking of you bubas it was you in the car listening to music for me well you probably don't remember this but you only had six thousand views on it back in the day okay well today you have 65 thousand views on it guess where they came from I bought them online to see if it would work and it did I don't know if it's illegal or not I wanted to try it out but you should have a hundred thousand views on this video by the end of the night bye see you at VidCon you new viral star okay okay I love you it's not illegal I don't think she's going to jail okay okay let's see who else okay your sister's followers so before she had around 5,000 followers let's see what she has now it's only been a few hours [Music] 31 to point 4,000 followers honestly the beauty of yours are sheikha you know who else are shaking the food fetish community because her foot picture let's see if it hit 10,000 yet Wow well let me see what Shane's green shirt has before I think I had like 3000 oh my god did you buy I guess a about 50 we're close forty six thousand followers okay so are you gonna do some like investigative journalism and find out whose phone I just broke no I just want to save it work okay see me Tara sent me a video of her mom reacting what yeah alright let's watch it what did you buy twenty thousand [Laughter] fake retweets to the police showing up at Aaron's house I think that's it right yeah Wow I did a lot well guys I have a lot of thoughts number one does it work yes number two do I think anybody should do this no unless it's a joke because it's not real people I don't think these are real they might be dead they might be babies we don't know but people are gonna know if it's fake or not like if you have 20,000 likes on something and no comments like people are gonna be suspicious also does it matter numbers don't matter what matters is if you're putting out good shit that people actually like if you're putting out something and you want much of numbers on it what's the point although my mom's video of her not singing along to a song in the car definitely deserves a hundred thousand views okay guys go hopefully you enjoyed my experiments I'm actually kind of nervous I need to run this past a lawyer I think I'm okay but either way I will never I make a promise here pinky promise I will never and have never bought any views or likes or anything for myself ever in my whole life and I don't plan on it if people just stop watching me then I will just say alright because what matters is you guys the real people who are alive but if you die please still like my videos all right you guys I'm gonna go hopefully enjoy this if you are alive subscribe in the notification because I make new videos every day and let me know down in the comments what you think about this if you've ever known anybody that's bought likes or views or anything and if you've ever tried it and if you want more videos like this where I try stop and experiments and do very scary things online let me know I'm gonna go clear my history [Music] [Applause] [Music] 
hey what's up guys my name is Destry welcome back to what the fuck 5 so now Halloween was a couple weeks ago and you'll be happy to know that I did not dress up like dark mom is here I know I'd heard of I was actually a vampire this year and my outfit made Twilight look heterosexual not an easy thing to do but that said I thought today we would talk about another scary topic and one of the scariest things to me is weird and unsolved mysteries so talked about this topic a little bit before us if you haven't seen that first video make sure to click here to watch that but for today's video we'll be talking about five more unsolved mysteries so number one the Max Headroom incident the Max Headroom was the host of a show in the mid-1980s called the Max Headroom show but I honestly cannot even explain what it was about I mean this was the intro to the show yeah like what the fuck is that show about anyways so the Max Headroom incident happened on November 22nd 1987 during the nine o'clock news on a local channel in Chicago when the screen suddenly went black for about 15 seconds followed by an unknown man in a max headroom mass moving around on the screen for about 20 seconds straight while he stared into your soul I don't know why that's so good if you to me but I just imagine that you're coming home from a long day at work you're trying to catch up on some news and then all of a sudden this pops up on your screen with no explanation and no audience yeah no that's a bagel bottle of note right there fortunately the network was able to switch the frequency of their transmitter back to the original broadcast and no one really knew what the hell happened it even the news anchor words afterwards Vermont so if you're wondering what's happened as I mentioned this was just one of the times this happened as the exact same broadcast went live just a few hours later to another local Chicago channel who is playing a doctor who rerun but this time the network wasn't able to switch it off so quickly and so it played the entire broadcast but this time with the audio which just made it even creepier [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] as long as I can tell a massive evict okay yeah yeah actually that actually happened and this might just be me but why is it that a man in a mask being spanked on live TV is still somehow better than keeping up with the kardashians that's the real mystery right there but since the broadcast aired no one really came forward and said that they did it no investigations have really turned up any evidence or people that might have been involved with him so whoever did this creepy broadcast at 11:00 at night has gotten away with it for 30 plus years and I just spent like you know haha we were able to hijack a network I mean even the news anchors that covered it later hauled them pranksters or pirates and while it may have been of stunts it is not treated as a joke Chicago's video pirate could face a jail sentence and fines for his freelance exercise in public access so it's probably just a prank but it still doesn't make it any less creepy number two Kanika Jenkins so the depth of kanika Jenkins was actually a topic that Shane covered in one of his conspiracy theory videos but since the topic is so recent I thought I would cover it again and obviously I mean no disrespect for the families that were affected by this interestingly Cooney cos family actually believed a lot of the conspiracy theories because they're just not convinced that she would have died in such a strange way so 19 year old kanika Jenkins left her house on September 8 2017 to go to a party at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in downtown Chicago the next morning she was reported missing and no one had any idea where she might have gone and it wasn't until several pleas from canmake his family that the surveillance footage was released and actually showed what happened and I'm warning you the footage is disturbing knowing that these are the last steps that she would ever take as kanika Jenkins was later discovered dead in the walk-in freezer of the hotel [Music] [Music] and this obviously sparked a lot of controversy you know like why would she go in the freezer to begin with I mean it was obvious from the footage that she was intoxicated or on drugs but even her own sisters spoke out about her death with her own insight as just how weird it was that she was found dead in a freezer that many people speculate was almost impossible for her to open in the first place Shane mentions in his conspiracy theory video a lot of what people believe is that she might have been murdered in her body left in the freezer as some people believe that the Crowne Plaza Hotel might be a site for organ trafficking and I don't know if I believe that I mean maybe I just don't want to believe it I would actually like to have good dreams tonight so I'm gonna just ignorantly pretend like that's not a thing but what is interesting is that so many people around this area seem to go missing coincidence probably not but according to connect his autopsy which came out sometime later her official cause of death was hypothermia from being exposed to the cold for so long with their alcohol and drug use being quote a significant contributing factor other than that there wasn't any like ligature marks on her neck so she wasn't strangled and there wasn't any evidence of physical or sexual abuse so it could just be a huge accident but we may never know number three Bella in the wit gel so I'm just gonna say this one is probably one of the oldest mysterious deaths that still has not been solved to this day but has too many theories to possibly list in this video so I'm only gonna be talking about the ones that I find the most interesting so back story so in Hollywood England in the mid 1940s for teenage boys decided to go poaching for birds in the middle of the woods one of the boys climbed a tree to scout for bird's nest when he looked down and saw a skull in the hollow of a large witch elm tree and after thinking that might have been an animal that just got trapped within the tree they quickly found that they discovered a real human skull in the tree as it still had bins of hair and flesh poking out of it dude if I would have found that in the fucking woods I would have died hell no so the boys went back home and as they were doing something illegal on someone else's property they vowed to never speak of it again that didn't last long as one of the boys could not handle what he had seen had nightmares about it and finally decided to tell his dad so he obviously calls the police and upon checking out the hollow tree they found not only a skull but a nearly complete human skeleton along with a shoe a wedding ring and bits of clothing oddly though one of the hands of the skeleton was missing which was discovered buried nearby and after examining the body they determined that the skeleton was a middle-aged woman who had been murdered and put into the tree for over a year before it was discovered so news about this spread across the UK and as this story picked up even though they didn't know her name people started to graffiti the words who put Bella down the witch Elm all across the town this is where a lot of the conspiracy theories come into play a lot of people thinking that bewitch Elm is actually significant and if you put a witch inside of a witch helmet like nullifies their power and she's not able to do things past death it's also weird that her hand was missing as many satanic cults believe that if you remove the hand from a which it actually nullifies her power as well not to mention the weird graffiti popping up everywhere which many people believe that everyone knew more about her death and people were letting on and I don't know if you've seen the movie Hot Fuzz but it's basically like this whole town is in on this like giant cult type thing so it could have been the same exact thing as the only thing that police really knew 100% is that the woman was not from the area so you know like why would a foreign girl come to this small town and just end up murdered a few days later but throughout the subsequent years of Investigation no one really found anything as far as a lead and also as I mentioned they weren't able to identify the body as this was all happening during World War Two and there was obviously a lot of dead bodies which made finding her identity even harder but for the sake of me not overthinking this and not having terrible dreams I'm just gonna pretend like this lady actually was a witch and if she wasn't killed and put into this Wiggum then she might have haunted us and cursed us to have toenails four eyelids and anuses four lips yeah that doesn't sound pleasant at all so good job for murdering a woman that's something I never thought I'd in my life and now to take a break from the creepy ones number four benjamin kyle imagine waking up one day and not even knowing who you are not knowing your name how you got there nothing well this actually happened to a man named Benjamin Kyle who was found naked outside of a Burger King with several injuries to his body after he was discovered there he was sent to the hospital and treated for his injuries and when he was finally able to speak he told the hospital staff that he couldn't remember anything and didn't even know his own name all he could seem to remember is that his name might have been Benjamin with two A's by the way so it was more like Benjamin here's how you normally spell Benjamin and here's how he spelled it so I guess Benjamin so Benjamin assumed the last name of Kyle has sort of a placeholder for forms as a joke to make his initials BK where he was found ha ha that's a good joke so after being transferred back and forth from different hospitals and homeless shelters with absolutely no success of founding out who he was he was invited onto the dr. Phil show which launched his unusual condition into the public spotlight unfortunately even with dr. Phil's help no leads came up no one really sang he I know this guy so he remained the world's first missing person despite his whereabouts being known so this continued on for years appearing on more TV shows to sort of plead his case and in the meantime since he didn't have any idea or social security number or birth certificate he wasn't able to work beyond being a janitor and living in an air-conditioned shack in Florida wow that's terrible mostly the being in Florida Park that place is the worst but in 2015 after 11 years of amnesia and a dozen DNA tests a match was finally found he was discovered to be William Burgess Powell a native of Lafayette Indiana so where he got Benjamin I have no fucking idea Benjamin must be his superhero name I am Benjamin having amnesia is my power it's really not a good power man I have no idea but Vincent's identity has been found into trying to reconnect with the people that were as friends and live out the life the way you should have and not stuck in a shack washing dishes in the butthole of America seriously that place is the worst so yes not all of these unsolved mysteries will remain unsolved forever but this one was a mystery for 11 years and took up a ton of this man's life so that's why it makes it onto this list and finally number five abies voices so this one just fucks with your mind and there's still no explanation as to anything in his story end it with we'll make you question everything in your life okay so a bees voices is the story of a girl in the 1960s known only as a B so a bee was having a merry old English day when all of a sudden she started to hear voices and he might be like oh that's just schizophrenia there's a lot of documented cases about people hearing creepy voices or telling them to kill things it's actually not that uncommon but in the case of a bee the voices in her head weren't yelling at her or telling her to kill people but instead according to her said in a calm voice please don't be afraid I know it must be shocking for you to hear me speaking to you like this but this is the easiest way to think of my friend and I used to work at the Children's Hospital Great Ormond Street and we would like to help you apologies for that terrible British accent by the way but of course completely understandably a bee was absolutely terrified I would have been shitting my pants I mean I don't usually wear pants but I would 100% be pooping in my Star Wars pajamas so a being continued to hear the voices until she finally decided to go into a neurosurgeon named doc for a zonie and as boney did everything he could medically to figure out what was going on with her where the voices were coming from but after running several tests nothing came back so she leaves everything seems fine but a few days later the voices come back telling her she has a brain tumor and that she needs to go into a hospital and do a brain scan after finally giving in to the voices demands sure enough the scans found a tumor on her brain stem exactly where the voices said it was oh yo what the fuck even more crazy is that the tumor was in such an early stage that they were able to operate and remove it and she ended up making a full recovery which if you know anything about brain cancer that's like unheard of but when she finally woke up from her recovery she heard the voices for one last time saying we are pleased to have helped you goodbye and since that day she never heard the voices again ah yeah I don't know I got nothing so this one is just crazy I guess some people believe that maybe she already knew that she had cancer and she just went in there to prank them ha ha ha gotcha you gotta realize this was in the 1960s when there was a lot less awful people than there are now but other than that no logical or scientific answer has ever been given but some people believe that it was God or a telepathic person that wanted to save her I don't know it's just it's crazy so that said that's why a bees voices is still one of the most mysterious unsolved mysteries but that is it for this episode of what the five hopefully you guys enjoyed it honestly I'm real spooked out so I'm gonna go fucking turn on all the lights in my house and probably watch a feel-good movie like grown-ups just something that's horrible but will take my mind off of this terrible stuff yeah that sounds good that's it guys I will see you next time for another one fuck five thanks for watching and Fairwinds

hey what's up guys my name is destory and welcome back to you what the fuck but thank you to Matt Johnson who suggested the topic for this week's video and remember if you'd like to leave your own suggestion for a future what the fuck 5 episode make sure to leave those in the comments down below that said guys without further ado today's video we count out the top 5 strangest ways people have gotten famous son wait guys I found my voice goes out today is probably because I played overwatch a shitload yesterday and I screamed at the fucking screen for about two hours straight I'm not too good at that game but I just wanted to tell you in case you hear a lot of it so this day and age it seems like people aren't getting famous in just the weirdest way it's possible from a we're dancing shark that took the internet by storm for some reason - damn Daniel and whatever the fuck that was Daniel it seems like there isn't really a formula for what the internet will do me more than enough to be popular but one thing is for sure all of it is just really stupid that's at number one on this list is Danielle Brooke Jolie a prime example of exactly what I mean you might recognize her as the girl that says we're just from an interview that she had on the dr. Phil show and she was only 13 where she was caught stealing doing drugs and generally just being the worst person in bathroom and I personally tried to cover this on my what the fuck new show to the point where I actually had a professional trying to tell me what she was saying kids Beyonce you know you gotta go set catch it and then yo she's gonna tell you what something you gotta know what she's saying and I gotta be honest I still don't have a fuckin clue what she was trying to say but since the interview she has amassed a ton of Fame online to the point where she now has apparently bodyguards protecting her and charges upwards of 30,000 dollars just to appear places let's be cool to discharge $30,000 just up here somewhere I'm not gonna buy a fuckin whopper you don't take me for showing up to buy a walk she's also made a ripple in the rap game I'll be in a very tiny ripple when she released a song called these pill skis hoe Noakes PTO's I mean what did that say I know she's trying to say these hoes but that does not say that by her stage name but at the Habeas is way more fun if you pronounce the H is way too much in her name hot baby hot baby [Music] you know wished to be deaf but with this and fucking Jake Paul yeah call me nice not to hear what the fuck I had a hard time understanding one sentence from her this just sounds like a satanic ritual with the rap beat over and the main problem I have with this is just that it glorifies just being a shitty person you know it's like hey kids you want to be famous to be terrible number two oh ma long canal coma so Omar broad canal gamma is the Saudi Arabia man who malaria Slee got famous for being too good-looking Arabic newspapers called LF reported that Omar was kicked out of a festival by religious police claiming he was too handsome and there are concerns that female festival goers would be distracted by his glowing radiance apparently not only this but it was also stated by many news articles that he was kicked out of Saudi Arabia altogether what seems to be the exact same but he's a dude what is this guy's life how cool the up to field feel like I can't go back home and watch why not just too attractive man he's too attractive yeah now can't relate meanwhile Here I am in my mid-20s and the greatest achievement that I have under my belt is that I once won a yugioh tournament when I was 12 whoa yeah watch out for this badass overhere apparently though he wasn't actually kicked out of Saudi Arabia as he still resides in Dubai and now makes his living as a model because he's as the kids say but since the news article his popularity has skyrocketed because as we know attractive people always get famous for doing nothing tell her that salty why do you ask Omar though has embraced his newfound fame by posting updates about his life to his 900 9,000 Instagram followers and over half a million Facebook followers and even became a spokesperson for Samsung I'm a big photography guy I'm a photographer my song I knew at the same time as your phone so like you can get any better than those before you get your tickets to Tobias stroke this man meat sticks it's actually revealed he's married and has a kid and because of course he does if you're a girl you're gonna make sure to watch this shit down before these hell steal them away because as we know the best way to get a man to stay with you is to poop on a baby and tell them it's him this has been life tips ancestry number three Kevin Federline so if you're around during the early 2000s you may actually remember a Kevin Federline who really was only famous because he was married to Britney Spears for a couple of years this being when Britney Spears was the number one biggest pop icon of the time as oops I did it again had just ravaged the world because that song is fuckin dope the coven himself really wasn't famous for anything prior to his relationship with Brittany but that her through his connections as a backup dancer for artists like Justin Timberlake Michael Jackson Destiny's Child and pink and whatever sorcery or pickup line he used on her clearly worth as he too were practically inseparable until Britney filed for divorce in 2006 reasoning for the divorce is apparently due to Kevin's hard partying habits but I gave me the only one who thinks it's hilarious that she decided to divorce him one week after he dropped his first rap album entitled playing with fire which was a critical disaster it is still the lowest rated album on Metacritic with reviews like wow this is so bad holy shit I'd rather staple my nuts to a wheel of cheese than listen to this shit again hilariously also Brittany's sprung the divorce on up via text message the night before the papers were signed which I imagine probably went like this oh wow my husband made a rap out let's listen to us dear Kevin I want a divorce but since his divorce he's been doing pretty much nothing occasionally appearing on TV for random interviews but mostly is just spending time with his children that he had with Brittany and sporting his brand-new you are born oh wow look at that sad body hashtag dead body sadly Kevin's Fame can be described as started from the bottom now I'm here now somehow I got back down to the bottom again and at the bottom I found myself way more obese than I was before and I have a hashtag dad Bobby number for mikkel it looks heat oh that's probably the widest way I can say a French man's name I have a fine apologize Mikkel Latino who is also known as mr. Ito when as his name suggests eats practically everything you know I know youtuber who eats everything I think they get along mr. e doll got his fame in the 1970s and 80s for regularly consuming things like lightbulbs metal screws shopping carts TVs and even eating an entire airplane the only thing he refuses to eat is bananas and hard-boiled eggs which he says gives him heartburn due to them reacting to be metal in his body and as the sounding as disability is I can't help but wonder how he even got started doing this in the first place you know like one day you just randomly decided to eat a fucking light bulb I mean there's no way that tastes good or even feels good going down anyway these doctors were astounded by his crazy diet were determined to find out what keeps him from you know just dropping dead from eating so many dangerous and shrunk objects and it was revealed he has a very thick lining in his stomach and intestines that allow him to consume almost anything without injury turns out eating weird shit and having an indestructible stomach can make you famous who knew just be careful about going to the bathroom I didn't say anything about his butthole being indestructible oh but for having me we this diet in the world he was awarded the brass plaque from the Guinness Book of World Records which he apparently also ate sadly though he died in 2007 from natural causes somehow unrelated to his crazy diet finally number 5 is for Becca black who got famous for telling us what day of the week it is fiercely if you want to make it big in the music industry you have to make a good song to impress people with your musical talents the same could not be said for Rebecca Black we've got famous in 2011 for releasing these songs Friday which is the easiest way I know to make a human's ear bleed [Music] you know I never loves that song so much that he actually threw up brick through my window just so he could hear it better for my apartment as bad as this song is I've got to say it's not the worst thing I've ever heard I heard woo-wee terrible music now so I can't really make fun of it that much but the song which now has a hundred and eleven billion views smartpaker ear for Rebecca on YouTube where she now makes vlogs and for music I'd never been to Oregon before so I see Portland for the first time we drove all through the country the Eclipse itself was so worth going to see you [Music] and I wanted to end on this one because it goes to show that you could be famous for something completely terrible and then totally turn that around and make something really positive out of it and I for one respect the hell out of Rebecca black for not just caving into a deep dark depression the likes of which she can't escape from but actually making a career out of it and rising above the hatred that she got and not moving across the country and changing her name to Toto blacken mockery because honestly that's probably what I would have done and I think that's the note that I want to end on because you know out of all the terrible things that we talked about today weird ways to get famous I think this is the most positive one anyways guys that is it for this episode what the fuck five hopefully you guys can join it I'm very surprised that I didn't lose my voice throughout this whole thing if you were to see all the outtakes though you would know that I have cracked my voice at least a hundred times during this video and you're probably what yeah but if you did enjoy this video make sure to give this video a like and also subscribe to the channel as there will be more every single week also guys it would mean a lot if you win and checked out my channel youtube.com slash cat Vestas where I post all sorts of dumb shit that you're gonna hate I'm actually posting up a video of me reacting to my old videos soon there's actually a really hilarious video of me and Shane when we were like seriously like I feel like 16 or 17 first ever collab video so I think you guys will love it definitely check that out that'll be up on my channel hopefully at the end of the week that's it guys I'll see you next time for another one of a 5 thanks for watching and Fairwinds [Music]

a song together like a new song yes like we make our own what is she's intimidated by my bars are you rapping oh well I mean I theory I could spit a little yeah how do you record your songs daddy do you wanna help us record a new bob so while he's setting up the recording studio I think we should like go outside think of some lyrics some Bach melodies let's go make a song right okay all right squad where's Garrett if we're gonna record like divas we need to look like divas I call Janet Jackson from the late 90s but very early 2000s I got Britney I got everyone I got Katy Perry who chooses what I want this to be a serious song give me the blonde wig give me the next thing by my neck is too fat for this just give me the Liza Koshi wig I'm Janet Jackson can you buckle me yeah everyone good drew what are you okay let's do a song about new friends it could be called best friends for these computers it's coming it's coming come on Liza give me a pun Liza best friends for oh my god we all like cheese we talked about that earlier I love to use cheez-its and particularly best friends for cheddar wait what does it mean best friends for cheddar cheddar start at the beat and think of a course about finding a best friend and then you find out what you have in common is cheese [Music] we got all this jamming going yeah and we just found out something we all like cheddar cheddar cheddar best friends for cheddar yes Oh sprinkle cheese on me let it melt on me huh I like to eat I like to drink I like to hang out with my 14 yo you know what I want from the store it's my favorite cheese type I like cheddar or American where are the flights get me out of here get me out of this place I wanna go that was deep okay carrot what he got okay girl I make cheese I'm talking this stuff yeah I got a little of this happening imagine hundred-dollar bills right here well I think we're done dad is a recording studio already good cuz we have nothing - oh my god okay let's start writing friends friends friends oh Jesus this friendship is vegan we feel good but no one's beefed it sometimes we get cheesy if I'm a vegan if you're eating cheese you could incorporate gez and feather pretty easily pretty easily hi I'm Garrett okay we're ready to record the UPS guy just walks by by the way it's all meeting with dad what are you thinking should we all record it once let's give that a try it should worship her so whenever it's our turn and just don't jump on the mic okay whew I love making music lieutenant let's go let's do it okay the Ghibli we're gonna go top of the charts we're sitting with our friends we hope it never ends but we know it won't as long as we tell me you know what I want extra cheesy on top that grease is drip drip non-stop then with my friends I made this Bob Joe I don't like cheese because it makes me fat with ease it's sticky and it's a gooey and that makes me very sticky it brings beverage together and I know we're not forever well they're worse for now but I hate killing cows okay yo I'm a stuffed crust boy and my close friends they bring me joy yo I got that mad cheddar but my hygena could be better i got that Hufflepuff flow we love friendship and playing in the snow y'all this friendship is vegan feels good and all was decent but sometimes we speak cheese and so I guess what kind of vegetarian we all got a different flavor but it tastes so good together we got sharp and shredded and stinky and fired this cheese will never expire I want you to get up that was insane I think it is time to go to my mom's set up the stage my mom's favorite song of all time it's cause I'll stand by you it's really good so I kind of think it could be sweet if you start like when she walks in singing that song do you think you can learn that song okay perfect okay so I just wanted to prep you a little bit about my mom um I sent her the video of you rapping to Eminem on the street they know this is where she said that she said oh my god when I started watching her rap on the street I stood up from my chair but all I'm gonna say is if you bring her to my door rapping I will pass out right in front of you my mom is a super fan are you prepared for that so you're gonna do that song but you want to throw a little rap in it like a melody when do you want to practice a little bit so this song in particular just a little backstory is a huge song for my mom when she was married and she was working in the church and she had like a youth ministry they would play this song like at the end every little church group and my mom still cries whenever she hears it so it means a lot to her which is why I thought somebody like you who she loves performing it would be everything so I don't know give me a little taste I sing for you I stand for you I wanna nobody hurt you I'll stand by you [Music] [Applause] don't want me all inside come on talk to me we both tell me something different it could be some faraway bit outside the distance running in the rain I might go insane but I know it's worth because I'm saving you from pain oh yeah you are the only one so many stars in sky but you are my one and only son running away from problems in any bed and something but don't wanna make you go and worry even if the world is kind of blurry we can make it through the fog would you call me with me and I'll be there oh my god oh my god if I'm crying my mom's gonna kill herself soon a jump into a furnace I love you I am so excited that I randomly stumbled on your channel and I'm so happy you're here and I'm sorry you're not afraid of me okay alright do this okay yeah we just got to my mom's house the squad is behind me in their car so we need to get my mom hidden while we set up the stage yeah so what do we do do we leave them in the car yeah they're fine they have a heater they have radio all the hits it's dark I don't know every time you do this she's got a point I'm scared bad baby is here what you know about

by you I'll stand by you who only nobody hurt you I'll stand by you if you make it don't hold it all inside come on e come to me we both be so far ahead of the fun of distance running into rain I might go insane but I know it's worth because I'm saving you from pain oh yeah you will the only ones to me sounds good but you are moving all these under run away from problems in it that isn't so don't want to make you call me worried if everyone is kind of blurry we can make it through the fog so mom what did you think it still can barely breathe and that song honey is like oh my gosh what did you think originally when I sent you her videos oh my gosh I just couldn't believe you're not already like a huge star I couldn't believe it so do you have any advice for her going into the music industry Oh stay away from Taylor Swift hey but I'm like her new album I know but she should make it jump all right mom oh I'm glad you like your song and I'm glad you didn't die yeah or pass out okay

the night and that was such an incredible day for so many reasons meeting somebody who I really really believe in who really did affect me with her music and made me cry the first time I heard her rap it's really refreshing to meet somebody who's talented but also so humble and down-to-earth and like a normal kid not somebody who's trying to be a youtuber or somebody who's you know taking a bunch of selfies and doing all that stuff she genuinely like just loves making music and is really good at it and I am so so proud of her and excited for her and I just can't wait to see what happens and

your circle oh my god wait what ah I have a cold diet root beer for you oh and this is the Queen herself Megan's mom patty-cakes hello we were always in your house making very very strange videos yeah

laughter you guys are having fun well your house looks amazing I'm gonna have some of this Tigerettes beer I'm really nervous and it makes not good how are you feeling the same I'm nervous too wait I'm sorry what I just what is that it's my engagement ring you're getting there it just happened oh my god yeah we want I don't know maybe Alaska Alaska okay whatever bye that looks like the heart of the ocean oh he went down and got it for me all right well we're gonna hang out and talk and stuff and then now we're gonna talk about murder yes do you remember when we would drive around on like Saturday nights yeah what a Walmart go to Yogurtland we had a lot of fun we were under 21 we had nowhere to go so we just made our own see here's the difference those when you turn 21 and when everybody else is turned 21 everybody started like partying and drinking and having fun I was still going to Walmart still going to Yogurtland wouldn't like what changed for you honestly the honest truth about it I was still in the closet I hadn't dealt with the bisexual thing and I was afraid that if I got drunk or if I drank I would tell somebody or I would like try to kiss a guy just to try it out I mean that that means that you could have had a lot more fun I could have said a lot more dicks oh my gosh this is the school this is so weird it's been years [Music] you just think go would I did that's their catchphrase all right let's see if we can break in well we're not doing that I'm not physically fit enough to do that what if we give you a list I'm I need an uber I'm I need I'm gonna need a car to run through it wait there's somebody out there wait maybe they'll let us in excuse me can we come in I'm trying to relive my youth wait these are coming oh my god he's coming so you just have to be nice to people we're here to burn down the school we're not doing that oh okay change of plans what if he walks all the way over here and just tells us to leave update he literally walked all the way over here just to say we're closed wait that's where we shot a video with Kirk right there oh my god that's where we shot oh this is like where I shot a lot of our high school videos I never thought I'd want to go inside a fight all right well let's sit on the ground and let's talk about our theories so when I misses you you said you weren't surprised yeah I think there was the initial shock like everybody else but then when I really sat back and reflected on who he was throughout middle school in high school I wasn't that surprised anymore there was some odd behavior wait what I never heard him talk about anything personal I mean I sat next him in a lot of classes but I never heard him talk about friends or family or girlfriends or anything like that and I noticed that he never had and tell me if you remember something different like a true like laugh or genuine reaction to something that we've matched the rest of us I always kind of felt there was like a coldness or just like a maybe smugness I'm not quite sure what it was just something not fully there with the rest of us I don't know if this is an exact time no by no means a professional but I just think it's odd that from sixth grade to 12th grade as long as we knew he never changed his hair he always wore some sort of polo I feel like in like khaki shorts he just looked the same to me every single day every single year there was never even you kind of changed her hair do you not remember I was just thinking I did five years literally wears the same thing every day every day do you have any theories on why he did it a lot of people I talk to think that it was drugs and a lot of people think that it was insanity because there's a lot of psychologists involved in the case I just have like a weird deep feeling that there's more to it like I don't think he just snapped I don't think that's I don't know I just don't feel it when we first talked about it I had a feeling just looking back on who he was as a person like maybe he's a sociopath and just nobody caught on but I was thinking that again maybe I mean he killed his uncle maybe there was some sort of molestation in his childhood and I know that's awful to think about but what would drive somebody to take those steps and family member yeah I mean that's something that like I was even nervous to bring up but it's something everybody's thinking about but like none of us you know like cuz none of us knew the uncle and he was probably a great man I mean it is one of those things like when you're not given a reason like in the court documents in every document I found there's no reason for murder he just said she did it never said anything during the trial and then they sent him to jail so it's like can I ask you a question yeah because you seemed really affected by it and I don't know if it's just curiosity or you're disturbed but why do you think it's affecting you so much I think I'm affected by it because he was a part of the popular group that he was always really nice to me and when the popular kids would make fun of me he would be the one that would kind of really quietly tell them to stop or say like machines cool you know I did a video with him where he played a killer like I made him kill somebody the video which is crazy but I don't know I just had this weird connection to him like he was the popular nerd and I was the unpopular nerd and I felt like a bond so him doing this like I wanted a wife the one thing I remember that he did so I was you know a big kid and I was sweating a lot and I would always wear like a t-shirt with a button-up over it because I wanted a barrier but sweet my sweat and my clothes so I had this shirt to kind of catch the sweat I would put my button up over the back of my chair my desk so that it wouldn't touch my sweater and I did that one day the person behind these desk got smashed up against my shirt and I didn't know and I was about to get up and it would have completely like ripped my shirt off and he stopped me and he was just like hey did your shirt and I was just like oh thank you and I fixed it and I know that's dumb and I know that's just like whatever but nobody in high school is like that with me nobody really cared or helped or was nice or if anything I was kind of joke sometimes it's like for him to do that even those little that's why I'm struggling too because it shows that his feelings and it shows that he cares and shows this he's empathetic like so I'm not buying the whole sociopath like oh whatever like I think it's something bigger than that because why else he would just let my shirt get ripped and get marason father yeah you're right he didn't right well speaking of high school I don't have any of my yearbooks or anything I have a feeling your mom I happen to have every yearbook freshman sophomore junior senior oh and there's the diarrhea again I wonder if I ever wrote in your yearbook like I wonder what I said probably 8-bit oh my god that's the Walmart that we stay hanging out at I'm such a loser that's the wall oh my god the long beach town center this was the jam I had so many what I thought were dates at this movie theater and then it just turned out no I was the fat gay friend who they just wanted to talk to you about the boyfriend so memories alright there's one thing that I've always wanted to do I hate that I'm doing it but this is the Barnes &amp; Noble that we went to all the time I went there like every weekend God Starbucks looked at the sex book all the Kama sutras but now I want to see if they have up there which is so gross I should put my book next to the sex books that would be like full circle we really am in the Christian life category definitely not that closer there we are oh my god should we spread them out perfect I love a supportive boyfriend oh no sorry we'll stop it's you so can't you do whatever you want I love that attitude that's the YouTuber attitude jabbin on the nadir of course because it's mean we're eating and we were just talking about how in class when we were really poor if you look across the room in each other what did we do we can to mine so if there was a video or a lecture that was just literally killing us we were creative yeah I remember stabbing my own self in the neck and then across like that you see most people remember things like from our homecoming our first kisses I just remembered me and my best friend minding these two killers okay so I thought this would be the perfect time to say something and see what your reaction is okay there was a period in my life I'm not gonna lie I might have had a crush on you [Music] okay did you know no was I [Music] was I being muffled like was I trying to make you feel like you were gonna be a boyfriend no I'm actually kind of hitting but I'm I'm not no I I'm just so happy that I'm here and I'm so happy that we're talking we're reconnecting and we're gonna go back to your house talk more about murder and high school how was the transition all right bring in the yearbooks Oh oh my god oh are you ready to see what I look like this is supposed to be extraordinary or anything but wait what for anything but extraordinary that's not good I'm not relating on that did I write in here who's this whole page what is she in a tree I don't know how does she die what happened no this is the back where like parents could buy their kids the hell yeah I'm nothing really good I don't think I've ever seen that crazier oh my god that's not as bad as out yeah like she doesn't look too bad oh my god wait where are you it's bad huh did you look like the girl from the ring the deadlines who crawled out of the well no but in a cute way like before she died like in the flashback Oh thingies my mom is better you had a glow up oh my god wait we just found what I wrote in your yearbook what did I say love it if you would at least that I probably said that and I did yeah did you do anything that would have gotten like a name in clubs or no like desserts look for eating alone by the girls bathroom you can always go to the Gay Straight Alliance this is crazy the blood drive pictures of everybody screaming bloody murder literally what wait wait wait okay do you sign with the footprints between everybody else's picture oh my god oh my god I literally just got the chills I wasn't even we weren't even looking for that like here's the difference there's Katherine who is always just bubbly and light and then the other picture that actually like actually scares me yeah he looks scary oh my gosh wait when I went to the bathroom I looked into one of the rooms and I saw a couple Lakewood shirts I can pull them out a few more what size are they medium or largest if I could fit into a high school shirt I've never been in South reacts hey let me go oh my god of dreams are happening alright yeah yeah okay it's a little tight but uh you know I almost fit into it and that's a big deal for me are you ready class of 2006 [Music] No [Music] when we started this today I didn't know this is where we're gonna end oh my god it looks like one of those like most likely to well over we most likely lose we didn't get voted most likely to I mean I know he technically did it but I think I'm most likely to kill somebody like keep it real and you're most likely to be the person killer Sophie I'm just kidding here the person that I would call after what a night we started thinking it was gonna be about something scary and dark and then it got scarier and darker talk about ourselves yeah thanks for always being nice to me and being a good friend [Music] okay so I just got home and that was an unexpectedly fun day which is kind of weird because I went into it thinking it was going to be more about figuring out the mystery of murder and kind of just turn more into me reconnecting with an old friends which felt really good it's definitely been interesting lately I feel like I've had this weird thing where I'm constantly making all these videos about my past and reliving my childhood and talking to people from high school and I'm not even to do it it's just kind of happening but every time I do one of these videos I feel like lighter I don't know I'm not gonna question it anyways back to Kirk today I genuinely saw a different side of him looking at all those pictures again hearing her side of it and what she noticed about him I'm definitely a little more confused a little more conflicted but I'm gonna keep looking for more and more answers and I've tried to reach out to his family I think I'm gonna do it again maybe I'll try to visit him in jail I don't know I'm scared of that but I genuinely want to know more hi Howard you guys I'm gonna go and I might not have found out the reason for murder today but I definitely enjoyed reading it a really good mystery [Music] all right let's get a thumbnail that's really uncomfortably looking at each other over a plate of food so I think the vibe is like like they never knew [Music] 
because yes I am scared today I'm gonna be watching a bunch of compilation videos I think I don't think they're hater videos maybe now I have been seeing these a lot and I have not clicked on it maybe a button and I'm sure you guys have - there's some called like this she doesn't okay and some called Shane Dawson at one point to pay for five minutes both of which I would like to be played at my funeral but I've actually not seen any of these mainly because I don't click on anything that has my name in the title because I don't like looking at myself if I could not click on a mirror I would so here we go we're going to experience this together get ready to cringe did I say cringe I might cry alright this first one is called that is Shane Dawson okay this should just be a really short video that just says nope somebody saw the real darkness in my videos this video is only two minutes long I feel like it should be you find out race oh I think this video is something I should use for like when I get a new therapist and they're like tell me what's your issues hmm I'm just gonna email you a link I met this six year old child blank emotions thanks the blackest eyes oh this is actually making me question okay nevermind I know the answer but wait did you see that see what I'm trying to think of a conspiracy I don't think this one should be played at my funeral I think this is my funeral alright let's watch a snorting compilation years ago I had been a pig since you've been born do I have what did you find a problem I don't know about like what if I do it you needed septum pack nose job what if I'm just getting fatter and it's getting harder to breathe me out okay this one is called youtubers annoying Shane Dawson for two minutes two minutes did you mean 10 years don't touch me that's not real though I love Gabi it's more like when people touch me I want to burn their hands off but that's my issue no wonder I smell I'm gonna go soon or until I die to be fair though every time I collab with Joey like the schtick is that I'm annoyed if I don't want to be there which is also my shtick for lives like a [Music] mean girl inside bitch you thought musically stars were robotic I just powered off whoo this one's called Shane Dawson getting angry at youtubers why do people invite me over a cute boy was I wrong look at that fucking beep I was genuinely like shook by my love but that is not Geoffrey's fault that he's gods oh wait there's a video call that jeffree star annoying Shane Dawson for a minute so a lot of these products law I mean you never see any of these broader the first step here is primer okay I don't think I'm looking no that's just my resting face I just have a rest why am i alive face so I shadow palettes usually range from like twenty to forty dollars this is what I'm thinking I don't give up up I was thinking is your dick tattooed and you put makeup on it a lot of people actually pull this thing out of it makeup is messy it looks gross I wasn't kidding here's the thing I did not mean any of this to look like I was annoying it's just the vibe of colliding with Jeffery is like hanging out just like whatever so I wasn't like trying to be funny the whole time and also that make it was messy like on camera I looked so beat and then when I don't have a mirror I wanted to beat myself up I love Jeffery so that was funny see what's next this one's called a Shane Dawson throws ultimate shade at Tennant mojo based on all the previous videos they have done and all the tweets we've seen on Twitter you may believe that Tana and Shane are good friends first of all I love how serious this is I'm gonna sucked in until Shane's last video where he throw shade at Ana so hard he calls her Twinkie and this is what he has to say about it Rickie's sit down like I know you want to roll with the minions or guess what bitch when you get involved in a controversy bitch and somebody makes a Content cop on you all that maybe they gonna skedaddle so Twinkie what you need to do is you need to apologize you need to admit you're wrong I need you to go back to what you're known for which is delicious fattening sugary ice flavor or fat fucks like me this might have also been a note to youtubers how was this shaded that was good acts advice bitch that advice you could pay for and by the way this is stuff like Paulo Tana in private being called a Twinkie is literally a compliment but it's coming from me now if I called you a broccoli oh wait this one's called Shane Dawson annoying his ready to watch me to know this makes me think I hate you the a is really good [Music] wait wait do you remember yesterday with it what oh my gosh in the plane yeah oh my gosh the number one thing that Shane does that annoys me is when he digs in his ass to itch it but under his boxers so when he pulls his hand out it smells like dirty asshole and he did it in an inquest plane sorry I pulled out a hand sanitizer just so I it's my ass and I was like trying to be like all like subtle about it so gross well yeah just reliving the plane pretty tell me what you I didn't believe that our post mates here it's now sitting across your bed yeah here's your picture oh when I'm so annoying you just want to get me drunk so I'll pass out so I'll black out and maybe die this room wait what it's time that you called me hola Chris I

that googoo gaagaa girl of my jujitsu dreams is that maybe soon and then maybe like this in real life oh my god you don't know much humor there's no dog spit oh so nervous me too I'm shaking so this is like crazy is not just a video I mean what I told you that me yeah this is like real he is well you've known and rude forever Andrews like I can't pitch him like well enough he's just one of the most like genuine guys ever sometimes he'll just like see a post and just be like man this girl is like so cool like because I asked him I was like you know you have this crush on magnet to like tell me about that that's so interesting secure so she's like really pretty he's like no it's because she's like everything that I wish a girl would be here's my favorite part so last night I was with Andrew and I was like he's so scared that he was gonna find out I don't know why and then I wanted to show him something on Instagram and he pulled out his phone and you know how when you would assert something it shows the last thing you serve yeah and it was you and I was just like oh my god screams like a bitch excited what's your situation so you're single very much so okay so like how has that been more makeup cuz I thought let me cry I just hadn't found like the right person I'm like I'm 26 now I'm like so over dating in general like there's so much like blah out there and I want like the real funny thing like I'm ready no he's so cool no he's have an idea yeah so let's go over to the table so I was thinking like what are some typical questions that you ask on a first date what they're passionate about I want to know because when someone talks about what they're passionate about they just light up you know I want to see who they are as a person I don't want I don't really care about the true beauties of like their favorite food right mine's nachos but yeah I mean three months ago she was so nice he was such a gentleman it's just so boring like I remembered almost on sleep like andrew is not poor he's so funny no I'm not so crazy oh my god no I thought you're falling asleep and you're laying in bed you're thinking about it and it's like a brother he really is I fucked my brother in my dreams favorite rapper Oh favorite natural environment people love forest beaches I love that question favorite natural environment oh my gosh let's get you hidden upstairs my room so you'll just be like here okay and then when I'm like Riley says you don't wanna hear Andrews if I Bailey's to be to do for a second what secret doesn't tell anyone okay let's go downstairs and wait um so I think what we should do is set up the ring right number two I'll pretend like I'm setting it up for the video it was abnormal oh yeah act like you want to fuck him Shane have you guys my new switch batteries why [Music] Oh No oh my God my mom he's gonna pass out said about Oh welcome to my god okay well let's have you guys sit over there and get to know each other okay so we are sitting we've been hanging out for a couple minutes how are we feeling I'm feeling great I've already like passed out or whatever's well okay here's what I think we should do Garrett you take Andrew upstairs and get him cleaned up but get him date ready and I'm gonna stay down here and kind of get you know Meghan's initial thoughts and see where she's at let's go my boy okay he was okay wait wait what are you thinking how are you honestly feeling like cameras great really yeah well that's right if I've been over in this it's over I know that he's like overwhelmed and read you cuz he's scared he's usually not that ready I promise not what do you think about him and you can tell he's to me and grounded and like he's like a very down-to-earth person it's not like weird or anything yeah there's a Britney t-shirt I mean I could for the Britney team okay stick going yeah I make the team if this was a yeah [Music] okay okay okay yeah all right so let's move this date to the dining room table and see what we have in store for our new couple madam come with me ignore the hair goop on my hands it's just their group I promise a little cupcake residue on the table familiar mr. gross okay it's not across the menu for you - oh my god notice that some of the items might match your own personal interest because I went through your Instagram Megan for a long time and also I just know Andrew so those are an accumulation of both of the things that you love we're going to start with course number one this out Oh fine little drink oh my gosh - mrs. zwicki what - mr. Oh put this here just some inspiration oh wait it right me Andrew loves Tootsie knows pizza rolls yes let's walk away and you guys have some real genuine moments you answer these questions you are created by her alright we won't be listening okay the brat that's right yeah that's I have to I would expect nothing like they are cold but I'm gonna keep on drinking this good if you want to make me not feel like I'm you know grandma favorite rapper old school or new school drink mmm how old school you talking about like the first two mixtapes or like scared so far gone like so far gone up towns my favorite yeah I do oh my god well it's your favorite drink um uptown mm-hmm take loves great you like a new something join it I do oh my god and people on Twitter like I like this other one but I like as well right but we both like God's plan what's something you like about yourself oh this is a good question it's hard one for me oh I think I'm really resourceful and really genuine I think that I'm in people's cornered all the time even if they're not there for me oh I had one oh I'm sorry real quick can you just look at the very top of the menu that's a holy Sh did not I don't know what that is I'm a vegetable is maybe it's something to talk about this is core to nobody but like literally are you do you like it helped me a lot yeah I used to be really into that really yeah whatever tried I mean a lot of its visualization right what's so like dissociation do you have you tried it but what don't work for you like the swish pattern' and all that shit have you tried it for pain it's called neuro linguistic programming so you have to do you do you love your family with I was a hen atomically good childhood it was like really cool parents so like they were really great to me and they still are they're very supportive and nice and I love them my family is awesome I didn't have a lot of support they wanted me to go to schooling and graphic design degree they didn't really support the dance thing for a while because you can't make money off of it for what they thought they weren't super supportive of that employ showed them that like hey here's a paycheck from this movie I was in they're like oh now I now you can go and like we believe you which is I get it was all out of love but it generally felt like you're not in my corner right hi they wanted they wanted the best for you but at the same time they didn't completely like yeah until what you believe in you yeah they don't know what the best for me was they knew what the best threat that was but I do love them yeah I think it's time for Andrew to go to the bathroom oh you have a pistol [Music] okay how is it going I think great really okay I think so too I think so too you guys are both into the same shit it's it's a very weird thing and I'm very like you know not self-conscious but it's is like okay I know I'm reacting to this and like a very like what the fuck is happening way so there's like part of it I get a sense that she's liking this really how are you feeling about his interest good I think I think he is a genuine person I think he's obviously it's a weird situation but I think that he's being like the best thing you can't and I think that he's really receptive to what I have to say know what I was talking about my family he was like listening is it like even that is more than you'd get in a typical la guy are you okay with dating right now I didn't even know if I had to be honest really you know what I live on a date I contact it's beautiful I didn't it's pretty easy there's some eye contact that you can make this says I know since the video but these do scoop but like I don't see I'm a cop they're coming back so I think now we should kind of show each other maybe some of our talents down a little rap you can also hit the whip really good remember testing testing up so you want me to UM I'm going to get up here with you freestyle rap yes shit is my boy yes [Applause] yo side man Garrett I want to scream scary movie on a ferris Oh Shane pranked me I hope it's good content can't wait to read all to Andrew so awkward comments right before my eyes oh my god I'm gonna die why is she here it's crazy I feel like I need to get a pie in my face positions and saying well wanna go base-jumping off playing hey I don't know if that's gonna make sense carry with baby oh my gosh it's great to acapella it I don't give a shit [Applause] [Applause] well here's my version of moments okay I think you guys should just do a little slow dance okay really nice little circle and then you'll release me and we'll go this way and then I'll come back [Music] that was great I don't know there's also there's desert here is one payday you'll have to split it is that okay what K days oh it's cuz it's candy bar is it really yes I don't know anyone that even knows that yeah it's actually very good that's pretty oh you like it okay I've never I've truly never had the mower I only eat Kit Kats and Twix mm-hmm how about another question what's your passion hmm what they're passionate about I want to know because when someone talks about what they're passionate about they just light up my passion I think my passion is probably helping elevate the talent in people that I love even attending that's my passion that's awesome yes a hundred percent oswalt question back to you just like making people's days better if they're bad if someone's having a bad day being able to turn it around with whatever I can do anything good I can do to make someone feel better I will do and I'll go very far just to do it Wow oh that's like the people I love for sure um but yeah just like this world is filled with chaos and I want to be able to take someone out of that and make them feel good heard validating all we don't get in this world they're making me cry you're both so nice oh my god I'm just trying to get at that painting just a little answer sorry sorry sorry okay next question Angier favorite natural in the vise-like the forest well great well um I think that we're gonna go over there you guys can see our goodbyes and say your whatever and then yeah yeah that's great [Music] Hey alright you guys have a nice little talk outside we're really gonna leave you on this time for ya oh this is this you guys bye [Music] let's go I think they're not my thing our love it's okay [Music] she's [Music] keep talking I don't do things I hire people act like we're not even here I'm just gonna crank this outfit hey guys so how's it going good well thought it was going it was I guess the last question is is there gonna be a second date also the second last question is do you mind if I finish your payday well Megan this was as fun and exciting as this was I don't know how realistic it was for us to get to know each other so if you would like to go on a date with me that wasn't as entertaining and as you know a little less Garrity and Cheney in reality although we will miss them yeah if your date they'll be there if you want to if you want to what but if you want to go on a second date that would be to go on another day chef [Music] and by the way this you don't feel pressure this is here for the video I mean if it's awkward if it's weird I'll just cut it out and everything will be fine so be genuine be real did it go well yeah I mean I I think one alone would be good too I do love you guys that I want you to be there for another one Oh we'll be around don't worry are you saying that you think would be more than two days I mean I can't tell each other nobody can tell future Shane but you're invited to squat okay it is later in the night and you drove her home I did try it first of all yes how did that go it was great it was just talk I honestly like I feel like crying right now no I do I thought was just I really do like that was so fucking sweet I okay here's what I think I don't know listen I feel like there is a genuine connection and I feel like she he was genuinely into it I think with me it's like I like being around her you know it was just like a it was it was just a nice just positive thing was she everything that you hoped for honestly yeah which is crazy because it's just a crazy thing to say I'm not I miss this sounds a little weird it really does but I miss you guys together I know that I do I'm just happy that you don't hate me and like you're not mad at me I hate you at all there's not a speck of anything of a hatred towards anything I just hope that something comes out of it and even if nothing does come out of it I hope you remember this night for the rest of your life I'm not gonna ever forget this I know seriously I'm just happy that you're still alive and you didn't die no I'm good okay oh here we go oh my god [Music] you 
guys oh my god we just did a podcast with Barry and he is a penis performer his penis was out he made it into stuff a burger a hotdog druish shook justice quaking Aaron Robin Kingdom covers also here this was the craziest day of my life check it out I'm glad I got a post-dated friend buddy hey what's up you guys yes welcome back to another conspiracy theory video now after Dave's video we're going to be talking about a lot of different theories and some of them involved in your favorite youtubers but before you smash that dislike button just remember these are all theories although some of them might be true and before we get to all of that I'm going to do an update on the movie poster theory that we talked about a couple weeks ago so as you guys remember we talked about how so many movie posters look identical to each I mean we went through so many different posters that looked identical to other movies well since that video so many of you guys can find you or you can send them to me and they are crazy here's just a few of my favorite so first we have the poster for it follows you see a couple making out a car nine middle of nowhere if that looks familiar it's probably because you see the poster for Riverdale that's right a couple making out in the car a little of nowhere no literally the same poster that they're supposed to for Star Wars The Force awakens which looks identical to the poster of stranger things I mean even down to the coloring like the left side of the poster is kind of an orange and the right side is a blue you should tell me then you have the poster for ladies rug which is a girl in the darkness and wings schooling her hair and she looks serious and then the movie came out called let's be evil a girl and dark hair is blowing serious and you just put them next to each other not identical then this next one is crazy on the left of the movie called shock collar and on the right is a movie called snitch literally must a filter anything that is the same and I'm about 99% sure it's the same body like just zoom into the pipes really quick literally the same muscle the thing shirt the thing pocket on the pet everything about it and there's like hundreds more than you guys been sending me and I cannot stop looking at them so please keep sending them okay so now we're going to do an update on one of the craziest conspiracies I think I've ever talked about on this channel and I think I've done ten videos about her that's right we're going to do an update I will Michaela that's right little Mikaela the girl learning scribbs nobody knows if she's real or fake now I'm not going to go over the entire story and all the updates because there's too many I will make a playlist online conspiracy video solo image but today we have a new one that is very confusing to me first let's start with something that I saw on Twitter so a Twitter account called super deluxe tweeted at Michaela and said how many retweets for you to come on why I know if I could retweet that 500 million times I would well then Michaela responded with lol he's fooled at super-deluxe want me to go live should I now over 5,000 people favorited this and a thousand or more reach we did it but she did not go by the Betty she did something that we had been weak little Michaela released her first single and this is the first time and we actually get to hear her voice okay here is just a clip from her music video that she posted for the song [Music] a lot of auto-tune was just added to the theory that she might be robot but also there was a lyric in the song where she said she's just trying to go out there and live her life what life is it a real life it is fake life it was a civilized I had so many questions well the Sun came out and a bunch of articles were read that one article was on billboard calm which is fully the biggest music website ever an article of titled could she be America's first fake pop star I know literally what I said like once is a company trying to create a pop star and then there amid your fingers on the internet and you're gonna release a song everything I said is happening well here's a quote from little Michaela Inever I've been writing and recording so much for the album and had been dying to release it not mine is all about summer in love and growing up so it felt like something I needed to drop now obviously the music edition but that was just a lyric video where you can kind of see her body but like is there going to be an actual music video where she's like dancing in shit is she's going to work I study well I went to her YouTube channel and I noticed that she created it back in April of 2016 which means that this is something that's kind of been in the works for a while did she create this a year ago did the company create this a year ago also her descriptions of under constructions that me there's more videos to come I hope so well ever since this song came out the pictures on Instagram is garbage even for me I mean the last two pictures genuinely look like a real girl which makes me think has been a real grow along and now she's slowly taking off the filters is it a metaphor so now I'm lost by you know inhale again out of it when are we going to do an interview she did not respond it is all like planned I don't know but I can honestly say this is one of the most fascinating weird things I've ever followed it I alright so moving on to something that is just as crazy we're going to be talking about the theory that Donald Trump's son Aaron be a time traveler so Baron trunk is 11 years old he was born in 2000 days well hundreds of years before baron was born there was a book series released and the book series was all about a boy named Baron Trump yeah then book series was released in the 1800 now let me break down what the book is about because you are going to lose your shit so in the book series Baron is a younger rich man who lives in a place called Castle Trump well if that isn't crazy enough in the book there's a man that that guides Baron through these journeys and his name is dawn now dawn who refers to himself as a master of all masters he tells Baron to travel to Russia and find a portal that lets him go to differently and it makes Baron Trump he lives in castle Trump the guy that guy his name is dawn he thinks he's a master of all masters he wants him to go to Russia literally all of these things could be said about the real Baron chunk now if this isn't crazy enough the guy who wrote the beard Trump books also wrote another book in 1896 the book is called the last president and it's about a guy who runs for president who's a common name and he claims to be anti-establishment literally of Donald Trump now there's a part in the book where there's an angry mob and it says this the Fifth Avenue Hotel will be the first field of fury of the mob now the Fifth Avenue Hotel is a real place but it's not a ranking well guess what's sitting right where it used to be that's right the Trump Tower what now there's tons of theories as to how this happened why there's a book about Baron Trump back in the 1800s now most of the theorists believe that doubling time is actually a time trapper and maybe he lured these folks now I know that sounds crazy but number one we talked about the fact that time travel will exist at some point the future it will remember to Donald Trump is one of the richest people in the world and probably will be in the future so it'd be super rich and have time travel you know a hundred percent Donald would so maybe sometime in the future you went back to the palace wrote these books about his life and about his son's life and maybe when he went back in time to write those books he messed something up and that's why we don't just mean della it's crazy that that make sense but that little Michaela thing doesn't all right now let's move on to some theories about youtubers so first I'm going to talk about something that easily really in a theory it's just fact a lot of the youtubers they do watch and we seem to know you don't know at all there are so many people on YouTube that are putting on a fake facade what they think you want and this is something that's been happening in Hollywood forever now I don't know if you guys know this but do you remember the show duck dynasty yeah a show about a backwoods country family and they all have long beards and they're super rugged and sometimes they can't even form a sentence because they're so average and not educated in country well before the show duck dynasty was created this is what that family looks like yeah that's right that's the whole time dynasty clan and they're all in there Country Club outfits holding their golf clubs looking like they're worth a million bucks and their whole scam worked we all believed that they were these country bumpkins and that's why everybody fell in love with that but examine well now similar things are starting to happen on you first we're going to start with the wrapper a little Windex now low index is a music video al called cleaning up and it's doing pretty well with over 1.5 years come on a bad way to step up your knocked-up enough to fucking you but it does on the a dose again it makes me miss this makes those little independent content on other social medias promoting nice feel and they were strange rickety say hello no messy hearing that just getting ready so when I saw all of this I was like there's no way this person's real this can't be real and then I found out that he's not not found out that he's actually pretty normal guy and he probably thought he had to come up with some kind of a crazy character to get attention and it worked like a little Windex care Jewish pretty obvious like yeah that guy's playing a part but there's a lot of other youtubers which you can't really tell what's real which brings us to the Paul Brothers now Jake and Logan Paul are taking over the internet right they both have over like 10 million subscribers they're getting hundreds of millions of views a month and it seems like every single day there's another story about them that's trite and inur'd a lot of you guys you thinking what how did this happen well there's the theory it was all planned now first I need to be totally honest I know Logan Paul I met him before all of this shit blew up he came on my podcast he was super nice super down-to-earth very respect my friend directed a movie that Loki was in called the finning it's on YouTube red he said low he was professional King descent on time and just killed it and Riley interview Jay Paul on set at the sorry part but we're here in the door and he said he was super nice super laid back and very British so when I started seeing all these crazy things recently of like oh it's saying they are how they're blowing shit up and how they hate each other and other like feuding and I started thinking how much of that is an act now I know a lot of people say they don't understand why the Paul Brothers are famous they don't get it I get I mean it's kind of like a reality show for this generation there's lots of editing lots of music lots going around there's love interests and there's breakup there's fuse is literally like the Kardashians kind of but on YouTube so I totally understand why it's getting millions and now abuse because it's a real issue but just like every we are gonna show it might be heavily now first let's talk about their deep now throughout the years in Hollywood there's tons of feeds that are actually just fake and the purpose of that is to embark to each other's projects it happens a lot of the rap industry now there's a famous feud between Drake and meek mills that people increase you now they both released dis tracks and they both sold millions of copies of those tracks and they both got super rich from it now it's now proven that that abuse was fake definitely helped out both their careers I mean just look at more recently Beyonce and jay-z Beyonce releases lemonade which he's talking about jay-z cheating on her and then JD protects his side of the story and 444 and then of course everybody buys both everybody talks about both and they both become super crazy success and then in comes the poverty now if you look at the music video for Logan distracted Jake he disses Jake's merch while showing beautiful pictures of Jason March you can't even smell available right on your end cards it's not pronounced available it's a veil uncle now obviously March is a huge part of it and both Jake and Logan are trying to build their brand and that's right do that is to build up much so this dish actually probably resulted in a bunch of people buy merch and getting their brands one well then in the video where Jake Paul pranks his brother the prank is literally in making a billboard on the busiest street in Hollywood promoting his merch I mean in my opinion it looks good and and it tells fans where by the March which is in the description so tough some of that yeah that's literally billboard for merch disguised as a prey and then in this video you'll open wrapping bottles pointing at a girl in merch now see you know looking and you know she yama teamed it's almost like every district somehow includes their birds and you know their company's team tanning with their production company basically so all of these diss tracks and all of these videos are only making both or thing is both of them more money and promoting both of their birds which they probably share Ellison I'm not kidding I totally get it I actually respect what they're doing because we put a lot of work into their videos and that's awesome but don't get it twisted no matter what side you're on if you're on the Jay Paul side logan pulse on it either way you're contributing to a company that they probably own together that's making multi millions of dollars awesome you guys find them and it is Jesus I know you're getting GG can blow in Jesus's like they're just too dumb guys I don't believe it as in Jake hall with literally full-time on the show on Disney Channel working 12-hour days probably five days a week while we're also making like a shit ton of videos which is not normal that's something the normal youtuber doesn't do I'm a youtubers who can barely make one video a week and this kid is making like seven videos a week and full-time on a show the brain is bigger than he's letting on I don't know I think it's fascinating I think it's very interesting and I wish I'd informative a few ways because I would really help my brand now here's the last theory I'm going to talk about and this one is varied and I don't even know how to introduce this theory other than there's a channel on YouTube where a girl is acting like she is in love and obsessed with the cereal now you guys might remember back in 2014 a man named Elliot Rogers killed a monster he stabs three men to death at USC Santa Barbara and then shot several others in total six people died and more now Elliot even he wrote a detailed manifesto talking about his fantasy of torturing and killing giris he said he wanted to find sorta girls decapitate them and bring their heads back to the sorority house well after he killed those people he killed himself now clearly this man is very very very so you think there's no women on earth that anybody would be excessive him or like him well let me introduce you to a woman who calls herself Elliot supremely now this is the YouTube channel dedicated to Elliot Rogers yeah she makes me an edit of a guy who killed a bunch of people she even makes videos of what her life would be like issues with this one is called me Elliot Rogers you she's lost about it talks about her obsession I can't have him he's gone never coming back yeah she wishes that she was with she wishes if he wasn't gone keep in mind this is the same guy who wrote a manifesto where he said he want to define girls torture them and then he cut their pencils and now this girl is making videos obsessed so it makes me wonder is this girl actually obsessed with him or does she think this is going to get her views or get requests or get her on Twitter trending moments and somehow make her famous whatever the truth is it is [Music] [Music] well Larry guys go those are all included conspiracies today we certainly give this video thumbs up if you want more youtuber conspiracy theories also make sure to subscribe to my channel if it's a notification though because I make new videos every day and if you want to see on my other conspiracy theories I've done wise on poppy I've even done ones on mice I'll put them into a playlist right hopper description move

hey what's up guys my name is Destry and welcome back to you WTF five have you ever been hammered if you're underage it's okay to answer because to any moms watching we all know the answer is no of course not for those of you who answered yes don't go rescue sick mother daddy I'm just good however if you'd answer yes that question the chances are you may have also been in an uber which if you don't know is the modern rideshare program where they hire literally anyone to give you rides to places like this guy oh oh oh oh god they would hire that guy would you hire this guy no and as popular as uber is nowadays there are guaranteed to be some terrible stories about it I mean when was the last time you heard a headline saying uber driver does something super nice to someone exactly so that's it for today's video we countdown the five worst uber horror stories number one have you ever robbed someone at gunpoint Tommy you have well in that case get along sir you're going to jail someone don't worry guys I'm getting rid of all the scumbags watching this video but if you are looking to rob someone then you're in luck because your new Bert can also double as a getaway vehicle that's was the case of the incident that happened in Portland Oregon where a man got an uber robbed a bank and then used the same over to get away this really happened the best of all if this happened to where I live which is hysterical and if you're wondering no I didn't do it at least that's what I'd say if there's any police watching but the hopefully unknown man only identified by this picture was dubbed the rideshare bandit as early on September 27 2017 he flagged down an uber in Southwest Portland and stated that he needed a ride to the bank and would be willing to pay the man cash once he arrived in the bank but the driver didn't know was that the money he be withdrawing was not his you guys like that that's pretty dramatic right after robbing the Umpqua Bank in Portland he got in the same uber that was waiting for him outside the bank and drove off which my question is how did the driver not notice that this was going on like all right and just wait here it might take me a little bit yes sure no problem man just take your time I love this song [Music] the driver they took the man to Northwest Portland and dropped him off near pharmacy and that is the last-known location of the suspect still at large and with all that just terrible news stories coming out about uber I feel like they should just own that you can offer a getaway vehicle service to criminals like you've heard about uber excel you've heard about uber means where you can get your favorite food delivered to your door introducing uber crime do you need to escape the law hire bad guys that offer some reason or Russian hello I am glad to be unperfect escaped in vehicles that no one would ever suspect is being a getaway vehicle hey copyright 2004 Honda Accord perfect then as with every humor experience feel your life threatened before your very eyes uber crime getaway your way number two well usually it's the uber driver that's a nightmare in some cases it can be the passenger or lest we forget the pillaging of like the continent of why yeah that is actually a real thing but anyways with this next story that I actually covered in WTF news a nipple driver was attacked by a belligerent passenger after the driver asked him to exit the vehicle for not giving him directions no you're too drunk to give me directions ma'am sir get out of my car or I will call the police seems like a totally sensible reason to beat someone right yeah leave it to a guy in a backwards hat to unjustifiably smack someone and pulled her hair but the uber driver Edward Caban was luckily able to capture the entire incident on camera with a 33 year-old Taco Bell worker Benjamin golden struck him repetitively for seemingly no reason at all fortunately Caban was able to escape the attack by summoning a band of ninjas to strike down his foe from the shadows totally kidding but can you imagine oh yeah you're gonna hit me well prepare to die you lost boob I got a little stop monkey Doo monkey Tahoma but now in a much less cool way he was able to escape the attacker by spraying pepper spray the guy who chased him away from his car the best part is is what he was saying there in all this which was due if i reenact by anyone that's exactly what I'm gonna say only I probably won't have mace and I'll just lightly scratch someone like you guys got scratched mother oh man that kind of hurt a little bit yeah take that you jerk but since the incident golden has been fired from his job at Taco Bell and is trying to sue the driver for illegally recording him for five million dollars oh no man not your lifelong career Taco Bell you were really going places for the record I'm not bashing Taco Bell I love taco bell I basically bleed taco when I pee it's seasoned ground beef that doesn't sound healthy man but like how does this guy think he's gonna win we all saw him do it the driver is obviously acting himself depends so I'm just wondering how the court case is gonna go like your honor members of the jury I ask you does this look like the face of a man who would repetitively hit someone in the face and pull their hair yes ah well that was my only defense sorry it looks like we lost this one number three it seems like getting in a car with an uber driver is generally pretty hit or miss you either get a fantastic ride with little or no complications or you get a guy that barely speaks a word of English that locks you in the back of his car until you give them a five-star rating you gave me start know who kicked me started out no I swear to God give me stop fine I lock you in God and play extremely loud Persian music less he probably gonna guess this exact thing happened to an anonymous passenger in Los Angeles claim that that rumor driver Murat wouldn't let them leave the car and tell me gave him a five-star rating okay dude I realize that the rating system for uber drivers means everything like if you get enough negative reviews you're gonna get fired but this is not the way to go about getting positive reviews you can't just force someone to like you trust me I trust no matter how many love letters I send to Daisy Ridley or lots of my own hair or pieces of my eyelid skin I still have not gotten a response from her what's the deal with that god I hope you're kidding her barely how many situation happened was Veronica taking me passengers phone after asking to see how much the ride cost for Maroubra that's what he had apparently locked the door and told the passenger to that he wasn't going to let her go until she gave him a five star rating most hilariously was that the ride was only for 379 for what I can only imagine was maybe a mile you kidding me you could have walked that distance totally takes me like five dollars to get an uber to the post office to drop my love letters off for Daisy Ridley ha ha ha the more you keep saying that the more I think you're not kidding fortunately no was not anyone so there was no reason to call the police the man that must have just been really awkward we're brought for the love of God I need to go home don't make me play extremely loud Persian music from last kid only lover oh my god no Barak please no anything but that too late number for this one I'd also talk about my WTF news and it is probably one of the more disturbing stories to ever come out of uber that is the story of the 57 year old Nile celeb who started touching himself to a female passenger that enter his uber if you thought that was the worst part no because the entire thing was caught on camera is this what normal guys do well I guess so because it seems like every guy on omegle does this because anyone in the history of the world thought this was attractive well my restraining orders from flashing women at an Olive Garden says no but I'd love to be proved up was in fact question of the day is this hot can't wait to see an entire comment section that just says no just no but the incident that occurred in June of 2015 tells the story of a young woman who wrote it in uber and actually reached her destination before anything weird or perverse even happen once they reach the destination that's when the driver of the car got in the back seat with the passenger and it started to fondle his wiener while saying quote oh my god you're back I don't know what that voice was but you look and that's presently this is when the woman got out of the car and ran to her destination to avoid seeing the rest of this dudes dumb smart cop initially the woman was hesitant to call the police but eventually contacted the authorities where Salam was landed with charges of lewdness false imprisonment and harassment since that uber has apparently cracked down on their safety procedures to avoid things like this from happening in the future police there's that right glad this will never happen again both hilariously in October of 2017 this exact thing happened again whatever they did clearly work at this point did you just have a class for us like how not to masturbate to your passengers step one don't do it okay that's it for today's lesson hopefully you learned a lot this card is David Howe I'm already fan but number 5 is the rest of the stories I didn't get to mention because honestly but you just to come the stories that just start with uber driver attacks we'd probably be here for like two hours it's that bad job some of the worst stories of ease we have a story of a woman named Bridget Todd being choked by her uber driver that was apparently due to the driver being racist there was an uber driver that actually killed six people in a shooting in Kalamazoo all the while picking up and dropping off uber riders in between the killings there was a driver in San Francisco who pulled over asked the writer to get out hit him with a hammer and then drove off there was another story of the driver who called a passenger a dirty Mexican and then hit him several times before being discovered that the driver was actually a wanted felon another story out of Richmond occurred where a woman was attacked by an uber driver because she he was snapchat in his car hey man I also hate the dog filter that everyone and their mother is using nowadays but come on that's no reason to hit someone okay it might be a reason to hit someone but not hard okay like we're talking just a little no don't use the dog filter my god so I guess the moral of this story guys is just don't get into cars with strangers like everyone's mom once told us that this was a bad idea and now we know what that is it for this episode of WTF five hopefully you guys enjoyed it if you did make sure to give this video a like and also subscribe to the channel as I will be doing these every single week by the way it let me know

our boyfriends have like an egg dirty inside joke they think we both look the same now when I'm nervous sure look there's not even a word for it I'm near death okay so here's the situation we did a video a while ago where we bought each other outfits and it did not go well I mean I'm looking nurse he definitely looks like something Oh CJ I don't know what you're thinking she wears all those outfits I put them in a box and I ship them away but here's the thing I am aware I am in need of a makeover if you go to my Instagram you will just see that my theme is just me in the same dirty coca-cola shirt every day and I've never washed it it's my fam you so here's a plan you are going to give me a genuine makeover like we're gonna go shopping you have a whole look picked out in your head we have my friend Devin who's a hair stylist and a makeup artist she's gonna come over we're gonna go over this pig on we're gonna barbecue this pig that like this is genuine this is real it's not a gentle right I mean I hope so and I hope that I open your eyes to something new and you actually apply it to your life okay me when I'm in therapy and I don't want it also on his channel we are going to do the same thing for him I have all my inspiration for you picked out oh it's gonna be good okay so let's start okay show me the situation okay well I wanted to do something drastically different and then I realized literally anything would be literally a shower a bath would be so the look I've decided on is edgy fall fashion I'm gonna fall off a cliff and I'm gonna hit an edge and die okay think Chad Michael Murray from One Tree Hill pretty bad boy what yeah so I'm gonna like make you a little bit bad but you're gonna be pretty and it's like approachable have you seen me this is a drastic Bank okay all right all right okay so first I'm showing you your inspiration which is Chad Michael Murray from back in the day are you ready okay okay oh my god not like a nice leather jacket a good accessory we're gonna do your hair really pretty yeah well you can't just take away letters from the word accessory no and then I also think once we make you over we should have a photo shoot in a similar vein as this okay photo shoot literally just means you and you're falling in our house but okay I have a couple other photo I am going to kill you and you have a similar length hair to him here so I think we might be able to brush your hair back like he looks like he is a Christian I'm fucking youth minister who plays guitar so all the Christian girls want to fuck up but might be bad but probably is gay okay so I also pulled some other inspirational photos just from Instagram some random fashion bloggers why is his shirt tied around his waist fashion but he's wearing a jacket if you're cold wear the shirt and the jacket you can't have both why are they all wearing necklaces I'm not wearing you're wearing a necklace it's in my to get list oh my god so for your look I'm thinking a nice boot some ripped up jeans I can't have my skin Papa flannel or sweater I'm going to sweat with a leather jacket and a nice SS I'm gonna have a heat stroke I'm gonna strangle myself okay the reason this isn't going to work is because I don't fit in that type of clothing see my vibe is more like sad clown this is a makeover this is your glow ah well we're we gonna go to get those clothes to the mall I'm not going to a mall no oh my god all right well here we go let's go me up I'm gonna throw up hey guys welcome back to another episode of not worth shame fashion facts I have not bought a shirt in two years no way maybe three that's crazy yeah the last time I bought a shirt was like two bodies ago offered to you via clothes like once a month I don't know if it's because I'm self-conscious or if I genuinely just don't care about fashion you're the only person everyone likes to look good and feel good just because I don't look good doesn't mean I don't feel good no I don't yeah you ride you're right what about underwear can I keep my old underwear no oh my god that's even worse you had the same pair of a Mary hold on she's had it back now say it Shane's had his same pair of American Eagle neon underwear for four years and they're distinct you know now the Year showdown nobody gets it no when I'm gay or than you perfect the thrift store and everything's a dollar know about this is a lie oh my god it literally has rag in the name okay thank you really how about something like this please give me that I'm ready okay so I really like this one okay that's leather and fur and trigger I know what I'm gonna get you okay serial killer boots with cool noodles inside them is my aesthetic I will fucking kill you try the chains on and then tie the flannel around your waist okay here's the big reveal the shirt around my waist was a really good idea because it hides the fact that these fit why did you give me this size are you trying to trigger me what are you doing Oh trying for things on for myself do you not know what this video is what do you like it yes it's cute you look perfect in everything that is the opposite of how I feel right now okay

the champagne house complimentary so you guys don't have to pay for any of this why he was being nice to us thank you wait I really didn't pay for this wait that's weird right I was literally just talking to room service and then they showed us a furnished room service in here because that he died six years ago what if they're just trying to poison us fucking pop some champagne that's our last night on earth I'm supposed to be at work on birthday call him dead [Music] alright guys sorry I'm filming on my phone because this was unexpected we went to a restaurant down the street it's called uncle Pat's and we're talking to Pat the guy who owns a place about how we were ghosts hunting and he's like oh that's kind of funny because there's actually a ghost in our back room kinda thought he was bullshitting I'm like oh maybe he's kidding no he said that the previous owner in 1970-something hung himself in that back room and then he's like you can go back there if you want so we come back here he lets us come back and then Morgan pulls out her snapchat that's where he hung himself Shane Shane Shane come on desperation she literally is right there it is so cool [Music] it literally feels like I'm having trouble breathing are you serious underneath there which makes sense because he was hey that's what the other girl said okay sorry another side note we're coming back from dinner we're in the hotel and I'm like uh let me just take a couple pictures around the place so in this picture of Ryland nothing on the carpet right nothing near him and then in this one you can see in the corner I'll zoom into it I mean that looks like an orb I mean yeah it's clearly not photos and it's here and it's like not on the ground here either which is where I was standing alright it's gonna be a weird night okay so we're back in our room after dinner and we're gonna set up all of the nighttime Ghost activity oh my god if something moves in front of this laser in the middle of the night I'm gonna have a fucking break down if something passes that the light turns on it shit yeah okay well here's what I think we should do technically ghost time is around 3:00 a.m. so maybe what we should do is set an alarm and it will wake up and see what's going on at ghost time all right just a guy a boyfriend and his sister all right see you guys at 3:00 okay so it's 2:00 in the morning hey it's a nightmare and my heart is beating so hard that I thought I was gonna fucking die this room is so loud that it literally feels like being in a nightmare like the wind is moving in the whole room shit I thought it's literally a thousand degrees in here like we're on fire oh my oh oh fuck here was me [Music] let's get on foot it's definitely fucking with so much okay so like an hour until it's three hopefully we're not dead good how have you been sleeping in here I honestly feel fine please are you serious there's someone walking back and forth for Mike I mean yes it's loud but I don't feel like it's an evil spirit okay we thought it would be a good time check out the musical oh my god Oh case is fucking scared oh my god [Music] [Music] see if there's any orbs aren't you you're about to kill your mom why is your closet light on wait did you really not leave it on sir have you heard anything nothing no it's been incredibly peaceful and nice it's comfy in here [Laughter] [Music] all right it's the next morning that is that was by far the worst sleep I've ever had in my entire life it was so loud all night my heart was racing all night it sounded like somebody was running around the room for eight hours I would get really hot and really cold really hot again and it was just awful their beds comfy I'm not sure so here's the thing we didn't see any ghosts but we did have a lot of really crazy experiences and things that I can't explain I mean first of all when we got to the room all of our cameras were out of focus it's not focusing on that I got it focus on and this camera has never had a problem with that this room does not like this camera also all of Morgan's pictures had weird objects behind her and the 666 temperature how do you explain that that was coincidence or weird numbers then of course the polaroid not developing then there was an orbit of snapchat with Ryland then there was orbs all over island when we would take pictures of your hotel then of course it sounds of little kids laughing when we her room other than of course just for a little extra fun we saw a snapchat filter over a face where somebody hung themselves so I'd say that we didn't have like a crazy visual encounter we didn't see somebody run around the room we were dragged by but I do genuinely feel like the best hotels haunted I feel like this room especially is haunted and I never ever want to come back the vibes are genuinely creepy well maybe the ghosts will follow Morgan home and hang out with Angie in her room all right let's get the hell out of here so we're back you're Alan's house and we leave to go to LA in the morning and I'm kind of sad about it even though the Stanley Hotel thing was supposed to be scary and you know like a haunted experience it actually ended up being more of a bonding experience I had loved his family and I hung out with them a lot of times before this this time felt so much different so we might not have seen ghosts might not have got possessed by we got a lot closer that's really fuckin cool and to Rylands family if you're watching us thank you for accepting me and letting me into your home and letting me be a part of your family oh and also Ryan's sister Morgan has a channel and you should check it out she definitely is one of my favorite people and I'm just really excited that we've got us applause all right you guys good

hey what's up guys my name is destory and welcome back to you WTF 5 so dating nowadays is a lot different than what it used to be so once was a time before phones and messaging apps and texting we're literally the only way to ask someone on a date was to physically ask them in person oh god that sounds exhausting it was it was exhausting I mean look at me I wasn't nearly 18 years of my life without getting a single date that's how hard it was now it is of all the dating apps and ways to slide into someone's DMS it's easier than ever to find someone to slob on your nob like corn on the cob trying to stay hip with all the terms you kids are using nowadays but just upload a picture put in your name age and location a few facts about yourself and within minutes your inbox is flooded with people that you match with and within hours your inbox is flooded with people that you've add with within days your inbox that's it for today's video we count down the top 5 hilarious dates as a result of tinder number one Phil Stevenson so it seems like having a horrible tinder date isn't really new to anyone in fact there's an entire section of YouTube dedicated his story's all 100% about awful tinder dates actually question of the day what does the worst date you've ever been on I might make another video just based on you guys the story it's funny ways onto Phil Stevenson good old Phil so Phil matches up with this chick on tinder did she have a name of course she had a name but did Phil care no Phil use for the to meet up and after talking a little bit the girl offers to bring Phil on a vacation that she actually intended to bring her family on before they backed out so Phil and greets you know Phil's got nothing going on besides looking like a youtuber and having perfect eyebrows so sure why not just met this girl five minutes ago who cares that's part of the fun so Jim packed up and had the turkey for some good reason what's there I don't know well reserved gue moose the amazing Turkish soap opera yes amazing show massive GU moose fan here oh yeah it also for that turns out as soon as the two reached their destination in Turkey the Turkish Armed Forces was in the process of trying to overthrow the government wow talk about a great date am i right I've never tried to get laid when there's a massive grenade fight going on outside it's not easy not impossible but definitely not easy but for now why of all the places you could go did they choose Turkey and why did she invite a guy that she knew for literally five minutes what if bill was a weirdo what if he liked to collect women's nostrils it's possible you know just a Jarrah nostrils that he stumbles with haha luckily Phil wasn't a weirdo but also wasn't the nicest date the woman could have asked for as he spent the entire trip ignoring her and enjoying his free vacation god damn it bill you son of a according to Phil the woman also attempted several times to hit on him even going so far as to push their single beds together but Phil was having none of them back away Shiina oh he said you cannot touch me with your and even went on to joke with his friends say but the explosions and gunfire was scary it's not Isis or terrorists I'm scared of its her fell you did it again film he is a huge dick number two the dog thief where were you going on a date you usually have a few expectations as to how that dates gonna go seeing a movie getting to know someone maybe snagging a little ass everybody likes a little ass in their life well unfortunately for a woman in Leonean New Jersey her expectations fell a little bit short but instead of having a cool date instead stole her laptop and Amazon package and her family's dog and did not show her a movie get to know her or give her any ass what the woman matched up with a guy on tinder at the time that she wanted to meet him was actually house-sitting for some family friends so instead of waiting which is what normal people would probably do she decides to invite the guy over that she's never met to her friend's house for a little bit of unknowingly B guy also invited his friend along who I guess was just hanging out or whatever don't know if you've ever been the third wheel before but I have I've been the ninth wheel before it's not fun everyone's make it out you're like hey how's it going you guys good you want some snacks oh man oh god why is your hand wet why does this room smell like regret but after what seemed like a decent date except for you know having another person there while you're trying to have a good time with someone the two guys left the woman soon realized that a package her laptop and the family who owned the houses pet dog Maggie were completely going out a little bit gone completely the woman soon called the police and the police finally caught up with the two guys but did not manage to find the dog they did however find out that the two had intended to steal something beyond the girls virginity Who am I kidding no one on tenders a virgin number three Liam Schmitt kids questions I be ready to poop when you're on a date because I don't know about you but for me that happens every single time every single time you find a quarter for every time I had to poop when I was on a date I could build Trump's wall we wouldn't even need the Mexicans to pay for it I could do it with my poop money this is now officially my name if I was to ever become a bubble wrapper poop money I make my mom proud anyways as you probably gonna guess before I started talking about coop money yes this next story has to do with poo poo we all do it unfortunately sometimes their bodies decide hey guess what you're on a date I don't care time to go well this is that thing happened to a woman who went on a date with Liam Smith after matching up on tinder but it doesn't end there in fact it gets a lot worse the poor kindly woman got up Andrew date with Liam as they were watching a documentary at his house to drop a load in his toilet but you didn't count on after she had done the brown deed was that his toilet did not flush at all Oh God instead called me say hey uh your toilet doesn't flush she thought that the better option was to wrap her poop in toilet paper and throw it out the window okay girl gets points for ingenuity I like it after leaving the bathroom she tells Liam the entire story saying quote for a pill in your toilet and it would not flush I don't know why it did this but I wanna apologize to the entire country of Britain that was awful Liam thought this was just hilarious until he realized that his window actually has two panes of glass the inner pane of glass which opens from the top and the outer one which doesn't open at all so she basically threw her poo it between two panes of glass Oh God how unfortunate can your date be like I thought mine were bad because I make excuses to leave when a girl says she doesn't like star wars true story by the way but holy SH - Liam's date feeling incredibly bad it likes to climb in between the two windows to retrieve the trouser treasure and throw it in the trash but to make the whole story even better she apparently got stuck in between the two windows and had to have the fire department get her out ah ok I'm usually a pretty optimistic guy but there's no positive part about that story no silver lining like oh hey at least I had some dope spaghetti no I do think though that if one positive thing was to come out of this it's that if they ever go on a second date there's no way it could be any worse than the first one today you ever feel like man this date is bad just remember you could be this girl who literally got stuck trying to get her own poo out of her tinder dudes window number four so these next few stories don't really single out one specific story but instead are just quick stories that people have shared and collected on the site thought catalog guy invited me on a date to a bar to watch a band play and get her drink or two I show up and wait around for a good 20 minutes turns out it was his band that playing and invited three other girls on dates is the only way you could get a crowd for his bitch no one wants to watch my band do covers of Coldplay how do I do match with an insanely hot guy told me he was a virgin but I figured I'd let it slide go to his place and he was super handsy and sucked at kissing oh no I decided it was over and I told him I had to leave hugs me at the door and said I love you I mean I love your body I got out of there so fast that I left my favorite cardigan I have no desire to get it back I like The Bachelor she's concerned when my cardigan but come on give this guy a break he's a purchase he's never seen or touched a baguette in his life this next one is just finding my mom on there Oh God yeah not a match DNA maybe but not for JD hey you've already been in there once right I'm so sorry I once got stood up twice in one night with the first girl we actually planned out a date a few days in advance I get to the place and texted her she texted me 20 minutes later and said that she had met up with a friend beforehand and was running late she never showed up I started tindering again at the bar matched with someone told her about my situation and asked what she was up to she said that she was also at a bar by herself and told me that it sucked that my date didn't show up I asked her if I could join and she gave me an enthusiastic shouting sure she wasn't there when I showed up the first date later said that she showed up late after I had already left and wanted to reschedule I wasn't feeling it anymore so I got off tinder after that one that is rough man that's like my 16th birthday invited my whole school to come guess who showed up my mom yeah she said she was voting for Ben Carson she called her father daddy she made me sit through an entire Joe Jonas song that or when I showed up to the bar she started talking about all her exes and then she ended up making out with one dude and went home with another this all happened within 20 minutes oh god it's good yeah that's when you just uninstall tinder unless I got any matches yeah no no okay wait I got one new matches get tinder gold six months 883 a month well this won't be the first time that I pay for love sign me up finally number five is Skippy Jessa yep this is a man's name boo and God's green earth would name their child Skippy I don't know but Sammy makes it on this list as the perfect example of what I meant when I said that finding dates before tinder was extremely difficult but I before my tactic of getting someone to like me by sending me me their Twitter inbox was around so back in 2006 a real man named Skippy ended up getting a date with a woman that you had to church with through a friend of its problem is Skippy is extremely awkward I mean Sam though and he's also a 24 year old virgin I mean same though so Skippy decides to make a video diary of his experiences trying to find love let's watch so the whole reason I'm going out tonight is there is this girl named Rachel and I'm going to ask her out tonight there's a cher concert [Music] you'll found the passage of strength to all the times get me a cher concert followed me hi are you are you sure it's okay like yeah okay oh god yeah this is pretty much how all of my dates go it's extra close to home for me you're sure you want to do this no oh you are you're 100% sure well after Skippy and his hot date go to the sexiest place you can imagine baskin-robbins to get a hot sticky load of ice cream Skippy gets to know Rachel by asking deep and thoughtful questions like the kiss boys you like kissing books I do sorry that is a random comment on my part I'm sorry oh oh give me you cut me to my core the robots like kind of heaven what hold on gang Skippy's got more up his sleeve after parking with this girl on a hill that more than likely has had several murders of young women happen on it Skippy decides to get right to the point I've got something for you I'm not sure if you can see this but these are little toy boats let's call this a friendship we've been you know like sailing these little friendships you know for a while and stuff like that like a year right when you say but there's another boat that's in the harbor you ready for this huh this boat is called a relationship you see that I think there's a way to go from a friendship to a relationship Skippy know why Skippy no get a Skippy she had to have said yes right what sane woman would say no - Skippy in his toy boat said he brought specifically for that metaphor I just I'll let you know right now I think Rachel yup you had one job Rachel Getting Rachel man okay guys to me just for a second realize that Rachel probably didn't go to the cher concert with its share guys share like look at this rejection phase that is the face of utter defeat awkward Oh God turn it off I can't I can't shed more tears for Skippy but you know this was 12 years ago so surely Skippy has made some improvements and actually gotten some D and V over these last 12 years nope now 35 years old Skippy is still a virgin even appearing on the TLC show the Virgin Diaries Rhea lives at home with his mom has his mom come with him to failed dates and has a jar of bellybutton lint in his room room here's my poster of the Osmonds and over here is my belly button lint collection oh oh oh God skip you know hey I don't know if you know this but belly button lint quickest way to get laid no joke also passed the time Skippy now sells t-shirts about his horrible sex life so hey I guess if you can't get laid might as well sell some t-shirts about how much you can't get laid right you know what I'm gonna watch this video every single day until I die not because I enjoy it but because if I ever feel bad about my game with women I'll remember Skippy and feel instantly better and

it was a guy my name is s tree welcome back to you what the fuck five proud winner of Baron Strucker sports show on the internet Awards I just make that award up yet do I deserve them yeah anyways thank you so much - Amanda Brisbane for the topic of this week's video remember if you'd like to leave your own suggestion for a future with a pup 5 episode makes you leave those in the comments down below that's it for today's video we count down the top size band boobie so not surprising to anyone number one on this list is the human centipede - where do I start well the first human centipede saw its fair share of angry critics and backlash it wasn't really until the second movie in the series that they really started to get bad participate some of you have not seen the work of art that is the human centipede or its sequel it's a fascinating film about a strange German doctor much like the one in Captain America only this one isn't trying to make a super soldier but instead so people asked to melt sounds riveting right yeah not easy to masturbate you that's for sure anyways and although that might not seem like a big deal and you're probably wondering why this got banned it's not so much the premise of the movies that people had a problem with but almost more the things that people say or do in the movie including but not limited to masturbating with sandpaper shitting in people's mouths smashing a baby's head under a gas though and of course these wonderful lives would rather fuck that retarded boy backstopping yeah yeah just making that swimmy hot which I'm ashamed to admit that actually that last one that you heard is actually by text oh yeah it's really awkward when I'm in the movie theater and I forget to silence myself yeah yeah just making dance really hot all right I forgot silence it anyway though since the movies released in 2011 it's been banned in Australia New Zealand and the UK but really not bad in enough places to deter the director from making a third fucking movie which I've been informed is even worse yeah I don't hate myself enough to see it so I'm sure it's just it's fucking good at the first two though number two Cannibal Holocaust so this one is probably the most fucked up on this list and yes I ever wear I just covered the human centipede but trust me this one is worth its Cannibal Holocaust was a movie that was released in 1980 about a film crew that gets lost in the Amazon rainforest while filming a documentary about can tribe and because of the way that the movie was filmed it's often considered one of the first fountain footage horror movies ever made inspiring a ton of other movies to do it after including ads above so below overfilled and be Blair Witch Project the same as Haugen movie was the first of its kind many people believed 100% of what they were watching on the screen was part of the documentary that the film was showcasing and again it wasn't so much the premise of the movie that other people it was the crazy shit that happens in it there's so many things that I'm going to have to probably blur out but let's get into it so one point in the film the male character is gang-raped one of the tribes members and her body is left in pelvis fighting at the end the crew is attacked and gruesomely eaten by a cannibal tribe but there was a scene where the characters had sex in front of the tribes people where apparently the female actress actually told the male actor at the time to actually stick it in her luckily though I guess that didn't happen not too much any very real animal abuse that was shown in the film which included the actual depths of a pig a turtle a tarantula a boa constrictor and a spider monkey on camera in the end the director of the film was condemned from his native country of Italy in his film license revoked for only three years three years it's basically like that don't murder any more animals and make more fucked-up films okay not serious don't do it for three years and then you're fine you can do whatever you want after all that though it caused the film to be banned in several countries including Italy and Australia despite all the controversy though the film is now considered a timeless horror classic for pushing the envelope of film expectations at the time number three Zack and Miri Make a Porno this one you may have actually seen already as it was pretty positive when it came out in 2008 featuring both Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks in a comedy movie about being forced to make a porn tape to cover their rent so the movie was pretty well received a ton of people enjoyed it but one of the people that didn't enjoy it was the Minister of Thailand who believed that it was going to make teens want to make sex tapes and bandits dude I don't know if you know this the people are already making sex tapes man you're banning this movie is not going to affect the amount of sex things that are amazed probably in your country what I know right who knew apparently no that wasn't the only reason they blocked it in Thailand another reason that they claim to have blocked it once because it's quote/unquote depicting sex oh no not sex that's horrible honestly man like what is the big deal it really shows that these people will want to upset and that's a problem yes because I don't have sex Wow well that explains it so Minister of Thailand just needs some booty guys that's all it is very funny though two methods administered be like oh thank God you banned this movie man because in Rodney watch this movie and now he has sex with like a ton of different women they said 14 pornos a day there's a ton of money and he's wildly successful I'm just so glad you were able to protect us from that nightmare unfortunately if you don't live in Thailand the movie is still perfectly legal for you to watch and you should definitely check it out if you haven't already number four a Clockwork Orange being the oldest movie on this list makes it one of these first film to ever get banned released in 1971 a Clockwork Orange was a story about a man named Alex the leader of a gang called me drew so go around stealing raping and beating people up and I know you look at these guys you probably think that's been wearing underwear I probably think that the game really doesn't look that threatening at all especially because they're wearing masks that strangely look like dildos but on between violence and rape that took place in the movie was enough to see it banned in Ireland Singapore South Africa and South Korea we've eaten somewhat banned in the UK due to the filmmakers Stanley Kubrick getting death threats against him in his family to which the UK refused to play the film until hubris death in 1999 for his protection in addition some countries banned the film because it quote glorified game culture and the time chains in the UK start making their own games loosely based around the droogs despite all this though a Clockwork Orange is still considered one of the best films of the 70s and probably of all time I don't know I've never been robbed by a gay guy that is probably pretty terrifying but honestly maybe I'm just a sucker for British accents because like if you get robbed by someone with an American accent it's like giving a fuckin monster rap ticket being robbed by a British person seems like it'd be like thank you give me a woman fuckin wanker oh my god you're adorable what I said give me a fuckin wallet off to Papa I'm sorry that's just the cutest thing I've ever heard that's a key to robbing me apparently I'll give you anything as long as you rob me with a British accent and finally at number five is Boris about act that was a terrible impression I'm truly sorry about that though is a movie that I'm sure you've seen before or the very least heard about since everyone and their fucking mothers tried to do with catchphrases with your movie came out in 2006 and actually remember watching this movie in theaters and this watching is like row after row people just getting up and walking out of the theater just go so we haven't seen an Borat is the story of borat sagdiyev a fictional character made by Sacha Baron Cohen those journalistic ambitions lead him to America to improve his country of Kazakhstan that Kazakhstan or is it as closeted kha'zix kazakhstan kazakh kazakhstan kazakhstan kazakhstan just seems like it's like the american way to pronounce it you know I can't say who's been right and yet Kazakhstan the movie was a massive critical success making around 261 million dollars worldwide and rating a 91 percent on Rotten Tomatoes not that I really trust rocks matters because they gave fucking the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers movie like the old ones a 41 percent 41 bullshit if he snuck into however not everyone was a fan of the movies incredibly dark humour had to abandon every Arab country except Lebanon finding that the reason that it was banned was that it was placing harmful stereotypes on their people even the country of Kazakhstan actively protested the movie until very recently when they've actually thinks the movie is creation because of their enormous tourist boom a sensor at divides Ministry of information called Borat vile gross and extremely ridiculous adding that if all of the offensive scenes were cut out of the movie only 30 minutes would remain out of the one hour and 26 minute runtime it sounds about right here's the thing though I have an extremely doctors of humor and this is one of those movies that you have to go into the movie you know just with an open mind knowing that everything is a joke and not to be taken seriously if you do that then the movie is actually pretty good it leads to by opinions but also I just did in The Orchid do you think these maybe should have advanced let me know the comments down below and that's that exhibitors that's not what about five hopefully you guys

aren't you guys I'm gonna go eat that advent calendar that's still in the fire I [Music] 
hey what's up you guys so today I wanted to talk about some stuff just be really honest with you guys so as you guys have noticed my videos have changed a lot in the last like six months and there's a lot of reasons for that but first I want to go back a little bit so I started YouTube back in 2008 what's cracking youtubers and it was the best time of my life tomorrow I got a special episode planned Shane gets his eyebrows threaded see that nastiness it's gonna be gone tomorrow I had a place to be creative and do whatever I wanted and not have anybody tell me that I wasn't good enough you love me right snoop I could play characters and put on wigs and make sketches with my friends and family you look like you brush your teeth with cat shit okay bye grandma love you pussy and I was doing that for years hi excuse me miss can you tell me where Santa Clauses so I can have a picture taken with my daughter oh if he asks you to pull his finger don't do it you'll pull you'll think of grab yo arm rip it out your socket wrap up behind you later fuck yo face next I even started doing music videos and parodies and then around 2013 I slipped into a pretty intense depression let's keep it real guys in about ten years when a thirty-five probably won't be doing YouTube if I was doing YouTube it would probably be creepy I just kind of lost inspiration my youtube channel wasn't like a fun place for me anymore it wasn't like inspired and I was kind of embarrassed when I would tell people oh I'm a youtuber and they would go to my youtube channel I wasn't doing sketches anymore and I wasn't doing big music videos I was in my kitchen and I was eating pizza and I was making crazy faces and I was trying girl products and like I don't know not that there's anything wrong with that I did have a lot of fun making them fuck oh my god but meeting people and having them go to my YouTube channel and seeing those thumbnails of me like it started good and I'm almost 30 and I was feeling very like defeated and it's not that I didn't want to make cooler crazier videos it's that I just literally wasn't inspired I just didn't care like I was too busy to care I just wanted to make five videos a week and keep putting them and the passion was just kind of like going away and that was really scary side note I'm not saying I wasn't happy I have had the best like two years of my life meaning Ryland getting you know and cheedo in this house and like all of that has been incredible but creatively I've definitely been feeling a little bit like stuck and then I met my cameraman about six months ago I needed some more help with editing my videos and Garrett told me about his friend who was a great editor and I tried him out and he took this video of me like making my cat a movie theatre and made it something so much bigger just from editing these little girls look so bored she's like bitch I'm trying to watch cáñamo John what a story times she fucks me with a toothbrush and I was blown away and I was like oh my god like you're fucking amazing and I want to make cooler stuff so that you can edit it and I did over the next month I started filming crazier videos and giving him more and more footage and he would edit bigger and bigger and bigger and I was starting to feel myself get me inspired again and seeing him so excited about editing made me remember how much I loved editing and I love making videos I love it why the fuck am I just sitting in my kitchen eating pizza like this is not what I want to do and then that's when I did my dad series and I did the whole thing myself and I edited it myself and I am so so proud of it and when I put it up I had that feeling again that feeling of like oh my god I can't wait for people to see this I can't wait to read the comments I can't wait to upload this and I had not had that feeling since like 2012 so since then we have been working really close together me Garrett and the cameraman and we've just been having so much fun making bigger you know two and three parter series things that I never thought I would do on my channel or that you guys would ever want to watch and he added some of them and I had and we just created this like team I've never and that's why I wanted to do this video today because I know a lot of you guys were like oh who's the cameraman we want to see the cameraman and I didn't want to just do a video showing him to you I wanted to do a video dedicated to him so he is on his way but before we get to that Garrett just hit a million subscribers and I'm so proud of him so of course I have to do some dumb surprise and embarrass myself in the process right now do you feel like I'm gonna kill you Joe dress yeah that'd be nice wish for a million more oops I blew it out no let me use my magic ready Philippe Philippe retardant are they oh [Music] my god oh my god here you're ruining it for everyone else do you live here too whatever three well it's magical but thank you for the sugar a martini matowski that means I love you so you're probably wondering what today's videos more than I thought Oh could we go a Harry Potter lid if you do that I'll actually piss all over my face sorry I don't know I just get excited um fuck no oh we're gonna be doing something that I have been wanting to do for a while and I know a lot of the comments have been requesting Sarah frosting yes we are going to be exposing I'm sure you've seen the tweets you've seen the screenshots you seen the conspiracies who's behind the camera who's doing it is it superwoman come on now we have not talked about this cameraman but I feel like you should say yes he's literally in that Bay you sure well should we do the reveal where I do all my reveals oh in the mirror that you're going at all costs yes oh my god wait that nervous for you okay all right one andrew is not just the biggest sweetie in the world but a fellow redheaded so I feel at home you're ready thank you oh it's it's it's new I can't I don't know Romo your Instagram I know what he needs oh I have never initiation a midnight seat so this is clean-ish okay cameraman come on up I mean Andrew he has a name now [Music] Oh my boyfriend did you roll up the sleeves little sorry no here's what I think we should do because now that you're dressed like me and you're on camera like me right you need to eat like me okay so this is not a brand deal but I'm really excited because I heard Taco Bell much fries not sponsored which it was I think what we should do is get in the car have an adventure go get some fries and easy yes are you building yeah I'm not confident with you as the cameras should um okay so I was thinking to get to know you a little bit better we should do a Q&amp;A oh it's so internet like me always feeling Gareth and GERD filling me with this is weird it's like well it's a Garrett thing I cared thing Shan Shan it's like he's here except you smell like you shout hey Shan first question comes from rickey dillion fun how weird and strange was it to film all this crazy stuff for Shane fun I don't ever really even think about it be weird never know I don't think there's ever been that anything we've done where I was like this is weird so I guess the challenge is to make it really weird for you to woo the challenges to make it so weird that he quit huh now that sounds interesting a lot of people are asking are you single yeah so are you looking I guess so I'm I feel like I'm pretty busy but at the same time I would never say that I'm not give me like three celebrity crushes there's an actress with a name Chloe Bennet whoo I saw her actually the flea market it was really weird the flea market all Garrett is Garrett suggests no you can't say it don't don't do it in juice no I get no answer just this once you can say okay you're pretty gay Tessa broke I think there is something that's kind of attractive she's 18 we hope she's deeply yeah who else there's like one youtuber that I always kind of passively talking cared about that I feel probably like crush status that's what the question was can i I'm sorry kinda out for a moment passively Andrew I mean I don't know it's his like dream girl yeah I mean I mean yeah is that weird is that gonna make it around I don't know is that weird because what if you see her in real life I interesting she's cool I don't like oh my god oh my god bleeding no you're good here I'll do it unroll the window oh my god oh my god I see the picture hi can we get three nacho fries one of the nacho fries supreme one Crunchwrap supreme a large Diet Coke what do you guys want a shredded chicken burrito and let's make that two Crunchwrap Supremes and an orange cream pop I'm at that I'll stop alright dude oh my god we what do we do we all drive at the same time we get first we try it without the devil try it without the dick just as they are I'm just realizing that I'm purposefully hiding myself because I'm so used to try and hide away no you're a part of this Cheers okay the dip changes the game it really does well similar to the way that you changed the game for my channel but dip changes the game for the fries if you're the nacho cheese Andrew oh my god you're not your cheese for big fries alright sorry I'm gonna get the camera in just a second should we go through and say we have receipts talking while we're going through Taco Bell and fixing what they messed up you like a father/son moment it's good we like crunch wraps in this no it's great it's great this is so I have a genuine question that I'm very curious so you added a lot of me have you noticed any like weird things that I do you know you an ironic me do that tongue pop thing like you're not joke not you know you do you did it all the time in the video of me confronting my dad it's like I don't want a relationship yeah it's like it's before you start saying something you're just like the shirt and chicken burrito though we paid for already started chicken burrito cuz you guys forgot it and then I wanted to yeah and then I wanted to add a Crunchwrap supreme ok so we're back home and garetty so the girl that andrew has a crush on his name is making petunia back by popular demand me delete your channel she's a youtuber and a dancer and really great [Music] and I actually met her years ago we did some video together like back in 2011 so I thought it might be fun to set them up on a blind date I mean I feel like it's only fair right like we're initiating Andrew into the squad so obviously I have to surprise him that's what I do okay so here's my plan I'm gonna go back out there and pretend like we're gonna finish the video later tonight but in reality what no the only thing I want to cook fries on my bus well I kind of did I'm sorry it's out I know okay wait you didn't know us filming that felt real no yeah I felt completely what are you doing survivor in the car when Andrew brought up his crush I'll be - what is this mashed potatoes what is this I think it is it's a little bit you know everyone has crushes on social media or like celebrity crushes right and sometimes with celebrity crushes it's like a super sexual thing or like a oh if that could be with them it's not that with Andrew it's the weirdest like not weird but like it's the sweetest thing like he sees her and his heart just breaks like he can't Iseman kinda love this is weird but like he once looked at a photo of her oh but he like looked at a photo of her and said like fuck any guy that like would ever date this girl and not just like want to marry her right away his heart just like it's so just like ah it's not like a silly infatuation it's like so sweet when he talks about it and the thing is I did not know it was this deep and serious it is not I feel really weird I know it is but the other thing is like I can see it Andrews a good guy like if I was a girl and put a ring you want to fuck him now and you're a boy so when we were in the car on the way home from Taco Bell I might have DM mega Mattoon and she might be coming over tonight for a play oh no no I need a night I'm gonna find a knife to your throat I cannot do this no no dude he's literally going to die you can't do this you can't do this week it's too late she's already covered oh my sorry oh my god so an ID I'm turned like I told her I'm like listen it's for a video but it's for real life and he really need somebody that loves him at Camden she was like oh my god I'm looking for something genuine so she wasn't just like Oh for a video hub so later tonight she's coming help me oh are you kidding me oh good we could somebody I'm gonna bring someone stupid shit okay all right well tonight we'll hang out if we have a marriage oh my god I'm so excited because tonight is the big night I am setting up my camera man Andrew dream girl right now women assume does not exist in Los Angeles violin [Music] whoa whoa 
okay so before we get started this video is sponsored by Dollar Shave Club and that is important because of what's about to happen so as you guys know about a month ago I found this youtuber named Bobby burns now bobby made a hate video about me a terrible terrible content and then i wanted to respond to him so i flew him out to my house and we made three videos together and through that process we actually became really close and i kind of feel like i'm a little bit of like a dad slash mentor to him he's like 20 turning 21 I'm almost 30 but he's so incredibly talented and I really wanted to figure out how to work so he's flying out here we're gonna talk about what you can do for my channel and I think we're deciding on doing some type of news series on like Sundays on my channel but I'll get into that later so it's also his birthday and I wanted to do something really special for him and he's moving out to LA soon so he could really pursue more this YouTube thing and I want to help and if you live in LA you have to have especially if he's gonna be doing a lot of video shoots he's gonna have to have a big car to put all the equipment in and the amount of freeways like he needs a car so I know this is crazy and I have never done anything like this before but today I want to surprise him with a car I know okay I know I'm not trying to be a Paul I promise but I'm trying to justify it this video is sponsored so that's definitely going to go towards it and it's no secret that YouTube money has not been great lately but it's one of those things where I feel like what you give out is what you receive and to be able to help somebody who is really just starting out and moving to LA and scared and nervous and like needs support to be able to help them I just feel like that's so here is the plan Garrett is coming over right now to film a video with me and Bobby he has no idea when it's about we're meeting Bobby at 2:00 p.m. it is now 10:00 a.m. Bobby has no idea what's happening so it's gonna be an adventure and nervous I'm also really excited oh my god what am i doing no all right let's go tell everybody we're buying a car come in I was tossing it oh you're such a big dumb dog so you know we're filming a video with Bobby today yes I probably car what is that it says happy birthday and welcome to LA Bobby the most important thing you can have in this city is a good friend so drop the zeroes and get with the hero because I'm all you need be my Valentine and I said PS do not open this card in front of Jordan that's his girlfriend that's crazy it's not crazy till we know what he says and how he responds so literally straight with the girlfriend just for fun how do I get the creepy controversies okay everybody sit on the couch I have news okay so you know how it's his birthday yeah we're gonna do a little cake party he's 21 there's gonna be alcohol in the kitchen you can okay I have a better idea I was thinking that I want to buy him a car like I use two thousand dollar car the joke is that it's gonna be a junker and a clunker and you're gonna say I'm buying you a car and then it's gonna pull up and all be in it with like some Taco Bell Tesla rate or a G Wagon this is my car no a sensible breeze like a 2006 your 2006 no but I do think he needs a better car he needs a bigger car you could put equipment and I was thinking what if I got him a matching Jeep like his daddy what are you trying to do I want to be reasonable okay I don't know prices of anything because I'm a youtuber but I don't much my car was and my car and of a used piece of shit so I wanted to be a little nicer than that well you already have a better car than you got you when you have a kid you want to give them a better life than you have do I need to tell ya no okay so here's what I think we should do we only have a couple hours because Bobby were maybe human like - so we need to go to a car dealership buy a car those choices take weeks for me in my life okay Hertz we gotta go I don't know anything where are we going Google it just I'll be here you're coming I think what they give him the car they're gonna do it like this like once he reads it like will you be my Valentine I'll do this so he knows that I'm not acting around like he can't say no why do I all right family ready to go car shopping let me know if you need access to your piss bottle shame oh thank you no what do you what are you doing was that fake I thought it was I'm never kissing you again why do you the baby oh this is our child are you crazy - cuz that's gonna make this experience so much better oh no yeah we're carrying a baby for 24 hours great let's go car shopping Shane what are you doing on that car why is that Carly I've never seen a bird shit like this we should cover Bobby's car in like shit or something and then you can make a game of like reveal your nice car that'd be fun that'd be nice all right Ramos they're never driven we're gonna go look at some girl that's a big top scar right oh my god we should get it customized put hater on the side oh shit I'm gonna be so excited you're good at my dream car oh okay new video idea all my money signs are yellow we get one car and that's it I am worried about you how are you affording this if you do bad well we'd like the comments to come to life oh my god you're gonna get kicked out are they gonna pretty woman else and be like you can't afford this they will I'm not I'm gonna be like ina oh my god it has a bowl on it okay we're getting that one it's over three hundred million dollars have you ever bought anything yeah we were looking at this one [Music] [Music] just 25 on something can I see you inside oh I can't wait to go to all my business meetings oh my god it smells rich the door opens good there's notice why are there so many numbers ah there's a place for the key bottle I mean a place for my money [Music] doesn't believe me at all should I buy just to prove I feel like the key road king of the tube let's go here we can't afford this Jake powered by anyone Jake Paul would kill you and film it alright so that was a little too expensive for Bobby and a little too expensive for me so we're gonna move on it's fine I like my Jeep it's great it really has that wow factor nice huddle right there to the Jeep ice back to reality oh I love Jesus I think Bob is gonna love it I think it's cute it's gonna match mine and it's going to be 1/4 of the price of every lab oh you should put a piss bottle in there for him yeah I love daddy son gold huh okay so somebody made a video about me on the Internet where they called me awful and they hated me a lot so I'm gonna buy them a car okay I'm good yeah so I need up the last achieve new with room for a bottle than here they all have rooms about they have space for that four-door black not g-wagon they said there might be went up on the roof and he's gonna look look at the basketball hoop in here you want to see me shoot him LeBron J Michael Jordan oh I got one oh and in fact I'll challenge him Blake Griffin yeah bet you've never seen anything like this I didn't realize that was professional just thinking about my new ball life Wranglers such a bother what are we go to the carnival what do you think about G wagons they're just a little too pricey for me but that's gonna be a little bit more expensive I don't know what we want to take a look at that look how much is that what's your favorite kind of pizza whatever peak say I like everything it's right here I'm above the boy oh definitely doesn't know the same feeling is a thing of the g-wagen but you know what it's fine it's his first car oh hello didn't know this car comes with a little sweetie me I think so alright let's do it whoa love it oh it has it all oh so this you could just take off yeah throwing money on the fucking ceiling whoa or just throwing your hands up in having a good time yeah I mean it is crazy this is nicer than your car I know this is like actually nice for them I go should we do yours look at look at that was skeptical the baby looks at this moment oh okay so we need a paperwork I also have a Dollar Shave Club kit it's

like weird celebrity items on eBay like Britney Spears sweat or Michael Jackson spit or Oprah's tissue I would eat that so then I was like okay what could I sell that would be grosser than that and

bars okay she said she's gonna call in a minute I'm so scared hello yes yeah so this you're not allowed to sell underwear thank you for being really nice about it I mean it started as a joke and then it just turned into like oh my god what no worries thank you so much no I guess you can't sell underwear on eBay here on the website yeah it clearly says used clothing except for underwear can be listed on eBay so you're not allowed to and then here it has a list of things you're not allowed to sell boxer-briefs g-strings thongs well there goes my thong so now I have to delete the pulse I got some bad news Wow I have to cancel it no this is funding my dreams I guess you can't sell used underwear on eBay I think we can find another server another platform to sell your underwear Oh Craigslist okay here we go wait you're gonna delete it willingly why don't you at least like see if they come for you I'm not actually trying to go to jail I'm saying like let it and see if you get paid no I'm not going to jail for my dirty shitty underwear we're deleting this right now ready you're a better person than me okay all right one two oh my god I said pay for my sister's College I can't stop thinking about all the things I would have got with that money [Music] now I'm just kidding I probably would have given it to charity all right here we go cancel okay wait what your list can't be ended early if there are bids on it wait what I don't know what to do oh my god I think you can do it okay I'll talk to you guys later I got to figure this out okay it's a little while later I talked to eBay they said they were going to remove the post so I'm going to refresh the page and it should be gone here we go for charity no in all obviously I'm glad that didn't work out because what if it was a kid who was on like their parents credit card and the parents didn't know and then they go bankrupt and it's my fault there's just too much risk but this got me thinking like what if I put something not illegal on eBay for charity maybe my green shirt the one I burned maybe you know what he wants to leave I don't know let me know down the comments what I should put on eBay and what charity you think I should do it for do you want to find a new home for charity I'd you guys hopefully you enjoyed this video make sure to give it a thumbs up and subscribe hit the notification

mom what I need the boy is race with the girlish body 
hey what's up guys it's Destry welcome back to what the fuck five justice the quality of being fair and reasonable these are not my reading glasses justice the thing that bad guys run from and the thing that gives Batman a giant boner Oh justice although sometimes justice is a little harder to define so from a judge preventing a man from having a girlfriend to forcing a man to hold up a sign for six years today's video we count down the top five weirdest judge sentences number one so in 2007 a man from Toronto was arrested for beating his ex-girlfriend and threatening to stab her but not before turning the knife on himself when the police finally arrived after spending several weeks in the hospital because he severed one of his arteries he was also charged with assault against his ex-girlfriend and sentenced to not have a girlfriend for three years seriously that was this punishment according to the judge though the exact punishment was three years where he could not form a romantic relationship of an intimate nature with a female person which if you think about it might have been the best punishment ever they just imagine the severity of this guy's blue balls if he's at a club and it's like hey I'm not wearing any panties why don't we get out of here and you can take me back to your place okay fine let's go sir you're under arrest ah but also like how do they even keep track of it like did I have someone constantly watching him to make sure there's no flirting going on oh yeah I've been there it's on a third street right now we should go sometime no this is your first warning it was that no one don't mind him incredibly loud second warning bra licking your lips staring at her tits one more you're out of here your creepy motherfucker ass native as the punishment was though the 24 year old Stephen cranly actually assaulted another girl a couple years later and was in fast track to two years in prison Wow way to go Stephen fucking Stephen number two Daniel and Eloise Moralez this man and wife couple of truly show that even the worst people can find someone to love while the rest of us are stuck here with porn hub and a crusty tube soft did I mention lightness fair anyways Daniel Morales from Houston Texas was busted after he stole two hundred and fifty thousand dollars from his County's Crime Victims Fund but instead of sending him off to jail which would have been way too easy Daniel was ordered to stand out busy intersection holding up a sign saying I am a thief I stole two hundred and fifty thousand dollars from the Harris County Crime Victims Fund Daniel marilla's for five hours every weekend for six years holy shit that sucks but I gotta say it's brilliant we should just do this to all criminals so maybe it'll teach them to not do crime unless they want to be hilariously embarrassed you smoked Matt sign you sexually harassed a co-worker sigh you peed in public sign but eventually you just have to move because everyone in your town is gonna be like hey I know you you're the guy who pees in Dublin right that was one time what a loser but apparently Daniel says that he suffers abuse from people driving by and sometimes even sympathized with yes sympathize with the guy who stole a quarter of a million dollars from a crime victims fund poor guy but let's not forget about his equally terrible wife Daniel's wife Ellis was also convicted of theft when she was found guilty of embezzling over $200,000 from the local district attorney's office fortunately the judge was not so lenient with Eloise as she was forced to go to jail one month out of the year for six years straight complete 400 hours of community service have a sign at their house that states that the people that lived inside the house are convicted thieves and she also had to hold up a sign similar to the one that her husband had to hold good god I mean this is what justice gets kind of dicey I mean do you think that the punishment in this case fits the crime or do you think she should have gotten off easier do you think she should have gotten off harder it's tough to say even though this punishment is hilarious number three Heidi cult so this one is just hilarious because of how old the lady is because usually you don't hear of an 89 year old woman committing destruction of property crimes so the story goes in 2008 a German lady by the name of Heidi Cole in the ripe age of 89 witnessed every day more and more cars parking on the street leading up to her house so what did this gentle grandmother do oh you know just what any sane person would do she went out with a knife and slashed the tires of all 50 cars lighting down her streets full Yuko grabbed up every single car which like how I wouldn't really know but I don't imagine tires are the easiest thing to slash and we're talking about an 89 year old woman like usually ladies that alone can't even open a jar a jelly let alone slash a rubber tire come on you son of a bitch I didn't survive the Revolutionary War to go out like this so Heidi was quickly sit and was interrogated which he admitted to her crimes and was forced to pay a giant fine but she stated that she didn't have the money to pay for her evildoing she was then sentenced to knit sweaters for every person's tire that she slashed which is totally it won't be sent them totally this story except honestly though how do they even enforce this one two they also never mentioned the quality of the sweaters that she had admit so it could have been like high tea thank you so much for my sweater I mean and in no way helps the fact that my tire is still slashed but thank you hey what about my sweaters here you go what the hell is this this is like five pieces of string crudely glued together I hope you freeze you son of a bitch Stephen in your age to hover on my block fucking scheming every assholes name is Stephen apparently the last news at this article at vertebra though he completed the sweaters but had moved on to a retiring home where she's probably spending out the rest of her days softly telling her friends Gertrude Wilfred and Ruth about how she's a hardened criminal while doing wheelies in her wheelchair and smoking cigars number four Jesse Lee Harold do you know someone who's just an absolutely terrible parents like we're talking Faramir from Lord of the Rings dad bad we're talking star Lord's dad bad we're talking Tywin Lannister bad we're talking Darth Vader bad you get it well one such terrible parent is 27 year old Jesse Lee Harold from Virginia good ol Jesse was driving in his car with his three year old son when he got into a car accident and usually when you get an accident you stop you make sure everyone's okay are you okay exchange insurance yeah here's my information I'm so sorry call the police and whatnot oh yeah there's been an accident well not Jesse Jesse decides instead to get out of his car with his dead injured three-year-old and just run off did you go up to me time to piece out of this bitch actually you scratch that don't grab your coat I'm a terrible parent let's go yeah just runs off good job man real real good parent say was it worth eluding the police for five minutes yeah cars are registered to people I don't know if you knew that so Bob police getting called to his residence they found his son there with minor injuries and even glass in his diaper Jesse's son was sent to the hospital and jesse was quickly arrested but he was landed with charges like child endangerment a hit-and-run and also driving under a suspended license also in addition to just these crimes Jesse had an extensive previous record getting arrested in 2007 for another hit-and-run after he was huffing an aerosol can 2008 for beating up a guy and again in 2012 for possessing cocaine also middle side note the child that was with him and his car wasn't actually his only child as he has seven other children with six different women Jesus Christ dude you know what condoms are so on top of all those other charges he was sentenced to four years behind bars and forced to get a vasectomy to never have children again well done judge we need more people like you as we all know you slice off one head of a Hydra two more take its place but if you slice the balls of a Hydra that's a different story and probably number five Michael chicken Eddie so no Michael chicken Eddie is not an old man slashing tires or an irresponsible father huffing aerosol cans while driving and Michael chicken Eddie is certainly not an Italian mob boss as his name kind of sounds like it would be but it's instead in Ohio judge that is the best example of using creative punishments to punish criminals rather than just sending them to jail it actually was a lot of the inspiration behind some of the cases that we mentioned today but some of his best sentences include forcing a woman to walk 30 miles after she refused to pay a 30 mile taxi fee forcing a man to donate twenty pounds of dog food every holiday after he shot a dog begging two teenagers lead a donkey down the street with a sign that says sorry for the Jackass offense after they spray-painted 666 on Jesus forcing a man to stand with pigs for two hours after he was yelling at a cop and calling the pigs and making a woman spend the night in the middle of the woods alone after she left some kittens in the same woods and again these are just some of the awesome sentences that mr. chicken Eddie dishes out so if you want to check out the rest of them you can check that out in the description down below they're brilliant though after being arrested for soliciting a prostitute this man chose public humiliation over jail time this tough enough punishment that you're never ever gonna be doing some how you say yes this team stole porn from an adult bookstore I'm thankful that judge chicken that it gave me an opportunity instead of a jail time but that is it for this episode of what the fuck five hopefully you guys enjoyed it if you did make sure to give this video a like and also subscribe to this channel I said we'll be doing these every single week my question the day for you guys though is do you think that these punishments were stiff enough or should they bit more lenient so you think they should have been more let me know in the comments down below most before you guys go make sure to check out my newest video of my channel where I talk about my favorite music it's literally twenty six minutes long so it's not gonna hurt my feelings if you don't watch the whole thing but a lot of people assume that I listen to a certain genre of music which is not really the case I'm just gonna spoil it right now my favorite song of all time tiptoe through the tulips by Tiny Tim got the songs such a banger man check that video in the description down below that's it guys I will see you next time for another one to put five thanks for watching and Fairwinds [Music] 
today I am going to be genuinely watching and responding to a video by youtuber named Bobby burns he's not actually a conspiracy theorist he's just someone trying to make legit tons of money making terrible terrible content I think what I want to do is fly him out here bring him to my house and confront him in person see you soon Bobby burns okay so update so I teamed with Bobby I talked to him and I was like hey man listen I want to do a video with you I want you to come to my house I will fly you out I'll put you up in a hotel you can bring a friend and he said yes so he is on his way he's gonna be here in like an hour I don't think I thought this through completely because I don't know if he actually like really doesn't like me or if he was only doing that video to get views and he was like man this will be a good video I don't know I've never really interacted or confronted somebody that publicly said they think my videos are terrible like I'm sure a lot of my family thinks it but they've never told me so I really don't know how this is gonna go well he might actually just be mean or he could be really sweet I don't know another thing is I have not told the island about this mainly because I knew he would think it was a bad idea so um let's go tell them now good morning what are you doing fun you know what else is fun making new friends what do you mean so I have a friend

terrible terrible terrible terrible terrible content I mean I think we could all agree that your content isn't terrible you put more effort than most into your content well feel free to tell him that when he shows up at our door you invited this man are you crazy Shane I don't know he's on his way I flew him out and put him up in a hotel what I mean listen I have a good feeling about it I know he's coming across crazy and possibly like a serial killer but so do I which is why I feel like we will connect you gave him our address I guess that's not a good idea Shane we could have a least met at your mom's although oh my god I just got a good idea for later taking him to my mom's house showing my mom this video but not telling her he's here okay you've gone crazy all right well I'm gonna

that I'm coming over to eat Chipotle and screaming shit on me like this listen I think this is gonna be fun I think it's gonna be therapeutic to get to know the person who made the hate video and fall in love with them so here's what I think you should do because you're really good at like making people feel happy oh sorry I meant uncomfortable oh I think that your goal should be to make him like us like Oh what is it soda or ooh we should mini-golf Bobby Bobby [Applause] this is gonna make them hate us more wait what treats do you have oh my god a lot of shame this is not okay Bobby leave it alone it just confuses sex to me he's like two seconds away he's pulling up thala no maybe my tater wear my virgin that's everything you know that is everything all right maybe just that one does he

hairnet one what have we poison that killing my hater do I like hug him he's gonna spit in my face isn't he what if he's like if not a fan willing to stand like a scary one here's my thought I had an inkling that every hater is secretly a fin because why else would they hate on you cuz hey is passion so like I hate myself yeah I guess I'm not a fan of myself I think we should have in mind just in case you know oh my god I don't know okay I'm gonna keep it cuz I don't trust you with it okay he's one minute away hey what are you doing let's go panic together I'm just getting something ready for the TV I wanted to know the whole time we're having a conversation oh my god it's been just like my photo pigeon it's been like Bobby's photo so oh god what am i doing what the fuck am i doing

Queen Chloe's Queen oh he's from the hit film Valyrian exactly yeah exactly thanks yeah I'm also like Chronicle he's my era maybe he likes carrots content I do actually okay well uh hi yeah get a little closer how are you so you said my videos were terrible you said there were terrible seven times yes terrible terrible terrible content I guess we'll just start there okay okay so tell me what you think is so terrible and also what I could improve okay so we're immediately doing that okay oh fuck wait hold on drama music oh my god I was not ready to immediately do that hmm I wasn't ready to watch this okay um backtracking that's that's a good one that checking oh oh back back yes CT yes a lot of fact-checking okay mainly fact-checking but that's just conspiracy videos yeah yeah yeah so what about my other videos no I don't have a problem with most almost anybody else but you said my content is terrible that specific content you said all my content say yeah yes oh yeah let's go through it perfect yeah Bobby burns personally I like your name Bobby you're supposed to be getting him to like us let's just go to this specific moment that's burned in my friend okay I have a problem with people manipulating people and not being honest and making terrible I'm terrible Oh terrible terrible terrible terrible terrible content to you is if you get content so it's those specific is that specific media that I was talking about that specific series oh I remember this specific moment were you insinuated that because I was promoting merch that I'm somehow genuine or or something and then I realized that in this video and in a lot of other videos from her what are you wearing that would be my oh yeah so yes but it's okay to release merch it's only it's okay to talk about it yeah why was it a problem it wasn't problem that you talked about merch the night pops it was part of the bigger issue wasn't it wasn't wait can I actually you want to touch it yeah okay you tell them it's good quality okay it's fun you get it I know yeah I mean I I see the advantage of having a pop Sokka des you won't drop it is all I could get was overcome flashy not this wait did you say WWE amazon.com slut-shamed I did perfect it not for Christmas prime just making sure that's what you say okay my last moment that I want to bring up was you called me something change I think you're making garbage videos that are courtliness be on time I know this video is pretty much cutting me off from ever having any kind of relationships chain dalsu never ever ever but you don't see me fuck you just seems dumb so I'm done okay mm-hmm makes me dumb I didn't say you weren't I said you looked down those big cats do I look fat [Music] okay so here's my plan for today we're gonna talk more about our beef but then after that I thought like listen we can handle hate reduce to it no he's gay he's gay I used to be fat and half gay we've all got it but my mom is triggered mm-hmm so I was thinking later we was go to my mom's house show her the video and then you knocked on the door and she didn't confront you that sounds fucking amazing like that actually sounds incredible you're welcome so here's what I'm thinking I think we should really seriously talk about our beef mm-hmm in my conspiracy room wait what am i oh you guys stay here [Music] oh hey not cool that's my move you might have seen us a 14% on tomatoes some would say that is dumb I never said it stomp your you never seen it I know I think I actually have you've seen my movie I think so why spooky music so yes so here's the thing I feel like the one thing that you said that really did bother me because none of it really bothered me was when you said you didn't believe that I was into conspiracies I think it's dishonest I don't think Shane is in any way a conspiracy theorist mm-hmm and you felt like maybe I was doing it because it was trendy or something yeah that's that's something that I actually wanted to ask you about - whose it is like if that is something that you really are fully into just because I don't know here's the thing honestly I haven't even talked about this before but oh no no it's perfect I'm so I'm genuinely into conspiracies to a point where it's like sick and unhealthy and I've been into them since I was came out I meant a really really dark dark was that I'm gonna feel too scared to talk about or like on their channel yes so I like when I started doing conspiracies nobody was really doing them I gonna two years ago nobody was doing that nobody liked mine nobody wanted me to do them they weren't getting views but I love them so much I was like oh I'm going to keep doing them so my way of doing it was like okay well I can't talk about what I want to talk about because I will get sued or have a channel deleted so all do more pop culture loans or entertainment ones and maybe throw in a little you know whatever but I won't go too far yeah so I understand because if a conspiracy theorist was watching my videos they're like oh this is fluff it's my culture whatever but for me it's a way to slowly get yeah slowly slowly get the audience to but slowly get into that by telling them about my lead and whatever gotcha and then hopefully soon I can start incorporating you know I'm more the dark one because genuinely and this is something I've full heartedly believe nothing is real everything's bullshit literally everything is everything everything's run by profiles like literally everything but let me tell you this this is one thing that you kind of brought up in your video so I have been talking about the child molesters running Hollywood for years right now everybody made fun of me everybody said I was crazy every comment was like she this is fucking our fence whatever whatever recently so I understand where you're coming from yeah but the funny thing is your video actually got me thinking because I was like you know I love conspiracies and stuff but I don't want to just be like the conspiracy guy so I recently started doing more like documentary type of those yeah it's the storyline this stuff yeah you know I feel here and I feel like I'm even more proud of what I'm making so thank you for pointing out that I'm better than just talking about yeah I mean definitely I mean I think you are like what makes this year's you'd about your dad like that was really really good well thank you and that's my problem with YouTube in general is like I don't know what this is getting too deep but I want to do so many different things and I don't really like fit into like a box and that's hard because people like you who might stumble onto one of my videos maybe oh they're all like this yeah but they're not because they're all different series well alright you know what I feel like we talked yes feel like we have conquered our beast yeah and we're vegan now I am you are okay we're done we're friends now we fixed everything well I missed you folks worth bubbie all right watch stop okay so I was thinking we should like maybe go to my mom's house we could all get him pop sake now the girlfriend why do you have a camera oh do you guys do the videos together or yeah yeah oh so you were part of it well oh yeah she's what did she did she helped read it no you wrote it so you got that actually the haters - I'm so pop that you have a girlfriend yes everybody gets mad I think she wants to go home how about my signature every single day bro shirt oh my god yeah not only am I gonna let you wear them oh my god I'll even let you use the bugs Amazon pops off here in a minute Shan are there more options available on the site and colors and sizes asking weights I question so you guys make your gifts together yes yes so when did you guys start making videos together um since we were very very soon yeah at least play tonight or 10 years probably Wow okay this is really exciting because I did not know this was like a team effort and I hope that because I already like you now thank you I liked you before now at your videos and now I know it's a team and I'm like rooting for you guys thank you okay so let's go to my mom's I guess I'm nervous I haven't told her about this do you guys like a million dogs you like Jesus Christ okay so we're right outside my mom's house yes it's super weird to like actually be here it's like why I've been seeing her in videos for like how many how many years have you been doing you two I thought wait I thought you didn't watch my videos no I'm not your videos dude I've been I've been watching your videos since probably probably 13 14 I stopped last year just because I move because I moved and I but yeah yeah I've been watching your videos for years and years and years so it's really it's gonna be super weird to be super weird to see her so you wait wait this is what I thought so you secretly were kind of like a little bit I haven't that every hater is secretly a fan because why else would they hate on you cuz hey is passion oh yeah I mean I've been a fan of your of your channel for forever yeah whenever I was really young it wasn't allowed to get on youtube by myself so whenever I go over to like a friend's house I like it on YouTube and like they'd be like with doing something in the other room and then they'd be like what are you doing nothing I would always like sneak to the other room and watch you know this is why I'm happy we did this and listen I would have been happy if you weren't like this secret Banner yeah yeah because I'm happy because I genuinely knew I was like I have a connection to this kid I don't know why it's weird that I do he made this video about me I should like hate him but I love him and I don't know why and this is really cool because honestly like I love this I'm happy we're doing this yeah it's nice really genuinely really fun think you're making me want to do better stuff yeah you don't mean you're like you making that video even though I disagree with some of it I'm like yeah you know well I can do better stuff I can I can raise the bar I can make you watch again you got me back let's go make my mom

hey what's up you guys yes welcome back to another creepy video huh snapchat one of the most popular apps in the world an estimated hundred and fifty-eight million users a day it's inevitable that with that many people sending that many snaps some creepy ones might get through and today we're gonna be talking about some snaps that should have never been sent from embarrassing moments to freak accidents even death today we're gonna be looking at some of the scariest snaps that have ever been recorded okay we're gonna start with something sad and disturbing but a little light-hearted now some of you guys might remember this I had never seen it a few years ago a woman snapped herself saving a turtle or so she thought so here's a little note to self if anyone runs into a turtle say that don't just leave it on the road now the idea of saving a turtle he's a good one this did not turn out that way turtle saving is a hobby not only is that not the way to save anything but what's even worse that wasn't a turtle and by the way that turtle was actually a tortoise and tortoises can't swim yeah you can only imagine that kind of hate this girl received after she sent that not only did she throw a tortoise I can't swim into water she threw it from very high up and then she said that she was the Savior did you not know that tortoises don't swim I did not know that I never intended anyone to think that I killed an animal or would ever do anything to harm an animal now luckily tortoises can hold their breath for 30 minutes so this kind of does have a happy ending do you think the tortoise survived yes it did survive he popped up out of the water and walked into the woods either way that girl probably regrets sending that snap every single day okay now we're gonna talk about something that is very very sad at the very real that is people that get into car accidents because of snapchat now car accidents have obviously been around forever but now because everybody has a smartphone in their hands at all times it's only gotten even worse first we're gonna be talking about an accident that happened in 2015 in Philadelphia three women died after burning them alive in the wrecked cars before they died they were all snapchatting and posting about their crazy night while they were having fun and snapping and driving their car crashed into a tractor-trailer now this tractor-trailer was carrying large amounts of herbicide and that is highly flammable the car burst into flames instantly and everybody inside died now nobody knew why they were driving so fast some people thought they were trying to get away from something people thought there was more to this story well then a few weeks later they found out there was the girls were trying to get their speed as high as they could so they could put on the speed filter on snapchat and impress their friends now this happens all the time people trying to go faster so they get their speed filter higher and they consented and their friends and say I'm going so much faster than you well in one case even landed somebody in prison a man named Adil was arrested after a car accident in 2014 and left another driver dead just before the accident he sent a snap to his friend that said leads to Rochdale 11 minutes catch me and then he crashed and killed somebody now obviously snapping and bragging about how fast you're going is awful but what's even worse is bragging about how drunk you are while you're driving earlier this year three women died because of a car accident from snapping and drinking and driving they posted a series of snaps of themselves drinking an entire bottle of vodka while they were driving now this is something that happens all too often and the police are trying to stop this was a very tragic accident and it serves of an example of what can happen when you mix alcohol and driving in a vehicle now listen we talked about this in the Instagram video I did and we're going to talk about it again don't drink and drive and definitely don't drink and snap and drive that's too many distractions and you might end up dead okay now we're going to talk about something that I am so fascinated by now because everybody's snapping all the you might catch something unexpected you might even catch in 2017 two teenage girls were found dead in the woods near an Indiana hiking trail before they died one of the girls might have gotten audio and video and pictures of their murderer now listen this story breaks my heart but I want to talk about it for a reason first let me give you some more details about Liberty and Abigail now these were just to normal teenage girls exploring nature just hours after their family dropped them off by some old railroad tracks the girls bodies were found now the killer is not yet been apprehended but Liberty apparently felt something was wrong and uploaded videos of a man authorities now consider one of their main suspects she even recorded some audio now the case is still ongoing and they were very brave to start snapchatting the second they felt like something was gonna happen but remember in moments like this please also call 9-1-1 hopefully soon we will find out who killed Liberty and Abigail all right now let's talk about some paranormal stuff now many people believe they have caught ghosts on snapchat now I'm sure you've seen this before people trying to get their face in the face filter but then something behind them picks it up now obviously that could just be a glitch or it could be snapchat seeing something that we don't I might touch you okay mm-hm can I touch you [Music] I can't teach you yeah super creepy there are tons of snaps out there of people who have been trying to do the face swap and it literally swaps with something in the darkness behind them or literally like it'll detect a face in a dark hallway sometimes it'll even detect a face on a door and there's nobody there so is it a glitch or is it actually seeing a face now obviously some of them just look like glitches but this next video does not now this woman was playing with the dog filter and then another dog appeared next to her now she jokingly said stick your tongue out and then this happened okay them closures yuck we did them my feet down see what you put in your longer stupid but constitute is up ah [Music] whoo I mean she literally jokingly says stick your tongue out I'm even happened this of oh my god this actually you know that huh you know what wait oh my god okay I want to go to that haunted room in my house and try this myself actually no I know no you know what no let's do it let's go find some ghosts okay I'm in my haunted room I'm gonna go in the closet where I always hear the noises and try the face filter uh-huh oh my god I'm so scared No okay okay what if I just face it this way okay the closet I don't see anything that did not work okay now let's move on from the dark stuff to the weird stuff

hey what's up guys my name is Destry and welcome back to you what the fuck fuck I'm just wondering if it is hotter than a demon's taint in my studio right now so don't be surprised if we see the return of steam anyway thank you so much to xodar Zillah top on the suggestion for this week's video you can leave your own suggestion for a future with the pup 5 so make sure to leave those in the comments down below but without further ado for today's date of a 5 we countdown the 5 weirdest things people have bought online it is nothing to think that a place that we all enjoy so much with amazing personalities multiplayer game experiences communicating with friends can also be a place where one could purchase owl vomit in a jar wolf urine and a pet rock you can plug into your computer why I don't fucking know doesn't do anything so great that's number one on this list is an imaginary friend yeah now this is this is real but like who in their right mind would make this post I'm selling my imaginary friend yeah really like sweets's puffs the cereal ah he's a little racist but just a little his favorite movie is Shaun of the death and he loved Latino movies like even if I believe that imaginary friends were real you can't just sell someone man there's a little thing called slavery a while ago people didn't take too kindly to it I think my favorite part about this post is that the seller also included a picture of the imaginary friends I gotta say he really got his good side in this picture I mean damn look at that guy right what's worse about this we'll know is that someone actually bought him for how much you might ask oh you know just a measly $3,000 what the fuck that imaginary person is worth more than my network I don't know how a person could have a negative network but apparently I do anyways that's really the last update that we have on this story so I don't really assume that the imaginary character whose name is John now PMON apparently has found a new home and is as happy as an imaginary character could be number 2 a ghost in a jar so you believe this in Arkansas Eve a user in 2003 sold a jar on eBay that he claimed to find in an abandoned Cemetery that since he picked up had been haunting him and terrorizing his life and instead of calling the Ghostbusters or Ed Lorraine Warren or the psychic twins the eBay user decided instead to sell it it passed the curse off to someone else stating in his post that he would not be held responsible for anything that might happen to the buyer interestingly enough though the jars sold for a staggering fifty five thousand nine hundred and ninety two dollars but unfortunately B buyer didn't pay for it so chances are it is still stuck with a guy who is trying to sell it but honestly why would you want to buy this who's just like yeah I love demons I love meat with that it's real real fun real fun for the whole family I don't know is that whoever wanted to buy this was going to give it as a gift to someone else you know like oh my god reckon you made it I know we kind of broke up suddenly last year I just hope there's no bad blood between us Oh in fact I actually brought you again thank you no problem [Music] number three the bumper jumper dare have to take a massive shit when you're traveling on the road are you too afraid to poop in the wood because you're afraid of rattlesnake will bite you in your scrotum or labia majora do you have a pickup truck well then you're in luck introducing the bumper dumper a useless is fuck product that attaches the toilet to your back bumper Wow it's almost like the person who made this has never heard of a fucking rest stop but essentially all it is is a bucket you can attach to the back of your bumper for a reasonable $70 like you sees this it's like what's my soul I gotta get me one available I shit on the daily that will never have to be in fear of shit myself on the highway oh yeah like what are you supposed to do with your shit fill bucket just leave it in your truck hey Brad what's that Oh what the fuck also never mind how dumb the product is let's talk about this fucking website was this made in fucking 1996 and even worse is the commercial that was made for it now you always have a place to go it's the ultimate portable toilet for the outdoors the original bumper dumper is made in the USA it easily mounts into most standard 2x2 square hitch receivers the patented frame can use most standard and elongated toilet seats fana what if the guy was close enough to the microphone is reporting that bumper dumper is the best dang product I've ever heard of oh but hey it's not all that you double the bumper dumper as a disciplinary tool for the kids heyday sisters split off when you hit a bump oh well she was my least favorite wife anyways now shut your ass or you're next on the bumper dumper number for getting Kanye West out of debts and he might be like wait Kanye West is in debt no that's why this is stupid but you may remember back in February of last year when Kanye announced that he was in debt fifty three million dollars apparently there are several factors contributed to death from a failed record label to a failed clothing line fans of Kanye even went absolutely nuts and decided to start a GoFundMe page to raise funds to get Kanye out of debt and the envy GoFundMe page raised only and I say only seven thousand three hundred and eighty three dollars out of the fifty three million dollar goal I don't think they made the goal but here's the thing why it's not just that this is ridiculous but you also got to realize money to a normal person is like after bills will I have enough money to eat this month looks like no cool Top Ramen it is money for Kanye West is like how many twenty dollar bills can I wipe my ass with today how many trips to the moon can I take this week seventeen cool and then what he's like oh no I only have 67 million dollars in my savings right now I'm so poor it's a good thing I'm a god everybody says who does he think he is I just told you who I thought I was I got all he has to do in that situation is literally sneeze on a rap beat or fucking take a song that we already love and just wrap over it hey it's Kanye West thanks for buying my new single voila he's a millionaire good anyways Kanye and his team actually took notice of the page last year made a statement saying he doesn't want any of the money and wants to actually send the money from the crowdfunding page two notes four notes charity which is an organization that builds recording studios since so many of them are burned down every year when someone records a fire mixtape yeah that joke was pretty bad that joke was so bad that I literally entered it cricket sounds in there two seconds ago no more stupid pun jokes Destry stop it finally number five beet juice cero so this is something you could actually still buy it is quite honestly more useless than a Bluetooth connected fidgets pin which exists it was very close to making it on this list so why is this thing so useless I mean let's fancy enough right well it should because it's $400 wow I better like sense his fruit nearby and then like teleports them into the juicer and then makes fresh juice right no but that does sound sick the juicer oh is a juicer that you can only operate from an app on your phone and will only work with juicer Oh branded juice packets that cost between six and eight dollars per pack Blumberg actually wrote an article stating that the juice from the packet tastes pretty much the same as just putting the juice to the device so really the only point of buying the $400 device that claimed it was revolutionising how you consume juice what's to squish a juice packet into a cup worth it originally the juicer o is funded on Kickstarter that raised over 12 million dollars over the course of its Kickstarter campaign and what's exercised is that the video that they use to explain the juice row now has over 9000 dislikes and only 1000 likes and they've disabled their comments on the video oh come on it's funny because every comment was like this product fucking sucks the best part about the video though is probably this part our founder Doug is straight-up made of juice literally there's juice in my bags well I got juice in your brain too is that ain't working for shit unfortunately the juicer Oh has stopped making and shipping its products and is looking to sell their company you know this is actually inspired me to create a useless product as well I call it rainwater I had to spell it weird cuz all new companies are like look at us we don't it weird how innovative rainwater it's like water but from the sky here at rainwater we fucking hate Lakes so we literally have 50 different people at any given time running around with buckets trying to collect rain for you to drink just listen to these testimonies it tastes literally no different from normal water rainwater fuck Lakes anyways that is it for this episode of what the fuck five hopefully you guys enjoyed it if you did make sure to give this video a like and also

watching and Fairwinds [Music] 
hey what's up guys my name is destory and welcome back to you WTF is much like the rest of Shane's videos this week today we'll be talking about the top 5 most haunted hotels in the world if you really think about it hotels are the perfect place for ghosts hundreds of thousands of people attend hotels every single year so you got to think that some of the people that go to them never end up leaving and stay there haunting the hotel where they died while I myself have never really had a scary paranormal experience stories like the one that Shane told happen a lot more than you think from hotels built centuries ago to modern ones with just an extremely violent history like ELISA Lam from Vancouver Canada her body found in one of the hotels four water towers so number one Fe hotel cecil so you might remember the video I made a while ago talking about the unsolved death of ELISA Lam as well as the video that Shane made about it but that was just one of the terrible things that happened in a long list of events that happened in the hotel Cecil which I have to say is the least scary sounding Hotel name I've ever heard the hotel ceases there's just no way to make it sound scary for the death of ELISA Lam if you don't know was a highly publicized and mysterious unsolved death of a Canadian student who was found dead in the water tank of the hotel Cecil with little to no explanation as to how she got in there or why and the creepiest part being that she was caught on camera moments before her death on an elevator seemingly losing her mind in hiding from something that we never actually see and as if that wasn't scary enough the hotel has a long and violent history of just disturbing events dating back to 1931 where a man named wk Norton ingested poison capsules in his room probably enough over the course of the next decade after that death there were seven more documented suicides within the hotel from a man shooting himself in the face with a shotgun a man slashing his own throat with a razor a woman throwing herself out of a window on the fluor a year later a man jumping from the roof to his death and then three different people taking their own life by ingesting poison all within the walls of the hotel seasonal last time I swear okay where the fuck are people getting poison capsules could you guys go to a store back then and be like yes I will have a five poison capsules please Danks I guess it's not totally unheard of because you could still go into stores nowadays and ask for cigarettes and that's basically the same thing Oh gotcha don't smoke kids this message was brought to you by the no smoking campaign try not smoking today it's serious like I mentioned that was just all over the stretch of just ten years and since then the number of odd suicides and violent deaths have only gotten worse not only being the site of dozens of suicides and just weird deaths the hotel season was also home to the serial killers Richard Ramirez and Jack Unterweger but it's downtown LA descended into crime in the 80s so did the guests like serial killer Richard Ramirez The Night Stalker killed 13 people as he lived on the 14th floor and serial killer jag hunter Vega who preyed on prostitutes some just blocks away from the season can you imagine just being in a hotel and seeing a dude wanted for mass murder just walk around sit down next to you have a continental breakfast gives in the hot tub next to you like because of all the death and just strange occurrences that happen at the hotel it's actually the main inspiration behind the TV show American Horror Story hotel and because of the just massive popularity of the show a lot of the Phantom of American Horror Story has made a conscious choice to stay at this hotel probably in the hopes that they can relive some of their favorite scenes from the show without you know the terrible death and destruction also because of all the negative publicity that the hotel's gotten over the years new management has decided to rename and rebrand the hotel to the stay on main which again is not terrifying to stay on main which I guess I get because I don't think normal people want to stay in a hotel where several people have jumped to their death on it and people have literally drank the rotting flesh of a woman who was found dead in a water tank above the hotel come stay at the stay on me hey wait a second isn't this the hotel Cecil hmm no definitely definitely no you're thinking of another place that's 100 percent not here but there's still signs that say the hotel Cecil right there you're missing we're definitely the stay on main there's absolutely no death here the stay on me now with 100% no death still rated number one on Trip Advisor's fleshie astata award number two the Fairmont Banff Springs Hotel located in Alberta Canada PBM Springs Hotel is not only one of the most scenic ly beautiful hotels in all of Canada but is also the most haunted hotel in all of Canada which I don't really know if that's saying that much cuz I don't imagine a Canadian ghost being really that scary they're probably really nice actually hello do you mind if I hunt you I do actually yes okay I'll come back later but after a massive fire that broke out in 1923 the original wooded Banff Springs Hotel was completely burnt down to the ground and rebuilt just a few years later out of stone which I feel like they should have just done that in the first place well no in fact for you guys stone is not nearly flammable as wood yeah you know you're welcome I'm just real smart so you know why it was burnt down though because somebody smoked a few yes in the original hotel claimed to have heard voices and odd noises coming from within walls of certain rooms and when the hotel burnt down it was discovered that there was a secret room built that had no windows or doors so there was no way to get inside of it but somehow guests still heard noises coming from it despite having no idea that there was a secret room at all which why would there be a secret room in a hotel huh what possible reason would there be what were the sounds coming from inside of it for my own sanity I'm just gonna pretend it was like an orgy room people would just somehow go in there and spew bodily liquids on each other because as gross as that is my brain can just not handle one else that could have been another haunting story from the Fairmont is that of a young bride who is emerging from her room with her wedding dress on and while descending down the main lobby stairs fell and died instantly on impact and according to many guests they witnessed a woman in a wedding dress descending down the same stairs and then disappearing into nothing also a former bellman named Sam McCall he has been seen haunting the upper floors of the hotel with a few people even seeing him as a completely real person even talking with him before he instantly disappeared and the most haunted of all the rooms in the Banff Springs is room 873 as this was the room where his small family was mysteriously murdered when the police investigation around the bar was finally concluded and the room was cleaned up fingerprints belonging to the youngest victim of the family were left on the mirror inside the room however despite the hotel staff doing everything they could to remove the fingerprints they never seemed to come off the mirror so I guess they just didn't have Windex or I having a hard time believe in this one's the hotel staff decided to close the room off not let guests in there but staff who check on the room claimed to see be family roaming around from time to time and many guests claimed to see them roaming nearby the room that they were murdered in number 3 the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel so this is another hotel that Shane not only mentioned in a previous video but actually went to and stayed in the hotel all the while knowing it's dark and sinister history the Roosevelt Hotel was a 12 story 300 room hotel known all across the world as one of the best places celebrities could stay in Hollywood being literally right across the street from the Hollywood Walk of Fame and the Chinese Theater the Roosevelt was one of the best hotels for celebrities actors and musicians to stay at some of their most famous guests included Shirley Temple Clark Gable Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie and most notably Marilyn Monroe who is said to still be haunting the hotel to this day in her old room 1200 guests have claimed to see her face staring at them in the mirror within the room it doesn't actually sound that bad though like if I saw Marilyn Monroe's ghost staring at me I would probably just stare right back because that girl is what the cool kids call fee with four C's and no kiss far as I know being thick is good but you don't want to be thick like with the cake but even is things language but the most malevolent spirit said to be inside the hotel is that of the actor Montgomery Clift Montgomery Clift was an actor best known at mean 1940s and 50s who would often stay at the Roosevelt Hotel in room nine to eight and like Marilyn Monroe though Clift didn't die in the hotel it's not crazy to imagine that as a ghost they might return to a place that they loved and visited so much in a place that essentially made them who they were in a sense what's interesting is that Clift wasn't an angry guy when he was alive get so many guests claimed to have similar experiences in his room of the hotel a feeling of uncomforta cold and angry presence when you're trying to sleep some even saying they woke up in the middle of the night to a weight on top of everything most commonly seeing Montgomery's apparition staring at them from across the room and tell they're forced to leave or go to sleep somehow yeah nope I must say though with Montgomery's ghosts and marilyn monroe's goes it seems like they're both just chillin you know like I don't want to possess anyone they don't want to harm anyone it seems like they just want to know what it is to live again so all they can really do is observe from the afterlife which is still creepy in unnerving but I think I'd rather a ghost stare at me that it goes trying to like possess me or hurt me or try to kill me number four be laying him hotel so unlike the others on this list the Langham Hotel was built outside of America in London England and was the largest and most modern hotel for its era like the Roosevelt Hotel the Langham was known pretty much everywhere as one of the best and most elegant places to go if you were a celebrity during the early 1900's and also like the Roosevelt considered one of the most haunted places in all of England since its creation in 1863 the hotel opened its doors to the likes of Mark Twain and poet Oscar Wilde Napoleon the third and was even written about in one of Arthur Conan Doyle as Sherlock Holmes books and while the hotels struggled to stay afloat during the Great Depression he was able to prosper afterwards by being used temporarily as accommodation from British soldiers during World War two sort of like the grand budapest hotel if you've ever seen that movie amazing movie if you haven't seen it very well that's not the correct way to use that word oh my I apparently don't know how to be cool I'm working on a dog get in a shirt next week that says supreme across the chest so I think you know come try and I've also been practicing dabbing on my haters so you know leaving the comments down below if you think I'm cool okay yet again can't wait for an entire comment section that just says no yes no but a long history of success and reputation doesn't always mean it's that bright and happy right under the surface the ghost of Napoleon the third has been seen roaming around in the basement to man in military dress has been seen standing next to the window on the fourth floors have been told to be a German Prince who jumped from the same window before World War one but ghost has been seen running the halls with a gaping wound in his face doctor who murdered his wife and then killed himself has been seen that within room 333 guests have had their sheets pulled off them in the middle of the night and sometimes the person being pulled off the bed entirely in the middle of the night ah and like the haut you know CSIS new management tried to renovate the place and wash away all the terrible things that have happened within its walls but guests still complain about creepy occurrences to this day and finally number five be Stanley Hotel might seem familiar for a few different reasons as it was the main inspiration behind the Stephen King novel The Shining and is the same hotel that Shane was staying in earlier this week as he explored this Stanley Hotel one of the things that makes the Stanley hotels so fucking creepy is that it's made a believer out of skeptics and people who never would have believed in ghosts had they not entered its hallowed halls the air in this day of a hotel feels thin indifferent sounds are amplified yet silent moments feel like they engulf for you even when Stephen King a legendary horror author behind it stayed in the hotel he had nightmares so terrifying he wrote The Shining the next day based on them people have heard piano keys in the middle of the night after coming from nowhere but somehow all around them people's clothes and items being randomly misplaced or moved around the room when they aren't looking but as we saw in Sheen's video just a lot of really weird unexplained events like his camera going out of focus weird figures appearing on the walls in the bathroom door closing without anyone touching it so with all that I have to say shame just has way bigger balls than I do which is a weird thing to say but you know they're like I refuse to go with that place you couldn't pay me enough money to stay in that place anyways guys that is it for this episode of WTF five hopefully you guys enjoyed it if you did make sure to give this video a like and also subscribe to this channel as I'll try to be doing more spooky videos like this all the time on a lighter note if you'd like to see a new video on my channel where I until the quiz seeing how gay I am do you click that right here or you could check it out in the description down below be honest

wigs on me and dress up like a woman you would you would think it was higher that's true that's it guys I will see you next time for another WTF 5 thanks for watching and Fairwinds 
guys sit upon cousin Nicki Gabi oh my god you're not gonna believe what we talked about it got really dirty really fast you know DIYs hey what's up you guys yes welcome back to another conspiracy theory video now today we're going to be talking about some of the biggest conspiracy theories that blew up in 2017 some of them are funny and some of them are weird and some of them are intense so before I go any farther please if you are triggered by sexual assault or child molestation or shootings and please click off this video but for the rest of you here we go all right so let's start with the fun one the iPhone X is taking over the world now I'm just kidding but it is watching your every move so first let's just talk about the obvious conspiracy that we have all thought about and that is whenever a new iPhone comes out it seems like all of our current phones start to slow down literally the second they announced this new iPhone my phone started up I'm not just up like freezing and shutting down and doing spiral I've never seen before oh wait except for the last time there's a new phone that came out and I had to get a new one now of course Apple denies that this is true but the proof that there's other people out there that feel the same way as me is evident back in 2014 there was a New York Times article that showed that the Google searches for iPhone slow spike every year around the new product dates yeah literally look at the graph every time there's a new iPhone more and more people are searching why is my iPhone so slow you can't tell me that's a coincidence now of course you've all heard of the iPhone X which is the latest and it's an awesome phone and there's a lot of new cool features but one of the features that a lot of people are afraid of is the face idea now of course the idea the face idea is to make it easier for you to unlock your phone or purchase things on iTunes it's supposed to make life more simple but is it really bad safe now the galaxy phone tried to do this earlier this year until people realize that you could literally just put a picture of yourself up to the phone and it would work the guy registered his face to the phone to lock it and then took a picture of himself and unlocked the phone now of course Apple says that theirs is better and I won't do that but what if theirs is what if it's a lot better now I'm sure you guys have heard of an emojis which is a new feature and that's where you use your face ID to control emojis like if you frown in friends if you smile and laugh it smells and laughs it can track over 50 muscle movements in your face which sounds pretty intense for something that's literally just supposed to unlock your phone one weird thing that happened was a while ago the show black mirror literally predicted this I'm sorry these are the facts well duh what do you think mr. Monroe are you addicted no sorry I mean all you would dickhead yeah literally exactly what black mirror said was gonna happen happened I mean they even tweeted about it they put their little blue emoji in the middle of all the other animal jeez oh and by the way every episode of black mirror usually ends with a lot of people dying and technology taking over which feels like that's where we're heading I mean think about it this way this is technically artificial intelligence right and artificial intelligence is going to be able to collect more data about people than ever before our phones are literally gonna know what mood we're in what we're wearing what we're eating so not only will the government know every single thing about us but they'll be able to sell that information to advertisers think about it this way you use your face ID and you're wearing new lipstick well now Apple can send that information to all the makeup companies hey look Lisa is wearing this color maybe she wants this one advertised to her and I know you're thinking shame they can't just scan your face whenever they want not true it actually happens all the time there's an aquarium in Dubai that has a hidden face scanner it's literally a system for you to go inside and look around at the fish while it's scanning all different areas of your face yeah and people just think it's an aquarium now let's take it even further say you're dating somebody and you fall asleep well what if they're really nosy if they wanted to get into your phone they would either have to know the password or they'd have to use your finger but if you're sleeping that's gonna be complicated and it's gonna wake you up well now with face ID they literally can just take your phone put it over your face while you're sleeping and then unlocked would take it even farther all of your information is in your phone your banking information your social medias your emails everything is in here your whole life is in here now what if somebody killed you and then what if they wanted to take everything you had all they would have to do is take your phone put it over your dead face and it's unlocked I mean I know this all sounds crazy but it's where we're heading facial recognition is getting crazy good already without a face ID I mean haven't you looked inside of your photo albums your phone literally makes albums for the people that you have pictures of like what all I'm saying is iPhone X sounds more like iPhone exterminate the humans okay so that was fun this next one is we're gonna be talking about some of the conspiracy theories about Las Vegas now before I get into this number one I just want to say I mean no disrespect to the victims or the survivors and this is in no way gonna be me saying that it never happened I believe 100% that this happened that people died and that it was literally one of the worst thing that's ever happened in our country and I debated even talking about it because I was so affected by it and I mean you guys saw my crying video it was a lot but I also don't want to ignore this because I hate when this happens big tragedy happens and then everybody's like oh god why did that happen and then they move on no I have a lot of questions and I hope you guys do too so there we go all right so first let's remind ourselves what happened on October 1st 2017 a man opened fire on a concert in Las Vegas he was staying in the 32nd floor of Mandalay Bay and he shot out his window fifty-eight people died and over 500 were injured the man's name was Steven paddock and his motive is still unknown now when this was happening a lot of people had questions because it seemed like there was more to the story so much so that when you search the Las Vegas shooting on YouTube all the videos were about conspiracies literally every top video with somebody questioning what exactly happened that night now people got really pissed at YouTube for this they were like why are you exploiting the situation why are you promoting these conspiracies even one survivor came out said this it's not a conspiracy it's not a joke it did happen I was there we literally thought we were going to die and I agreed the people that are saying that like nobody got shot it's not real I am NOT a fan of that this was very real somebody shot a bunch of people in Las Vegas but was it who they're saying it was so a lot of people believed it was more than just one shooter even some people who were there there's no physically human body physically the only possible way that that guy that was the only sugar if you were where we were and how we were hidden in the way they came in and herded us all out out into the staff parking lot and then continued shooting into the staff parking lot yeah and then there's clips out there where it sounds like there's more than one gun going off on the fourth floor look like a gun now that one's been debunked that was just like a broken light but there are a lot of other things that were weird I'm sure you all heard about the girl that was in the crowd when somebody came up before the shooting and said yeah so there is a lady who pushed her way forward into the concert venue into the first row and she started messing with another lady and told us that we are all gonna die tonight is that a coincidence or did the woman that said it know what was gonna happen now before we knew who Stephen paddock was everybody thought 100% this is Isis mainly because Isis did reference Las Vegas and one of their last videos well some of the famous landmarks that were used to around the city including some on the strip right here behind me are clearly seen in that new video now take a look in the propaganda video several strip properties are clearly shown making Vegas a potential terror target then the police came out real quick and said it was nice as this event unfolds we have determined to this point no connection with an international terrorist group then of course it came out that the shooter was dead and it was confirmed to be Steven well since then we still don't know what his motive was now of course like the news and the government always does they're saying that oh he was crazy now listen I know a lot of crazy people I've dealt with mental illness in my family all around me my whole life and crazy people don't just plan an entire thing and get 30-something guns and then shoot a bunch of people which is why the whole thing is so confusing and sketchy I mean let's talk about the fact that there was no cameras in the hallway yeah in Las Vegas where there's cameras everywhere Mandalay Bay is saying that there was no cameras that could catch Steven walking in and out of the hallway that does not make sense and then there was this interview with one of Steven paddocks former employees and she seemed just as confused as everybody else he cared about everybody spying it says he cared about everybody's um cars he cared about he actually cared about people including her those pictures show them pelling around together with iconic Las Vegas hotels in the background now I know you're thinking Shane but the government in the news they all said it was Steven so why would they lie about that and that's where some theories now listen I do not want to get arrested I don't want to die please government don't come for me I'm just saying that some of these theories are out there okay now this one is the most viral of the theories is that it was Isis and that because the government didn't want to give them that win they didn't want to give them credit for this they didn't want to scare us they blamed it all on a man named Steven Matic now that wouldn't makes sense to me because I get it listen if the government is just trying to picked us and they're like we don't want everybody to know that Isis just killed a bunch of people because they're gonna be scared to go anywhere let's just say it was one crazy guy who is dead now and don't worry everything's fine listen all I'm saying is I think we need to question things more I mean back when 9/11 happened and people were questioning things everybody was shutting it down if you said oh I think there might have been something weird with 9/11 everybody thought you were crazy and everybody thought you were an asshole well cut to 16 years later more than half of Americans believe in 9/11 conspiracy theories half I just don't want to wait another 16 years to figure out exactly why of all those people lost their lives that night because I don't want to accept that it was just some guy who was crazy who just wanted to kill people I think there's something once again all respect to the families and the victims and imagine want more answers okay now this next one is once again triggering we're gonna be talking about some theories that even really theories involving the Harvey Weinstein case once again this is just alleged I'm not trying to get sued as you guys know very recently it has come out that Harvey Weinstein who is a huge movie producer has reportedly assaulted harassed and possibly raped a lot of women in Hollywood and I'm sure most of you guys heard that very intense audio recording of him trying to get a woman into his hotel sorry I don't know yes it was a kind of a progressive party I need to know a person do a thing I think please I swear I won't just sit with me don't embarrass me in the hotel all the time I am a firm believer in the saying that there's truth in every joke well let's take a look at some of the jokes people have been making over the years about Harvey Weinstein in 2013 this is what Seth MacFarlane's congratulations you five ladies no longer have to pretend to be attracted to Harvey Weinstein yeah he said that in front of a whole room of Hollywood people and they all laughed which means they knew now look at this clip from the show 30 rock I turned down intercourse with Harvey Weinstein on no less than three occasions yeah she literally said something that actually happened I mean just look at this clip from 2005 Courtney Love answering a question on the red carpet and it was intense Courtney Love has also spoken out a video of a rock star of the rock star rather in 2005 came out showing the star warning young women in Hollywood about the movie Titan yeah Courtney Love she knows Hollywood and even that she knew that this was the situation but here's the weird part of it even a Courtney Love who is warning people still would be around Harvey in this video from 2012 you can see her standing next to him and that's some kind of a party so like he probably knew she said stuff publicly but he was still next to her and she was still next to him so all I'm saying his Hollywood knew about this guy and this is not the first time something like this has happened but it's also been covered up and there's a lot of guilty people out there in Hollywood who are probably not alright this is where it's going to get very very dark we've talked about child molesting in Hollywood before but I really feel they need to talk about it again now when this whole thing with Harvey Weinstein blew up I was like great awesome I'm so happy these women are speaking out but it even reminded me more of how much child molestation is happening would that everybody's covering up let's talk about Woody Allen Woody Allen one of the most famous movie directors of all time and also an alleged child lost his adopted daughter Dylan Farrow came out in 2014 and wrote a letter about it some of the stuff she said in the letter was 22 years on and Dylan's given her first public account of what happened in an open letter to the New York Times in it Dylan who's now 28 says he told me to lay on my stomach and play with my brother's electric train set then he sexually assaulted me he talked to me while he did it whispering that I was a good girl yeah she says that Woody Allen molested her for years and then he married his other adopted daughter that's confusing I'm not gonna get into it all I'm saying is people know that this guy is an alleged child molester but he still works in movies I mean his new movie is in production and it literally has Elle Fanning and Selena Gomez yeah two really awesome strong women who have young fans and I'm gonna give them the benefit of a doubt that they don't know about this maybe they're too young but the fact that they don't know is not good it means that people are covering it up a lot I mean just look what Corey Feldman who's a former child star said in this interview I can tell you that the number one problem in Hollywood was and is and always will be pedophilia that's the biggest problem for children in this industry yeah everybody on the news right now is saying that women getting taken advantage of is the biggest problem in Hollywood and I agree it's a huge problem this one is big too nobody talks about pedophilia it's the big secret then it's widespread oh yeah I was surrounded by them when I was 14 years old surrounded now when Corey Feldman brought this up on the view Barbara Walters literally shut him down are you saying that they're pedophiles yes and they're still in this entire industry on so yeah Barbara Walters who I love but you know she knows the dark going on in Hollywood and it kind of seemed like she wanted to just cover it up all I'm saying is yes I'm happy that women are speaking up but please children or former child stars speak up will believe you I'll believe you even if the rest of Hollywood is trying to shut you up all right now let's talk about something fun and light please it's been a while since we talked about Mandela effects that was kind of a 2016 thing but I did learn some new ones that I was like oh I got to talk about it first we're gonna be talking about the Mandela effect and the movie The Matrix now a lot of people remember in the movie Morpheus saying what if I told you that everything you know was a lie I definitely remember that moment cuz I was like oh everything is a lie I mean so many people remember it that it even became a meme but what if I told you memes and gifs were everywhere I mean there was so many and of course my favorite one what if I told you I've been done since noon yeah I really died well guess what he never said that the matrix do you want to know what it is yeah never said it but for some reason we all remember it which is even crazier because the whole point of the matrix is like simulation and things changing so like what if something in our matrix changed in our simulation and we thought we heard something I thought I'm getting to do all I'm saying is I remember it now this next line from a movie I specifically remember a certain way the movie saw you know the movie about jigsaw who kills people in crazy ways well you know that creepy little doll thing that comes out on the bike and talks to you what is he saying do you want to play a game right that's what you were thinking your head nope yeah he just says I want to play a game I specifically remember do you want to play a game I remember saying it to my friends when that movie came out I remember every time it was board game night I do want to play a game I know I'm lame how I'm saying is I believe that one all right now this next one really pissed me off so the laughing cow cheese look you know that little round cheese with the cow on it now I'm going to show you two versions of the logo and you tell me which one you think is right hmm what do you think you probably noticed that one of them has a nose ring and if you're me you would say yeah it always had a nose ring nope the laughing cow never had a nose ring I literally remember telling my mom like mom can we get the cheese with the cow with the nose ring I even remember putting in a fake nose ring when I was a kid and somebody called me a laughing cow so that one pisses me off actually hold on I want to get like a real reaction I'm gonna get round in here and I'm gonna show him is that he did not believe in Mandela effect so this should be interesting okay all right now you don't believe any of them no not really perfect okay so I'm going to show you two different pictures of this product and you have to tell me which one you think is right okay okay so it's the laughing cow one of them has a nose ring and one of them I think growing up it always had the nose ring what no I don't believe it I need real receipts like you can't just say it didn't happen google it oh no ring wow that's so weird she had earrings but no nose still not a believer I mean do you have another example just go all right now of course another huge conspiracy that happened this year was little Michaela but I I'm done I need a break from Michaela it's been too much but I know a lot of you guys have been tweeting me yes she came out with a new music video I saw it and it was incredibly attitude I mean listen until there's a huge update I need a Michaela break on a small note remember we thought that one girl are stinkle was Michaela well it turns out she blocked the words Lille Michaela and Shane Dawson from her comments yeah she literally blocked those words so oops but it's okay at the end her she's fine she's not mad she wouldn't admit whether or not she was a little Michaela so I still don't know but once again I need to break them all right so before we go I'm gonna leave you with this now this has been going viral and I read it and I literally could not stop thinking about it this is an afterlife conspiracy theory alright so I'm gonna read this to you and you visualize it what if when we die the light at the end of the tunnel is alight to another hospital room there we are born and the only reason you come out crying is because you remember everything from your past life and your crying at the fact that you died and lost everything as you grow you start to forget about your past life and focus on the life you have now but patches of memories stay behind and that memory causes deja vu think about that for a second oh I did it I thought about it for a long second like a week so let me know down the comments what you guys think do you believe that one also let me know what you think about these theories that we talked about today and what your other favorite theories of 2017 were all right you guys I'm gonna go make sure to give this video a thumbs up if you want more conspiracy theories also make sure to subscribe to my channel right down below and hit the notification bell because I make new videos every day and if you want to see all my other conspiracy theory videos from the year I'll put a link to a playlist right at the top the description below and once again before I go no disrespect to anybody I just enjoy talking about these theories and twisted things and I know you guys like it too all right you guys remember don't believe everything you see bye Hey so I just wanted to give you guys a little update I had a really weird experience just now so I finished the video and I changed and I was cleaning up my computer and stuff and I couldn't stop thinking about the Vegas attacks and I kept thinking like oh maybe I'm gonna cut that out of the video I don't know I don't know even though my heart tells me to keep it in because I feel like we should be questioning things and as I'm literally having this conversation with myself I noticed something that I had not noticed before literally in the biggest picture behind me that is the Mandalay Bay and that is the window that he was shooting at like that's it it's right there literally his floor was right there and I'm sitting right here I don't know it gave me the chills made me feel really weird maybe I'm overreacting maybe I'm crazy but I just it's been there the whole time okay I feel really weird I'm gonna go it's too safe and I'll see you guys tomorrow 
so today I'm going to be switching lives with Trish my boyfriend cheated so I feel like I need to challenge you now so tomorrow and I want you to live a day as me hey what's up guys welcome to a new

got that in common wouldn't put the two of us we love 5x Isles for our to excel bodies we actually have so much in common it's crazy yeah I felt like this experience showed me even more how similar we are yeah I feel like this whole situation not that this was what it was intended to do honestly yeah but I feel even like closer to you than I did back in the day yeah because I feel like we're different people and I feel like I'm actually being myself around you mm-hmm and the fact that we've been here to stay each other's life and to see him to like live each other's lives it's so true what they say like when you like walk a mile in someone else's shoes obviously like my favorite part of this whole experience was I haven't really like hung out with you and this type of whim ever it's usually just one on one yeah this was like I had you know my boyfriend who you can't like want yeah literally I had Garrett who you've seen like one times really maybe twice yeah and this was like one of the most fun days I've ever had in my life really me too I just didn't know me not cuz I obviously know a lot of friends I'm like you know whenever I see you guys all hang out together myself but I got something too I honestly like got like oh maybe she doesn't like my friends she doesn't really like going around and so whatever that maybe I should just hang off her long but maybe she's like Jamaa I don't know well I mean it's kind of true though I didn't know Rylan I didn't know Garrett so it's like of course I was like yeah I never was like offended that we didn't all you know cuz I didn't know that well how do you feel well I love what like love like truly love like love like Riley 'no couldn't be sweeter because Brian what I love about him is like he doesn't he's yes easy you do work but he doesn't need all the attention of on him like a lot of youtubers do like he's very much happy to just support and that's like all he did all day was like just support even when he wasn't on camera he came with us everywhere he could have been editing and get doing stuff and I'm like that was amazing Garrett like adds so much energy that I was just like this is he's so sweet and so nice and just talked about really random stuff he just reminds me like a really like weird friend in a sitcom that's looks like says the most Raven things like I loved it and then it just was really really cool I loved it and I find you they were good people cuz you have in your life for so long anything out them all the time so you know I was really happy because I don't have any genuine friends and you've always been a Jenny one so I love it so much was so fun but yeah like factor just you being you today was like so cool that was your man huh give me me you me a hot Shana inception hug well the final thing we have to do now that we're in bed yeah just a three-way spin we love tired you should little spoon Shana Baker moon Ryland okay this is how we cuddle he never lets me be the small spoon wait really I like being kind way after me oh yeah oh yeah oh my god you would have impacted it turned out by it I love having a guy's butt up against me like that and your body's like a for as tiny as you are okay so it's the end of the night and Trish just left and I cannot believe how incredible the last two days was I went into this whole thing thinking oh it's gonna be fun and it's Trish I love Trish like this is gonna be so funny but it genuinely turned into one of the best experiences of my life I love making videos like I love it but these last two days felt like more than just making a video it genuinely felt like hanging out with family and I don't have that much family so it just felt really good and I'm gonna be honest like the last few years me and Trish definitely haven't hung out as much for a lot of reasons I mean I came out and then I started dating a bunch and then I got into a relationship she was getting into relationships and we just were kind of going in different places but having her around my boyfriend and my other friends and doing something like this with me it brought us so close I mean we laughed for the last two days non-stop we had so many deep conversations Trish if you're watching this not only did I love being you I love being with you I guess I want to say to you guys watching if there's somebody in your life who you kind of drifted apart from and you don't really know why or you haven't really talked about it talk about it get coffee with them hang out with them put on their wig and figure it out because those people who you feel that connected with you should not let go and I just can't wait to be like 90 years old hanging out with Trish even pizza just talking shit all right you guys I'm gonna go actually shower I promise and I was you guys [Music] [Laughter] 
hello guys my name is destory and welcome back to you what the fuck five before we get in today's video I'd like to thank our new sponsor weird green juice that looks like Shrek speed being drunk out of a glass my god this is bad thank you so much to Louie Jackson to the topic of this week's video if you liked leave your own suggestion for a future what the fuck five so make sure to leave those in the comments down below that's it today's video we count down the top five dumbest trends of all time number one beanie babies some sure there's a few Millennials watching this video that are rolling their eyes right now remembering back to a time when beanie babies were a thing and for those of you who maybe don't remember it was essentially a worldwide craze where everyone was collecting stuffed bears for some reason there was really no reason behind the craze of beanie babies except for that most people believe because they were collectible one day they would be worth millions but here we are 20 years later and they're essentially worth about $5 each it wasn't just beanie babies that everyone seemed to be freaking out about as it was around this time that Furby is also became a thing which were basically demonic-looking talking robots that were honestly the shit of nightmares in the early 2000s even more stupid toy trends with viral including troll dolls Polly Pockets those weird robotic talking dog things razor scooters and even the razor phone that everyone and their fucking mothers seem to own at the time and of course the more recent craze has been centered around the fidgets spinner which don't get me wrong he's a trend I know you might be like no way that's gonna be 83 one day and still rocking the fidgets spinner yeah okay so just keep in mind well you might be tempted to buy a tin load of something because it's super in right now just know like all of my hopes and dreams eventually they'll all die down and you'll be real sad about it number two the fire challenge this one really encompasses just all internet challenges because they are all stupid you know aside from the ones that actually help to cause like the ice bucket challenges all of them are pretty dumb really while we can sit here and sift through all of them and grade how dumb they are from the Kylie Jenner lip challenge where you cut off circulation to your lips in a shot glass to get big lips to the Charlie Charlie challenge where the main goal was to summon a Mexican demon to the several challenges that were just massive health hazards like the gallon of milk challenge a salt and ice challenge the condom ciao and of course the wildly popular cinnamon challenge which actually left a few people in the hospital because of it seriously look it up it's fucking pretty but not more more idiotic than the fire challenge which the main goal of the entire thing was to light yourself on fire for no reason just to just to do it there was no like let's turn ourselves on fire for charity which is stupid even that but no this was like that you don't be fun to light myself on fire for the internet yeah Internet quick wit which would you rather have memes or a body free of third-degree burns hmm if you even had to think about your answer chances aren't you need a break from the internet number three myspace oh god fuck it myspace so far from being a giant part of my life in the late 2000s with my cringe-worthy phase of Destry demonic you can never kill death to demise but will seriously never live that down myspace was a hugely popular website from around 2005 to 2012 where it seemed like every one of its seventy five point nine million visitors a month were all trapped in their emo phase the site became a platform that saw the rise of a ton of creators on both YouTube and in the music industry and then suddenly died around 2012 when everyone was disappointed in the site's new direction and joined the new and exciting Facebook with all of its super-fun intuitive new features which I can't seem to think of a single one of those features but they're there I feel so bad for the generation of people growing up right now that won't know what it feels like to log into my space and see this oh oh baby I miss you MySpace why did you eat I'm a really ugly crier sorry but again myspace wasn't the only trendy website throughout the internet ages long and questionable rape other sites like formspring dailybooth and MSN Messenger which for you Millennials out there this was for you yeah god the feel and of course the website which we all dearly miss is the actually good YouTube where people could upload whatever they wanted and there was a cool rating system but people didn't get their videos to monetize every time they uploaded a video this shade though number four rotting teeth so let me have the trends from the last few decades for this video and I was like hmm I wonder if there's any trends from like way back in the day that people did and that were just really stupid and as it so happens there is as in the 1500s in England it became a trend to have black teeth this is 100% real so apparently how this started is that between during the time Queen Elizabeth had consumed so much sugar that her teeth actually started to rot out of her skull and for whatever reason the rest of society decided to glorify the rotting of her teeth and started rotting out their own teeth as well oh that's disgusting but hey this one's an arrow without toothbrushes or toothpaste so you got to imagine that your choices of dental hygiene we're pretty limited hello how are you well your breath didn't completely rot my skin off my bone said hey what I've said as weird as that is it was actually reported in the 1800s that the disease tuberculosis also became a trend as it was considered a beautifully artistic way to die and there was a fashion trend where people would pale their skin as much as they could and then get dangerously skinny to look like they had tuberculosis even worse is that some people actually tried to deliberately contrack the disease to live out they quote artistically a beautiful death they said it was one dumb fuck and probably at number five clothing trends so I can't move this one together because there really wasn't one specific trend out of the hundreds of dumb trends that I've seen in the fashion industry that have stood out to me and is ever evolving as the fashion industry is I'm sure even remember back to a time where maybe you dressed a certain way or you did your hair in a certain fashionable style and now you look back on it are like what the hell was I thinking for me was when I was in eighth grade and for some reason I thought it was awesome to have orange gangster pants with a matching orange vest puka shell necklaces and etnies shoes with no laces while my hair was spiked up but only in the front and with blond highlights what's that you want to you want to see a picture luckily all of those images if it burns by me so luckily no one will ever have to see that but if I do find one that isn't ashes in my mom's fireplace I'll make sure the lady's name yes throughout the years has been a lot of dumb fashion trends from the people wearing cross which were those neon phone clogs that had holes in them that were essential Universal sign that someone had given up on life the of the trend which looked like space boots for basic bitches there was of course the silly van trend where everyone was wearing those weird like band things and I think they meant different sexual things I don't know maybe that was just advisable that's where I was like Japanese wearing black bands man you know what that means he's down with the bridge there was a trend in the 1920s where women started dyeing their hair black cutting his shorts wearing kind of more sexy dresses and smoking from those weird long cigarette thingies I don't know why but I always thought the 1920s flapper girls were just so big I'm sorry I'm weird but damn this was also the same kind of era where dudes started getting attracted to girls calf muscles for some reason B you know it now was like who the booty ur those titties it was like oh yeah I don't know again pretty weird trend and the early 2000s there was a trend for some reason to wear baggy pants that sag literally below your ass crackit it just looked like you pooped yourself 24/7 ha there was a trend from the 80s to around to the mid 90s where girls just wore their pants way too high like way too hot which if you're fan of camel toe Merry Christmas I guess but that cannot be come anyways that is it for this episode of what the fuck 5 hopefully you guys had a jolly ol time going up every Lane my question today for you guys is what is the worst trend that you've ever been a part of let me know in the comments down below before you guys go make sure to check out my newest video on my channel which is a reaction video to all of my own videos and there's actually a really golden video of Shane and i's first ever a collab video that we did that you guys would absolutely love so check that video out the description down below lets up guys i'll see you next time for another one to put 5 thanks for watching and Fairwinds [Music] 
hey what's up you guys yes welcome back to another creepy video now we've talked about some very scary Instagram accounts we talked about the account I know exactly who you are and we still don't know exactly who runs that account but when you do them and say Who am I they send you back a bunch of in-depth details about your life that nobody would know and yes that account is pretty creepy but it gets worse today we're going to be going over some of the scariest accounts better on Instagram that's right Instagram isn't just a bunch of pictures of people doing yoga and posting their avvocato toast that they have in the morning if you dig deep enough you can find some of the creepiest pictures on the internet and we're gonna start with an account called mop Meister now this account is incredibly terrifying and almost feels like you're looking at somebody's and nightmares I mean just looking through some of the pictures gave me the chills you have people wearing clown masks and dark suits standing in the middle of nothingness you have old dying clouds holding on to sad sad animals you have clouds that have black eyes that you do not see any like so I did some research on them and what I found was that their whole idea of their page is to challenge traditional beauty standards and they want you to be looking at the Explorer page and be seeing pictures of Kim Kardashian and Taylor Swift and Selena Gomez and then randomly gets one of their pictures and it kind of messes with your head now it's a couple that runs this account and they said they get their ideas from their nightmares that's right they wake up from a nightmare they write it down and they turn it into a picture now I'm gonna show you a few of their most disturbing pictures and literally it feels like a nightmare watch yeah the pictures are nightmare fuel but even more terrifying art videos now the world war all of these pictures and videos take place is somewhere they'd like to call Wonderland now in this land of nightmares anything is possible and you might notice that a lot of times they're holding what looks like a dead animal and that's cuz it is that's right not only are the instagramers they're taxidermists now for those of you who don't know what taxidermy is it's a lot it's basically an art form where they take dead animals and they freeze them in a lifelike State by removing their insides and putting stuffing inside so now when you look back at the pictures knowing that it's literally a dead animal you mix it in here okay so those pictures probably made you feel very uncomfortable but this next account is going to make you feel even more uncomfortable in a different way we're gonna be talking about the Instagram account baboon vadym is a Russian stuntman who risks a very horrifying death with every post he makes now he started a trend that I'm sure you're aware of called on the roofs now this is a type of photography where people will go to the highest places they can find and take terrifying pictures of their feet dangling just looking at these pictures literally make my sigh shake but if you're a guy you could probably feel your balls like go inside of your body when the staring days I mean in this last one thinking about what would happen if that guy accidentally tripped or if his grip slipped up it's intense I mean these pictures are incredibly risky I mean one slip and it's all now I'm the roofs went supervisor one video that that Amade got 63 million views his friend claimed China's Shanghai Tower which is over two thousand feet just want to clear this [Music] yeah I literally could not watch the whole thing I just ah now of course they made it to the top and they were perfectly fine but it doesn't always end up like that a couple years ago a boy named Connor Cummings went to New York to try and take his in one of the top ten pictures he took an elevator to the top of Four Seasons Hotel him and his friends sneaked onto the room to get some shots here's just a couple pictures that he died when he was at the top now those were the last pictures that Connor ever took because he miscalculated his steps and he fell 52 stories now his camera survived and that's why we have this all right now I'm warning you this next Instagram account is intense and I have to blur a lot of it all of it because this is an account of a human dissector hey guys I'm miss Angela from Instagram that's right missing Jimmy does dissections and post them on Instagram now here's the first one obviously I had to blur all the faces but the caption says cadaver heads set up for educational use yeah those are heads real heads on Instagram uh-huh and then look at this one you can see her digging into somebody's body she posted a picture of a guy's face being peeled off of his skull and then there's just ones like this and this one's caption just says finger versus heavy wood door oh and she even post pictures of severe injuries that are caused by really bad accidents but she does this is kind of like a cautionary for example she'll post a picture of a hand that was exploded because of a firework accident now I can't show you that obviously so I'm gonna show you something very similar she posted a picture of a hand that her friend made who makes props once again this is not real it is a prop so YouTube do not block my video but it looks oh and that's very close to what her Instagram account usually looks like and it usually it's real now sometimes she post like strange deformities or unique like illnesses for example here's a picture she posted of somebody who had an extra finger yeah from far away it looks normal and then when you really look at it you're like oh my god there's six on each hand speaking of hands she also posted a picture of a guy's hand after he got to a huge electricity accident oh oh my god oh oh my god uh-uh now a lot of people think she's exploiting the dead or exploiting illnesses but she says it's all in the name of Education and science and when she shows pictures of bad accidents or fire or accidents she's trying to show you the results of doing something dumb or unsafe because when you see a picture of somebody's and exploded it makes you rethink your choices I mean it's the same reason they show those drunk driving accident videos in school it was still and see something like that makes you really think having a drink which brings us to our next Instagram account we're gonna be talking about a girl named Sophia now when you go through this 16 year-olds Instagram account it seems pretty normal her posing with their friend and a mirror her showing off her makeup and a jewelry or the disturbing part Sophia is her Instagram account remains under the dangers of drinking an Android and Sophia captured her last moments on Instagram now first it looks relatively normal two young girls having fun in a car but then we see a bottle of champagne of his hand and realize where this is going then they swerve off the road and hit a pole and Sophia is killed inst her friend from the mirror selfie that was wearing the pink dress is declared dead moments later in the hospital now when a warranty this clip is very disturbing you don't see anything but just the sound [Applause] here's a picture of what was left or Sophia's car and if you go back in her page you can see her getting into that same exact car having no idea that she retired now I know it gets repetitive and annoying hearing the same thing over and over them don't drink and drive through the driving is bad you'll die but cases like this with this girl who is probably so sweet so great and it's all over because she was drinking and driving and this happens at the time every 51 minutes somebody is killed in a drunk driving accident in the United States alone so please please make sure okay now this last account is something that I have not even looked at like I know about it and I have it here on my computer I have not went through the pictures because I'm scared this is an account called a PI exam have you ever heard of a theater called emetophobia I might be pronouncing that wrong yeah me neither well it's a fear of taking care of your eye cleaning your eye touching your eye getting anything near your eye that would be the fear well this Instagram account I care is meant to trigger you if you have it no I don't know if I have it or not but I have a feeling I do because just the idea I'm just I'm just gonna watch all right first one oh my god that is the worst oh my god alright okay is that even okay is that uh alright let's go another one oh just like the way that the pin is being pushed like it's gonna pop the I uh get out get out Oh what is that what is that that looks like the strips that you test like pee with is that her birth control test what is that I think I'll name it oh yeah let's go but I have it oh my god oh my god Oh what is that what okay that one's not too bad because the razor is not touching the eye but it's still way too close ah that looks relaxing something about that looks good to me like I want to try that go oh I don't want to try that ah why why why I hate this no no next huh you're you purple why why why are you ruining Forks for me oh my god what is that are those like charms it's not like a new jewelry thing I don't I don't get it alright I got a I'm

I'm so fascinated by people and how they live their lives and one of the people that have been most fascinated with is Trisha Paytas so today I'm going to be switching lives with Trish being you is really hard today so I feel like I need to challenge you now so tomorrow and I want you to live a day [Music] Hanabi guys yes today is the big day where Trish is going to be me now yesterday I spent an entire day is Trish and I still have the makeup on my face because it's never coming off I don't know what her morning routine is but it has to involve a damn chisel and a cup of acid because that's what I need for this anyways Trish is on her way and she has no idea what she's truly getting herself into so here's the thing my life is pretty different than what you probably think it is you probably think that I don't shower and I lay around all day and eat Taco Bell and that's only half true my real life is actually kind of a lot so not only do I eat extremely healthy but I also go to the gym every single day and see a trainer and then on top of that I have this YouTube channel which I love but it's a lot of work and then when I get home from all that I try to keep my relationship going with Ryland and he's busy too it's a lot so I'm curious to see what Trish thinks of all of that but the one thing I think Trish is not gonna want to deal with is my animals not only is she terrified of dogs but I think she hates cats and I have both and they're both terrified all right Trish is on her way I'm gonna go shower just kidding that's not what I do actually know what it's a big day let me shower fresh and clean see you think Trish okay so Trish texted me she is one minute away and she wanted to drive but I said I don't drive pooper huh so she's gonna be pulling up in her big black uber oh I think right now oh my god she's coming yeah I told her not to shower so she better not smell good notice the old pizza box empty root beer bottle and empty vodka bottle yep that's

new scary video today we are going you're talking about serial killers but not the traditional serial killers you may think of you know like the men today we are talking about yes good women and I'm sure a lot of you guys know women in your life that could be on this list so we're gonna talk about all the reasons why women are serial killers and why they kill number one they do it better yes men can be stupid but women they're smart and I know a lot of smart women I don't know about you but women on a daily basis creep me out no wonder sir men are so fucking stupid and so fucking dumb I mean it's no wonder women kill them I know I would reason number two is cuz women are like chameleons the killers are like everyday people Christians white upper-class and it's honestly so scary that when you walk down the street you may see a woman who has killed 11 people mangled up in her basement not one is really intense honestly I've had the chills I'm sorry how is just move on to the next that was too dark for me okay and number three when people don't just kill for Satan sex or cheap thrills they kill for money power resources not one of my personal most interesting stories that I was researching is this one Abdullah Fein Laurie she's tell it to almost 90 people thanks just thinking about that 90 people okay so she was a well-to-do socialite in New Orleans one day her server was brushing her hair when she pulled a little too hard minutes later she was thrown from her balcony and she was killed dead on the spot now the craziest part of the story is that because of her status and her socialized she got away with only a 300 dollar flying honestly goals that just goes to show you can get away with anything and honestly that's the creepiest thing alright guys I hope you enjoyed this conspiracy theory video just be careful you never know what's out there and honestly you stay safe guys if you ever feel something weird about even a female your life and you think oh

with five or Jesus it's gonna be glorious let's do it Oh 
a fandom name yeah why don't you just work on this we need to name our sweet fans who have been with us for so long what was your ages was Alliant sleigh gyres sleigh is on his way up yeah lit is gone but so I awaken hey Shug hey what's up you guys yes welcome back to another creepy video now I don't know about you but I think about death a lot when is it gonna happen how is it gonna happen well I see it coming death is all around us and it's inevitable think about it this way since you started watching this video several people around the world have died every single day over a hundred and fifty thousand people died around the world but today we're not going to be talking about an actual death we're gonna be talking about what happens to the bodies afterward now obviously some people are buried some people are cremated but some people's bodies get left in very strange places I mean I'm talking suitcases trash cans I mean there's even been cases where people are being buried like at the cemetery and during the funeral a body part from somebody else in the grave next to them will just pop out I don't even know if I explained that right so just watch the clip Sandra Butler says she didn't think losing her 85 year old father Cleveland Butler could be any more traumatizing than when it was on the day he died of a stroke but then a week ago as she and her family from Brooklyn went to bury him in this picturesque New Jersey Cemetery it got worse something invaded the burial coming out of the dirt of his grave as you see in this photo taken by a relative it's a bear leg on another corpse all right so let's start with death vehicles so as I'm sure you already know there are vehicles that have to transport dead bodies to and from different places and these are just normal vehicles like for example mostly they're just big white vans and just like any other vehicle sometimes there's malfunctions sometimes those malfunctions lead to this some residents say they thought it was a joke but the coroner's office says it was a problem with the Vans back door yeah in 2014 a corner van accidentally dropped a body in the middle of a busy street in Philadelphia cars litter had to swerve out of the way to not hit a dead body uh Monroe County Coroner Bob Allen says there's no state regulation on how to transport a body just that it has to be done in a respectful and secure way now not shockingly this happens quite a lot I mean it happened just a year ago in the middle of a busy street in Cuba and if you do a deep dive into the internet you can find a whole bunch of pictures putties that fell off of ants now this happened so much that it's literally been parodied in like movies and TV shows all the time now luckily in most cases it doesn't end that badly the driver realizes it they turn around to get the body they put it back in the band but sometimes bodies get run over oh I'm sorry I just thought about it it's it's it's a mess all right now speaking of bodies being left in weird places this next one is crazy now I'm just gonna start by saying I love Walmart not as well just Target but I do have love for her but this story makes me a little scared of her because there was a body left in a Walmart parking lot for weeks the Spokane County Sheriff's Office tells me they believe the body of the woman that was found in this parking lot earlier today is a woman that has been missing in Spokane County for at least the last several weeks earlier this afternoon this is what scene looked like how literally how can a body be left in a busy parking lot for weeks and then I did more research and no no it was months that's right the body was left there for three months before somebody discovered it so apparently there was a woman who unfortunately had a drug overdose and died inside of her car now she was parked on the outskirts of the parking lot she had her sun shades down so I guess this one-time thing kind of makes sense but it happens law officials made a horrific discovery overnight in a Walmart parking lot in San Antonio Texas eight people dead in the back of a sweltering truck yeah eight more people dead and that's just the beginning here's another one whose update investigators working to identify a man whose body was found in a south Tulsa Walmart parking lot when officers arrived they found the body inside badly decomposed now that one turned out to be a guy that was living in his car who then died in his car and was there for a month and weirdly a few years earlier something very similar like that happened in Santa Fe Santa Fe County sheriff's deputies found that marine 48 year old Ron stark dead and naked inside a car at the Walmart parking lot those signs that the body had been there for an extended period of time police say as long as a month but even creepier in another Walmart parking lot in Kansas City there was a man and woman found dead together inside of their SUV then there's another story of a body that was found behind a Walmart in New Mexico and it was in horriffic condition we can confirm that the individual was missing their head and other parts of their body police say the man was decapitated and missing his genitalia and if that's not enough for you here's another one now I know you're thinking Shane all of these happen in parking lots so it's not technically Walmart oh well I forgot to tell you about this a woman's body is found inside a Walmart bathroom and if you're wondering she was in that bathroom for three days employees literally put an out of order sign on the stall because it was locked and they just thought maybe it was broken they had no idea that there was a decomposing body inside on the toilet now listen Walmart I'm not trying to drag you but what either way I'm not trying to make jokes and all respect to the families of any of these Walmart victims but oh my god how is this happening okay now this next thing we're going to talk about is almost creepier than Walmart bodies because we're gonna be talking about the remains of a dead person that are put inside of teddy bears hi my name is Teddy Ruxpin yeah a lot of people cremate a body right and turn it into ashes and choose to put them inside of a heavy bear now first of all that sounds like the plot of a very scary movie that I would love to see but it is very real I mean listen the of scattering somebody's ashes in a place that they used to love is really sweet and I love that for me personally I would like my ashes scattered just all over a Taco Bell and some people even go farther and they like turn ashes into jewelry like making diamond necklaces out of a person's body but then it takes it just like one step too far with this teddy bear situation now listen I don't want to make fun of this I think it's sweet but it gives me the chills now here is a kind of scary side effect of this whole situation sometimes these teddy bears end up at thrift stores and then people buy them and then later on realize that there's a dead body inside that's right a 15 year old boy named Joshua Scott and his mom discovered that one of the Bears they bought it at thrift store for their little sister had human remains inside of it another in the process of trying to find out who those remains belong to so they can give him back and then recently in Oregon a mother lost her teddy bear that had her daughter inside of it I mean it's a piece of my daughter that's yeah now she's been going door-to-door even checking dumpsters for the missing bear and she posted a plea on Facebook as well but luckily a few weeks later they found it but this happens surprisingly a lot I mean this gas station owner found one of the Bears that had ashes inside of it at his gas station inside the tummy of this teddy is this a gold container holding what appears to be ashes it looks like a little urn like it's a shiny little gold-plated urn so I guess the moral of that story is if you find a teddy bear anywhere just like investigate before you give it to your child okay so that was kind of funny and light-hearted but this next story is not back in 2013 something happened to a high-school boy named Kendrick Johnson and it all started with him losing a shoe go outside go now there's a dead body out here okay we're answer loud high school old gym how the body in question was dead and it was the body of Kendrick he jumped into the huge fitness matica tissue got stuck and he was unable to breathe Lowndes County Georgia investigators say Kendricks death was a tragic accident that he climbed onto these rolled gym mats to reach for this shoe at the center of one Matt slipped got stucked upside down and died County officials say the blood in this photo spilled after Kendricks heart had stopped pumping hours after he had died after several months of them fighting England back and forth Kendricks parents were certain that this was a murder there's enough evidence to show that Kendra was murdered so they exhumed the body from the grave so that they could do another autopsy now this is where it gets really dark during the second autopsy they discovered that all of Kendricks organs have been taken out and replaced with newspaper so what exactly did the Harrington funeral home do with Kendricks organs and why was he stuffed with old newspaper now the funeral home is stating that Kendricks organs were destroyed by like natural causes so they just discarded them and this is something that does happen and funeral homes tend to stuff bodies full of rice or cotton or things to kind of fill the body out but Kendricks family still believes that there's something going on and that their son was murdered now either way one thing is for sure this was tragic and awful and Kendrick won't be missed and hopefully soon the family will get some closure okay now this next thing I have talked about before but it was like two years ago I think so a lot of you guys might not know about it so I'm gonna go even more in depth this is the mystery the British Columbia this is just the latest twist in this bizarre mystery one that forensic experts have been unable to explain the other three feet were found on Gabriel Island Jedidiah Island and on nearby Valdez Island early on it started with just a few feet but as the years go on hikers in British Columbia Canada found a dismembered foot inside of a running shoe tonight with a mystery unfolding on a BC beach a human foot has once again been discovered 13 feet 13 separate feet have washed up on shore now as the mystery continues feet keep appearing people are making a lot of theories most people believe because a lot of the feet are inside running shoes that it is a serial killer who is targeting people who are running across the bridge we have to be aware that these could be homicide victims well the fear of a foots every killer grips the public imagination investigators turn to science as for now the police have said it is not a serial killer and that there's no evidence if a body has been dismembered with a blade it will leave telltale marks on the bone there are no blade marks now police believe it's because of accidents or suicides where people are jumping into the water or falling into the water and then their bodies dissolve and the shoe rises to the surface and supposedly this happens worldwide it does happen on other coastlines around the world it's not unusual so you might never know exactly what happened but either way or you get into the water check for shoes all right now this next thing involves something that's very close to my heart and that's a Jeep alright so in 2009 a woman went missing in Detroit now the woman was kind of reclusive so nobody was really looking for her or realized she was gone for a while they just knew that her house was abandoned and her car was gone it's been years since anyone living on Savannah saw the woman who owns this home when's the last time anybody saw her about six years ago well then the situation took a very scary turn but today neighbors here in Pontiac found out the owner has been here the whole time inside the garage in the back seat of her Jeep dead but nobody really questioned where she went when she was missing because she was always traveling people just assumed she was gone she was probably there for a couple days then she'd like lead for a week then she'd come back and she's leave for a month and she'd come back but for years and years all she was doing was slowly decaying in her garage the owner has been dead for so many years that our sources say her body was mummified that's right her body was so decayed it had been left in the garage for so long that they couldn't even do an autopsy so her cause of death is still stream so it makes you think did somebody kill her did they know that nobody would be looking for her did they target her specifically because of that because they knew they could get away with it or did she just heart attack and die either way if there's somebody in your neighborhood who kind of keeps to themselves but you don't see them for like I don't know a week please look into it knock on their door because they might be rotting in their car there you guys go hopefully you enjoyed that creepy video and once again I just want to say no disrespect men to the families or anybody that was involved in any of these awful situations I just love talking about dark and twisted stuff and I know you guys like it too all right you guys I'm gonna go make sure to give this video a thumbs up if you want more creepy videos also make sure to subscribe to my channel right down below the notification about because I make new videos every day and if you want to see my last couple creepy videos I've done once about the scariest accounts on Instagram and a video about fangirls who've murdered I'll put a link to both of those in a playlist or at the top of description below so remember whether you're on the road or in a Walmart parking lot or even in your own neighborhood keep her eyes open because you never know when a dead body will appear bye 
hey what's up you guys I am pretty nervous about today's video mainly because it's really close to home so I talk about a lot of dark things on my channel a lot of death a lot of murder because I like that kind of dark twisted stuff and I like hearing the motives for why the killer did it getting in the mind of the killer to see what that's like I mean I've been obsessed with the killers and horror movies and all of that scary stuff since I was like five just for proof my mom recently found this in our closet it's from I think the seventh grade and I made a collage of all my favorite movies and scream is all over it and it is even a picture right here of all the main characters covered in blood holding their guns it's weird that the teachers didn't a question that anyways so I clearly have a fascination with anything dark and I have been obsessed with something for the last six years that I haven't talked about publicly because I felt weird about it but I feel like it's even weirder that I haven't talked about it because every time I talk about a murder on this channel I say oh I can't even imagine why this person did it or what got into them and with this specific case I literally cannot understand why this person did it and what got into them somebody I went to school with for a long time and also somebody that I did consider a friend at the time killed someone and they didn't just kill someone they killed their uncle and they did it in a very intense violent terrifying way that you only hear about in movies and nobody to this day knows the motive so I went to Lakewood High School and I definitely stood out for being a weird kid and the popular kids definitely pointed out that I didn't fit in quite a lot but in sight of the popular group was a boy named Kirk Galvin not only was Kirk popular but Kirk wasn't the typical popular kid he was different for a lot of reasons number one he was always nice to me I mean whenever a popular kid would kind of you know make a joke or laugh at me he would always step in and be like and not only that Kirk had a 4.0 for his entire school career I went to school with him I think from fifth grade to twelfth grade and in that time span he only got A's which is crazy like the smartest kid in school one of the most popular kids in school turned into a murderer all right I'm just gonna say what happened on July 27th 2011 Kirk Galvin murdered his 53 year old uncle he then drove the body to a remote area and attempted to destroy the body by setting it on fire and then he left so this guy that we all knew that was smart and nice to me murdered his uncle and then burned the body which I can't even process and I haven't been able to process this for six years well in court the judge said this no one may ever know for sure what happened or why it happened this is obviously a sad tragic case I wish I could do something to ease your pain so even the judge didn't know what happened nobody knows that the victims cousin said he was a man like no other his heart was as big as his smile he always put others first and another member of the family said Kirk I want you to know I forgive you and I think he would forgive you too because he loved you so much and now he's in jail and nobody knows why he did so I've been looking for answers for a long time I've talked to a lot of people from high school years ago about it I tried to reach out to Kirk's family I even emailed the district attorney it was a part of the case and she said this unfortunately I don't have many answers to give you about why this crime occurred mr. Galvin pled guilty to the crime he did not have a jury trial so we have very little details about the incident or why he chose to do what he did no jury why was there no jury I don't understand and I'm not the only one who's very skeptical and confused by this I was looking on one of the websites that had the story and this comment was there no one person could have accomplished this Kirk doesn't have the strength to fight someone he can't build up enough anger to fight someone the uncle was not murdered by his nephew no motive no cause of death no time no place of death and then he says it would have taken three to four people to get that body out of the apartment across the courtyard and into the vehicle without people noticing was anybody questioned at the apartment complex I mean that is confusing right like how did this happen completely unnoticed but also how did Kirk who's a little guy do all of this and why I mean clearly he says he did it he pled guilty but why what drives somebody to kill somebody who's never done anything that showed his sign of it ever to just snip now this is where it gets really intense for me because I knew Kirk pretty well and I even did a video with him once where well let me back up so I've been making videos since I was a kid I mean ever since I got my hands on a camera which was when I was like nine and a lot of that footage is deleted from the world some of it's still out there I think the oldest one that exists is a video of me at a birthday party is singing and Kelly Clarkson while sucking helium into my mouth [Music] yeah I was not popular but once I entered high school I started doing video projects instead of essays and I even got my teachers and sometimes my principals to be them now I had so many different people in my videos popular kids nerds jocks it became a thing where everybody wanted to be in my weird messed-up videos they didn't want to be friends with me but they wanted to be in my videos well my final video that I made in my senior year at Kirk in it so this video was about dictatorship and what would happen if I turned into a dictator and ruled the school now the video has been copyright strikes so there's no audio but basically here's what happens so me as the dictator tells Kirk you will be the incentives man if one disobeys you and then he says something like beat them up or something and then I say I was thinking more like kill them which is so crazy considering what happened in the future and then in the video he actually killed someone he takes his fingers and then puts it to her neck and then somebody pushes him and she dies and now that guy that same guy is in jail for murder do you see why this fucks with me now I have not talked about this because I feel weird I feel like I don't want to be disrespectful to the family I don't want to bring up bad issues for them but as somebody that knew Kirk as somebody that liked him somebody that had a weird connection with him I just want to know more I want to know if there was a motive or how this happened and I'm not the only one I think a lot of people that grew up with him want to know too and I want to know for the victim's family too I mean aren't they like what the hell like tell us why you did this and who knows maybe the reason he did it was he just went crazy you know a lot of articles are saying oh he just had a mental break and he went crazy but I just feel like that does it I guess I also want to know if there were any signs like how do you avoid this happening again we all thought we knew him so we didn't besides there's a lot there's a lot that I want to know okay I think what I'm gonna do is go on Facebook go to his page and see if I can see any clues or signs and then maybe reach out to people from high school and see if he noticed anything I'll reach out to the family again the family if you're watching please no I'm not like trying to make anybody look bad I just I just want to know more I want to know why somebody that I considered a friend would become a murderer okay let's go on Facebook so I'm just gonna film this and then we can watch YouTube and stuff I got you a princess great thank you okay just back into High School on Facebook I'm gonna need this huh all right here we go I owe $350 what nice to see you again to Facebook okay so first let's go to crooks page I haven't seen Kirk's page in a while the last time I did was like maybe four years ago so I don't even know if it's still up or if somebody took it over I okay whoo that is one of the scariest pictures ever for so many reasons just the fact that you can't see his face is this the last picture he posted February 4th 2011 yeah huh ok so I want to look through more of his pictures because one thing I remember a lot of people saying is like oh I wasn't surprised because he never smiled and was always kind of sad so I'm curious to actually look and see where he was at mentally before it happened let's see him smiling he looks happy like that doesn't look like a sociopath to me I mean all of these pictures are he seems to be having fun I don't that's the thing that's confusing to me I feel like if he slowly fell into some kind of dark deep depression or something that would make him be able to kill someone wouldn't there be pictures to show that although I guess people only post pictures of smiling cuz that's the Internet so maybe he was actually I don't know I mean he had a more interesting social life than I did he's partying up all over the place okay that one's a little dark so that's in 2008 interesting I'm kind of surprised to see this type of picture cuz like the guy who I knew in high school was shy and like not a shirtless selfie kind of guy so I guess I know I guess I didn't know him as well as I thought I did not say all right well let's see if there's any like anything on his page that could give any hints about anything about I think nothing nothing no literally nothing that's a little scary likes okay we have some likes making people smile this is like like I knew this was gonna feel weird and be kind of dark and I didn't really think it through I'm feeling really weird dancing developmentally disabled sports fun like he liked charity work I'm just so confused past events and what are these birthday parties concerts and engagement like that's why I'm even more confused by this I just okay so I think what I want to do now is I want to message some people from high school specifically people that I saw in his pictures people who I know were close to him and I want to see if they know anything now I've talked to a couple people about this a few years ago and everybody was in the same place like everybody wanted to know more they didn't get the full story so I feel a little weird about messaging people but okay so this guy was his best friend and was in one of his last pictures and I know this guy very well I mean I was in his class early years okay hey man okay I'm not good at Facebook I know it's been many years and you might not even remember me but we went to school together I was looking into the Kirk Galvin case and I wanted to know more about what happened okay I also sent another message to saying I know it's sensitive and I understand if you don't want to talk about it I'll see scent all right so I'm gonna send a message to ten different people the one I really want to talk to you is one of my best friends from high school her name is Megan we did videos together we were very close and I even talked to her about this and she was in his class - so I also just haven't talked to her in a long time in general and like I just kind of want to like break the ice hold on let me do a little stocking first oh my god I love her so much wait what no I'm not like that oh man but I do love her that's her mom oh my god her mom's name is Patricia and I called her patty-cakes her mom was so supportive of everything I did and loved the videos that we would make home the dog oh my god her standing in front of the Long Beach sign that's everything that's very gruff oh man okay that's my sister hey is that too much okay super random but do you know any info about the Kirk Calvin case like anything that wasn't in the news already how are you oh my god this is why I can't keep friends on send it alright I am going to let this sit overnight and then morning we'll see if anybody wrote back okay see the Hardy okay so it is four o'clock in the morning and I went up to go pee and then I looked at my phone and I had like a lot of missed messages and I couldn't go back to sleep because I was like I don't know what everybody said Rylands back let's leave back there but he can sleep through anything but who know is very annoyed oh my god let's do this okay so I'm not gonna say any names or show pictures of who I'm talking to but the first person that brought me back was one of my really good friends alright let's see what she said hi so not super random I thought the entire situation was crazy he killed his uncle set him on fire and buried him after driving over an hour with him in the car what the fuck never heard anything more other than that he's in prison but for how long I feel like I tried to Google it after I heard but found nothing you see this is why I'm doing this video not like it's not just for me everybody that grew up in this neighborhood feels the same way it feels like we don't have any information so it's nice to I feel like I'm not alone of that okay I'm alright her back in a minute alright so this next one is from another girl who I wasn't that close with but she was close to her pretty close to group I Shane I'm doing pretty decent too hope you are too honestly we're on the same page I was in England when it happened and I didn't really talk to him too much after high school I almost made a plan with somebody to visit him in Santa Barbara but didn't end up going visiting him it you thought about them we'll get to that idea later from what I know he got into drugs and ended up stabbing his uncle and driving his body to Santa Barbara equally shocking to me and don't entirely understand what led to it okay so same boat okay this next one is from another girl he was pretty close to what's up dude Kirk hated his uncle hated him that's what I remember and I talked about it a few years ago I'm pretty sure they said so what she just said I'm going to not put in the video cuz it's touchy and I feel like that's overstepping a boundary so I'm not gonna put in what she said out of respect for his family he's not a lot to defend herself and he was the one that was murdered so like not go there but let me read what she said after that I saw him out on Second Street a few days after he killed his uncle during holidays he was totally normal but that's my thoughts on it I don't remember reading about drugs he smoked weed and drink that's all I know she saw him a few days after that's crazy like killing your uncle and then a couple days later hanging out at a bar laughing and smiling like that's so that's the most information we've gotten so far Megan oh shoot now I don't it didn't totally shock me though I know it sounds weird since it was murder but that guy wore and dressed the same from sixth grade to 12th grade looking back I don't remember him and ever having a genuine smile just seems like psychopathic tendencies maybe that's a stretch but I just wasn't shocked when I looked back on who he was as a person who she's the only person so far that said she wasn't surprised oh my god she also sent me a picture oh my god that's us at prom I mean we didn't go together but I mean I wanted to but oh my god ooh that's a lot oh my god she also sent me a link she said remember this oh my god [Music] first of all the making out hold on let me go back this real-ass making out literally didn't even touch faces oh my hair there's a lot happening right now oh my god that was so cute the funny thing is I remember we were filming that I had a crush on her and I remember being like so nervous to make out with her we literally didn't even touch hair okay so I wrote back to her just saying like hahaha that video is terrible but also asked more about Kirk she said find out motivation because I'd like to know what drives someone to kill their uncle maybe it's been long enough his family would be willing to participate you know what okay I was already planning on asking somebody from high school to like be in my video so I could interview them about everything I kind of feel like she's the perfect choice because she's the only person that said she was a surprise that he murdered but also I just miss her a lot I don't hang out with her so I'm gonna ask her if she wants to be in my video she said sure oh my god okay so I think do is I'm going to write all these people back I think I'm gonna have her meet me at my old high school and oh my god this just gave me a lot of anxiety I don't know maybe going back to Long Beach will actually help maybe I'll ask more people in the area and what they think or if they know anything else I just want to talk to more people about it who feel as annoyed and aggravated as I do and once again I always say this but no disrespect is written toward the family of the victim or the family of Kirk I I just want to know and everybody else does too from the messages alright I guess I'm going back to high school I'm about to tract in Long Beach where I grew up and I'm gonna go hang out with one of my best friends from high school no I did have a crush on her when I was younger is that gonna bother you wait really we're gonna hang out and talk and stuff and then oh we're gonna talk about murder wait that's where we shot a video look Kirk right there so when I misses you you said you weren't surprised there are some odd here lately so I thought this would be the perfect time and see what your reactions might have had a crush on you [Music] 
oh my god oh my god running if it goes for God okay doing good you're like yes would you feel like guys guess what I know what do you know what wait what wait you know I'm on the couch watching Wendy

[Music] [Applause] warning what you are about to watch may make you question everything you thought you know viewer discretion is advised hey what's up you guys welcome back now today we're gonna be talking about a lot of different types of conspiracy theories we're gonna be talking about cardi B and some possible connections to NPM and we're even gonna be going out into the world and exploring a conspiracy involving one of my favorite places ever target now before we get started I just have to mention that all of these are theories none of them are facts and they're not meant to hurt any company or a person alright let's get started now I know you're thinking Shane how is there a conspiracy theory about mattress stores well I'm gonna let you know that this is one of the most convincing theories I have ever heard and this is also why how to do that legal statement at the beginning of this video now if you look around your city you've probably noticed how many mattress stores there are when you go to Google and you type in why are there one of the first results is so many mattress stores and you've probably noticed when you walk by them there's nobody inside now one of the mattress stores that you see most frequently is called mattress Verne well just check out this theory that was posted on Reddit mattress firm is some sort of giant money-laundering scheme they are fucking everywhere and always empty I remember seeing for mattress firms all on each corner of an intersection once there is no way there's such a demand for mattresses and then they posted a Google Maps link and it was insane yeah twenty results for mattress firms all in the same location some of them are literally across the street from each other now the way I found out about this conspiracy was actually through my cameraman and friend Andrew he told me a couple years ago he was visiting his hometown and he noticed that there were three mattress firms on the same street so I decided to pull up Google Maps and check it out myself all right Mattress Firm near Algonquin boom three on the same street now just to show you how close they are to each other let's look at the satellite view all right here's the first door now we're just gonna go up the street two clicks and then two there's the second one I mean that's crazy and he's not the only person that has noticed this there are tons of videos of people driving around their city showing how close and how many mattress firms there are I need a mattress there's a store I need a mattress there's a nother store it's a good day to buy a mattress so I got mattress stores everywhere to choose from I need a mattress hey it's another store now the reddit theory said that mattress stores might actually be laundering money and that's why there's so many of them all right so first let's talk about money laundering and what that means so if you get money through doing illegal things like selling drugs or guns or terrorism or prostituting you make a lot of money that you don't want traced you don't want the cops to find out what you're doing you don't want to get taxed on it so you have to find a way to hide the money and sometimes you can do that by buying a business for example years ago Al Capone one of the biggest gangsters of all time decided to put all of his illegal money he made into laundromats now laundromats are a cash flow business right people come in they pay with cash they give their quarters they do their laundry they leave well that way he could say oh wow we got $10,000 today from people doing their laundry let's put that in the books okay great when in reality no they probably made $1,000 and that is where the name of laundering came from from the word laundry pass so the theory is that mattress stores might be the new laundrymat think about it this way you only buy mattresses once every 7 to 10 years so why are there more mattress stores on one street than there are grocery stores or Starbucks there is another mattress firm I kid you not there is two mattress firms in the same basic complex folks also there's no customers ever inside of the stores because the stores aren't real they're just a cover-up once again just a theory not a fact don't sue me now when people are laundering money in banks they usually separated to $10,000 chunks and then they'll put it in a bunch of different banks so when you think about the mattress stores it would kind of make sense why there was three on the same street because maybe they're all owned by the same person and he's spreading his money out 3 different ways so he doesn't look so suspicious oh and just a side note another way to hide money that you've gotten illegally is by hiding it in different places in your house well guess what the number-one place to hide money is mattresses I'm just saying it's a weird coincidence but now that you know this I bet when you drive around your city you'll notice the crazy amount of mattress doors and the crazy amount of no customers in sight of them another mattress firm what is going on it's an infestation car DB has blown up this year she's become one of the most famous people in the world and it happened very fast her hit song boat at yellow only came out in June of last year but she's already nominated for Grammys on every single magazine cover and one of the most famous rappers ever now this clip I'm going to show you I didn't take seriously at all but the more I watched it the more weird it seemed this is her being interviewed on a red carpet and then this happens Finnick being so nervous a little bit over well after little shaky oh no no zombie no nobody's good it's good it's good it's good you're gonna get it look great weird right like maybe she was just joking or something but isn't it weird that she went to that hypnotic trance and then when she came out of it she didn't even reference it like she didn't laugh or say like haha sorry that was a joke just watch it again it's weird right like the more you watch it the more you're like but now this got a lot of people saying that there might be some ties with her you know menotti or maybe she's under mind control I mean she did become extremely famous very fast which the Illuminati attends to be able to make happen well first there's a video of her from before she got really famous where she said this I know my family by man Illuminati which one of my cousin you want for that did he well then she posted a video on her Instagram where she was doing the devil horn with her hand [Music] and then there's tons of other pictures out there of her doing the devil horn or her doing the 666 by her eye in this video she's singing something in Spanish and you can clearly hear her say the word witch mckinnon bad I don't know why okay Mucha mckinnon bad pero no way okay Nadine and again Michael Illuminati well that was on March 10th 2016 and then one year later in June of 2017 Oh Dec yellow came out and became one of the biggest hits of all time now cardi has talked about the Illuminati a lot throughout her career but Illuminati but one thing she said during a live stream was pretty scary if something happened to me just note that the government try to kill me because I believe that America be trying to kill you she basically said that when her parents turned 60 she's gonna move them out of the US and send them to the Dominican Republic I want to move my parents out of America like let me tell you something like my grandmother for my mother's death sigh she died when she was 75 because she used to live here in America if you go to the island country people be a hundred and five years old a hundred and some six years old so she's basically saying that the u.s. is trying to kill you sooner now her reasoning is the food industry she thinks that organic food is a Jill how to lettuce and how to fruits last so long out here how how does a travel from places to places and last so long I don't give a fuck if they say that the chicken and the food is organic I don't believe it's organic like I don't believe nothing here is organic I feel like they trying to kill you I mean she's not wrong the amount of preservatives that we're getting on our food the amount of chemicals that they're putting in the air right over our heads it's not a surprise that people in the US die sooner than people outside so like my grandmother was she was diabetic right like they used to go for 10 to 12 pills a day how is that normal so that's why I feel like this country just just they be wanting to kill people so many things that I just don't be understand and I'm and I'm realizing he now I got this email from a viewer named Julie she said what if these famous people aren't cloned but they're hypnotized I mean the Illuminati could completely control what they said and did and then she went on to talk about the movie get out we're all those people in the movie were being hypnotized and controlled and they'd have moments of snapping out of it the chores have become my sanctuary who's controlling it well if you look back at that clip of her on the red carpet you look behind her you see two women and a man who are not looking that way but when she starts to glitch look over and then card he comes back to normal it's weird I mean listen I don't know who those people are they might not even know her but it's not that crazy to think about the fact that there might be somebody around a celebrity at all times to keep them in they're hypnotized zone I mean celebrities always have an assistant and an agent and a chauffeur what if the purpose for that Posse is to keep them under hypnosis then what if one of the celebrities goes rogue and they break out of their hypnosis and they've been so long being a puppet that they don't even know who they are anymore and then they act out and if you think about it that seems to happen quite a lot especially two extremely famous musicians and all of a sudden Britney Spears came in and said in my turn said I want to shave my hair off she had no emotions in her face so the way I found out about this theory was super random one morning I was watching a youtuber named Alicia Marie and she was vlogging her day and then this happened duh-duh-dunnnnn 12:13 p.m. guys I really need to change my background it's still Christmas themed sweet oh my god wait do you see that what is that is someone recording me wait on camera you see that like blinking thing I don't see that in person at all what yeah weird right I had never heard of anybody saying that they noticed the blinking red light on their phone well then after that I started looking into it and it's like more than iPhone Nexus now of course the theory is that that light means that it is recording you at all times but then some people are saying no no that's just the face idea and it's always on because it's looking for your face and that makes sense it does look to be making a cylinder shape around your face and it's not just one way this is what it looks like in the dark when you use your face idea thousands of little dots going all around you coming from that one little light okay so theories over right it's just the base ID light but then I saw this so this is the iPhone and I'm guessing you guys thought that they're flashing red light up there it has to be the camera huh like that doesn't make any sense the iPhone 7 does not have a face ID why is there still the red blinking light that's hidden I mean we pretty much already know that our iPhone is recording everything we're saying do you record and store everything I say and texts on my phone I'm sorry but who would have thought it would be recording everything it seems so of course they started having a full mental breakdown and panic attack and then I saw a user on reddit say this that's the proximity sensor it's how the phone knows you're holding it up to your face when you're on a phone call so it can black out the screen and prevent your cheek from pressing buttons it uses infrared which is the reason your camera can see it but your eyes can't and then they went on to say that you can also see this blinking red light in your remote controls you can't see a middle life but you can only see it with phones cameras which makes a lot of sense because your remote control is based on a sensory so this theory might not be true but I still believe that my phone is recording everything I'm saying and doing after what Apple did with admitting that they purposely slow down our old phones I don't trust in anything Suri would you lie to me I'd rather not say now we have talked about 9/11 conspiracy theories before 9/11 theories are what got me into conspiracies oh and it's not just me a huge percentage of the population believes these theories too I mean even President Bush has slipped up a few times and almost said the word conspiracy himself mr. president I would do want to get right to the news of the terrorism in Boston well at first you know I was deeply concerned that there might have been a organized plot this could have been you know another organized highly organized attack on the country like why would he even think to say that word you know another conservative now one of the biggest theories is that it wasn't just planes flying into the buildings that there was bombs planted as well but of course the government said no no it was just the two terrorists in the planes but some people think that Bush and the government actually coordinated it themselves and that there were bombs placed in the building beforehand because they wanted both buildings to come down the building has collapsed that tower just came down now of course the theory is that the government created this awful disaster so that we would be okay with going to war with Afghanistan but today we're gonna be focusing on the boss the day that 9/11 happened everybody was saying that they heard the ladies that are with me were in the World Trade Center on the on in the first building and escaped through the lobby where they report they believed there was a bomb in the lobby and as we were coming out we passed the lobby didn't see no Lobby but I believe that the bomb hit the lobby first even firemen set it even Donald Trump who had a lot of power in New York at the time said he thought it was bombs I happen to think that they had not only a plane but they had bombs that exploded almost simultaneously now this is where it gets crazy one of the survivors from 9/11 was a janitor at the World Trade Center his name was William Rodriguez and he had worked there for twenty years now he came out and said that he'd heard bombs before the plane even hit I believe that censorship started from the very beginning because when I was telling my story they told me I'll cut this out cut this out it was the first hijacked plane no hello that was an explosion before 9/11 before the plane hit the tower now in 2004 that powers in charge came out and said that there were no bombs well just listen to this audio clip and tell me that you don't hear a bomb going off before the building's collapse come on that's a bomb you could see explosions coming out of the sides of the buildings but of course the government says no now this is where it gets really crazy but somehow seems believable some people believe there were no planes at all and that it was just bombs and that all the clips that we saw in the news of planes flying into the towers or CGI I know it's crazy but just look at some of these videos the airplane did disappear like a bad special effect exactly like a bad special effect a good special effect would have parts exploding and bouncing off and tumbling to the streets below first let's look at this clip of what people are calling ghost plane the plane appears to pass through steel columns and the steel and concrete floors like a ghost it doesn't twist Bend slowdown break or explode now this plane goes right through the building like a knife through butter and I know what you're thinking Shane yeah it's a plane going really fast of course it'll go right through well years before this happened the government was testing to see what would happen if they flew a plane into a big metal wall and it was at the speed of which a normal plane flies and this happened it's doing 500 miles an hour it just disappeared into dust the plane disintegrated disappeared but then when it hit the World Trade Center it went right through no issues but how could a plane even a point even a 767 or 747 or whatever I buy the bit how could it possibly go through this now look at this angle you'll see the plane flying through the building and then you'll see the nose of the plane come out the other side okay you saw that right the big nose of the plane come right through the other side completely in one side and out the other it's physically impossible for the nose of a Boeing 767 airplane to emerge intact well after the smoke cleared it was seen that there was no exit hole that's right no exit hole where the nose of the plane supposedly went right through it nothing and that's why a lot of people think that it might have been CGI and this is the other weird part in most of the clips that are online it goes black for a split second right when the plane hits well this person took all of the news clips and sync them together at the same time and this happened yeah all of them black for a split second not to mention that on some news channels you didn't even see a plane you just saw the moment of the explosion right afterward and the one second that would show the fate of Pinocchio's nose has been edited out why would the now day brothers remove that little piece of video it didn't show the moment of the plane actually hitting it like would go somewhere else or it would cut off or something maybe that's because there was no planes and it was just bombs not to mention another clip that was circulating that was on the news where you can literally see one of the wee of the plains disappear [Music] just disappear glitch now listen I don't know if I believe the theory that all the planes on the news were just CGI - that seems a little far-fetched but I definitely believe there were bombs I mean come on so who are you gonna please the government who lies to you about everything or people who are literally there okay this is my favorite theory of all time and I a hundred percent believe in it have you ever been into a store and you tried on an outfit and you looked in the dressing room mirror and you thought wow I look great I'll buy it and then you took it home and you put it on you said ooh yeah that might have to do with the mirrors in the dressing rooms now on the show shark tank there was a company called skinny mirror and if you go to their website it says this the skinny mirror off errs a subtle and believable slimming reflection 5 to 10 pounds and then they show comparison pictures of what you look like versus what you look like in the skinny mirror oh and by the way there his slogan is you are beautiful what they also have a section on their website where retail stores can buy mirrors from them the skinny mare is an ideal solution for dressing rooms the subtle yet believable slimming reflection will improve the attitude of your customers self-image body image increasing overall sales so that's not even a theory some stores might possibly have them but here's where my theory comes in I love Target I buy everything from Target but I look so much better in target dressing room ears and it makes me buy clothes and then I take them home and I hate the way they look so I want to go to Target and investigate and see if they're using and skinny mirrors okay yeah so we're in the car on our way to Target you have no idea what we're doing right no no I thought we were going to talk about we'll do that after touch it we also have in the back seat Rylands sister Morgan how do you feel good well we're gonna go in the dressing room and take pictures in our clothes and I go back home and take pictures of the normal mirror all right believable slimming reflections designed to help you feel good about your body [Music] ah let's do my least favorite thing in the world let's go look at some mirrors there it is oh my god me when I see the fitting room just never tell like I'm trying on this this is a plus-sized Karl shirt no obviously we're not even taking the picture here I can tell you that I am NOT this then oh my god [Music] ooh I need to take it at the same exact well that I'm gonna take it okay so right here so when it I was afraid you want to take one - you're gonna do like a psycho - oh yeah take one in this nightmare - oh this worse let me just see if I can I can't tell alright let's go home and take the same pictures and see if we look fatter all right you ready to go to the mirror alright let's go to the one upstairs maybe can you have this straight oh my god that's crazy it's like in the arms it's like that's the trigger oh my god my legs look so much smaller in the target one it is drastically different ever like if we zoom in movie shirt now listen this could be like a lighting situation yeah either they have bomb lighting or skinny-ass mirrors alright here's the next one my legs look so much smaller in the target wanna alright now let's do you you ready oh my god liking this one oh boy would be like yes and this one would be like oh my god Viper's is real life okay so let's go to the other one oh my gosh I look like I could have like a thigh gap in this one it's not like so drastic that it's insane he's 5 to 10 pounds that's what the skinny mirrors say 5 to 10 pounds I don't think target says they use skinny mirrors because I think legally they have to was the objects in mirror seems smaller than them here social media oh well mystery solved but still just a theory not a fact don't see any target I love you okay bye yeah the tide pot challenge something that has been going so viral lately and I just didn't know why many are looking to become what's called YouTube famous but a local doctor says this could cost you your life now this became such a huge story that tide even put out a bunch of statements on Twitter about it and they even made a PSA saying don't eat iPods the tie pot challenge was everywhere you would think that hundreds and thousands of people were dying every day for meeting Tide Pods but then when you actually look at it the numbers have gone down and you can see in 2017 there were 12,000 calls that's down a thousand from the year before that also to put in perspective over 20,000 people called because they accidentally ingested hand sanitizer 17,000 people called because they ingested too much toothpaste and 16,000 people called because they ate too much deodorant so in the grand scheme of things people eating Tide Pods isn't as crazy and widespread as the news is making it but Tide Pods sales have actually gone up the more people talking about Tide Pods the more people behind them so what if Tide hired a marketing campaign get our name out there more to teenagers and the marketing team said ooh teenagers love youtube they love challenges what if we created the tide pot challenge obviously nobody would really do it but it could become like a meme teenagers love memes and if that happened it worked I haven't thought about type odds at all ever and now it's literally in my brain I hear the word tide pot five million times a day but the even bigger theory is one of the most fucked up things I have ever heard and definitely the most fucked up theory I have ever said on my channel so if you've ever been to the dollar store you've probably seen a bottle for fabuloso and if you look at it it looks just like juice or Gatorade but it's not it's cleaner but a lot of people have mistaken it for juice and it's ended very bad ways now it's a reasonable mistake to make especially when some stores are putting it next to juice yeah that's literally fabuloso the cleaner right next to juice and this isn't the only toxic thing in stores that looks edible look at this picture a floor cleaner looks like a bottle of lemonade or this window cleaner that literally looks like a bottle of blue soda and then this one yep looks just like juice there's even this product for your hair that literally says whipped cream or this cleaner that is called lemonade or this picture of insects brain or this picture or these energy shots that are not energy shots and this is the craziest one this is hair bleach that's hair bleach it looks like cereal for kids and that's where the conspiracy comes in overpopulation is a huge problem maybe it's all just an extreme form of population control thousands of people every year dying from accidentally ingesting things they shouldn't nobody can get sued because right on the box it says do not ingest even though the bottle looks like children's juice and it's not just food there's other little things out in the world that if you're not observant enough you could die from why else would this hand sanitizer be installed here or why would this water fountain be right next to an outlet I don't know maybe the type out challenge is a challenge maybe it's a challenge for the government and maybe if you fail it they didn't want you here I believe that America be

Bobby burns that is being a bully the BBB oh my god in a splatter it's got bells on I made it this day as possible hi what do you think Jane holy crap that was everything hello sit on the couch obviously come for a second oh this is so good okay mr. Bobby burn oh so you were being kind of a bully yeah I don't think so you're good to think his contents terrible yeah because we all have an opinion what I will say you might want to leave out things like dumb yeah because that kind of insults me is his mother yeah sorry I do not mean to insult you one things to be fair in the video I didn't say he was dumb I said he looked dumb in that video now that he was done I would not have just said any person is dumb unless I actually thought they were though I'm still just tripping curry I was like already for Garrett uh-huh I fought in the beer so I have a coffee maker or we've got flavored coffee we did not see him come NT - I thought we hated him you already love him no well no because he apologized and I'm all good with that and then he said he didn't call you dumb which as a mother all right he has a right to not like your content no he doesn't it's good quality I'm your mother I think it's brilliant but he has a right not it all right well let's go get my drink then let's give you joy I need this definitely she is kind of you I know yeah you're a good-looking kid thank you very much 20 but my point is you're a good-looking obviously creative young man so I hope you do a little more than just that yeah no I I do you have some great bone structure what is she what is this so you were telling me something in the car that I thought was interesting watching chains videos since probably since I was like 12 or so I've been like super excited to meet you it's like really cool when you see a video like that if I would have just shown you that you in a million will fuck that guy right but then meeting them in person and hearing them out it makes I think I think if he wouldn't have been so respectful towards me then you would have seen yeah totally how that you were respectful and then I'm gonna go k-50 a lot of that stuff I mean it is the persona that you put on like you have like your character that you do when you're on camera so like yeah cuz yours we didn't bring this up earlier so you were so angry yeah and I was just like there's no way this kids as angry no no no it's so like for that video I listen to music before hand that did push-ups did a bunch of stuff to get amped up before I shot I can't relate yeah you're getting oh my god just got the best idea ever yeah okay we'll do this later there we go we should have you teach my mom how to do an intense angry critical video and then you can do it in front of all of us later like an audience oh hey honey I scare people okay help makes you mad who makes you mad right now who makes me mad let me think celebrities I'm trying to think of like enews okay I will say this I was like the number one Bravo fan uh-huh I was don't talk about it no keep going Peter it's tea honey okay Andy Cohen was like a son from another husband or whatever but when I saw him do what he did with TMZ to Kathy Griffin mm-hmm have you I told to Kathy atoll in the meantime whoo Kathy Griffin when you care about somebody you don't say whoo-hoo Kathy Griffin I don't know her like he was like I don't know that person I may not agree with everything Kathy says sometimes okay but I love her yeah yes yeah I don't like that fucking engine today part for confronting an you Colin oh I don't think it would be good for my heart you're gonna be Sasha you start with a disclaimer and we'll say dear Andy its lol joke and then you'll fucking end here I don't know something for you because you loved it this is my brother and this is my girlfriends nice to meet you they helped him make that video yeah there they helped me write it so I need to talk to them too did she draw blood no no we got we drink tea together oh yeah and then she complimented his bone structure so the plan is my mom is going to learn how to make a critical angry video about Andy Cohen because she's mad at him what she's gonna perform it for us Andy come on so handsome how could you be mad at him he did this Kathy Griffin and I didn't like them oh okay well now that I have had seven panic attacks let's get some food I'm kinda nervous like I know you uber everywhere are you sure you can drive I'll be okay we're fine we're fine we're alive why are you driving honey because I want my hater to see me as a real down-to-earth guy who can drive a car who can drive I'm normal I'm

I had a good feeling about Bobby when I saw his video about me even though it was like kind of shit talking I just had a feeling I was gonna connect with him I don't know what the point of this whole thing was definitely didn't have one it wasn't like I was trying to say oh when people don't like you online you should force them to be friends with you that's not what I was trying to do but I am happy that I didn't just watch his video and get mad about it and it's subtweet about it and then move on I'm happy that I actually got to know him as person and took what he was saying as criticism instead of hate because after hanging out with him today even more so made me realize like I love working with people I love making bigger videos I love finding new talented great people and making something with them and I can't believe that I literally had fun making something with somebody that made a hate video about me it's so weird but kind of Awesome wow it is really weird though to now consider him a friend cuz I do and I feel like we're gonna make more stuff together and I'm excited about it and once again this was not faked this was not staged it genuinely went really well and I was not expecting it to go that well and I don't know I'm just feeling good about it so I believe in him and I think he's really talented and I think a lot of you guys would love his videos especially

my car sorry the Coyotes back he's probably ripping the head off a gopher oh wow he literally it is oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god have a present for you we really lose it or is this gonna be a gag no no 
guys we just did a podcast with Sierra green and she is asked Erik tur at Universal and she plays a monster and told us all the inside T about what it's like to be in there it was crazy and I loved it I'll give you a hint it's spooky it's spooky not spooky hey what's up you guys yes welcome back to another conspiracy theory video now 2017 has been a year of some of the craziest conspiracy theories of all time but today we're gonna be focusing more on the creepy ones and we're gonna start with the theory that the iPhone might be examining your news now recently the iPhone X came out and of course there were so many theories about it most of which involved the very scary face idea it projects and analyzes more than 30,000 invisible dots on your face to create a very very very precise map oh no no I do not like that but what I'm about to talk about isn't even regarding the iPhone X this is something that's probably happening with whatever generation iPhone you have so recently this tweet went viral attention all girls all girls go to your photos and type in brassiere why are Apple saving these and made it a folder and then a bunch of shaft faces so then people took out their phones went to their photo albums and searched bra and it was true a category called brassiere popped up on everyone's phones and then people started screenshotting their brassiere albums and posting them online I mean this girl posted hers and there were tons of pictures of her having sex and changing and then this girl posted hers and there are once again pictures of her changing and being in a bra so this wasn't even a theory this is real your iPhone is saving every picture you have that shows your bra so of course people started freaking out because they're like why is this an option why is the iPhone saving my bra pictures well then Apple came out and said hey no no no it's not just bra it's a bunch of words iOS is designed to take advantage of the powerful processor built into every iPhone so when you search your photos for instance all the face recognition and scene and object detection are done completely on your device so basically what that means is you can search a lot of different words and your iPhone will categorize all the photos so then I went to my phone and I decided to try it out I don't have any broad pictures so I just started with the letter A and then boom all these categories popped up apparel los angeles animal apparatus what august april alehouses and on and on so here's where it gets weird so I started doing every letter of the alphabet cuz I was just curious what was gonna pop up I can't believe I'm gonna show you this I'm gonna blur it I put in the letter P and the only category was pig and then when I clicked on the pig album it was my noon I literally saw my naked body and said Pig oh my god I just snorted maybe Ethel's right listen all I'm saying is this whole thing is creepy the fact that your phone can go through all of your pictures and detect every single item inside of it and also for the pig thing you've done for that Apple all right now this next theory is in the same vein as the last one but almost creepier and that is the theory that Facebook is listening to you so everybody knows that when you go on Facebook there's gonna be a bunch of ads and the ads are usually related to things you search or Google or buy on Amazon but then sometimes an ad will pop up that you've never searched for but you've just kind of talked about so because this was happening so often to people this one couple decided to do an experiment they decided that they were going to leave their Facebook open on their phone and talk out loud about buying cat food so we're gonna do a test here and all day we're gonna talk about cat food we don't have any cats we never search for cats especially cat food let's find out so then they just started randomly talking about cat food all day around there for cat food cuz I could use some cat food well the cat is almost out of food so we might need some cat food we should buy some cop and then guess what happened two days later and there you have it cat food so I guess Facebook does listen oh by the way this came in two days later I think how how does that happen why does that happen have they hacked to your microphone have they hacked everything now of course after this one viral and everybody started freaking out about it somebody at Facebook said this I run ads product at Facebook we don't and have never used your microphone for ads just not true I don't know listen I don't believe him yeah but who knows maybe he's not mine either way I'm definitely going to do an experiment in a future video and see if it works okay now this next theory we're going to talk about involves one of the craziest things I've ever seen on TV that's right Wendy Williams passing out [Applause] so it was a lot of fun let's get started our first caress I know literally one of the scariest things I've ever seen I couldn't believe that people were like making jokes and laughing about it right away when I saw it I was terrified first of all let's talk about how it looked first she gets this look on her face like she's terrified it was almost like something inside of her head snapped then she goes to touch the sign of her head right before she crashes to the ground now Wendy and her people are claiming that she was just dehydrated apparently I was dehydrated according to paramedics and instead of drinking regular water I had electrolyte drinks and then you know I went to my own doctors and I'm fine and then what people were saying then why were you touching your head like it hurt she said she was trying to hold up her crown so so for people watching when they saw me you know put my head my hand up it's because I'm trying to make sure my crown is there now of course a lot of people online are saying wow this is like a metaphor Wendy Williams fainting while dressed as the Statue of Liberty is the perfect metaphor for 2017 and of course a lot of people are saying oh it was an Illuminati thing or she was a clone and then she got turned off before the most part a lot of people are saying that it seemed they now one of the main reasons people think it looks fake is because her eyes never closed or rolled back into her head which is what happens when you pass out and if you look at its side by side with somebody who's actually passing out from dehydration it's different one of them has their eyes rolled back in their heads so why would it have been fake why would they have planned this this is where it gets every single time a big event happens they say that the Kardashians Bruce Jenner became Caitlyn when a really crazy shooting just happened now this youtuber goes on to mention of all the other crazy things that have happened in pop culture that seemed to distract us from things that were happening in the world I mean we've talked about it before people genuinely think that Britney Spears was hired by the George Bush administration to do crazy things to distract us from what was going on in the White House so basically any time George Bush and his people would fuck up or do something wrong Britney Spears would go crazy and shave her head and then everybody would be focusing on that rather than what was actually going on in the world and then after she shaved her head and started wearing a wig she would start publicly saying things about George Bush like this honestly I think we should just trust our president in every decision that he makes and we should just support that you know and and be faithful and what happens do you trust this president yes I did now clearly it wouldn't be crazy to think that they're working together well then that youtuber goes on to remind us what happened at the same time as Wendy's passing out Wendy Williams passed out on her show the day the Manhattan shooting the terrorist attack yeah Wendy passed out literally at the same time that there was a very awful terrorist attack in New York it just kind of makes sense and Wendy Williams all of a sudden just fainted on this specific day when something happened so most people that would be watching TV and stuff pay attention to the news know they're gonna go watch and see what the Cap'n what did she look like when she fainted now listen I know this is intense but she's not wrong I mean that entire day the number one a trending topic and Twitter moment was not the shooting in New York it was Wendy Williams and why did she pass out on live TV seriously every single Twitter moment was about Wendy Williams I mean people stopped talking about that New York terrorist attack in like two seconds which is crazy oh but don't worry we got 24/7 news coverage of Wendy Williams and why she passed out so was that a distraction was that planned I don't personally think so but I mean it definitely looks sketchy okay let's lighten it up for a second and talk about something was stupid now we even talked about poppy in a while but I have been getting so many people requesting me to bring this up a clip surface of poppy back in 2015 on the Disney show Jessie and she did not look like poppy I know we'd like to see her not like huh but just like a normal girl in the background with a normal girl haircut and a normal girl face weirds me out well even weirder supposedly poppy is friends with Debbie Ryan who was the star of Jesse there's even a video of them like hanging out while poppy is making videos so then it makes you think Debbie Ryan Disney Channel Disney Channel evil Illuminati poppy Illuminati evil what if Disney Channel is behind it or what if poppy got her inspiration from the Disney Channel and saw what was going on with Jesse behind the scenes like I'm gonna write some music about this either way it is just weird to see poppy not being poppy okay so this next thing we're going to talk about is unfortunately something we've been talking about so much lately and that is more child molesters being exposed so as you know Kevin Spacey has been outed as a child molester so many actors have come out lately saying that he touched them inappropriately when they were underage and it wasn't even just young guys it was any guy well Kevin Spacey's own brother came out and said this his fans love the sinister characters he plays but he's not acting that's really him in reality he was a monster Oh his own brother who probably knows him better than anybody literally just said he's a monster now this is something Hollywood has known about for ever and Seth MacFarlane has even joked about it on Family Guy years ago ten bucks five bucks eight bucks and I'll do it to find help I've escaped from Kevin Spacey's basement help me but I told you a few months back in a conspiracy video that there are so many cha molesters in Hollywood that are protected and Kevin Spacey was one of them I knew like I had heard the stories but I was too afraid to say anything because it wasn't like directly connected to me like it didn't happen to me but I knew he was one of the guys that was out there possibly molesting people and then it got exposed and that is just the beginning okay now let's end this video with something fun and light-hearted because this is just too much so while ago we talked about movie posters that look identical to each other but I have learned recently that it is not just movie posters I got an email from a fan named Macy and she said hey Shane have you ever looked into the fact that there's a bunch of the album covers that look the same and oh my god I'm just gonna take you through a few of these and you're literally not gonna believe it first we have a sane and little Wayne literally the same album covers maybe it's intentional I think it might be intentional but either way that's crazy then we have beyonce and ellie goulding hair blowing in the wind fur coat only covering your breasts that's showing your but same cover then you have Bjork and Britney Spears same pose saying look into the camera and then this one literally didn't even try to look different you have no doubt and demi lovato literally the same cover the same font the same colors they just threw Demi in there and even weirder the no doubt and Perrin Brown book they just changed it from red to orange and the list goes on Christina Aguilera looks just like Madonna's Britney Spears looks just like Mariah Carey's Earth Wind &amp; Fire looks just like iron made and then there's these three albums that look identical and they're very strange yeah all of these albums somebody holding a face in front of their own face then of course we have Michael Jackson and Madonna but the one that weirds me out the most that's like the closest is this one yeah same pose hand over the head similar text on the sides of the body the wind blowing the hair literally the same Hager I mean I don't know where they intentional where the accidents did some artists just say like no I really like that one move it take it I don't know but either way there's a ton of them and there's even more than I showed you today but one of them that might be intentional is Taylor Swift's new album reputation people are saying it's supposed to look similar to Kanye West's album the life of Pablo yeah look at them side by side the way the text is overlapping the way it feels like newspaper columns is intentional miss Taylor Swift trying to get underneath Kanye skin personally I think yes but either way I guess we'll never know okay now this last theory we're going to talk about is kind of a continuation of something we've been talking about a lot and that is kaamika Jenkins as we've talked about before kanika Jenkins was a girl that was found in the freezer dead bay hotel but things weren't adding up it did not seem like she just walked in there alone it seemed like possible murder but they closed the case and now we just don't have answers but then I started thinking about something and I remembered a story that happened a while back that's very similar to this let's talk about ELISA Lam now as you might remember ELISA Lam was the girl that was stumbling around a hotel and went into an elevator pressing all the buttons now there was footage of her walking in and walking out of the elevator it seemed like somebody was telling her what to do or guiding her huh that sounds familiar Kanika Jenkins stumbling around a hotel room security cameras are capturing it she looks like she's being guided well of course koneko was found dead in the freezer and ELISA was found dead floating in the water tower on the roof of the hotel but when both autopsies were done not much was found and those answers Mike won't be coming for a while yet we spoke with the LA coroner's office today who told us the cause of death remains inconclusive and finding out how ELISA Lam died will require more tests so both girls died in hotels under mysterious circumstances and then the cases were both closed well then I started looking into it and I found that ELISA had a tumblr page and there were some disturbing the stuff on it and one of the posts before she died she said I have arrived in la-la land and there was a monstrosity of a building next to the place I'm staying then she said I'm going out tonight I really hope no creeper comes near me then in one of her blog post she was complaining about a creepy guy being in her hotel now when her body was found in that water tower she was naked she didn't have her phone and there was even evidence of anal bleeding also there was no way she could have gotten to that water tower alone like literally but they said the case was inconclusive and they closed it and nobody else was involved with her death so there's a theory that she did have a creepy stalker and it was somebody that was watching her every move on her tumblr page and when she was saying she was afraid of a creeper and that she felt unsafe those might have been true well then you're probably thinking why was she touching all the buttons in the elevator well it's often said that young travelers are told to throw off their attacker so if your elevator is hitting multiple floors the attacker might not which one you're on I don't know I think both cases are so similar I mean clearly kanika had some assault happened to her and clearly she was thrown into that freezer and clearly ELISA had something very similar and was put in that water tower but why was it just murders that the hotels were covering up because they didn't want people to be like oh my god this hotel is not safe we can't stay here or the hotels in on it and the goal was to preserve the bodies I guess I'll just keep looking into it but it looks like cases are closed well there you guys go hopefully you enjoyed all of those creepy conspiracy theories today and if you like these conspiracy videos and you want

hey let's have you guys okay I am so excited because today I'm starting a new series that I've been wanting to do for so long I'm so fascinated by people and how they live their lives and how different my life is from theirs and one of the people that have been most fascinated with for a long time is Trisha Paytas forget you forget you yes Trish now not only is Trish somebody who I'm fascinated with who I've been watching on YouTube before years she's also one of my best friends and honestly more like family to me she's been there for me through so many things and just like a little background on that I met Trish when I was going through a pretty hard time and I was dealing with some eating disorder stuff and I had pretty severe depression and she was one of the people that really helped me get through it and somebody I could talk to about it she's also one of the people that helped me come out and told me that it would be okay and because of that she is somebody who I consider family and I would take a bullet for her and I literally see her being in my life until I'm 100 years old and I just feel really lucky to have her but with that being said she is still one of the most fascinating people I have ever met I mean her apartment is covered in pictures of herself she gets up at like 6:00 a.m. every day to do full makeup and glam she does eating shows where she orders like every type of pizza from every type of restaurant and dries them out and talks about her life she has a huge pink g-wagen that is custom that she drives through McDonald's like it's everything she also makes music videos and does dance videos and makes pop songs and she's so open on camera full-on crying and putting a bag over her head eating nothing else to do but it is so entertaining and I want to know what it takes to be Trisha Paytas I want to know if I can do it so today I'm going to be switching lives with Trish I mean full on hair makeup choreography music videos

moment definitely magic because you'd love chickens I love it okay I'm so excited about it [Music] cute the oh my god that was a day and Wednesday I'm exhausted so her seven post mates are on their way that was a lot yeah I definitely am like feeling tired overwhelmed hungry and kind of stressed how do you do this uh I know it's overwhelming cuz I like don't have anyone like I feel like you can go home now I'm like view of your Island and like how much your day and it's like for me it's like it's just stressful and it's just like empty and it's just people like you know we you know like people wanting more money or whatever for you know doing like stuff because I think I'm money so it's like for me it's just like I don't know how I do it like I was actually gonna ask you about this because when I was putting this video together the amount of money that it cost to be you and also the amount of people that are involved yeah it's pretty crazy I mean it was makeup it was hair it was a choreographer there was dancers it was the camera guy it was like a lot of people do you feel like stressed but that many people's livelihoods kind of depends on mm-hmm well you get to employ so many people like I like that part of it but it's just a lot it's a lot it's stressful and it's awful it's like lonely because you have fun you have like high is like I know and you're dancing you like all the times in college freshman is like cheering you on and then after it all this is kinda like goodbye like that's literally how I felt because it's similar like Britney Spears right like she goes on stage at Vegas there's thousands of people screaming for her watching or whatever and then the second she gets upstage it's kind of like lonely and sad and quiet and like yeah it's such a crazy up and then death yeah cuz I just think about that even today just like being with we don't like something that much time together sounds like this it's really sad that you're gonna like go home and then tomorrow is gonna be like it okey was we even seeing Rylan that I haven't seen in here and half was like we just don't hang out that much and it's like kind of like sad at me cuz it's like it's just like a thing that it's like it's over you know it's like and then I go back to what being miserable you don't I mean I'm getting all this hate like today you know what has any comments from people and like that one in person like leave me comments it's just really sucked and if you weren't here it would have been really bad but the reality is you're not gonna be here after tomorrow and that's just a high high and low lows it's just really weird you know I mean and you know what all honesty like I do definitely feel I wanted to do this video obviously yeah I wanted to become you I wanted to see what it was like you do get a lot of hate we're very judgmental and like you know yeah you post some crazy videos sometimes and stuff but I know you as a person yeah you have probably the biggest part of anybody ever so for me it's like yeah I wanted to do this video but I also didn't want to like no closer like we used to be yeah I know if we still have that mm-hmm and we do more than we used you know I know this was I think the most bonding we've ever had and I was like it was cool it was cool cuz people ask all the time like why don't you know she ain't like we're in George need friends like oh I'm like that and so it was like cool to like hang out cuz I always say that then it's true when we just hang out as I get just feels like the same insects you know just hang out are waking together you know well I mean I definitely feel like now especially for me like in my life I feel ready to have more hangout time because like I got so trapped in the fucking grind of Union and now that I'm like pulling back a little bit yeah like I want to actually hang out and just have a frenzy yeah he said I'm glad we did this because like literally nothing change and I always seem to be my best friend like the even like Friday when we hung out and like afterwards I was just thinking like how like lucky I am that you still like not only make time for me but also just you know you've been doing those thumbnails for me in a stupid straight like that that you don't have to do and you do it for me well I said this is the weekend your family to me fucking diggable and I don't never change the bitches are bad all right I think I hear the postmates yes cries over time to eat yes mind your Twitter bio donuts Chinese I was about to say I've never seen so much food in my life but that's a lie this is so much fun did you just literally grab for everything so I will frame it ah so a Mook bang is basically what eating a bunch of food are we talking or eating chewing sorts all of that each ha you choose so much you mean sizes II swallow loud oh my god I'm so excited I can't believe I'm in a Trish this is gonna be very exciting why does that come up okay so your treasure you should start out you know mouth starts you want to go longer to with us hi guys um okay it has been a long day and we have so much VPD haven't eaten all day you know they started and we have a hundred nuggets which we go through first well you know what I'd like to do who's starting off these is having a little appetizer of pizza so that's a little out a little appetizers take a bite of it and get it going just get it going yeah so first we have our pizza should not be half the kernel silly this reminds me of Christmas Jessie my mom doesn't cook oh man YUM but you have to teach me how to lick my fingers right just amazing a lip you'd be like yeah I'll give you had a fake nail like you're trying to chicken out behind the fake nail yum-yum oh okay being you is really hard today very overwhelmed tired a little sick so I feel like I need to challenge you now so tomorrow I want you to live a day as me stop I want you to come to my house in the morning noon and not showered Bob good you're gonna have to deal with my animals ill exercise sale eat healthy no have sex with right love you're gonna have to make a scary video oh and possibly have to prank my mom oh so means I don't die one day no I really do don't want to see you live a life as me because I feel like glad that I live on YouTube is kind of I mean it's real but not really like my life is high depressing and intense they're like kind of gross maybe a long day so I'd say get a long night's rest but I stay up all night let it go on Twitter tomorrow no I told her not to shower less you better not smell good anything so let's talk about the Luke maybe a little ranch stripping down all right so we love to create my mom so I was thinking you know island block pretend to be me [Music] 
gosh I am so excited you have no idea what's about to happen so I thought that this idea that could possibly break us up wow that's a lot of possibilities true so I have always wanted to take but I've always been too afraid to take a lie detector test about what about us oh so you'd be like quizzing me to find out if I've ever like cheated on you or something oh my god it wasn't good thinking about that oh my god okay so I thought about this idea last night and then I was like this is a really bad idea that could possibly end in me murdering my boyfriend so then I called up a guy and we're making it happen so I did a quick google and I found a guy really close to me named John Grogan this is not sponsored he literally said I need to bring him $200 cash this is like a drug deal okay wait let's practice hold on okay so I think the way lie-detector tests work is based on heart rate so like if your heart rate goes up that means you're longing cuz you're nervous but if your heart rate slows down that means you're calm which means you're telling the truth see I don't know how accurate that can actually be well let's test it taking your heart wait let me see if I can feel your heart oh there it is okay I'm gonna ask you a question and you say yes or not okay okay have you ever been fucking me and wished that I was a Paul brother no that's true do you watch porn because you're not attracted to me I think it's true that's so sad like do I wish you were 250 pounds in like 60 years old and that's what you watch what that's the porn why okay I just got a text from the lie detector test guy I need said that I should come with all of my questions for pay so I am sitting here trying to come up with questions that are intentionally ruin my life okay I don't even know what I actually want to know see here's the thing I feel very confident and comfortable and safe in this relationship so I don't have anything I'm like really wanting to know oh god one do you think my ass looks fat naked actually no this is gonna be easy okay wait what else should I ask about my dick no yes when I make jokes about killing myself do you tell your mom about it and say you're scared do you want kids with me do you want kids with me but do you want to use your sperm oh my god the questions are writing themselves okay I literally opened up my Instagram page I want to go through and like look back at memories and see if he was lying like when you took this picture of me laying on a pool floatie made out of bags of chips were you thinking I'm out oh my god or like the first time we had sex did you tell your friends that it was bad this is gonna be bad okay we're on our way I'm freaking out I'm literally sweating look at this I mean that's not new but I'm nervous are you nervous yes and no you should be no I think we need to make a pact that whatever happens we're still gonna love each other just the same okay can we make that same pact about if I get fat okay wait let's actually make a pact c'mere poquito okay no matter what happens today no matter if the answers are not what we want to hear or if we believe that they're wrong we will not break up I'll let this affect our relationship uh-huh and even if it says we're lying but we swear we're not you have to believe each other okay okay we are right outside of it I am so nervous wait a minute who is that oh no literally who is that when's the last time you shaved I brought well it looks really good that's a lot don't get it no okay I asked Gary to come because I wanted to film this for us because I want to get a whole perspective I want to see the whole experience wait who's asking me questions him are you what's happening I actually have no idea I wrote down some questions and I'm really nervous for him to read them out loud cuz they're a lot literally like oh my god I mean a lot of questions about my whole but we're not gonna get into it now no I'm kidding but there is one about my balls all right let's go [Music] hi okay we're here first of all what's your name I'm John and certified polygraph calm John I'm very very nervous mainly because I'm seeing this what is what what we're gonna read microscopic changes to your blood sweat and breathing as you answer yes or no questions oh no should he sit in the pink chair since he's gay whatever you want okay so you're gonna go first okay I think so right all right how do we do it I'm so unexpectedly nervous have you prepared your yes or no questions of importance yes okay well I can wire somebody up now or I can discuss how a polygraph is done yeah let's talk about like how it actually works we're gonna be watching a green wiggly line which is somewhat the squid at your fingers that looks like my weight well mountains is good your sweat goes crazy on one of the questions of importance that either means you lied or you move so we asked you not to move trades not nervous because it's you're going to first oh my heart's already beating fast just because I don't want this to end poorly for us what do you mean what's the worst that could happen come on we break up I throw in traffic oh okay so yeah so let's strap him up I have to sit down first is stomach this will let us know if you hold your breath which is a fail or if the question takes over your breath away that's fair if that doesn't fit around my stomach I'm armed up we're gonna put the blood pressure cuff on your left arm it's a little closer to the heart that's your third book a little closer to the heart you think I'm gonna survive to write another one this is the most the most sensitive if you move your feet during the test it'll make the sweater your fingers go up and make you fail so you need to answer yes or no with your mouth only no head movement I'm so nervous this is very triggering all right we're just waiting for to match on them probably three minutes okay do you have any like super uncomfortable situations like you've ever had a couple come in here and the guy gets busted like cheating and then you just have to go oil it's happened many times so how accurate oh that's so accurate you cannot become a police officer without passing a polygraph test and one out of three applicants fails okay this dude's careful suddenly I'm leaving oh that's the name of your book suddenly I'm leaving every time he answers a question we're watching the right edge to see what happened to his blood sweat while we're breathing up for breathing most important is the sweat do you want to do a simple one with you watching the screen so you can see what it's like yeah okay we're watching the right edge as you answer some questions so let's see how you do do you live in California yeah and this is your sweat do you feel you're the best-looking person in this room at this time no holy moley see a lot more sweat up but then on the first question so that's a lot do you think you're more attractive than us no you got a great face thank you without alive well he moves shall we oh we don't know you went right in on that one yeah literally I'm so nervous that spiked a lot yeah I'm freaking out now oh it's ready to start the test whenever you like okay first question do you love me yes [Music] that is true oh my god but you relieved Ryland because it's just like I feel like even if I breathe a certain way it's gonna go trigger that machine to say something different and then we're gonna have a real-life fight after this no no wait have you ever cheated on me no crew oh I don't know Wyatt I could have been real why would I cheat on you that serves me in no way like that so far oh my god okay okay this is have you ever been tempted to cheat on me No again true mileage you're such a good parent offer so much then why would I want to cheat on you now you're overdoing it no like I know there ain't no next question have you ever texted or flirted with other guys while we've been dating again a hundred percent true oh my god why are you so good I don't deserve you oh my god this is going good okay next question how do you ever thought about another youtuber while we're having sex no he's telling the truth Oh same youtuber is there that I'm like oh I have thought about the guy from worth it but that's just cuz you look just like him and I'm thinking about in my critiquing window whoa I'm just saying like if it's no I cut next question do you wish that I had abs still telling the truth really yeah I think that would make me like jealous do you want to have kids yeah I'm I'm always the one that what says I want kids I know but I think you just say it like you know I don't know for like and not only kids I want to pick I want a horse well that's a lot of things I want to wrap it we really yes I so I've told you that many times when I'm like 31 or 32 now I'm scared okay say Amy took me to okay do you see yourself marrying me that is a loaded question to have on camera I just asked you about kids I know but it just feels very intense okay ask again okay do you see us getting married yes his breathing collapsed every other question I'm a will arise my finger between the breathing's not that much I held my breath because IRAs nerve that's a lot to say on the internet like what's house cooking like this is exploiting your relationship on the Internet hi welcome to youtube.com plus Shane okay do you think we're gonna get married yes true when this becomes a proposal video no proposing in this room you better take me to fucking Mexico I'm gonna cry okay are you actually okay with me hanging out with my exes all the time yes he had a problem about money literally Garrett is in the room with us right now well not okay yeah he's telling the truth oh here's the thing I know that you like me a lot I'm very confident in our relationship yeah I'm very also I don't want to Bogar at the moment but like exes i-i've never even consider in a bed once and had an uncomfortable moment we can place yeah we did do you consider yourself more of a bottom than a top a shame I just I don't know I'm just asking a question okay asking you good do you consider yourself more of a bottom than top No you failed that one in what relationship honestly do you think you're more attractive than me she's telling the truth Oh what are you something about a check it means a lot of things okay last question have you ever thought about where you would move to and we broke up no truth again you must days true I mean you can't spend every day with somebody and not go sick of them every once in a while

guys we just did a podcast with my literal hero Siberia oh my god I don't want to give away what happen but all I'm gonna say is squirting was involved hey what's it be a Z yes welcome back to another conspiracy theory video now today's video is gonna be a mix of new conspiracy theories and updates to ones that we've talked about before and like I always say how all of these are theories none of these are facts and some of them can be incredibly triggering so if you are triggered by a murder or suicide or Jay Paul then I would leave this video for the rest of you here we go okay now this is gonna be a big update to a story that we talked about like a month ago and that is the accidental death of kanika Jenkins on September 10th 2017 Kumiko was found dead in a walk-in freezer at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Chicago now there was security camera footage of her stumbling around the hotel walking into the kitchen but there was no footage of her actually going into the freezer and because of that a lot of people think that it was murder now over the last month and a half her mother has come out her family members have come out many people have come out and said that this was not an accident there's no way that this little girl could have opened up that freezer by herself and went inside and just laid there I worked in the cafeteria before there's no way if she drunk and they said she stomach so she don't have no scream I believe that's someone in this hotel kept my channel even though all the evidence wasn't adding up and there were so many questions just now the case was closed as I was writing this video the authorities announced that the case is closed and there is no more investigation they're saying her death was accidental and there's no evidence that indicates any other conclusion and of course people freaked out people were tweeting reopen the case hashtag Anita Jenkins and thousands of people were tweeting hashtag just Kanika well then something really really disturbing happened photos of kanika jenkins body in the freezer were released now I am going to walk a very fine line I do not want to show the full photos because I feel like that's disrespectful but I do need to show pieces of the photos to explain what her mom is talking about okay so first let's talk about what her mom said tamika's mom on facebook said Rosemont police department stated two days ago before seeing the four photos at the time kandi cos body was found they did not see any signs of assault or criminal play so that is why they didn't start a criminal investigation then she said this Rosemont Police Department denied me as a parent to see my child lying in the freezer so they didn't want her to see her daughter's body we wasn't even allowed B when they discovered up I wasn't even allowed to stand in the hotel lobby they put us out we had to step outside and look well then when the pictures came out it definitely looked like there were some instances of sexual assault and for example let's look at the side-by-side of these two pictures on the left is kanika at the hotel party before she died you can see that her jacket covers most of her back and has a straight edge but then in the photo on the right you see that her jacket has been ripped and it's showing a lot more from back looking like she might have been in some kind of altercation and now this is when it gets really dark a video came out supposedly this has not been confirmed of the same night in the kitchen and you see a man pushing a cart that has a big black bag on it and inside of that bag that looks to be now I know you're thinking that could have been anything well then if you look at this picture of Kenny his hand you see this that's right you can see a piece of black trash bag on her nail which looks like she might have clawed her way and then even more disturbing there is another picture of kanika shoe on the ground in the freezer and next to it you guessed it a piece of black trash bag now this is from a police report and it says the photographs show that Jenkins was still wearing the jeans and jean jackets shown in surveillance videos of her walking through the hotel before death but the shirt beneath her jacket was pulled up exposing her breasts why why was for sure pulled up exposing her breasts why did she have trash bag on her fingers why was she laying in such a way that it looked like somebody threw her in there well because of this and because of a million other reasons her family is still pissed and still wants justice and so do all of us but as it is now the case has been closed stop moving my god that would piss me off so bad because I remember doing this conspiracy theory like a month ago and I remember people telling me I don't know that's a stretch I think she was just drunk a lot of people online were like that's just a dumb conspiracy theory and then these pictures come out and she's clearly disheveled and post assault but either way I guess all we can do is keep saying we want justice and kanika I just want you to know I will not stop talking about this until we figure out what happened okay so usually I would go to something lighter after something that dark but it's just gonna get darker because we have a few more theories about the Las Vegas shooting now last time I talked about some of the theories that maybe there was a cover-up with this shooting maybe Steven didn't actually do it and maybe the government is using him as a scapegoat well these next couple pieces of evidence show that that might be true okay so first of all these posts appeared on Facebook now I researched it and it looks to be very legit but once again these are just theories I don't want to be sued and none of this is fact but allegedly this was posted on Facebook a bunch of people that worked the route 91 and said they got their cellphones back today they said all their phones are completely wiped clean all messages and info from that weekend are completely gone anyone else experienced this yeah this girl is saying that everybody that was at that concert that night of the shooting had their phones taken from them or that left their phones on the field got them back the next day and they were white she also said this don't know but a few different people who were vendors there are saying the same thing which means it wasn't just people in the audience as people that were working there now why would the police wipe all their phones possibly to get rid of any evidence that there might have been one at one shooter possibly to get rid of any videos of people showing that there's more than one shooter well then somebody commented this of course it's an active federal crime scene they can wipe it clean I was the beverage manager for the entire event my laptop is wiped clean his whole laptop but why if anything wouldn't the police want to leave all of those phones and tacks so we could see exactly what went down and how it went down so we didn't figure out why it Stephen did it well that's not the only thing that came out this week that was very confusing now something everybody's talking about right now is the timeline and how it's a little fucked up now it was originally reported that after Stephen did his mass shooting he shot a security guard in the hallway of the hotel and then right after that he killed himself but now it's being reported that he actually shot the security guard six minutes before he even started shooting the concert even a spokesperson of the Mandalay base of this we cannot be certain about the recent timeline that has been communicated publicly and we believe what is currently being expressed may not be accurate yeah so even the Mandalay Bay is like I don't think that's how it went down well then at a press conference the sheriff started saying one thing and then changed it halfway through seems like he let something slip question is was he was the security officer shot before the suspect was shooting into the crowd the answer to that is yes we believe he was shot I'm sorry that we believe that he was shooting into the crowd and then the security officer was shot during that event as of yesterday sheriff Lombardo confirmed Campos was shot first that was metros first official announcement about the inaccurate timeline yeah we were right like it just felt definitely like he let it slip and then he's like oh fuck well another thing weird that I haven't heard that many people talking about is it Stephen used the service elevators and that's why supposedly he's not on camera anywhere sources being briefed on the investigation confirmed paddock had access to and used Mandalay Bay's service elevator in the days leading up to the attack yeah the service elevators that are for employees and janitors and workers why is Steve I was just staying if i Hotel using a service elevator possibly because they're bigger and because he could get more guns through them and also why is there not security cameras in the service elevator you would think that's exactly where they would put it to make sure employees aren't fucking around either way there's so many inconsistencies in the story and it's not even conspiracy theories at this point it's literally questioning why all of this happened and why all of the answers don't make sense so I'm gonna keep looking into this I'm gonna keep talking about it out of respect for the victims because I want to know why they died I want to know why it has happened and I want to know why more people aren't questioning it okay now let's move on to something a little bit lighter we're gonna be talking about it why Disney stars go crazy Miley Cyrus when she started Disney and then Miley Cyrus later Selena Gomez when she started Disney and then recently Demi Lovato when she started up his name and then later Vanessa Hudgens when she started Disney and then later and then of course bella thorne when she started Disney she was this little pretty princess and now she is literally making out with Tana mojo no there's been talks about Disney stars losing their minds for years it's become a joke at this point a girl grows up on the Disney Channel and she's clean and never shows her skin and is always talking about being the virgin and then a few years later she is naked on a wrecking ball and everybody's like Oh Disney did this to them it made them crazy it made them promiscuous or whatever I think there is something deeper to it before I get into that let me just remind everybody with Selena Gomez literally queen of Disney Channel said Disney is a machine and I'm grateful for it a machine got it okay let's get going now what does everybody in Disney have in common a contract every Disney personality signs a lengthy contract that allegedly makes it so that Disney and owns them for a long time now if you were in a contract that you didn't want to be in anymore how would you get out of it would you sue no Disney will win would you ask politely fuck no Disney would win but what if you knew that Disney's brand was wholesome and clean and virginal well I guess if you started releasing nude pictures of yourself or dressing really provocatively or singing about sex Disney might end your contract and then you're free these Disney kids are smart right they're not crazy they're not dumb they're not just like going out partying and like being idiots they're fucking smart that's why they're where they are so why wouldn't they purposely do crazy provocative weird things online to get out of their contract is genius let's look at Duff Cameron so a while ago she said this Disney is such an exceptional group of people everybody that works for the company is so kind and lovely that it's like a big family and no one's telling anyone to say that okay interesting but then let's fast-forward to look at some of the tweets that she was liking if Doug does another Disney show all understand Doug Cameron is close to 22 years old she can finish the sentence franchise but that's the only thing she should be doing for Disney Channel I want Duff to drag me with music and movie announcements I need her to shut me down and then there's this one which goes right back to what I said about the contracts no matter what AB Doug Cameron chooses to do I'll root for her she's been giving off some lawyer vibes lately flashed to me in the courtroom and she liked that like she actually liked that so here's what I think is gonna happen this is more of a prediction and less of a theory I think Doug might slowly release some sexy music videos and his sexy picture on Instagram and maybe even a leak somewhere and that Disney will cut her contract and then dub be free I mean she is friends with Bella Thorne so she might be getting advice from there and I am rooting for all the Disney stars do it break your contracts get free because nobody wants to stay working for a machine okay so this next conspiracy theory is incredibly touchy mainly because it deals with sexual assault and it's a huge claim a former Pussycat Doll kaya Jones claims that the Pussycat Dolls was actually a prostitution ring yeah and I know what you're thinking uh that sounds like a rumor no she tweeted this my truth I wasn't in a girl group I was in a prostitution ring oh and we happen to sing and be famous while everyone who owned us made the money oh that is so scary but also not that shocking sadly enough I mean we all know that in Hollywood there's a lot of that going on a lot of sex or money and sex for jobs well then she tweeted this how bad was it people asked bad enough that I walked away from my dreams bandmates and a thirteen million dollar record deal that we knew was gonna be number one well then she did an interview saying this if you're accepting an opportunity for sleeping with your boss or bosses or being propositioned that it'll go further if you do this what's the difference between a job opportunity and cash now after people started talking about this and it became a thing the woman who created the Pussycat Dolls came out and said something super fucked up kya Jones was never a member of the Pussycat Dolls but simply a pussycat reject who's looking for her 15 minutes of fame yes yes now listen I don't know who I believe in this situation but it's not a shock to me I mean we've talked about this a million times before Hollywood is so fucked up and there's so much sex and prostitution and child molestation so much going on that the idea of a girl group actually being a prostitution ring is not that crazy once again a theory not a fact don't sue me but Hollywood is gross I mean remember in the last video we talked about the fact that Selena Gomez is going to be in a Woody Allen movie who allegedly is a child molester well then this came out Woody Allen's new movie includes a sexual relationship between an adult and a 15 year old child that's what the movies about a child molester is directing a movie about the child molester starring Selena Gomez haha it's just it's all so fucking gross okay I feel like we really need to lighten things up so let's switch topics now we have talked about alternate realities for a long time the idea that maybe we're living in a matrix and maybe little things change that affect everything and maybe nothing's real at all well then this happened and it triggered everybody and everybody's like oh my god we're living in a matrix now this is from a basketball game and well I'm just gonna show it to you first [Applause] okay I know one first viewing it's like what's the big deal they all just ran the same way but really look at it I'm gonna zoom in a little bit notice that all of them at the same moment turn and run at the same time they even run on their same foot watch do you see that mean the more you watch it the weirder it is [Applause] I mean it's weird right it's literally like to all of them they didn't even communicate it it wasn't like everybody's like run it was like I mean I know it sounds funny and I even laughed when I saw this trending on Twitter but the more I watched it the more I was like this is weird once again do I think that's proof that were in a simulation no I think it was a weird coincidence but then there's this okay now I'm gonna ask you a question and you answer it what is the order of the lights and a stop light now I'm guessing you're thinking red orange and green and you'd be right that's what Apollo the stop lights are except for in one place where they're the opposite that's right green orange and then red now this specific stoplight is New York on temporary Hill temporary Hill is the home of the upside down traffic light now there have been tons of urban legends about why it's upside down there's even one about evil leprechauns throwing stones to break the lights over and over again and then they were replaced wrong I mean that's it's actually crazy to me but there is one theory that ties all of this together and that is the theory a temporary hill might be section or a center point of a parallel universe or of a simulation so we talked about me and del FX right there's little things that we remember one way but we see that the other what if the stoplights are a Mandela effect what if they did use to be upside down like that but what if when everything changed in our simulation they all went to red at the top but then what if in this one is section they didn't I mean think about it we all know about the Bermuda Triangle I mean in that location alone is 75 planes and hundreds of ships have gone amiss so maybe that's an intersection to of a parallel universe and maybe Tipperary Hill is another one oh my god what if you went to tipperary hill and you went to like a bookstore and what if they had a big steam bigger book there well maybe I'll try to do that okay now we're gonna end it with this now this is kind of funny but also driving me crazy and that is the conspiracy that Jake Paul is trying to ruin my life okay that's over the top but he might be trying to with me all right so here's that one down I posted a video called confronting my first love now if you look at the thumbnail it's me sitting with her in a car having an uncomfortable conversation well then in a few days later Jay Paul posed this a conversation with my ex-girlfriend him in the car with her an uncomfortable conversation okay maybe it's just a coincidence maybe the thumbnail titles are just similar but now look at a clip of his video I was like yo let's link up and she was down and so now we are about to do this uh-uh this should be interesting home to Nathan make me nervous bro a little bit all right now look at a clip of mine and I said hey do you want to reconnect and can i film it and she wrote back a very simple like okay we are going to her house all right let's see how it goes what literally the same idea the same way we express how nervous we were it was also similar and then I tweeted it cuz I thought it was kind of interesting and kind of funny and then it became drama Shane Dawson actually responded to this drama kinda by reacting to Jake Paul's video yesterday saying this Jake Paul is coming for my brand not clickbait showing that the thumbnail and title is very similar to Shane Dawson okay now clearly I don't care and like it is what it is I think he probably saw my video trending on the trending page and you didn't know what it was and he's like oh that's a good idea I'll do it which is fine but this is where it gets crazier literally I think a day after I tweeted about this he puts up a video called real exorcism on our possessed friend now if you are new to my channel you might not know this literally a month ago I did the same video and it wasn't just an exorcism of a friend it was an exorcism of textbooks yo e that's of that competition show yeah that pester Brooks Tessa Brooks from Team ten Tessa Brooks who is with Jay Paul and the worst part is Nick Crompton my cake was in my video and in Jake's video he's the one getting the exorcism which makes me think what's this all planned are they trying to make me crazy are they trying to annoy me all I'm saying is if next week Jay Paul starts doing conspiracy theories I'm done I'm just kidding I don't care I thought it was interesting though and I definitely think that they are trying to fuck with my head well there you guys go I just want to end this video on something funny and stupid because it was incredibly dark and well there you guys go hopefully you enjoy these conspiracy theories and hopefully they made you think and question all right you guys I'm gonna go make sure to give this video a thumbs up if you want more conspiracy theories also be sure to subscribe my channel right down below hit the notification about cuz I make new videos every day and if you wanna see all my other conspiracy theory videos I'll put a link to a playlist right down below alright you guys don't believe everything you see bye 
I know but I didn't want to see child porn I just wanted to see like okay let me just pretend let me pretend like I'm a pedophile for say okay by the way just for the record police I have nothing to do this I didn't know this like you can literally get arrested for so I typed in naked baby first of all I don't understand why anybody would be turned on by that but that's the first good thing you said but hi I wanted to play that clip in full I mean that moment especially involved just for context because that seems to be missing nowadays I cannot believe that I am having to make this video I cannot believe that this is happening I I'm gonna start by saying I am NOT a fucking pedophile i Shane yah my real name go on record saying I am NOT a fucking pedophile got it great here's my statement he's everybody saying Shane make a statement there's my statement I'm not a fucking pedophile it's disgusting that people are saying I'm a fucking pedophile because of some shitty ass fucking jokes from six years ago on a podcast now let me explain a little bit more um I'm not gonna here's what I'm gonna do I'm going to apologize first I am sorry that I used to make really shitty fucking jokes I am sorry that I was so fucking like insecure and like playing this character this guy who's like crazy and will say anything and like tries to make people laugh by shocking them that was my thing that was what I did on YouTube a lot of people now don't know that if you started watching my videos more recently you might not know that but back in the day 2004 2008 to 2000 12 ish maybe 2013 that was my thing I I thought it was so I loved the feeling of making somebody shocked and laugh because they couldn't believe what was coming out my mouth I wasn't confident enough to make smarter jokes I was making the easy jokes I was playing crazy stereotypical characters I was doing shit that was racially insensitive I was doing shit that was homophobic I was doing shit that could be considered fat shaming I was doing some fucked up like comedy stuff that I'm not proud of like hmm I've changed so much as a person and as a creative and a director and a writer and stuff like the stuff that I was saying back then those back in those times I wouldn't ever say now ever like cuz I don't think that's funny listening to that clip just now I didn't laugh I didn't think it was funny but when you hear that clip you hear my co-host laughing which is was my goal I wanted to always make her shocked and laugh that was like that was our thing our thing was like oh I'm gonna say something super crazy to get her to be like oh my god Shane you can't say that like that was our thing and if you listen to the podcast for years you would know that that clip started circulating today but they cut it up basically there's a clip right now called Shane Dawson as a pedophile and then it says proof first of all that's illegal you can't say somebody's a pedophile and say you have proof when they're not that's there's a lot of legal words I don't know but I think there is a word for that defamation of character I don't know I'm not on CSI I don't know but it seems illegal to me to call somebody a fucking pedophile knowing that they are not or at least not having actual proof so before I get into that clip I want to start with their other piece of proof that when I saw it I assumed that people would be like oh this is a joke like oh this whole videos a joke because one of their pieces of proof was taking a picture of me and Ryland my boyfriend and then a picture of me and Lisa my axe circling their faces and saying they look like babies they have baby faces Shane's a pedophile gonna let that sink in that was one of their pieces of proof for calling me something as disgusting as a pedophile so of course when the clip started circulating on Twitter they would cut that part out because the person posting about Twitter would be like that's crazy let's cut that out you know what I mean so like that's where my head's at now let's talk about the actual clip so six years ago ish I probably should have looked that up I mean get an exact date okay I don't know a long time ago I think 2012 ish yes 2012 ish this was from an episode of my podcast right so in the podcast I'm telling a story about a little girl I saw in real life who was like how to makeup on and like the whole shebang she was like a Dance Moms type of vibe I don't know exactly what to call it but that's what it was and she was on Instagram and she was posting like really like creepy selfies and her dad was helping her and it was fucking creepy and it was like weird right so of course I take that story and I talked about it on the podcast now of course what they didn't also show and that video clip is me talking about how fucking creepy it was but then I started making jokes about it because that's what I did back then I would make crazy jokes that sucked so I was saying you know well she was sexy but then right away I'd be like I'm just kidding of course when they posted that they would cut out that I'm just kidding or for example they're saying Oh Shane talked about googling naked babies which by the way I never did like I was making a joke and telling a story and lying and like well I googled Nikki bit of course I didn't Google fucking naked babies I'm busy and on time to Google fucking naked babies and that's gross and weird but I made the joke and then of course I said first of all I said I wasn't looking for child porn they cut that out then I said after that I don't know why anybody would be turned on by babies and they cut that out all but of course they cut all those out added scary music Google Image Search pictures of little girls which is creepy by the way whoever edited that video and made it seem like his creepy conspiracy but not even a conspiracy cuz they said it was a fact that they said Shane Dawson is a pedophile on the title so I was like I'm I need to talk about this because I talk about child molesters in Hollywood a lot on my channel it's something I'm very passionate about and I'm not gonna turn this into like a me-too moment or like a feel bad I'm not gonna turn this into that because that's not what I'm trying to do with this but you guys know I've talked about it so much on my channel I was molested you know this I am passionate about it I'm passionate about shedding light on the fact that there are people in Hollywood that have molested kids and have been arrested for it and are still working in Hollywood that's proof and that's fucked up and that's what people should be focusing on but instead they're focusing on a youtuber who made a stupid joke and calling him a pedophile like to me that seems not only crazy but also distracting from the real issues that are going on right now right under our noses but whatever so I think that's why it hurts the most is having my name put next to the word pedophile is actually like the most triggering and the most heartbreaking thing I've literally ever seen I've been called everything I've been on YouTube for a long time and I think I'm rambling and I think I've already said this but for those of you who might be new or who might have just started watching or something and you're probably like oh my god Shane I just heard this thing and I listened and you were talking about see girls and laughing and I I'm making this video more for you guys because people who have been watching me for a long time you know like how much I've grown and changed and how much my videos have changed how much my humor has changed I would never do that now ever so I am so sorry if that triggered you or offended you or hurt your families it triggers me listening to that clip I haven't listened to that clip ever because I recorded it then I didn't listen back so listening to me joking about it fucks me up and it makes me go like oh my god like what the fuck was I doing literally what the fuck was I doing but I look back at a lot of my old videos and I say what the fuck was I doing most of them so I don't even know what else to say I'm not a pedophile I made a lot of bad decisions as far as joke telling story telling trying to make people laugh with shocking them I mean there's so many things I've done in the past that I'm like embarrassed of ashamed of and I've lost so much because of it like this isn't new this isn't a new thing for me but if you've been around for a while you know that I've done this before I've apologized many times for videos and I've genuinely meant it kind of changed my videos because of it this is the first time I've had to like this is the first time I literally had to tell people I'm not a pedophile that's a first and that feels like fucking shit so sorry for making offensive jokes I'm sorry for I don't know I like I am sorry that these are making people uncomfortable but also it's very out of context when you listen to the full thing it's still like shitty and creepy and bad jokes but it's not meeting a pedophile this is not me this is not proof of me being a pedophile me dating people who have clean faces and saying they're baby faces is crazy and like I mean I'm sure Lisa is shook I'm sure she's like they said that a baby it's all too much um so that's where I am it's all so hard right now because I'm in such a good place like I I've been in such a bad place before you guys know that and right now specifically I feel like myself I feel like I'm being authentic I feel like I'm being the real me I'm with showing my boyfriend I'm I'm showing my family more I'm showing the real side of me I'm not making crazy offensive jokes I'm talking to the camera like a normal person rather than doing that like so right now it just sucks that this is like a thing because I'm like this was six years ago and I'm so proud of like especially this week I'm so proud of the videos that went up this week like that's another thing that hurts is they are like contacting Sophie's family and like kids I've worked with family and sending them this link and of course the families were like this is not like come on but either way it's like I literally found a talented girl online brought her out had her record a song with me made two videos with her she got hundreds of thousands of subscribers overnight because of you guys but also because of the video that I made with her and they're flipping that on me saying I'm a pedophile because I helped someone fuck you whoever did that that's so fucked up like it's just like I can't alright I think I'm done I'm proud of what I'm making I'm proud that I've grown up I'm proud that I don't make crazy jokes anymore I'm proud that I am changed my channel to be more about good things and cool things and helping people I'm not just doing dumb shit or blowing up houses or whatever the fuck like the fact that I posted videos this week that are about me helping a young girl in the music industry the fact that those did well the fact that you guys enjoyed those is so cool and so awesome like that doesn't like years ago on YouTube I had to do the craziest shit to get these crazy stuff and now I get to just help people and like be myself and hang out with my friends and my family like that's just so cool and I don't want this to fuck that up so I don't know that's my story and thank you guys for being on this journey with me I know I know if you've been here for a while we've had this before but this is this this is next level this is actually really fucked up and I'm really sad that people are actually calling me a pedophile on Twitter like I don't I okay I love you guys I'm gonna go I hope you're enjoying the videos this week I hope that you are having a good week and hopefully I don't know I'm gonna go back to editing more than yes 
when you let BuzzFeed right oh yeah but all the people that are there yes and they're like then is there like beef like you see them at parties cuz now you're a big youtuber and like I'm sure you guys

what school just now oh my god you're an EU I think you're gonna be fine no I'm not big enough noises or not they can sense noise they have an inner ear but they don't hear like we do so they basically hear our vibrations right you know so why is he so like that well he likes me hey what's up you guys yes it's time for another conspiracy theory video all right so first we're gonna be talking about some theories regarding one of the biggest stories of the year trumping president North Korea wanting to kill us no bigger than that Kylie Jenner is pregnant that's right that is what everybody is talking about right now including me now I know you're thinking oh is the conspiracy that she's in the Illuminati and that this baby is going to be the new leader of it no it's a lot different than that and honestly this one I kind of believe a lot of people think that kylie is actually Kim's surrogate so as you guys know Kim and Kanye are expecting their third child by early 2018 by a surrogate now if you don't know what a surrogate is basically if you don't want to have a baby yourself or if your body can't handle it you hire somebody else and they have it for you now I know a lot of people are gonna think this is far-fetched but let's go back to early summer in the season finale of Keeping Up with the Kardashians on June 11th Kim mentioned wanting to get a surrogate she talked about how her body couldn't handle another baby and she was telling her sister about it well what are you leaning towards like do you think you would be pregnant again or have a surrogate obviously I do want to have my own baby yeah but I feel like I truly don't know if my body can handle it one more time now this is where it starts to get really interesting Kim's first idea was to have one of her sisters carry the baby before I mentioned to Kanye then that you would be our surrogate okay and he was like what like is this a joke and I was like wait what if it's not a gentleman so obviously Khloe said no she didn't want to do that but what if Kris stepped in and said you know what what would be even bigger news is if Kylie did it that way we get all the news out of Kylie having the baby and being pregnant but then she doesn't actually take care of the kid I mean last season was all about Kim trying to figure out where she's gonna get a surrogate what if this upcoming season she finds one in her own family now I don't think it's that crazy because honestly if me and Rylan wanted to have a kid my first instinct would be let's have your sister do it that way we keep the genetics and the family we're not having to impregnate a stranger like it just kind of makes sense now of course there is another theory out there that Travis Scott is known to dad but instead it's your ex boyfriend Tyga so after dating for a couple of years Tyga and Kylie split up in April which timeline-wise kind of makes sense if he was the dad now allegedly he even posted this to snapchat and then deleted it like right away it's the headline saying Kylie Jenner's pregnant and then he put hell nah that's my kid so who knows is that his kid is a Kim and Kanye's kid I guess we'll have to wait until Keeping Up with the Kardashians comes back okay so that was kind of a fun conspiracy theory this next one is incredibly dark we're gonna be talking about the strange depth of kanika Jenkins kanika Jenkins was 19 years old she left her house at 11:30 p.m. on September 8th to go to a party at the Crowne Plaza Hotel then on the early morning of September 9th she was reported missing and a day later she was found in the freezer of the hotel all right so some of the security camera footage was released and it is disturbing so first you see her stumbling out of an elevator and walking down all away now clearly she's in toxic or on something which would make sense cuz she had just went to a party and she probably was there all night now in this footage you see her stumbling down another hallway having trouble keeping her balance and it's just incredibly disturbing to watch knowing that she was walking toward her death now this is the last footage that they have of her and it is her walking into the kitchen and as you can see it seems like she's going towards something and then she walks off camera and that allegedly is where she opened up the freezer walked inside and froze to death now there is no video of her actually walking into the freezer which is confusing and a lot of people believe too because she might have been murdered now before we get to that let me show you a clip of her and her mom and just when only time you can get your dog to come getting the beer with you well you get food that's it that's not again look at ya wait long I want to tell you get yours eat Kanika you need me look at him mmm that's just so sad now her mom has been very outspoken saying that she thinks that there's way more to this story and she wants footage of her daughter walking into that freezer I want justice show me the video of my child walking into that freezer from day one that's all of it excellent now the people of the hotel are saying that there's no camera above the freezer so the footage doesn't exist okay now here's where it gets crazy it is rumored that the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Chicago is actually a place where they do organ trafficking a lot of people need organs but they are very hard to get you have to get on a waiting list you might not make it in time well then there is the black market where you can buy any organ you want for a lot of money there's this underground world of people who get kidnapped killed have their organs removed and then people sell them and supposedly the Crowne Plaza in Chicago is where some of this happens once again a theory I'm not saying it is it's all alleged don't sue me let's talk about this picture that went viral on Instagram there's rumors going around the hotel was known for organ traffic a post on one of the boys Instagram said we didn't mean to kill her she had a heart attack while we were raping her so it could be possible that the hotel staff froze her to save harvest and then sell her orgasm so basically one of the theories is that at that party she was at she got raped she died at the hotel staff knew about it and then they took the body now there's another theory that the owner of the Crown Plaza actually paid her friends to get her to the hotel so that they could take her now the reason this theory is getting so much attention is because the hotel has been so weird about this situation they say that they don't have footage of her walking to the freezer which a lot of people think is alive and supposedly a lot of people do go missing in this particular area and are never found now her sister has come out and said that there is no way that she could have opened up the freezer door by herself especially when she was drunk I worked in the cafeteria before there's no way if she drunk and they said she's family so she don't have knows no screaming and the mom came out and said this and they say it the police Martin said freak accidents like that do happen so they're saying and if the camera seemed right in front of the caller then if she has to get in it now this is where it gets really sad the mom is basically saying that this isn't like a racial thing this is something that might be happening to people and don't make it seem like it's some type of presence no no trace thing because it's not cuz it could be yo-chan it could be a blue chat it could be a purple chat it doesn't matter now a lot of people have taken the clip of her walking toward the freezer and analyzed it and they think that it looks like somebody is guiding her now if you look at the clip some people think it looks like somebody's holding on to her elbow and guiding her through the kitchen so did they could edit it out is that why it took the hotel a while to release the footage because they were manipulating it now what I think is even more possible if somebody was guiding her with their voice because when you watch the clips of her walking seemed like somebody saying this way come on over here like it really doesn't look like she's just being guided this is where it gets super tricky when I was doing research on this video last night I actually started crying because I have stated this hotel but eventually our plane landed in the next city on the tour Chicago that's right on my book tour I am 99% sure I stayed at that hotel and this is gonna sound like bullshit but I promise you it is real after my book signing I came back to the room and I took a nap now while I was falling asleep I heard voices and then I heard the sounds of girls and I heard them running around my room then I got a sleep paralysis if you don't know what that is you're very lucky but I was laying in bed I couldn't move I couldn't speak I couldn't open my eyes but I could hear everything that was happening around me then I heard the sound of a large door slam and it didn't feel like a normal door felt like something bigger maybe metal maybe a freezer door then I heard the voices of men and I heard them working on something then I heard a scream and then I heard feet coming toward me and I felt a pressure on my chest and then I woke up screaming now I was so scared at that moment that I literally left my hotel room and I went down to the lobby and I switched rooms now I've had experiences like this before I as you guys know always have ghosts around me but this particular one was really intense I called Garrett I called a book publicist I was freaking out and now a year and a half later finding out that this might be a hotel things like this actually happened maybe I was hearing the sounds of ghosts who had been murdered and sold for their organs ah it's also oh my god it's all too much ok now this is part 2 of the theory that is crazy but it still is so creepy to think about now first let's talk about the actual purchase of an organ it's very expensive you have to have a lot of connections and you have to have a good alibi so basically celebrities can probably get organs pretty easily and what celebrity very recently did Selena Gomez revealed this morning that she had a kidney transplant the 25 year old shared news of this summer surgery on Instagram I know it sounds crazy but hear me out she had this done in Chicago Crowne Plaza is in Chicago and she has the perfect alibi I'm sure you guys remember she posted a picture of her best friend laying next to her and said that her best friend gave her her organ that was this just an elaborate cover-up here's what's making people think it's all connected not that long ago Selena Gomez released a very disturbing music video called a fetish not in the video she's doing a lot of weird stuff chewing on glass laying on the floor kind of losing her mind but how does the video and oh that's right her stumbling into a freezer and staying there [Music] yeah and if you look at the freezer wall you see angel wings behind her in ice so is that replicating as somebody who died in that freezer to give Salina organ and listen I don't believe that theory it's interesting to think about but her friend did post a picture on Instagram showing her scar that she had from removing her organ and I genuinely don't think Selena Gomez would buy an organ on the black market but that doesn't mean that other people don't and kanika Jenkins might have been a potential victim of organ trafficking now I guess we'll find out soon the autopsy report hasn't come back but if it does and she's missing an organ well know either way I send so much love to the family and I hope you get justice for your daughter and I hope you find out how she really died now once again before I move on I just want to say this is all a theory it's on the legend I don't know crown plaza might not be a place horrible organs are kept there's a 1% chance I didn't stay there but I'm pretty sure I did so don't come after me okay now let's talk about something a little less dark but just as scary and that is something that happened very recently where I live in California is it the end of the world as we know it or just a hacker's hoax Orange County Cable customers for the ominous prediction on the air today that the world is going to end Saturday that's right people in California we're just watching TV minding their own business and then an emergency alert broadcast went on TV and said some very scary things [Music] [Music] yeah in that clip it's a guy talking about area 51 and saying that the aliens are coming and sounding terrified and then there was this one where guys talking about the end of the world and the devil now we still don't know what happened supposedly the area 51 thing and the devil thing were both like radio shows so the stations are saying that there was like a crossed wire and something got messed up I don't know some people think attackers some people think that it's somebody actually trying to warn us or something I don't know all I know is if I was watching TV and that shit went up I'm out all right now I told myself I was gonna take a break from little Michaela because she's been in my life for a long time now but then this happened and I had to talk about it so you guys have been tweeting the shit out of me saying we think we found the real Michaela and I feel like you guys might be right all right let's talk about a girl on Instagram named Carly now when you scroll through her feed it literally is the human version of little Michaela I mean some of the pictures are insane they look just like her this one with her glasses and her headphones and her bangs and then this one literally the same body as Michaela and you put them side-by-side that's crazy so as I was scrolling through her feed I saw a picture of her and her boyfriend his name is Beth master Griff's and when you scroll through his feed you see a lot of pictures of him and his girlfriend Carly and they look really cute together and then I saw this yeah a picture Beth and Michaela he's literally with her Michaela not only that when I went to his feed and Mikayla's feed and looked at them side by side I saw that they've posted the same means so this is on his page it says describe yourself only with pictures you have you cannot search or download new pictures it's pink the blue and the white text then I went to michaelis page BAM same thing same exact thing well then I went way back in his profile so creepy then I saw this picture of pink Carly and it literally is Michaela yeah she even looks slightly digitally enhanced okay so they don't went back to Carly's feed and I see her posing in front of a lot of different colored walls but her favorite is a lime-green wall so she poses in front of it with a very blank stare and then she even posts a building that is lime green so then I go to Mikayla's page and I see this yeah literally in front of a green wall is that the same green wall I don't know and just to add on even or insane evidence look at this necklace that Carly has yeah a gold necklace that says her name oh that looks familiar boom Michaela's necklace the same necklace ah we cracked the case so then I felt really far down the hole and I'm like okay so is Carly Michaela like does Bev her boyfriend just digitally enhance her pictures to make her Michaela but then I'm like no Michaela looks too fake like I don't think that's a real person at all then I saw this picture on Mikayla's feed of her posing with this girl now this girl's name is princess Gollum and she looks fake like if I looked at this picture I would think that those were two fake people well then I clicked on her page and I scrolled through it and she's real so on Mikayla's feed somebody digitally enhanced her to make her look fake so is that picture actually of Carly and princess Gollum and they've just both been digitally enhanced yeah I mean going through his page and Carly's page I noticed that they're both into music I think he produces music so is this like an elaborate stunt that him and his girlfriend came up with like hey babe I'm gonna create a person kind of based on how you look and then you're gonna sing for her and we'll make you a pop star was Harley who I talked to on the phone cuz it was a girl's voice but it was slightly auto-tune so maybe they have like an app or something I don't know I think this is them I genuinely 99.9999% think that this is them and I also think that they're letting Clues slip by because some of the pictures they've been posting recently literally are just evidence so I don't know if we'll know for sure I've emailed Mikaela she hasn't wrote me back but I was like girl I don't you but I guess we'll find out soon Oh Larry guys go those are all the theories today I know some of them were very touchy and intense but once again I want to say no disrespect to any of the families no disrespect to Selena Gomez or anybody I talked about these are all theories and I just enjoy talking about them all right you guys if you want more conspiracy to your videos give me a thumbs up so I know also make sure to subscribe to my channel right down below and hit the notification about

what's up guys my name is Esther and welcome back to you what the fuck fuck you might have seen my weirdest laws in the u.s. video that I made a while ago and thought to yourself and America's really weird and you're not wrong we have a man with cheeto coloured skin and a croissant for hair as our president and our number one celebrity looks like she's hiding a face giving Turkey underneath her dress and it's famous for plowing a guy on camera god bless america we'd be surprised to know that we're not the only ones with hilariously obscure laws that said today's video we count down the top 5 weirdest international laws number one in the Caribbean island of st. Kitts it's actually illegal to swear according to the island's small charges Act which was put into place in 1892 it is now an offence to use any abusive indecent insulting profane or threatening language in any public area and apparently if you break this law you'll either be fined up to $500 or sent to a month in jail I'm just wondering if this law like stacks you know like it's a beautiful Caribbean island I'm just wondering if something like this ever happened oh honey we were right to come here for our vacation away after my disappointing son Timmy my god is he disappointing I mean damn is it beautiful here freeze I heard you say a swear word that's a $500 fine or what month in jail you Pig what not doing any of them just let me enjoy my vacation away from my disappointing son Timmy fuck make that $1,000 or two months in jail you're really pissing me off oh that comes as a swear word here $1,500 all three months in jail you know what I'm gonna take the jail time at least I'm away from my disappointing son Timmy fuckin a is he disappointing y'all do that's four months yeah now I'd probably not survive on that Iowa I swear in pretty much every sentence so I probably be sent to jail for the rest of my fucking life I heard that that'll be $500 and if you're wondering if this law is even taken seriously their number 50 cent was actually arrested in st. Kitts in 2016 for saying me word motherfucker that's $1,000 go away a 50 cent wasn't the only rapper to be fined on the island as in 2003 rapper DMX was fine for saying shit I heard that $1500 so what I want to know is why do they have so many rappers come to this island you think with the massive amounts of done in most rap music that you would want to avoid this island if you're a rapper but then again maybe that's just how this place makes money yeah one M&amp;M song would finance their fucking space program number two in British Columbia Canada it is illegal to kill Bigfoot without government permission why is this the law especially since it's not really proven that Bigfoot is even real so basically this law is like oh if you see any dragons you need a permit to ride them dragons yeah those don't exist man well we just want to be safe you know just in case they do we'll see you laughing when I'm the one riding the dragon because I have a permit anyways though this law dates back to apparently be 1800s when a man was denied a request to kill a quote-unquote wild man near his lake okay that's just rude it was probably just a normal guy with the beard and this guy's just an asshole it's weird even though Bigfoot is just a myth to most people there are actually shows of people hunting Bigfoot out there for example the show Finding Bigfoot has 89 episodes where they've essentially found absolutely nothing like at this point any rustling in the trees or any small sound on that show they just automatically assume as Bigfoot what was that sound that was me coughing no no it sounded like has to be Bigfoot right for that what are you talking about that's our waitress we're at Denny's right now but like since it's illegal to kill Bigfoot what would they even do if they found him just be like oh yeah there he is cool credits roll show's over but if you did somehow killed Bigfoot without government permission first you face a fine up to two hundred and fifty thousand dollars but as it turns out it's actually illegal to kill any animal in British Columbia without the proper permits and since Bigfoot technically I guess counts as a wild animal I'll be at a mythical one he's still illegal to kill number three in Cambodia it is illegal to use a water gun during a New Year's celebration in the world of oddly specific laws this one is pretty high up there and like oh it's just water guns and makes no mention of actual guns like it's totally legal to have real guns but god forbid if there are some fucking water inside of that instead of a deadly bullet time to go to jail you sack of shit so the law was put into place in 2001 after officials in Cambodia noticed the large amount of water guns being used during a New Year's celebration which mean I can kind of it's like you obviously don't want to be sprayed in the face when you're enjoying new years but still making them completely illegal seems a bit much Cambodia is also cited there's been many cases of children filling them with things other than water and quote dirtying up their country Oh God what did those kids put in there please don't tell me P God first thing that came to mind is P I was fuckin right remember like two seconds ago and I said I'd be annoyed if I got sprayed in the face during New Year's yeah now imagine that scenario only they're getting sprayed with P instead okay yeah no I totally understand now fuck water guns they deserve to be bad so while it's illegal to use water guns during New Year's there actually isn't any punishment for doing so except for you get your water gun taken away from you so there's that I guess can W the world's fourth grade teacher strict enough to take things away from you but not strict enough to punish you for it thanks Cambodia although it's pretty gross to think that somewhere in an evidence Locker in Cambodia there's probably like 200 Supersuckers filled with P so hey I guess if the police ever run out of bullets they know what to do number four while the UK has a few extremely weird laws the do weirdest ones are the fact that it's illegal to die in the British houses of parliament cliques which basically think that's probably just a line of old dudes they're like as long as I'm here I can't die out fuck my rotator cuff in the UK's other extremely weird law stating that a pregnant woman can legally relieve themselves anywhere they want even if she's so requests in a policeman's helmet man that is brill as you british people say which like why aren't more people using this law to their advantage imagine just squatting down in the middle of the road like what are you doing I'm pregnant oh I'm so sorry in that case go ahead no thanks officer mom but I guess if this law was more accepted just everyone in the UK would be shitting in the streets because it's not like police are gonna test if you're pregnant so they just have to believe you oh yeah you're under arrest but I'm pregnant you're a man that sexist the man can't be pregnant No so you know if you live in the UK now's your chance to just go out in the street and take a dump what are you waiting for it I'll watch this video fucking and go do it the missing valuable time you could be shitting in the streets right now father you're number five in Singapore it's illegal to be naked I don't mean like in public I mean literally for any reason I want to take a shower and what about your wife me you want a chill around the house naked covered in Doritos and watching meme compilations on YouTube and we're as according to the law in Singapore it's illegal to be naked in any place public or private as this deemed to be quote-unquote pornographic and in case you're wondering yes pornography is also illegal in Singapore Wow what yeah what's up just Singapore no it sounds like a fucking great porn title and obviously I assume this isn't actively enforced because like how are you supposed to shower or fuck it like change clothes actually this isn't the only weird law that Singapore has as its also illegal to connect to someone else's Wi-Fi smoke in public and sink that you're not allowed to sing in Singapore Yeah right you can't sing in Singapore makes no sense although you gotta have to feel bad for the person who heard singing so terrible that he literally banned it in the country it's fine that lady from spider-man 2 who's like oh god I can't stop pay raise guys that is it for this episode of what the fuck 5 hopefully you guys enjoyed this video and if you did make sure to give it a

up that's it guys I'll see you next week for another one's about 5 thanks for watching and Fairwinds [Music] 
hey what's up guys my name is Destry and welcome back to you what the fuck five so I'm sure you've seen a horror movie like Silent Hill where there's a little boy or a little girl just drawing something fucking creepy and you thought to yourself hey don't be fucking great because if I never have children because what the fuck yeah I'd be the opposite of a good parent if my kid was like hey daddy mr. chilly says that you shouldn't open the bathroom door opens mr. chilly he's the guy over there with the blood in his mouth staring at you oh hell no yo can I return my child please this one's defective we'd actually be surprised to know that a lot of those drawings that are in horror movies are actually based off of real-life drawings that existed in our world so that's said for today's what the fuck five suggested by YouTube user Claire bear we count down the top five creepiest kids drawings number one Lisa so these are actually a series of drawings that were created by what seems to be a little unnamed girl it tells the account of her and her friend Lisa who as we could see from these drawings he's not human yep pretty sure normal humans don't have blood coming from their eyes and mouth and no legs anyways the story of Lisa and the little girl goes along to fill up an entire notebook with several pages with passages saying things like this is Lisa she's my friend my mom and dad can't see her so they said that she's an imaginary friend Lisa is a nice friend yesterday Lisa and me went on a long walk until the moon came out daddy got really mad and said Lisa's stupid and fake Lisa got sad and disappeared today she didn't come to school but mrs. Digman says mrs. Munroe won't come back Lisa came back yesterday she said sorry for leaving and I told her my dad won't come home Lisa said mrs. Munroe and him are sleeping like her death I hope they wake up soon wait did she kill her fucking dad like is that that's what happened right great good story and despite how just absolutely chilling the drawings are it's kind of a nice tale you know like he says in a demon that was trying to take her soul or something she just seems like a ghost that maybe wanted a friend and this little girl didn't really give a shit that she looked different or had blood coming from her eyes and mouth or whatever the fuck that is maybe it's not like you know maybe it's jelly maybe it's Taco Bell hot sauce totally changes the vibe now if you imagine that this is Taco Bell hot sauce on her face that said don't go thinking that all of these on this list are going to be nice because they're not and with that perfect segue number two I want to die no that's the name of I mean I kind of also want to dive that's not important anyways so I want to die was a drawing that was uploaded by a Reddit user named candy slave who allegedly works at a restaurant where they hang up kids drawings on the walls one day apparently a co-worker at the restaurant was cleaning up after they had just served a man and his 8 to 12 year old son when she picked up the drawing that says I want to die and even though the art is just really bad it's so bad that you had to label what things are by the way does that say arm his arm is cut off whoever it is in the drawing that's killing them has both a sword and a gun which makes me believe that the killer is either Deadpool or Rick O'Connell from The Mummy jokes aside the drawing actually did raise a lot of concern if the drawing was real because it might have actually indicated an abusive household and that the kid might have just been trying to you know silently cry out for help but optimistically I'm just gonna hope that that wasn't the case and that he just has a real weird imagination one could hope right number three the secret room so this one is definitely probably be creepiest on this list as the story of this secret room drawing actually turned out to be true so basically a dad asked his two kids to draw a picture of their family and also a map of their new house the older child drew the house normally the mom the dad the two kids basically just a layout of the house that they now lived it for the younger child drew the mom the dad the two children and then two more children with blacked-out faces with cryptic symbols as their names in addition she also drew an extra room in the house that she insisted was real when her dad asked that you know basically like what the fuck is this who are these kids so the dad insists that she show him the extra room as the story goes she brings him into the bathroom and removes a piece of drywall and behind the pipes in the bathroom was actually an extra room just as she had drawn on the map oh you know and actually the worst part is that you know at this point the dad is kind of bewildered kind of scared so he asked the girl to take a picture of the room since he actually couldn't fit inside of it and this is the picture that she took this same symbols of the fucking faceless kids that she driven yeah I'd move out of there real quick real fucking quick that said when the story went viral there are a lot of people that were skeptical that maybe the entire storm is fake but to be honest this is so far like the most believable out of the ones that we've covered on this still pretty creepy number for the asylum kids so this one again is more of a series of drawings that are all really fucking sad when you realize why they were drawn so basically all the drawings came over a span of a couple years from 659 different children when they were all trapped inside of an Australian detention centre which is basically like the jail and we're instructed to draw their feelings so pretty much in every drawing the kid is always crying always saying they want to get out one of them says I need help I want to go out please help me I need go out please and one even saying parents are suicide with ropes around their necks so the entire thing is just really fucking sad and since the entire thing happened in 2014 it kind of makes you wondering if the kids got out or got help or really what was so bad that every kid drew something awful I mean obviously if you're in jail you're not gonna have you know a happy fun time the entire time you're there or maybe it was something darker I guess we'll never know and finally at number five the murder of Angela Wrightson so I'm just warning you this one is a super messed up and is easily the darkest one on this list as there's a lot of gruesome details so again I'm just warning you if that stuff bothers you you know you clicked on this video obviously so you're interested in this but it is fucked up all right so you remember those two girls in 2015 that tried to murder their classmate for Slenderman yes so this story is more fucked up if you could believe it then that story but like that story it also involves two teenage girls that murdered someone and while the two girls names and faces were never actually identified and all we really have to go on is the court drawings that people have drawn while they were in trial these girls are way worse than the girls that were killing for Slenderman so it all happened December 8th 2014 when the two girls were only 13 as they were roaming the streets drinking smoking and taking pills the night was still young so they decided to go to the street where a known alcoholic Angela Wrightson lived and she had apparently bought the girls alcohol before whatever is it I guess that night maybe she just didn't buy them alcohol you know something set them off if she was pronounced dead a few hours later in her apartment and she had been beaten by a lot of different objects including a shovel that was still bloodied and left at the crime scene a piece of wood with screws in it and a TV repetitively dropped on her head and the worst part and why these girls have been dubbed the name these snapchat killers is that they took selfies with her unconscious and bloodied body throughout the night as they were murdering her what the fuck and the reason that this case makes it onto this list is that one of the girls also left a drawing at the crime scene of her killing mrs. Wright's in with other bodies lying near her feet which one can really only assume that means that they've killed other people and the worst and just most insane part about the story is that the two girls that actually called the murdered in and the entire 999 call was recorded I'm just wondering if you're not from the UK the accents kind of make it hard to understand but just listen to this yeah it's like they just had no remorse just laughing in the background like oh yeah we just killed a lady yes hello I would like to schedule a vasectomy please I just don't want children ever anyways guys that is it for this episode of what the fuck five hopefully you guys enjoyed it hopefully you found those stories interesting and if you did make sure to give this video a like and also subscribe to this channel cuz I'm doing these every single week you want to see some more creepy videos that I've done make sure to check out the top five kill their children videos that I did a while ago which will guarantee to make sure that you never want to have children ever again as if this video wasn't proof enough secretly what the fuck 5 is an anti sex campaign that's why they hired me the least sexy person they could thought I mean where else are you gonna find a man who can do this oh yeah baby I like this shit Wow you know what I decided after looking at your face that I just never want to have sex again mission accomplished that's it guys I will see you next time for another what the fuck 5 thanks for watching and Fairwinds [Music] 
guys today I have something planned that I am so excited about and also very nervous about it because it involves some of my biggest insecurities but before we get to all the things I hate about myself we're gonna show you my new doggy hi baby she's literally playing dead I know you're alive I just had this special connection with animals I don't know what it is okay so here's what's happening lately I've been having a lot of self-esteem issues and body issues and by lately I mean the last 29 years I am shaking now it's hard because I'm with Ryland and Ryland has never really dealt with like body issues so when I'm trying on clothes at the store and they're not fitting and I'm having a panic attack and I'm freaking out he doesn't get it he's like you're not fat shut up so I had this idea that today I want to show Ryland how I'm feeling so he might understand what I'm going through he has no idea what's going on Garrett has no idea what's going on it's very early in the morning I'm calling everybody over early they probably think I'm having a breakdown I am but more importantly I think this experience actually might be really good for all of us and really funny for you guys to watch are you ready for your first squad video he just meow I love all my animals don't know who they are either come in okay so I have a little surprise for you please please super you know it's very oh my god yes I do know it's on its way oh my god you know me so well I know but before that there's something in that room that you've been waiting for Whitney yeah I have so many guesses they're all gonna be here about our themes and I'm not here for it say hello to you I know it doesn't feel good does it it's real sweet he just thinks you're like another dog so he sees you as competition I understand I smell like meat now before we get to today's video I do have a situation we don't know the name of the dog well we did have a name it was honey and then we decided it wasn't working because I just felt really gay saying it and like a big fat lady which I already am ha ha ha I like Elle from Kill Bill that's a person named Linda going on I'm so over all right Andrew take over okay you're probably wondering why I'm wearing such a big shirt no because I you guys are aware that I have a lot of issues so we were talking recently the three of us actually about how me and Garrett both kind of have issues with our bodies and how Rylan doesn't understand yeah because he's little and we're beep I really it's serious like shin and I connect on this all the time actually it gets it's one of the first times a chain and I really got really close his friends was talking about all this stuff cuz it was severe but yeah what about on the dark conversation why we're bringing that up in the video well because I thought we should do something fun as a way to deal with our issues I feel like the reason you get kind of frustrated when I'm having my light body issues is because you don't understand because you've never been big I have been like this Michael I feel like when you go to try on clothes in the store you don't even think about her when you get up in the morning you put on the outfit you're just like dude do I have a cute little elf where is me like to go to a store is a panic attack to put on clothes in the morning doesn't happen I just wear big muumuus like because I have the mentality of a former fat person and I'm remembering all the triggers right like going to target to try and close first of all didn't happen cuz I had to shop at Walmart cuz Walmart had brass I thought today I would put you in a fat suit so you could experience all the things that I went through and then maybe after that you could relate to me on it we're

anyways have you guys okay I know what you're thinking Shane why are you posting your video on a Sunday I don't understand what is this well that's because today is not going to be my video so you guys remember a few months ago I flew in a hater Bobby burns to come make some videos with me on my channel and we had a lot of fun and I just really enjoyed working with him and I thought he had a lot of talent so while he was here we told you guys that we wanted to do some type of series on my channel on Sundays that would be his thing and I'm gonna let him do whatever he wants I trust him I like his stuff and I'm very curious to see what he does so hopefully you guys are too so this is episode 1 of the show he made all right enjoy the video hi there most you guys probably know me as Shane's hater but my name is Bobby and this this is this is different this is a new thing for me I've never made a video that's gone up to a channel with 12 million subscribers that's a lot of people if you've been watching the videos I've been doing on this channel as Shane for the past couple months you know what's going on with me I just moved out here to LA to make videos with Shane and this is the first one I have been a big fan of YouTube and youtubers for the longest time so coming out here to California where the majority of them live has been very strange one thing I did notice about being out here in LA is that youtubers out here dress a little differently than I do where's my supreme and Gucci and BAE I'm currently wearing like a little pirate sailor boy shirt and my pants have a hole in the crotch and an asshole the fashion industry and YouTube have started have a very interesting relationship very similar to the way that the fashion industry and hip-hop music have had a very close relationship they think this is only something that's really been happening in the past little bit past few years and it's something I'm interested in learning more about so today I'm gonna be joined by my girlfriend Jordan it's a water bottle and a bank please show it to us so she stays hydrated for the whole mission my friend Elliot it's already gotten so hot okay I don't know how you're staying and hey I'm just pretending like I'm not hot and my cameraman slash friend Yale Yale's the cameraman he's filming oh yeah we're gonna go to the stores and look at the products that these other youtubers are looking at and try to find something we can afford within a full budget of $1,000 I am so excited to get out there and look at all this insanely expensive clothing let's go [Music] okay let's with an actual list we know we need a supreme shirt we need a watch watch you watch gucci sunglasses young sister on your color fight I guess maybe I should get a haircut you think I've had this hair growing out for a very long time I won't be like cut cutting it but I'll be getting a trim a trim you okay with that Jordan is that good enough for you let's get it maybe a hoverboard no I won't I can do it this seems like an adequate list seems like a list for sure lists okay so our first stop is the supreme store I think yeah it's right here you've never been to a screamer we've been outside a supreme store here's the thing we can go into a shop that's right up there that also sells supreme that it doesn't have a line that is the exact same price as if you were going into the supreme store where there's like it's literally there these suckers all the same shape it's right over here that seemed pranks how much you think this is gonna be jerk how much do you think a supreme shirt is like just been normal like white one that there's some freaky dollar 160 okay I'm gonna say it's going to be like 120 [Music] so people gloves so there's a Louis Vuitton supreme shirt for $6,000 why okay so we're looking for the standard supreme shirt let's see like this antisocial social quality shirts $100 just for the white t-shirt oh this is also praying buck the president supreme well it's $150 if I put it up with a stain on it okay could I just shows the t-shirt that I want I think is $1,500 they can't be right why is it so hard just for me babies it's only $500 it's a purebred dog so we can't find that shirt for anything less than $1,500 we're gonna have to settle with a different kind of supreme shirt garbage Farrington's let's go spend $100 on this t-shirt [Music] so waiting in line that I just noticed that they have supreme fanny packs I think that will make up for the lack of teacher Jordan might not be happy but we have to do it do you think Jordan would kill me if I doubt she would murder you like you're just like okay you really use like your heart [Music] so next we have the Fairfax optical lab we're gonna look at their sunglasses [Music] so most sunglasses and just glasses in general come from like one or two manufacturers so like I can neither confirm nor deny what specific brands but like most sunglasses these were probably made by the same people that that make Ravens wake up sheeple how much really carefully those really go hand them back to him he just said that this is right here altogether this is about $15,000 plenty now this oh my god so we are absolutely in that price range you guys have anything in the likes one hundred and fifty dollar price range yeah we have some things called valleys are you looking for more of that oval shape yeah okay it's literally like Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas so you like the yellow and you want get the second pair ready yeah okay what's the dog's name thing he's got a man bina no merely adopted the dark I was born in a small dead buyer didn't see the lights until I became a man [Music] we're going in here to look for joggers and see if we can find anything you know those pants that are like normal pants but they don't stop - gets about here that's what we're looking for gonna be dope I'm thinking we're gonna maybe go with these they seem like they're like joggers joggers are the most plain thing of all time but it's what everyone wears what if instead of getting pants we could go back over there no stop right there remember when Jordan said that they can't buy the bag he already said no but if what if remember how Jordan already said no she won't okay we're gonna try to call her okay hey babe hey we were looking at joggers and stuff the cheapest option is 150 dollars what if I wear my adidas pants and I get the supreme bag instead so then we have both of them would that work [Music] this is the baggy shit ever hopefully gonna need some smalls fill they didn't have anything but medium so so so that's we got so we have giant floppy saggy giant floppy saggy mediums awesome first thing well this is a Rolex Daytona and it's actually 16 oh my god what would be like the cheapest yeah which one which one do we think kind of do I do you like big faces or big dolls yes but if you'd like something that looks similar to a Rolex then that okay is it you know I have the most thin wrists in the entire world we see the left handed right oh no I'm right oh yeah because if you're right-handed this is how you work the wife oh yeah yeah what do you want yeah let's do let's do okay hold up pause the video we are interrupting you to bring you a commercial break although so far this video we have spent an obscene amount of money when you're

and then actually legitimately nervous I didn't think I was going to be and they got here and my stomach started feeling a little sick I haven't got it cut in a lot of months a lot of months I started growing it a year and two months ago I've got tiny little trim since then I don't know what I'm gonna do with it I don't like show what am I gonna do with it we're gonna see what the stylist says yes yes they were ready and they don't know we're talking about I don't know if the point might work okay there's someone coming over oh my god okay we like just look at we didn't even talk about what are you gonna do oh my god I feel like you might want to do a little bit more than just [Music] she told so amount to get in the cut we're gonna cut away so you don't know what's going on yet you'll see it in a minute it'll be a big surprise have different hair now Jordan what do you think so total for the haircut it was what 130 150 150 I think 150 $150 was as much for this as it was for those pants that I don't I don't really want I told you not to buy it so we're trying to find where we can get a hoverboard and a vape I think those are the last two things we need right now they have 100 a best buy at Best Buy okay so we have to get the best rate really quick unless [Music] Hilda what if they're out by the time we get there Jordan do you think they're gonna be gone okay oh my god here we are finally in the hoverboard aisle every board hoverboard hoverboard not a hoverboard that not a hoverboard focusing is one of them they were clearly four right here were you doing this just to push us forward narratively this is two hundred and twenty nine dollars Jordan how much how much money do we have left then that's seven too much I can't believe you're actually doing this I think it might actually come with a vein it just already might be in the box okay so it's the next day we kind of forgot you have to charge electronic appliances and we had to give these little guys time to charge shop they fit so I guess it wait you know is it time do my about to become an LA youtuber Bobby it's time [Music] Damon how do you do it again he's their strongest family in the gangers we out here buying Gucci we out of here buy-in bait we out here in the supreme we got to click bait we got the thumbnails we got the brand deals oh shit this Luke total cost me around 950 dollars or is it a thousand dollars unless it's $150 haircut 130 dollars 100 dollars how much for the pants 150 dollars $100 $50 17 I think how much is the LA YouTuber life worth everything so in the end I did end up enjoying a little bit of the LA YouTube for life for as stupid as it is the hoverboard was actually really nice and ended up actually being kind of cool to watch I don't care that much about the pants I hate these pants and although I am definitely not going to continue to wear all of this clothing I did have a really good time hanging all my friends and learning all kinds of new shit about watches and clothing and and the lives of LA youtubers now this show is still in its infancy and we are still developing it so if you have any ideas that you think would be fantastic for one of these videos if there's something on YouTube you really want us to talk about or something you'd like us to go investigate leave a comment down below or you can tweet me or Jordan or Elliot our hats are gonna be right here on the screen and down in the description thank you guys so much for giving this video your time I don't take it lightly and I'm very excited to be making more content for you guys in the very near future actually next week you can click right here on the screen to watch a new video I just put out recently on my personal channel Bobby burns oh give me first video so unabashedly self-promoting thank you guys so much for watching this video and I'll see you later 732 dollars in tax good job you piss well that is not what I wanted at all please high-five me Oh 
guys we just did a podcast right gaddy's yeah we talked about everything we talked about love relationships sex vibrators and hybridizing with your hands nice writing with your hands us making out my net worth you just looked at my mouth you listen to the podcast hey what's up you guys yes welcome back to another creepy video now I don't know about you but there is nothing scarier to me than a hospital the sounds of people crying and being in pain as you're walking down the halls the smell of blood and sometimes even death the awful food don't get me started all in all hospitals are probably my least favorite place in the world but there's something that we need I mean if there's something wrong with us we go to the hospital and they fix it right well that's how it's supposed to work but sometimes they mess up and they must sup bad no I can't believe I'm even saying this I can't believe this is true but medical mistakes are the third leading cause of death in America that's right number one heart disease number two cancer and number three medical errors over 250,000 people a year die because of some fuckup that happened at the hospital stunning medical news tonight about how many Americans have something go wrong when they go to the hospital the astronomical new number one in three patients will face a mistake during a hospital stay yeah one in three which means it's probably gonna happen to a third of the people that watch this video well today we're gonna be looking at some of the craziest medical mistakes that have ever happened and some of these are incredibly disturbing so if you are scared of hospitals already this is only gonna make it worse okay I'm going to start with something that is one of my biggest fears and it is not gonna make it any better first we're gonna talk about death from an MRI now I'm sure you've all seen them MRI machines are terrifying massive scary tubes that are in the dark and you go into them and you can't move now the M in MRI stands for magnetic magnet the size of an MRI machine cuz that's what it is yeah that huge machine is literally a big powerful magnet and obviously if there's anything metal around this magnet I remember going into these machines when I was a kid and even recently and hyperventilating because all I could think of was like oh my god there's a wire behind my teeth what if the wire gets through my teeth and it's the fucking magnet or what if I forgot to think my keys out of my pocket and it rips my pants off or what if the metal in my lake from when I broke my ankle just works out of my leg like literally the scariest thing I could think of now obviously they take as many precautions as they can sometimes mistakes do happen so obviously metal objects should be nowhere near an MRI machine when it's in use but in 2001 in a New York Hospital that happened there was a young man named Michael Colin beanie and he was getting a scan the nurse walked in to the room with a large metal oxygen tank as you can imagine it did not go well that big metal oxygen tank flew to the MRI machine and struck Michael in the head as it went now this killed him take a look at this video researchers make after Michael's death it shows just how fast that metal oxygen tank kills him okay that was really dark so I'm gonna move to something a little lighter but honestly very scary to me this is the medical mistake of the accidental wrists and we've all heard the crazy plastic surgery stories of people who go in to look like somebody and they come out looking very different I mean some patients go under the knife so often that sometimes they literally can't even open their eyes Marilyn Lise wants to look a little younger but after eyelid surgery she's unable to fully close her eyes I mean people are changing themselves beyond recognition they want the perfect teeth the perfect cheeks perfect body and then sometimes you might think they go too far and then sometimes it gets really dark for example what happened to former beauty queen Solange make no no now Solange went in to get her butt injected because she wanted to make it a little bit bigger well a few days later she died some kind of foreign matter traveled from the injection material through her bloodstream all the way to her lungs and stopped her from breathing all because of a butt implant that got fucked up now that story is awful but this one is worse Alexander Bias was a model an actor and former Miss New Mexico and mr. universe runner-up now Alexander had a small tumor removed from his chest and he wanted to fix it well he went to the office of a man named dr. Renaldo who's also known as the butcher of South Beach yeah the butcher Mya's his desire to revive his career brought him here to this office in Miami Beach the man inside told him he was a doctor who could literally turn back the clock restoring BIOSes chest to the rugged perfection that had brought him so much attention now after Alexander's Paquette surgery from literally con artists who are not surgeons Alexander wasn't given the two male pecs that he asked for he was given two female breasts after implant surgery to boost his chest muscles even more Alexander Baez wound up like this just listen how the South Beach Police Department described it it literally like a horror movie mr. bias who had been given ketamine an anesthetic used on animals kept waking up in tears as mr. Renaldo tried to force the two large implants into his chest this is the craziest part this insane surgery was filmed the captain of the police department said it was a butcher job you wouldn't want to have happen to your dog doctor in all those skip town after this happened because he had a bunch of other people that he had given bullshit surgeries to that he was trying to run away from too but luckily they found him and they put him in jail only for seven and a half years but I don't know oh and by the way in case you were wondering he literally used cake spatulas to shove the breast implants into Alexander's chest ah oh my god uh-huh we got it we got it okay now this next thing we're going to talk about is something I talked about six months ago so if you've already heard about this you can skip this part of the video but if you haven't oh my god this is going to ruin go into the hospital for you if you haven't heard of something called anesthesia awareness I'm sorry patients who remain wide awake and paralyzed while doctors cut them open it is excruciatingly painful as you'd imagine it's also more common than you might think that's right you're literally being put under to go into surgery can't move you can't talk you can't open your eyes but you can feel every single God everything every scalpel if you're getting heart surgery you'll feel them crack your ribs open if you're getting stomach surgery you'll feel them burning it your stomach ha ha and you can't do anything you literally have to lay there and be in your head and not be able to get out now like I said before this is something that happens a lot one in 700 people will have this happen to them what in 700 you know what that means I'm really bad at math but if 2 million people watch this video one in 700 I'm really bad about I don't know a shit ton of you guys might have this happen to you and YouTube now the amount of pain that you're going through during the surgery and you're not able to get out or move or tell somebody to stop is so insane that some people think about killing themselves there was a pain that you cannot deal with it just goes on you're screaming inside your head well in 2006 a man actually did Sherman Sizemore took his own life after having an experience with anesthesia awareness his family says that he was conscious through 16 minutes of his stomach surgery oh my god sorry that actually just made me sick if you didn't see this video I did a while ago I interviewed a girl who actually had this happen to her and she was having awareness during an insane surgery and oh my god just just but while your flex is burning you can sell it which is something you just never think about what a surgery smiling but while you're smelling it you're also kind of tasting it and in case you're wondering run flesh smells and oh yeah it is very very real so please if you are going to get surgery make sure they have a brain monitor make sure you ask about anesthesia awareness because some hospitals do have ways of making sure it doesn't happen but not don't oh it's just it's too much all right this last thing I'm gonna talk about is I'm sure what you've all been waiting for things that have been accidentally left inside of a person's body that's right this happens once again a lot just from 2005 to 2012 772 incidences of foreign objects left in patients occurred what now this happened so often in the medical world that they have a phrase for retained surgical items or you know shit we fuckin left in five operas him now obviously there's been sis your scalpels and other very very scary things left inside of people's bodies but sometimes they're little but they cause even more damage there was a woman in Sofia in Kentucky who had a small sponge left inside of her for four years now the sponge rotted into her body and caused permanent bowel damage now because of this huge mistake she got 2.5 million dollars I mean yeah that's a lot of money but her body is permanently hurt from that situation now this one is worse in 2000 there was a man named Donald Church who went in for surgery because of what looked like a beer gut in this photo now it was not a beer gut at all it was a huge tumor in his abdomen the size of a bowling ball now luckily they removed it with no complications so they thought 74 days later he had to go back to the hospital because he felt awful and he kept collapsing now I'm gonna warn you this is going to make you kind of sick sit down if you're not when he went back to the hospital they found out that they had left a 13 inch stainless steel tool inside of his stomach oh my god when I heard this when I literally got diarrhea now he's okay they removed it and he's fine I mean I don't know how but he is but 13 inches I can't even like that's just imagine having this inside of you that was a weird visual let's put this by now if you've ever had any kind of surgery many kind might want to feel around your body and see if there's anything that feels off because there is a huge chance that you have something that the doctor might have left inside of you and that random metal object might be slowly killing you all right now you probably thought that was gonna be it but it's not I'm gonna give you a bonus round know you've probably never heard of this I hadn't either until I started looking into it there is something called internal surgical fires that's right a spontaneous fire that could erupt in your body during surgery no surgical fires sound crazy but they happen and they happened 600 times a year that's like twice a day I'm bad at math and I think that's almost twice a day all right here is one of the stories and it comes from a girl named Lauren and it is intense I kind of asked her eyebrow is still there and she said that that was gonna be the least of my problems both eyes swollen shut with large blisters hanging from her skin Lauren was rushed to Metro Health Medical Center's burn unit now Lauren was told because of the problems that happen during surgery she would have a sunburn effect on her face well when her parents unwrapped her facial bandages they were horrified Lauren was the victim of a surgical fire now this fire occurred during surgery either on the outside or the inside of our body now inside of a hospital room there are tons of different items that could cause a fire I mean you have lasers gas tanks plastic wires so many different ingredients that could be used to start a fire and think about it this way with all the alcohol that they use to clean you and swab on your body and how flammable human fat is that's asking for a fire now luckily hospitals are getting a lot smarter about how to prevent this and how to deal with it but it is a real thing and it is scary well there you guys go hopefully you enjoyed all of these scary medical mistakes now this video in particular was really hard for me to make it was hard for me to think about it was just all of it he's literally my worst nightmare so I hope it gives you nightmares too because I don't want to be all right you guys if you want more videos like this I was thinking about doing a video about the scariest things that have ever happened in an emergency room but if you want that give me a thumbs up let me know also make sure to subscribe to my channel right down below the notification vote because I make new videos every day and if you want to see the full video I did about anesthesia awareness it is nuts so you might pass out I literally almost passed out when I was filming it I'll put a link to it right in the top of the description all right you guys I'm gonna go and if you have to go to the hospital soon good luck bye 
okay my new boyfriend [Music] that's literally what my legs look like when I was 18 that's it just dandy yes I barely fit in my office chair oh my god please can we see that no I want to see your pain

with arms okay I literally by the way side note sad music in school I didn't have a desk the teacher had to make one in the back of the room at a table with a little chair I still to this day I'm afraid of chairs for arms still that's why I always freak out when there's chairs around so go sit in that chair this is bringing a new meaning to the word trigger yeah and you're walking you have to

good when you reach the third that sound opal its abyss exactly how I used to stay after school mom no one had sex with me again I wanted him to know what I've struggled with in the past so he can understand me better and I used to be fat so I want him to be fat for a day and he's afraid of going bald so on-ball birthday and Garett death cuz he woke it doesn't really matter you want some chocolate rims you're freaking me out because you look like your dad this picture and how sad you've heard mine it reminds me right now oh my god it was on the list I was my brother a memory that is just like burned in my head for some reason his shame was gonna start high school and we were gonna go shopping and we went to Target if you remember Shane but it was really the first time that I saw him so frustrated because trying on clothes yeah because they had like extra extra-large t-shirts and stuff but I don't know it wasn't going really well and I literally like had to step away and go away and I like fine though it's like right now well you probably walked the other way and cried fuck I am so dark but I know he went back in the dressing room and he was really mad and then I was hurt for him and so I went off and cried and you know but it was tough um just to prove that nothing's changed yeah because I'm afraid of getting new pants and they might not fit they're literally breaking yeah Shana because I'm afraid I don't want to go try on pants is what if they don't fit what if I'm fat again that's literally what happens every single time I try enclosed I witnessed a couple of times well maybe today I'll get your pants yeah let because you're beautiful and you don't need to feel that way anymore where are we to get parents I think we should go to Target really yeah cuz that's where all went down yeah their dressing room mirrors are know you're gonna go to take this suit off tonight that's not gonna come off if that it's like a real-life nightmare hold on is like what's going on so here's the situation the plan was to go into the restaurant force him to try to get to a booth so he knows what it feels like and I want to talk about this out loud and on camera because I feel like this video is taking a turn and I don't really know how to deal with it like I don't want people to think we're making fun of fat people like I literally was fat and still think I have that so it's not that also it's all getting like way too real when I came up with this idea I was like oh me and Garrett we're talking you know this would be funny like oh it's it's funny kind of but real because it's like oh I want you to see what it's like to try on clothes and do all these things so you know my past and I think what's hard for me is like I'm reliving everything now I'm fucking crying like my mom I'm reliving everything and I'm staring at like literally what I was and also how I still feel and like seeing my mom cry it's just all it's all taken really fucked up turn and I don't know what to do well you know a little bit of like two cents here is like at your best to you is like a person who makes comedy and does this is all you've ever done this take your darkness and turn it into art with your short films with your books with everything with literally your entire career thus far and I think these issues that have haunted us so deeply this weird thing that we connected over is like severe body issues that control every waking hour with you with me Pingo like hey you know all we can do is laugh at these and try to make light of them because otherwise we're just gonna be wallowing in sorrow and that's not good for anyone so I feel like this video I know it got to a pretty real place but it's also us just trying to be like hey we're all in this together we all have darkness and because I deal with so many issues i thoughtyou knowing how it felt or even a little bit of how it felt would bring us closer or whatever and then what I think I've realized is like I don't wanna so sorry I don't want you to feel anything like I feel I don't want you to effort like seeing you sad and like on a couch like can't move like don't want to talk like whatever like I just like I don't want you to feel like that cuz it fucking sucks if fucking suck I hate feeling like this all the time it's nice to know where you're coming from although like me being in a suit for eight hours can't even compare to it like you've obviously gone through in your life it's nice to like get a glimpse of it to see where you're coming from because a lot of the times we'll get in like minor arguments about things that I just don't understand but it's because of like a huge issue from your past that I've never dealt with yeah it's all crazy how the universe is happening like my pants ripped yesterday like yesterday I noticed a hole in my pants because I've been wearing them every single day for like two years and I need to get new ones and I'm too afraid because I'm afraid that I'm not gonna fit into pants so maybe we do go to Target and I try out pants and I find new pants and then we go back home and we all become ourselves again and just burn your old burn your old camp fire pants order some pizza alright let's lighten the mood let's go to Target okay we're out target is God what are you doing I'm gonna take it off when I'm ready I'm nervous that's not helping that's gonna make you look crazier I think what we should do is take off the actual suit you look like a gentleman oh my god there's so much happened people are you from behind like mutants it's not true I'm fine there's no hiding then don't do it that is mean it's on my time that looks so real that's somebody a fox we're here for business we have to find me pants right I'm not doing blue jeans I'd rather fucking die what about Dickies what does that mean they're like work pants I don't work I'm a youtuber what's the darkest shade look at me on Twitter well we won't talk about that what is that Lenox it where's Big Lake fit and should I go to the mom section okay I'm gonna grab some I'm just gonna grab I don't even care you just look like me before phase two gesturing this downstairs [Music] try these on I'm actually freaked out and nobody's in here but think that usually around that comes in and tells me and like [Music] [Music] new pants and I want to come yet okay all right [Music] okay squad what do you think of the new pants pretty similar last ones but they look great in their new and that's what matters so tired emotionally and mentally and all I want to do is rip off my scalp and eat croissants and almonds [Music] I just want arme and Winchester [Music] alright Devon's coming back over to take all this shit off of us so let's talk about what we learned I learned to genuinely not judge somebody just from the surface I know that sounds so cliche but it's so true it's so easy to just like splurt out something and somebody that you don't necessarily know anything about I well I don't want to be dead and I don't want you to be dead and I don't want anyone here to be dead that's nice but it wouldn't be sick as held to be a ghost I've been thinking a lot about that today you look insane [Music] yeah okay oh my god so this video series took a turn when I thought of the idea for these videos I didn't really think it through I guess I mean I just thought it would be kind of fun and stupid and silly and it got very real I don't think I've ever talked to my mom about how she was feeling what I was and when I was overweight I had no idea that it was like that hard on her because I was so focused on how hard it was for me to be overweight but it was good to see you know Ryland live a day my old shoes I mean I know a lot of you guys watching have issues with your way like I do even though those issues are never really going to go away I think it's important to appreciate the people around you who are helping you cope with them today I realized how lucky I am you know like to have a group of people who love me and who support me and who cheer me on when I'm doing something as simple as trying on pants hard you guys have helped you enjoy these videos I don't even know who else was up and that was insane but I came up with this slogan when I was younger and it's super fucking cheesy but I stand by it you are you no matter how much of you [Music] [Applause] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] 
yes okay it is like 1:00 in the morning right now I had to run downstairs and grab my camera I'm having a moment I am feeling a lot of things cheeto is shook actually he doesn't care he literally doesn't even know I exist so me and Rylan were laying in bed and we somehow came across this random YouTube channel of this girl who was singing covers I think the way we got there was because we were watching a Jacob sartorius video don't ask and she did a cover of a Jacob sartorius song and she had like 100 views on it and when I watched it I literally got out of my bed ran downstairs Rylan has no idea that I'm filming him I was so inspired and so fucking shulk that i grabbed my camera and I'm like iiiii I like I need to know more about her I need to find her I need to look so crazy I need

I love her but you know what before we get too far let's watch a few more videos and actually decide whether or not she has the talent and the star quality okay where is my Apple TV remote okay I

[Music] [Applause] one what you are about to watch may make you question everything you thought you knew viewer discretion is advised hey what's up you guys yes welcome back now you might have noticed a few changes around here we got a new intro and your background same shirt but the main thing that is going to change with these conspiracy videos is I'm going to go even darker so if you are triggered by suicide or murder or possible abuse of children and Hollywood then you might want to leave this video now today we're gonna talk about a lot of different theories some involving the secrets of battle some involving a possible world war 3 and we're even gonna talk to the star of Riverdale Madelene bench about some of the very disturbing Riverdale conspiracy theories alright you guys let's get into it that's right we're starting with Apple conspiracies and you might have noticed another little thing I added before every conspiracy from now on I'm gonna put a little believability scale one Illuminati sign means this shit stupid but five Illuminati signs means this isn't even a theory and this is a fact and that's exactly what this first one is so we have been talking about Apple purposely slowing down our phones every time they have a new one coming out forever and then recently we learned that it's true today's tech bites Apple admits to slowing down older iPhones so apple says it slows down the processors on older iPhones to prevent battery issues that could cause the phones to suddenly shut down or restart now over the years there's been tons of studies about this every time a new iPhone comes out the Google search results for why is my iPhone slowing down skyrocket well people started going from theorizing to actually pursuing lawsuits against Apple and because of all these lawsuits Apple finally admitted what we as lithium batteries age they get weaker so we had to slow the phone to avoid the phone's crashing to compensate for the naturally deteriorating battery or in other words we purposely slowed down your phones you fucking idiots and the only reason they admitted this was because they were getting sued and it makes you wonder what else are they hiding I mean think about it Apple owns us they have our private photos or voice memos our finger prints our face scans and they claim that they keep it all private but they also claim that they didn't slow down their phone so life imitating art we've seen it over and over again Donald Trump being the president on The Simpsons and then Donald Trump being president in real life a statue in the 1600s and then Lindsay Lohan passed out in 2007 outside a club and then of course a crazy one Walter White on Breaking Bad and then right after the show premiered it was a real Walter White who got caught building a massive meth Empire in Alabama and then sometimes there's ones that are too dark to even think about but I said we were gonna go there so let's go now back in 2008 the woman in Jodi arias murdered her ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander Travis Alexander never had a chance and she did this by stabbing him 29 times slitting his throat and then shooting him in the head now the craziest part about this murder she was taking pictures while she was doing it now Alexander was in the shower and Jodi walked into the bathroom holding a digital camera well then she opened up the shower door and started taking pictures now she said it was just for fun I was like I just have an idea I saw this thing in accountant Klein at once they looked really good and this is the darkest part here is the picture she took right as she pulled out the knife and this is the last picture of him alive huh that picture is so terrifying to me the look on his face the subtlety of a fear confusion it's just awful the one that you showed me mr. Dayton looking right at you well the next picture after that is him on the floor after he has just been stabbed now you're probably wondering Shane what does this have to do with life imitating art well when all of these pictures came out people started noticing that it looked familiar now I'm sure you guys remember the famous scene from the movie psycho where the main character got stabbed to death in her shower well then people started taking the famous shots from that scene putting them next to the last pictures of Travis and they are eerily identical [Music] [Music] uh-huh and I don't think it was premeditated I don't think Jody went into that saying oh I want a remake psycho I think the universe has a way of connecting things like that they see directors have a vision well what if Alfred Hitchcock did have a vision and in his vision he saw the scene happening so he recreated it in his movie what if that vision was of Travis what if the universe put that in his head what if that's what happened with the Simpsons or with Breaking Bad it makes you think what if everything is planned out and everything is connected and what if we can look at a heart and try to predict what's gonna happen in the future I mean if there's a movie called world war three life will definitely imitate that and probably soon now we've talked about news channels faking things for a long time they've been caught setting up a crime scene and filming in front of it even though it didn't exist as many as four bodies may be buried here it can get really fucked up really fast on June 4th CNN got accused of staging and anti-isis protests in London now this is a behind-the-scenes clip and it's insane so first you see them setting up the shot of the protest then you see the producers putting all of the protesters in their place and then you see the producers laying down flowers in front of the protesters feed and putting flowers on their hands and then moments later you see what it looks like on the actual news you don't want to show you now viewers it's a wonderful scene there are flowers on the street here and ladies with hashtag turn to love yeah they literally act like oh here we are we just caught a protest we saw them placing people we saw them handing them signs putting flowers at their feet now of course CNN came out and said no no no it was not fake we just set up a shot and we had some of the protesters from over there come over here and maybe that's true but it's hard to believe the news sometimes when they do things like this good morning well obviously we're getting a nice break from the rain but not the flooding this is essentially now a part of the Passaic River and this neighborhood yeah she was in a fucking canoe just to scare everybody oh my god the waters so high we're in canoes but one of my favorite moments of the news getting caught faking something happened with Nancy Grace now in this clip Nancy Grace is doing a satellite interview with another reporter ha kinda looks similar right I want you to pay attention to the red truck and the bus red truck red truck bus bus Nancy Grace and the woman she's having a satellite interview with is in the same parking lot you see this red SUV drive behind Ashleigh Banfield and then immediately behind Nancy Grace and not just the same parking lot three parking spots away from each other what why did they do a satellite interview why are they thinking that I mean that was insane but the biggest scandal of all time when it comes to faking the news is this clip back in 1990 a CNN reporter named Charles Jaco was covering the Persian Gulf War now he's supposedly in Saudi Arabia outside of a hotel well then an angry staff member at CNN leaked this clip years later geopolitics by Dan Quayle I know what you're thinking well maybe they're just having fun but then he starts playing with what looks to be a prop of a missile this is a Scud now when you detect this you can tell it's been launched thank you I know like why well then he starts playing with his emergency masks let me just sighs my mask and fit it for a second just like I always do it seems kind of like a set right there's no wind when the camera pans over you see some wood it almost looks like a fake wall well but then you see what it looks like when he's reporting live [Applause] to show you where the missiles might be going like wow that's different he's panicking holding his earpiece well remember earlier in the clip when he was asking whether or not he should test out that facemask you're about to find out why CD if you need to take cover I notice that you've got your gas mask in your hands if you need to put it on wheels do so at home to take cover I'd say I mean come on now you're probably wondering what did that man say when this clip started to go viral well he sent an email to the person that posted the clip and he said this our coverage was on the roof of a hotel the plywood background was erected as a guard against the sand and wind storms and the clowning around in the video is just that we use black humor to deflect the tension of covering scud missile assaults and then he showed some pictures of what the actual hotel in Saudi Arabia looks like and it looks pretty similar you have the blue walls you have the palm trees you can even see the plywood that they set up to guard from the winds and as much as I hate to say this because you know how much I love a conspiracy I believe I mean all the proof is there it was years ago why would he still lie about it but man oh that clip was weird side note that's something I want to start incorporating more into these videos too if I find out that a theory I've talked about has been debunked I want to bring it up because I think people should be looking deeper and deeper into them and not just thinking everything is true because some of these theories end up being bullshit boy oh I almost look stupid whoo-hoo I know what you're thinking Shane how are their conspiracy theories about wildfires I had the same question then I fell down the hole on the internet and oh my god so as you already know there have been so many fires spreading through California the last few months and some of the footage is insane right off the freeway an entire Mountain filled with flames celebrity's house is getting evacuated thank God for this event this morning because I got up at 5:30 and everyone came to the house and they're like we need to leave and the fires are incredibly spread out but some of the footage of the aftermath had a lot of people confused so the recent California fires are very strange and suspects in drone footage of the aftermath we see houses completely obliterated and turned to ash while the surrounding landscapes and trees are totally fine that's right if you look at some of this footage all of the houses are completely leveled but then all the trees in the neighborhood are fine you'll notice here that stores and restaurants are wiped out while other things are still in perfect shape well that I looked into it a couple scientists came out and said well the trees are wetter than usual so that's why they're not that flammable but then I did a quick google and I found a lot of videos of neighborhood trees burning down to nothing now one of the craziest clips I think I've ever seen is a clip of a tree that a guy found that was burning from the inside out a haunting but mesmerizing scene from the wildfires in Sonoma County a man came across this tree burning from the inside out now that situation doesn't happen in a forest fire the only time trees really burned like that is when they're struck by lightning I know that was intense but this is what the trees look like right after that yeah they look exactly like the tree that supposedly caught fire during one of the wildfires so you're probably thinking Shane where is this going one word lasers laser okay hear me out I know this sounds crazy and I a hundred percent thought it was bullshit until I really started looking into it now the theory is that the government might have been testing out some direct weapons now these weapons would be in the form of lasers and the damage they would cause would be way worse than any fire could do imagine if the government did figure out how to do laser weapons kind of damage they can do to their enemies here's a laser of a power of 1 watt a 1 watt laser can light a match imagine then the power of a 500 trillion watt laser that's exactly what they've built here at the National Ignition facility in California yeah that's right they literally are building that giant laser in California now this is the craziest part in a movie back in the 80s called the Robocop this happened top story Santa Barbara 10,000 acres of wooded residential land were scorched in an instant when a laser cannon aboard the Strategic Defense peace platform ha literally laser weapons hit the same exact locations that the California wildfires are and here's the thing that's even crazier when a fire burns down a house it still leaves some of the house yeah it's black and yeah it's all fucked up but there's a little bit of structure still there but when you look at the aftermath of these California wildfires there is nothing not just houses have been leveled down to the ground but even cars glass and metal have been melted so how could glass and metal in these cars be melted how could these houses be leveled down to nothing lasers now remember earlier when I showed you that clip of the tree that was burning from the inside out now supposedly that happened from the wildfires but it looked more like it happened from getting struck by lightning and what did that clip look like lasers there's even tons of clips of people saying that their own house lit on fire but nothing around them did there was no other fire around us it just caught some of the shrub I guess embers I'm not sure and to this day we still don't know the true reason why all of these fires so far apart from each other happened yeah they're saying the high winds and the dry land but these specific fires were some of the biggest fires in history and this is the final thing I heard that made me think maybe this isn't complete bullshit now Trump is all about winning if we go into a war he wants to conquer it I'm really good at where I love war in a certain way if we have a big weapon he probably wants to make it bigger where I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose any voters okay so if he found out that the government did have the capability of laser weapons and he knew that North Korea is really wanting us dead right now then why wouldn't he want to do a test and see how the lasers worked I want to be unpredictable but obviously he can't test it on another country because then that would start a war and what place in his own country does he hate more than anywhere else Los Angeles some celebs are just not a fan of the Donald he despises the people in Hollywood he despises celebrities because they all talk shit about him he loves tweeting about KFC and beautiful chocolate cake and put them all together and this is what you get so why wouldn't he press that button and say you know what fuck it let's blow up LA it's lasers because if you remember some of the most affected people by these fires were celebrities comedian Chelsea Handler tweeted just evacuated my house it's like Donald Trump is setting the world on fire so not only did Trump get a test out these laser weapons but he gotta get some revenge on some of his Hollywood enemies I'm about to rock this place down now listen I know that all sounds very crazy but let's not forget about life imitating art 10,000 acres of wooded residential land were scorched in an instant when a laser cannon misfired today during routine startup tests so there has been some pretty dark rumors about some people in charge over at Nickelodeon for a while and recently a threat on Twitter started to go viral now besides the fact that there are some pretty sexual and creepy images in some of these Nickelodeon shows there's also some very creepy jokes that probably shouldn't be in a kid show one time my brother found a vacuum cleaner and I church basement you took it home and now I keeps it in his room you should call the church and Tommy has it oh they wouldn't want it back yeah she's referring to a young boy using a vacuum to suck his dick on a kid show now they also call out that the word hobknocker is used in iCarly oh yeah do you guys remember me Collins that I'm not just talking knockout from America sings well here is the definition of hobknocker when a guy hits you in the face with his penis one might call him hob-noxious anyway and then the thread goes on to show some more creepy visuals I mean this one is and then we get to finish dang dude that's some soft footage that's what I've said that's a nice bud right now if you're a fan of some of these shows you might remember that there's a lot of feet involved and icarly you see one of the characters getting her foot rubbed and victorious you see ariana grande literally trying to suck her own toes and there's so many creepy foot moments in these shows I mean going to score ketchup on them miranda cosgrove staring at them two young girls putting their feet up to the camera there's even a behind-the-scenes picture of ariana standing next to a flood pointing at it and then on the official salmon cat Twitter it said this salmon cat tomorrow right on the bottom of your foot take a pic and use hashtag salmon cat Saturday will retweet and follow until our fingers get sore and a lot of kids did all of these children wrote on their feet took pictures of them and posted them on Twitter oh and then of course there's other moments in the show that looked even more graphic and then this give up the juice I think the foot thing is what weirds me out the most because foot fetishes are a huge deal and having kids show their feet and talk about it that much is fucking weird and then of course there's little things like if you look in the background of the episodes you might see a hidden penis on a wall I mean it's not that big of a surprise that kids TV shows might do some evil stuff I mean the fact that Disney approved a quarter ride that looked like this it just proves that there might be some evil people in charge of kids entertainment and maybe they're trying to get in the minds of kids and make them evil I mean think about it it was the biggest kid's entertainer right now and would you say he's doing some pretty evil stuff we found a dead body [Music] all right so this is something new I wanted to start doing with these videos with some of our conspiracies about TV shows and movies I want to start interviewing people that are actually in them so today we're gonna be talking about some pretty disturbing riverdale conspiracies with the star herself yes of course you did okay great my hair looks like shit let's do it okay guys I'm here with before we get into the conspiracies because there's a lot of them about this show I want to know about your life because overnight you kind of skyrocketed right yeah probably I say a little over a year ago I had 45 cars and screams and then I'm at like something which is four million miles did the TV network make you do any like training or any classes like this get ready for hey yeah yeah we had to do media training which was like intensive like this is so weird we had learned how to get under the car without flashing was like a very specific way were you like you cover yourself in the door of the car and then you get on with the opposite leg stuff but like you're like isn't like open there's a class yeah and you have to pass it's good to do it until you feel like you don't fuck the thing is there a way to get out of a car without looking fat because I need that okay it is surprisingly dark for a teacher yeah but some of the conspiracy theories about the show go even darker than murder and I want to talk about I don't know what your conspiracy theories are some now I'm like nervous okay so your character Sheryl blossom yeah that's brother Jesus now he died in the first season that's kind of what the whole person sees but there are a lot of theories that show when Jason might have been more than brothers maybe yeah that theory has been debunked by myself well have you seen all of the proof proof so a video made by youtuber named Smurfs vlogs started going viral and some of the evidence is pretty crazy damn I should have made that video first okay so the first time that we see your guys's characters is in a car [Music] and the song says tell me I'm your baby tell me you'll never leave me tell me that you'll kiss me are you scared Jason it's just a creepy song that's why we played up but you guys are driving the car together for the first gen and Sheryl blossom drove out to Sweetwater River for an early morning boat ride I know do you want to know why yes I can give you is it gonna be interesting for your video if I tell you my or do you want to keep it just like well there's a lot more than that the one give me the rest of it you call from your soul right you guys share a milkshake together and there's just a lot of creepy imagery of you guys seeing each other essentially like you love each other but way more than I've ever loved a sibling and it definitely from an outside perspective feels creepy incest ting well we kind of got into that a little bit more in the second season that it's more so about that Cheryl's actually abused by her parents so he's kind of like her saving grace and he's always been the one who's never showed her love so it's more about the fact that she's never been loved by anybody else including her parents but I get that it looks like that and ultimately it was created to like look weird so you don't think it's ever going to come back I think anything's possible in riverdale is definitely the sound bite that I use a lot cuz like you literally anything the last time I saw Jason it was wearing this dress okay I talk about a lot of movie posters looking very similar TV pokeballs yes I have the same thing it's the same exact scene when I when we have and I saw the poster I was like it looks like it follows and I'll be honest our director Lee Krieger showed us a reel of all these different moves that he liked from different movies and it follows was one of the biggest moods that he was obsessed with so it would have just been inspired by that it follows was kind of one of the inspirations for the vibe of Riverdale so that there is right so that Buster is inspired by it totally I would say so yeah okay there's another thing that people have been sending me about Riverdale and I got confused you've been reading it myself and I don't know if you seen it okay so it says when I realize that Polly and Jason are in the same class but Cheryl is Jason's twin sister and Cheryl is in the same class as Betty but Polly is older than Betty interest what is that wait is that like a thing anything's possible never now Larry guys go hopefully you enjoyed the return of my conspiracy theory videos I'm really excited to go deeper and darker if you want that please give me a thumbs up so I know also make sure to subscribe and hit the notification post so you don't miss one also go talk about some of these

falling down dark holes with you this year click the links below to watch more conspiracy theory videos at your own risk of course [Music] 
Heywood's if you guys yes welcome back to another creepy video now in my channel I talk about a lot of scary things conspiracy theories stalkers real-life exorcisms and of course death but there's one subject that I tend to stay away from mainly because it's too close to home that's right today we're going to be talking about the terrifying world of Sanders now I know you're thinking shame that's not scary fangirls are just obsessed with something and they're just showing their love and their support by screaming and I agree something girls take it too far some fangirls even murder now since I started on the Internet I've noticed the evolution of the Fantas by the way we're not just talking about girls I'm using the term fangirls because it's you know popular but we're just talking about fandoms in general that take you too far now before we get to all the very creepy stuff let's show a couple kind of funny clips one of my favorite moments of a fan overstepping their boundaries is this one clip of this girl that's singing next to Lady gaga and then well [Music] and then of course there's also the girl who got drake tattooed on her head yeah that's real not photoshopped then of course you have all the kids that are standing outside of Jay Paul's house dabbing on the neighbors now all of those are kind of fun and silly but now let's take one step further just check out this video Britney Spears performing a her Vegas show when a fan gets on a stage [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] yeah that could have ended very badly and that happens all the time obsessed fans jumping on stage that's been happening for years now speaking of concerts this next story is crazy we're going to be talking about fans stampeding over each other to get into a concert and killing each other now back in the 1970s the band the who was huge they had and still have millions of fans around the world and their fandom was strong now on December 3rd of 1979 that is sold-out concert to 18,000 people now to put that in perspective this is in the 70s when people literally had to line up to buy tickets this wasn't on line that means that literally 18,000 people came to buy tickets and were lined up and waited for hours that's a shit ton of people now the fans showed up got their tickets and have been waiting at the arena for hours and of course at the front doors of the arena they all crowded and waited for the doors open and then when it was time only one pair of doors opened out of a whole bunch and all of those thousands of fans were trying to squeeze through that one door now obviously that turned into a stampede and people were literally stomped to death it was a sea of people 12,000 people very tightly compacted here's some more people talking about what it was like to be in that state a few people passed out standing up and then I mean you really start to panic by the end of the night 26 people were seriously injured and 11 people who died some of the photos of people being carried away in ambulances and the amount of bodies that were spread out around the front of the arena organ see now this isn't the only time something like this has happened 1988 30 people were seriously injured and two were killed in front of the Guns N Roses concert and the year 2000 million people were trampled to death at a Pearl Jam concert in Denmark and the list goes on and with the way the phantom on the Internet is growing it's only a matter of time before something like this happens thank God I mean we all remember the Logan Paul situation [Applause] luckily VidCon is very organized so things like this don't have a very often but when you get that many really excited teenagers in one place and you throw their favorite internet celebrity at them it's only a matter of time before something really bad happens okay now this next fan we're going to talk about is one of the scariest and also one of the saddest this is a super fan Paula Abdul now I'm sure most of you guys know Paula Abdul as the nice judge on American Idol but before she was on that show she was one of the biggest and hottest pop stars in the world in the 1980s now let's meet Paula Goodspeed now she was so obsessed with Paula Abdul that she legally changed her own name to Paula when she was 16 now she had been trying to get Paula's attention for a long time and then she did Paula Goodspeed auditioned for American Idol I'm Paula good speed and I'm from Los Angeles California and I'm a student oh yeah definitely I really think a lot of star now of course when you first start watching you just think oh it's another cringy audition but when you know that she is an obsessed stalker fan makes it I make life science growing so Paula I've been drawing ever since I was a little kid and my first drawing was a polidore and then of course she delivered a predictably one manís leave it was well I think mother bitch Simon Cowell was of course brutal as always and she got really pissed when she was there's a lot of people as I send to Hollywood that can't even we really hold a no I mean fun but it's what happened after that episode that gets two years later Paula Goodspeed was found dead inside of her car outside of Paula Abdul's house inside of the car she was surrounded by pictures of Paula Abdul and Paula Abdul CDs it was ruled a suicide by Paula Abdul talked about the situation on the view and what people don't know as months a few months prior I was in New York and she had attempted the same thing and they she was code blue apparently and they were able to and in front of my house is in the back seat of a car and it took at the hospital and she survived she also revealed that Paula is stalking her she has been a stalker and or about 17 years and that proves to me even more like you might think somebody's just like eccentric and kind of crazy and obsessed with something but it might be way darker than you expected unfortunately sometimes okay this next one is insane we're gonna be talking about a woman in Dianna Nautilus now stay with me Dianna believed that Steven Spielberg was running a satanic cult with his wife out of their basement and they teamed up with Jennifer Love Hewitt to implant a microchip in to Diana's brain to control her what in 2001 Steven Spielberg filed a restraining order against Diana because she had been calling and harassing his family in 2002 Diana was arrested for stalking Jennifer Love Hewitt and threatening her life a year later Diana showed up at the Latin Grammys to confront Jennifer Love Hewitt from the crowd she screamed at Jennifer and called her an Apple has made bizarre accusations screaming at Love Hewitt murderer killer and he doesn't stop there after she didn't successfully confront Jennifer she started sending really intense quote personal note to Jennifer Hewitt I plan to kill you at the first opportunity to do so and hope you die a tortuous death the woman brags I plan on firing a gun at her heart and not missing from 2002 she was arrested threatening jennifer Love Hewitt's alright now this next thing we're going to talk about is something I touched on in a previous video when I fell down the hole oh my god we're gonna be talking about fangirls killers so a few videos ago we talked about a girl who makes fan videos for complete Rogers the guy who killed a bunch of kids in his college and those videos she made by terrifying [Music] this is not the first time there's been fans of campus so first let me introduce you to one of the biggest serial killers of the eighties the Night Stalker his name was Richard Ramirez and he would roam around Los Angeles sneaking into houses robbing people raping an elderly women and then killing them sometimes in front of their own image he even claimed that he was the devil reborn now the scariest part about all of this is even after he was arrested and put on trial he had groupies he literally had women who were obsessed with him knowing that he raped and killed other women now as he's on trial for some of the most gruesome murders ever there are women standing outside of the courthouse wanting to have sex with him yeah just listen to the greedy stalker why are you in the courtroom today I just wanted a suti look like I think he killed everyone makes him look so bad you know but I know that he he's an iceberg because I've met only I know not only did he have groupies and fangirls he also got married while he was in prison to a fan her name was Doreen and she wasn't just a fan she was a magazine editor that's right an actual smart woman with a good job is obsessed with a killer how I just wanted Sam ecstatically happy today and very very proud to have married Richard and to be his wife she literally said that she started to fall for him when she saw his mug shot earlier she had told the Los Angeles Times that she became attracted to Ramirez the first time she saw his picture looking back I see it was a turning point for me she said I saw something in his eyes something that captivated me I this is not something new remember Charles Manson the guy we talked about previously in another video literally is insane if I wanted to kill somebody I'd take this book and beat you to death with it and I wouldn't feel a thing meet his wife star and Charles Manson's wife wife are you married we are technically the paperwork hasn't gone through yet but we already consider each other to be a husband and a wife yeah she's in love married to a crazy killer and she doesn't see anything worry about that well because I love him and I've somehow I've got half a brain that I can see that he is the one that knows what's going on he is the one that is in the truth whenever nobody else is okay so the last thing we're gonna talk about is something that is extreme we're gonna be talking about the murder of Selena and once again just want to say and I always say this but I do not mean any disrespect to any of the victims or the families with the victims or anybody that I'm talking about in these videos I just find it very fascinating and I like kind of dark twisted stuff but I definitely had a moment like a year and a half ago when Christina Grimmie died because a crazy fan shot her where I started questioning whether or not I should do these videos but the more I thought about it christina was into this kind of stuff too and I felt like she would want me to keep making this videos so I'm not gonna talk about her story because I crying but the story of selena has a lot of similarities and people have been talking about that for the 1990s the singer Selena was one of the most famous singers in the world her fame was easily comparable to Selena Gomez that's how famous she was and she was on track to be one of the biggest stars of all time until she was murdered by the president of her own fan club all right now let's talk about the woman named Yolanda now your londa called Selena's father repeatedly asking permission to start Selena fan club in San Antonio eventually her father accepted and she became the fan club president now over the years Salon de and Selena became extremely close and according to Yolanda even began calling her mom she was like that cuddling bear teddy bear that she would allow you to to love her I told her that I loved her like a daughter and she goes me you know I give you the ride she would call me mom on the phone she called your mom you know and she's hi mom how you doing now Yolanda was getting extremely close with Selena's family until Selena's father found out something suspicious he found out that Yolanda had been Eze only money from the fan club and from Selena boutiques that Yolanda was the manager of well he told his daughter Selina about this Selena and him had to confront her our last words were her was that I was going to go to the police to see what we could do you know to charge it was something she was taking money nestled in his father says that the same day that confronted her melanda left and when she left town she took Selena's business records a few weeks later Yolanda reached out to Selena and wanted to meet her alone motel and Selena the two women argued and suddenly there was a gunshot an injured and hysterical Selena raced from the motel room to the lobby where she collapsed after shooting Selena the londa went to her car and put a gun to her own head and threatened to kill herself he had a nine hour standoff with the police before finally being arrested now she was sentenced to life in prison but she still to this day says that the whole thing was a big misunderstanding she went down and she grabbed my feet I told me not to leave her and I picked her up at Twitter just leave and I grabbed the gun putting for my head I pulled it thing back and I said if you don't leave I'm gonna do it too now situations like this and situations that we Christina Grimmie event just make it even more clear that there needs to be more boundaries with things like snapchat and Instagram and Facebook and Twitter and YouTube and to all of these places where people are constantly saying where they are what they're doing it's just giving stalkers more tips on where they are to fight because fans are great I mean I'm a fan of scream and I'm a fan of so many movies and so many people but there's a difference between fans and stalker fans who are dangerous so next time you're on YouTube and you see a comment that seems a little too far and a little too scary make sure to flag it or let's in the no because you never know when that fan might take it too far later guys go hopefully you enjoyed this creepy video I know I didn't make sure to give it a thumbs up if

stay safe 
hey what's up guys so I am currently inside Rylands childhood bedroom it's awkward so we decided to come to his hometown for the holidays which is Colorado it is so much different from where I come from it's snowing it's cute all the neighbors are nice but it also is home to one of the scariest hotels in the world this is a story that a lot of people are talking about today about the haunted Stanley Hotel in Estes Park this was a woman who was found living here in the basement and later that winter they found her frozen to death Lucy was that you you willing to come out and let us know that you're around right in mid-sentence [Music] no tears in my eyes it's just creepy it's called the Stanley Hotel and it's actually the hotel but the shining was based on here's Johnny have you ever been there no oh we're going there tomorrow but we'll talk about that later change but before we get to that your sister is obsessed with ghosts and obsessed with the Stanley Hotel she's been talking about it to me ever since I met her but she also thinks that your house is haunted but I have to say when she told me that this house was haunted I didn't really believe her and then I slept here all night there was noises in the walls assembly people running around up and down the stairs it sounded like there was some wretches on the ceiling there's a lot of people in this house whatever I think bowels is haunted but we'll get the true story from your sister later but also I kind of wanted to make a video here just because I feel like this is weird but also cool like it's the holidays I'm here in your childhood house with your family like I asked your family if it was okay to film but I've never done this before nervous I have a little bit too because I don't know what like my mom was they on the spa when you're filming her I want to interview your mom this could go really bad don't make them hate you this is going well all right let's talk to your sister about the demons in this house YouTube channel your room is amazing oh my god oh that was my best life now we're in my crisis life she used to live in Hawaii and as you can tell she still wishes she was there okay so you think this house is haunted oh definitely well these faces that appear long like in snapshots you know try it with a friend are you thinking what I'm thinking yeah Sam let's just snapchat with yours um all right here do you want to hold the camera yeah all right so tell me about your experiences in this house do you want my full backstory of how they go Scott here you brought the ghosts here one of them my main goes her name is Angie there's this mountain about 45 minutes away from here called Lookout Mountain people go there like do crazy kid things and got it so I took a picture by this son and in this picture this girl's hair is all over me and like her whole body figures next to me and then I didn't really think anything of it I was like no no just picture and then Ryan was here and I just got like really really scared like out of nowhere and I was like oh and she's here Angie's here I could just feel her and I didn't know why like her name was Angie it just was I don't have sleep paralysis like three times a week at least and it was always the same dream of me and a cave but my hands tied behind my back and I couldn't move and it was just this black figure with like her hair oh my god and she would just like tell me like all I just like take me home take me home okay I need to interject because there's a few things I don't even know if you thought about the number one it is true that ghosts can attach themselves to people but the one main thing about every victim has in common is ghosts like to attach themselves to lonely people oh that's me you've made a bunch of jokes by being lonely but is that true like are you actually lonely or zone yeah okay very now when you had the encounter with Angie were you at like a peak of loneliness yes so I dropped out of call it frightened started all my friends went to college so all my friends were out living these great life and I was here by myself so it was a time of peak sadness so I think she like kind of was with me and just going with me she's like oh we're going on vacation like me and my friend like I just thought this is getting really dark okay Hugo I took her back to the sign then I took the picture I heard and I was like okay like you're home you can go home now like we're here and then I haven't had a dream since but I think she still comes back to check up on me like we're still like homies oh so this is gonna be the picture that you took where you felt like she was standing next to you okay so that is a picture of you standing in front of the stop sign or something so then we noticed that this girl's hair and like her whole side of a figure is all next to me but I was the only person there because my friend was taking the picture [Music] and it's obviously not my hair because I don't have black crazy hair and you can see like her oh my god right no that's a figure I see in my dreams so she was just he had this like crazy black fire have you seen this picture no you haven't seen this I mean if I have it's been years oh my god I mean it's back to it oh my god that is crazy so this was like maybe November December and a few months back in like May of that year a girl got murdered and thrown off the thing so it made it look like she committed suicide but it was actually a murder but they never found her murder so you think that was her oh yeah so then I started researching like deaths that had happened on this mountain and the girl that fell off the mountain her name was Angela well I didn't know that before I started telling Ryland that Angie was in our house how okay first of all have you not been telling me all about this you know I'm not in because you can't look at that picture and tell me that's not the scariest thing you've ever seen see majority of this people in this zip code just think I'm mentally unstable so they don't believe me what about the snapchats good okay so when I call her sometimes she shows up Angie and then and you stick your tongue out if I'm gonna be alone forever at least cuz if she's gonna be my friend at least she's honest gorgeous Morgan this is not okay I know then I was thinking maybe it's just the two things on that but then I was trying it in other places and she shows up other places too like she's just kind of everywhere all the time seriously chill oh my god it happens all the time I'm so freaked out right now we yeah usually I'm cold you think we're crazy yeah oh my god hundred percent even our parents probably don't believe you no I believe you but because you guys are both crazy I didn't 15 minutes ago and now I do Angie Angie you look crazy Angie maybe it's only when it's you hear it you try it oh my god oh my god okay here's why I think it's real if it was just like oh my dresser looks like a face or something then it would do it every time but the fact that it doesn't do it every time and it did for a split second and then you screamed and it went away you're so like comfortable with it yeah I think she protects me kind of and maybe she thinks I just need a friend and I think she wants to be my friend fun with your friend um how I know she's here oh I think she really likes the bathroom sometimes I'll hear like tappings but it's always like the same tab it's like every time and it used to really freak me out but it does anymore well it's freaking me out soon I'm gonna go you have fun with your friends and I will see you later all right Shane are you ready to interview my mom interview me so do you like me no seriously though what are your honest thoughts

documents that say that at one point this was indeed like an Indian burial ground or something and then the railroads bought it and I should see if I can find them are you serious I don't really want Morgan to know are you serious yeah I'm serious look at her face are you serious yeah you're kidding no I'm really not clean there was something about I thought they meant enlike this was Indian

bite than me I'm not your dog I don't want to lose a sponsorship but it tastes like talk about me okay I'm a bigger bite okay hold on when you turn down the lights so if you like to get ready for tonight we should probably tell some scary stories like to get us into the scary mood would you want me to tell you where the scary story make it fast though your stories are very long he's got a point okay well in the past one time my dad and I got this thing with Miss Tennessee don't cut me off you were already gonna say you were bored say it's scarier my dad and I were visiting Tennessee where the weather was cold it was snowing outside that is a creepy detail and we were staying at my sister's house because she had this massive like sorry visiting my sister's place and she was renting a massive house that she couldn't keep I like the top floor like the top two floors don't are you doing it on him well this give me sunrise so she put my dad and I on this massive air mattress where is this story gonna go I'm telling you where it's gonna go I'm sorry I'm just being distracted by the food so we were sleeping up there on this like massive air mattress and it was nighttime and the door was like cracked open a little bit and we heard these footsteps coming into the room and they just started circling the air mattress the sound of footsteps you know hi welcome to my house they were right where you hear demons breathing I know I have a scared you're just telling it with more style so I was laying in bed one night and I was crying with this I this happened yesterday I was laying in bed one night I was crying cuz it was my birthday and nobody had said happy birthday to me my luck worth it because I always add to it did you have a seven oh and then I'm laying in bed and I'm crying and I say oh I just wish somebody would say happy birthday to me and then as I'm falling asleep I feel nails on my back claw on my back I'd say happy birthday shame that was you matter of course that's what I thought yeah turn around she was nothing I said then I went to my bedroom and I said mom where he just in my room I felt the nails on my back and I heard happy birthday in my ear it sounded like a woman and she said was it me but maybe it was an angel and so all the way my whole life I thought that's so sweet it was an angel then as I grew up and realized the probability I've come to the conclusion that it was probably a demon that's really scary do anything of that are you telling that story about my nice surprise you on your birthday but never told you okay I've got a story like that I swear to God oh you got your jab true I honestly can't think of anything okay we're making a video okay tell them what you're doing I'm testing the four capabilities on this particular piece of furniture because we're gonna build a spookyboys fort why I brought a four blanket you have a fort blanket well it's not for that particular use I also use it for like reading the blankets I use it for a lot of stuff in shock the scary story I also use it for like reading the blankets you should put that on your tinder like I have a fort blanket all right sure you keep eating we'll make a fort it's perfect like it's soft and light you know is it gross okay no it's fine it's fine why did you judge it just how old is it wait on the cat tree okay I mean cheetahs gonna be pissed wait what what is this have you ever built a fort oh can you do better I'll get the camera you do better yeah so obviously this area over here is perfect for a fort if you go over here and we get underneath from this nook she have ourselves a little for it have you seen us we're all big okay that's triggering hey guess what we're building a fort come on come look at it I'm currently using I'm using some vodka to try to stabilize the fort what do you think this is the worst wait just go sit underneath it oh I just realized he's very small yeah [Laughter] so after realizing that we won't fit and also I don't want to be living here it's farts I've decided that we're just gonna turn this into a fort and it's gonna work trust me okay so instead we are going to try this what if one of us wears a top hat or something to keep it up what if we just give them a moment where it's like they're in a fort with us and then we take it okay but no but that looks like everything look at that look that looks like we're great for it right is it just me well I know what you're saying so just give them a second of it well just do like maybe kind of ASMR like come on in okay there's room in here oh that's good hey guys welcome to our fort come on in we're having a great time the worst answer marbella ever oh they're coming in hi oh my god you're the perfect person for a fort we love you do you

we have a list here of videos that you're not supposed to watch it a night and we like to break the rules so here we go actually before we get to that you were mentioning a video that you saw yes someone made a compilation called is drew Monson okay and it actually made me really insecure because I guess the point of it is like showing how weird I am or like and there's a creepy vibe to me or something and we can just watch it yeah I kind of want to see that the run towards camera factors like the man okay do it that actually was scary when it was black and white cuz it looked like you were running away from something felt like the person who made it knows like what's going on in my head or when I break down or when I'm not thinking about walking true what if you're so crazy and you uploaded this what have you edited this I did a documentary about like a serial killer and then they like look back is yeah he looks so uncomfortable alright well that was great now let's move on to

dog there's something wrong right yeah is he gonna kill me in my sleep yeah well yeah [Music] 
hey what's up you guys so today is going to be a lot so about a month ago I started a series on this channel where I wanted to confront people from my past and kind of talk about what went wrong and build those relationships back up again but the one I always thought would never ever happen but I wanted to happen but literally was not even a possibility in my head was my dad but I reached out to him and I asked him if it's something he would want to do and he said yes my heart is already about to explode okay here's the thing if you have been watching my videos for a while then you know about my history with my dad so I did not have a good childhood it was pretty rough and when I was about nine my mom and dad split up and my dad moved out and from that point on it was pretty much just me and my brothers and my mom so I never really did have like a father figure in my life and that divorce was really hard it kind of made me eat a lot I got really big and definitely got depressed but because of that I got creative and I kind of put all my energy into making videos and writing and all those things and then now I'm here so it worked out and when you look back at my videos I mean my issues are so clear I mean this is just an example this is from 2008 and this is a video I did where I saw a kid that didn't have a dad so I offered to play ball with him hey how about after I get up at work I'll come by your house we'll play ball all right yeah alright see you later okay well then later in the video I forgot to play ball with the kid and because I forgot the kid killed himself which is so dramatic I'm getting emotional and I'm on my period so I didn't get bail I'm optional take me back but then of course I go back in time and I play ball with the kid and we live happily ever after [Music] Hey Rock won't play ball or something all right let's go [Music] let's go well then in 2009 I did a video called happy fatherless day which was supposed to be for kids who didn't have dads happy Father's Day but what if he won't have a father I don't know about you guys but my dad wasn't around so my mom had to take on both roles and then of course later on in that video I started crying about it so I guess the whole point of this video is if you have a dad make him know that you appreciate him and if you don't have a dad to thank whoever raised you because for me oh my god I'm crying on a youtube video this is so lame I feel like Chris Crocker but if you're like me and you didn't have a dad didn't make sure you think whoever raised you because they should feel appreciated too and then a year after that I did another short film that was about a Father's Day dance at high school and of course I was sad because I did not have a dad to dance with all right everybody time for a slow dance with your father's [Music] but then I had one of my characters come in to try to make it a little bit funny and not so depressing you know I didn't have a father reader really he died when I was five Oh cancer no my mother killed him stabbed him in the face chopped off his balls and threw him in a wood chipper oh my god yeah he was kind of a douche anyways though I mean I wouldn't in chopped his balls off but what are you gonna do then a couple years after that I did a draw my life which was too much information for everybody but of course I talked about my family me my brothers became really close mainly because we were afraid of my dad he would take his anger out on my mom in us pretty much every night which is probably one of the reasons I still have problems falling asleep to this day I guess I'm still kind of scared and then since that drawing my life and because I'm so open about a childhood every time I'm interviewed they bring it up and I talk about it I had a rough childhood and you know I was morbidly obese as a teenager and I dealt with a lot of depression and and you know I definitely had to use comedy to kind of make myself laugh and make my family laugh so in 2015 I ended up seeing my dad and then I made a video about it but I didn't really explain what happened I don't want to get too much into it because I've talked to him recently and and he doesn't really want you know his shit aired out there and he shouldn't because I've already talked about him enough so I want to make this video more about the process of what I did and maybe you guys could get something of that but basically what happened was I hadn't seen my dad for ten years I think and when we talked it was awkward not just because we hadn't seen each other but because I had been publicly talking about how awful my dad was a lot and it was awkward but good I think I don't really remember I was so scared and he didn't bring up my draw my life so I still have talking about that but he did bring up that there's a lot of things online that don't make him look good and I have no idea what he could be talking about behind every good comedian is a whole lot of pain and oh boy was his childhood messed up morbidly obese dressing and dragging with an abusive alcoholic father shame would develop some crippling anxieties that comedy would eventually save him from yeah that's not good well then most recently I did a short film called the lottery which was based on my childhood and it had my mom and she was single and struggling and sad I [Music] didn't think my mom was an idiot I thought she was desperate desperate for a miracle to come desperate for someone out there to hear her prayer and come and save us and even to this day I still talk about my issues with my dad and me being a dad I mean I literally adopted a kid a few weeks ago because I wanted to prove that I could do it 1 2 3 [Music] Cheers here's to our new family well the last time I saw my dad was about a year ago but we still haven't really talked about a lot we haven't talked about the draw my life we haven't talked about all of my videos where I've talked about him and we haven't really talked about letting go of the past because here's the thing when you get older you start to look back at your childhood and you start to analyze it and reevaluate it and see that like all the monsters in your life or all the villains might not have been that evil and it might just be because you were a kid as you were confused and scared like was my dad a great dad no but I don't think he knew how it'd be a dad I don't think he had a good dad I don't think he knew how to show love in certain ways I think he was scared do I agree with certain things that he did no but can I forgive him I want to and I want to have him in my life and I want to be a dad myself and I wanted to have my kid have a grant but we have a lot to talk about I asked him if he was okay being on camera he said yes he said he's scared he said he doesn't want people to hate him I told him that listen like I just want this to be real and honest and I wanted to end with us being in each other's lives again okay so um here's the plan my dad currently is at a beach right now camping which is so crazy because this place where he's at is where we would go every year as a family and it's my only good memories from childhood I really did love sitting with my dad in those you know crappy fold-out camping chairs and just staring at the fire and looking at the ocean and it kind of seems like the perfect place to go and have a conversation with him and oh my god it's all hitting me all right so here we go I am going to go see my dad and for the first time you guys are going to see him too and I have never been more scared and nervous and just feeling like I'm actually gonna have a heart attack and die ever in my whole life when I came up with this series and when I thought of the idea of talking to people from my past all I wanted was this and I'm really really really scared because it's not like this isn't just a video like this isn't me click baiting or trying to collab or you know my ex ro like this is like so intense for me and I hate that I'm crying right now but I don't care I'm gonna leave it in because like this is fucking real and this is my dad and I am so so scared but so excited all right let's do this okay so I'm outside of my mom's house right now because I wanted to talk to her first about me making a video with my dad so I want to do a video where I talk to dad oh my god oh my god oh my god is it - this is so weird I'm sorry I'm scared [Music] 
hey let's open ice so today I'm gonna be trying something a little bit different something I've been a little nervous to do but I feel like it could turn out to be actually really mind opening or it'll send me into a crazy dark depression and I'll just delete my Jail because today I am going to be genuinely watching and responding to a video so I've been posting videos on YouTube for like 12 years and most of them are very cringy especially the old ones [Music] nine-one-one what the fuck is wrong with you I think I'm dying oh no hold on don't look into the life please yeah even I would leave uh delete your channel comment on that but being on YouTube for so long I've dealt with countless hate comments tons of hate videos a few controversies Shane Dawson is over party a hashtag rich trended worldwide but none of this has ever stopped me from wanting to make videos but also I understand like the hustle if you make a video and call it change Austin sucks or something because I'm a youtuber you might get some views on it and I can't even hate on that because that would be hypocritical for me when I started YouTube I was using so many celebrities and my thumbnails and titles Katy Perry Justin Bieber Lady Gaga Taylor Swift Miley Cyrus literally every single video had some celebrity in the thumbnail behind my stupid face and when I look back I cringe at that and I'm like oh god why why why but it's what I had to do to get people to see my videos and click on them and hopefully like them and subscribe so when I see people making videos called Shane Dawson sucks it literally does not bother me because I'm like okay but I purposely don't watch them I get super uncomfortable I feel weird I just want to disappear but I felt like it was time for me to finally face my fears and genuinely respond to it because I've like reacted to them before and watched little pieces of em and laughed but I've never genuinely like watched a full video and responded so we're gonna do today with a little video by youtuber named Bobby burns [Applause] gonna need this alright let's do this so today I'm gonna be talking about someone that if you've been on YouTube for any amount of time at any point in time you've definitely seen him his name is shaved dachshund uh Shane Dawson I already had anxiety based on his views he's making fucking Bank yeah I must stop you there Bobby I don't know if you've heard about something called ad pocalypse but um the meteor has hit my house and my house is on fire also I just noticed he has signs in his background that says hey Shane please stop doing this I'm gonna put those on my fridge sorry let's keep going do you have a problem with that Bobby so another youtuber making money off something that someone else enjoys not necessarily I have a problem with people manipulating people and not being honest and making terrible terrible terrible terrible terrible terrible terrible content this is why I don't watch a video listen I understand when people's don't like my shit but like I don't think my shit is that terrible I also think my videos take a lot of effort and a lot of time I'm not just like hey guys does this pencil break yeah that white button like I'm not doing that also oh no who cares I'm rich okay so I'm gonna derail for just a second because he is doing all of the things that I talked about in my YouTube manipulation video this video has all the key signs of YouTube manipulation we've got the sine shifting eye contact and weird breathing and vocal fry hey this video has all of the elements what does he think I like scripted that because if I would have scripted that I wouldn't have done in the bathroom he has started a series called creepy videos hey what's up you guys yes okay first frame of the video let's let's break down what's going on here the format of this show is so strange to me the shot is that thank you for calling it a show and on top of this whole Hot Topic aesthetic we have his voice today we're gonna be focusing more on the creepy ones what's wrong with my voice nevermind so the first theory on this list of popular 2017 conspiracy theories isn't a conspiracy theory it's it's just how the iPhone works well that Apple came out and said hey no no no it's not just brah you can search a lot of different words and your iPhone will categorize all the photos but this thing this phone is literally invading our life you are aware of that right like it's recording me right now the whole point of I phones is to be around you at all times to record you at all time this is why I don't watch these videos also my coloring book is telling me to calm the fuck down and I'm going to but my other color book is telling me fuck that shit so I walk seriously every single Twitter moment was about Wendy Williamson I mean people stop talking about that New York terrorist attack in like two seconds which is crazy hey Shane I've got some fucking news for you trending moments very person-to-person that means you cared more about the Wendy Williams thing than the shooting I don't know if that's true about the trending page thing because when you go to Twitter moments it's just news like world news and the top moment all day was Wendy Williams every single Twitter woman shredding moment Twitter moment this makes me want to break another pencil but I won't never mind I will there's just little piece at the end where he pimps out his Illuminati pops socket for your phone and this little piece of merch is one of the main reasons that I feel like he's not actually a conspiracy theorist he's just someone trying to make about shit tons of money here's the thing so he's hating on me for selling merch that's one thing but I happen to like my pop stock here and use it every day but here's the other thing a lot of people do leave comments on my videos saying like oh you only do conspiracies for views or oh because it's trendy I've been doing conspiracy videos for a long time and when I started doing them nobody liked them people were telling me to stop making them there wasn't that many other channels that were doing them another trendy I didn't start because of that I've been watching conspiracy theory documentaries since I was 10 I just love conspiracy theories so much so genuinely so I think that's what bothers me the most so far about this video is him thinking that I don't care that much about conspiracies or that I'm faking it for views because I'm up till 4:00 a.m. every single night watching the darkest shit clearing my history constantly and falling down every single hole that's just not the right words but you know what I'm saying all right let's see how it ends well Jane I think you're making garbage videos that are poorly acted poorly written poorly researched and I really really wish you weren't I know this video is pretty much cutting me off from ever having any kind of relationships Shane Dawson ever ever ever and I'm okay with that you don't seem like a nasty person in things that I've seen about you you don't seem mean thank you just seems dumb you look pretty dumb in this video dude and pretty dumb okay guy is this gonna be the end of the video think you know what okay here's the thing before I really go in I want to go to his channel because there's something about him that seems not genuine to me like he says I'm acting in my videos but like that did not feel real to me some of it did but some of it felt very very forced fucking bullshit like why I see that mad about my conspiracy videos like don't watch them alright let's see all right let's go to a really old video and see like how he started hey guys what's up so this is just a quick Wow how old is he here oh my god this is aha let's continue so in about nine days I'm gonna be driving to California and I'm gonna be at VidCon I'm not officially at VidCon it's gonna be a lot of fun my brother Nathan who you guys know from my videos is also gonna be there so I'm really hoping I'm gonna be able to meet some of you guys there Oh a weird reaction he seems very sweet or he seemed very sweet I was not expecting that see you later guys peace out Joe um Bobby that was a nice exit looks familiar I interesting did Bobby watch my channel when he was 12 was he watching my terrible terrible canta terrible content hmm alright this one's a little later it's called things will get better hey guys okay so I was going to do a Q&amp;A video it's gonna be all funny but I don't really feel funny right now so what I thought I would do today is just update you guys on how my life is going this seems like he's gonna talk about something depressing and I already noticed he had somewhat of a vocal fry and a weird breathing in vocal fry' hey love you guys and he also was doing shifty I contact shifting eye contact hey guys okay so I was going the side kind of hmm is he manipulating me let's find out I want to be really open with you guys it's good for me to be able to gonna get this out making videos about stuff helps me process my problems helps me deal with that and I hope by doing that it helps other people who might be going through similar problems so he can do emotional videos talk about things and that's not manipulative but when other people do it it is he's manipulating you interesting hey guys what's up so today's videos are gonna be kind of a little update video Bobby I'm starting to relate to you too much and I don't like that recently in the comments of my videos you guys have let me know many many times that I'm blinking a lot believe it or not I do know that I have some sort of strange tic or allergy thing or something I don't know I've gone to the doctor's couple times to have them look at it and they just said some kind of tic thing and maybe it'll go away maybe it won't so yeah that's that's what that is also my acne has been getting pretty batter easily over the past couple months she's been getting worse and worse well this video is making me sad fuck it's interesting I'm only a few videos and I'm seeing more sides of this person and if I were to only watch the hate video or the criticism video were able to call it I would have just been like oh fuck this guy moved on but now that I'm actually watching or I'm feeling different like I I feel like he's a nice guy I don't know I'm conflicted I am in so much better of a spot than I was whenever I made the last video I'm just really happy I'm just really really happy right now guys I have awesome friends I have an amazing hilarious beautiful girlfriend oh I like him oh I like him this is taking a turn he's nice he's attractive his videos are good like they look good they look like they took time and effort even the hate video he made what it kind of feels like to me he started YouTube a long time ago and maybe he wasn't getting views or he felt like he wasn't getting enough views so then he kind of went the route of like oh like criticized big youtubers to get views which were but he's good and I understand why he probably is frustrated that people like me are getting views or people like Jay Paul are getting used because he looks like he puts a lot of work into that what's this one but after that I started going to the gym again and recently for the basketball weeks I've been going four to five times a week yeah he can't hate on anything I've ever done he this motherfucker is getting shirtless on camera alright let's go to like a more recent one let's see what else he's up to hey guys I'm back I know it's been another two weeks I'm sorry about that I like this I like this oh I like the background I like the camera it looks like he's shower can't relate basically I'm just saying that I'm really excited to keep moving forward with this channel even though we are technically not advertiser friendly anymore it's frustrating a lot of my videos aren't monetized yeh less money so he's being affected by the apocalypse too so we have that in common all right you know what really quick now that I've seen his videos let me do a little research poorly researched alright famous birthdays he was born in 1990 he's 20 holy crap I could be his dad oh he's a website Oh merch interesting how he was talking shit about me having my own merch but okay he's just someone trying to make a but shit tons of money actually don't hate this sweatshirt I kind of wanted alright let's go to his Instagram okay Wow is that his girlfriend [Music] okay that's a gun slightly scared but give it a like he loves taking his clothes off once again don't relate I don't I same-same once again his Instagram is like good like they have style there's something interesting about it I kind of want to follow but I also don't want to give him that I have a good feeling about this kid alright so here's the thing I have a lot to say about his video he made about me dumb and I know this is weird and I was not expecting this to happen but I also want to help him like I think he's good and I really do enjoy helping people who I think are good who I don't think are getting enough views hate on me all you want but I have helped so many smaller channels grow and I have promoted so many people I believe in and even if they're a hater if I see potential and I think that they're great I'm gonna try to help so here's my thought instead of just telling you guys what I feel about that video he made and instead of just like sending him an email or tweeting him I think what I want to do is fly him out here bring him to my house and confront him in person and maybe just maybe I can turn a hater into a lover or maybe it'll end really really badly we'll get to a huge fight he'll kill me either way I'd be interesting all right let's fly a hater out to my house see you soon Bobby burns [Music] so I teamed with Bobby and I was like hey man I want to do a video with you I want you to come to my house and he said yes so I really don't know how this is gonna go terrible terrible content you invited this man are you crazy shame I think we should have invited just in case you know oh my god okay he's one minute away what

for a really long time so hold this hand I didn't you like spooky things do you know we're doing today we're going to be going to post haunted ghost shit arguably in the world called Queen Mary built in 19:36 but here's the thing this is way away what do you know about this what happened to clean Mary Queen Shane took her no I you know I grew up in Long Beach that's where it is Queen Mary is like genuinely haunted I haven't been there like 10 years but the last time I was there this is really dark but I went with a friend and we were in a haunted room and her pigtail got pulled and then we went to the front desk and said like oh I missed it oh did somebody pull your pigtail you know I said yeah and she said oh well that's the lowest captain of the ship and he likes to walk around a middle-of-the-night pole girl's pigtails and fuck them so you waited for Morgan to be here to take us to the Queen it didn't happen very very very fucking haunted it is not a joke it is like legendary yeah a legendary Queen way okay on a scale of not haunted to Stanley Hotel where does this lie more haunted than salmon everybody but this place is terrifying oh it the most haunted place in the world not only is it the most haunted place in the world but Britney Spears films her perfume music video beside the ship cut the clip you're recreating that in the same hallway you know that right oh my

wait okay Garrett yeah stand up and give us the real scary moments like what are we in for okay let's see present it okay so from what I was reading this place I know we've been goofing a little bit with our babies by the way Jesus but apparently this ship is insane so it's built in 1936 and a lot of people have died on it I guess and it's legitimately one of the most haunted places in America definitely the most haunted ghost ship apparently in the world when I called today about the rooms to find like the scariest room the woman said this she was like cuz I was like hey do you believe in that just you know like do you believe in this paranormal stuff and she was like honestly I don't like it all because I'm very like atheist but this place is fucked up like she said those words I was like what are you talking about she's like I don't stay here like after night like after my shifts I go home immediately she's like I've had horrible experiences by the pool people watching me people like touching me and stuff and I'll turn around no one's there's just like everywhere in this ship she's like something's happening on the ship it sounded like out of a film or something so this place is crazy I was he'd been reading the Yelp reviews there are people who were saying they didn't even believe in things that had to leave rooms that had to leave the ship if their experiences were so so dark one woman said that she woke up to herself being held down on the bed and she said she had experienced sleep paralysis before she knew exactly what that was she said she was literally thrashing to get up someone was holding her hands against her chest like this and after like 20 seconds they let go and she like ran out of the room welcome to the squad Oh yo it big can I tell you it's it's it was built by the same people that built the Titanic it's bigger than the Eiffel Tower this isn't like a tiny ship Oh dear me oh my god okay let's go get murdered in our sleep oh my new G we need to run in the G guys spoiler alert if you didn't know I am forced Riley to get a G Wagen and all the comments that Shane you should buy Riley two G Wagen and I said no he pressured me to get my own oh my

now the great day has arrived [Music] I want to pick up here this is beautiful are you against me yes okay sure I won't have you framed up absolutely got a great point thank you oh let's see under the most genuine and scary place is we want to see areas that like you shouldn't show us this is the isolation ward what to get to the isolation room which is where people would get isolated in your sick that they died there now I have to warn you we are not the only ones in there so please watch your step [Music] okay my friends out here well he's your spirit that's pretty too they are going this is like next-level the isolation our neighbor we kept contagiously ill passengers even wait right here you can see some of the original can I go in there of course that's what's been nurses grow but your face was lit already that's bullying right wait cranking up spanking what was that and just freak them out they just got scared okay let's see here we carry over two million passengers across the Atlantic 56 that they know of did not make it the way across and if you come back here get a list of passengers and crew right on this side of that hallway was the ice ice cream and beer storage so right here above us was also the more not just mental that hasn't probably ever will deep down the car the most haunting thing I've ever seen in my life [Music] and you may have felt the temperature drop as the bottom escalator we are now standing under water no that's so crazy I think that so much and the reason the walls might be coldest you are now walking through door number third dude wait this is the door right here what's up with this door this crushed two men they got none that we know of so a guy got crushed to death right here oh the openings right now is larger than it used to be hold it open yeah the veteran has turned stride to the water and gracefully along so we have a paranormal investigator that does investigations through here he had a tape recorder sitting right here on the edge was talking to his guests about five or six people and he played the recording back later and they heard a voice in the background that none of them recognized in the middle of the conversation there was a deep gravelly voice that just said get out right here right where you're standing okay everybody be quiet are you here if you wants to leave say something well listen to that I want to get back to the room we need to charge the camera what brings it into the character well we have the B decrement we have the Suites in this week you get more reports of activity on B deck than any other level onboard the ship for our hotel arrests that's the one that we have thank you for that okay we're back in the room we're gonna go get some food but the reason I started fucking having a panic attack and none of you guys noticed except for Andrew was when you laid on that top bunk and you were underneath it the whole top bunk started bending and then there was a crack in the center of it which I don't know if we did I hope we didn't do because I don't want to get sued you know that would have broke that literally would have killed you I honestly laid on the bed because it's a bunk for somebody to sleep on I know but it's a billion years now yeah I'm not telling mom that you killed me can you imagine that wait you saw that right I'm not crazy it literally was going to snap and break yeah it was bending so much down stay down there for like five more seconds broken and probably it would have a final destination yeah what a punch heard right through your body and broke you in half [Laughter] [Music] famous 1920s dance when I do this oh do they come crazy looking for moms I want to break the glass dude Andrew that's us look okay so we just got back from a very scary dinner at Debbie's it was terrible what are you doing okay can we talk about what we talked about earlier what this is well so I asked late at the front desk but she said that yeah that's

you you look like a corpse oh that's what they only use them what wait what if that sounded so crazy yeah that was crazy we what was that isn't that what that lady was saying that you've heard that high pitch the pitch yeah what is that oh yeah you can't wait but it sounded like a woman let's just Harrigan after you say guys guys nobody responded no and I specifically didn't respond so I was kind of like creeping out like don't say anything [Applause] wait let's keep going [Applause] [Music] see okay I said guys nobody responded to me yeah and then I said wait guys cuz nobody responded yeah so I didn't hear whatever that was ah literally is a voice remember that lady was saying down there in that room she heard that loud like wobbly high pitch oh that's what that was yeah and that's none of our voices I was you sounds higher pitch than Morgan and she wasn't talking I said I bet the woman that we met earlier when she played us the high pitched sound it was on her phone so maybe that caught something different that sounds okay oh I just got the chills oh my god self that sounds like it's mocking you like I heard like oh my god wait listen to all my sight guys ready right into an you listen listen okay cuz you were alone and kind of scared and it sounded like it was like feeding off you going like guys [Applause] let's keep on going [Applause] again with the foot that when you think you hear something out there okay that is fucking weird I love it every time I think I hear a voice on that thing and it's like loud that thing happened that closet moves [Applause] [Applause] don't that was like a song that was crazy plus I told you that I asked that wanted me to stay do you remember I told you it felt like it was hovering above me like and it was like sad and it was like didn't want me to go yeah but I shouldn't hear anything I was like I just I felt something that sounded like a lady like singing that that is fucking scariest without kissing the chills oh my god oh where do you rolling did you get that no I'm like crying cuz like that was crazy my knees are weak we have to get [Music] something just dripped on me weak owes me nothing that killed the guy in Titanic what [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] these women walking down the boy scared shirt wasn't a mirror [Music] I never ran out of a kitchen so I think we should just go to sleep for real well somebody should sleep in that scary ass room by the front door hey hey shhh ching ching not kidding the doors opening right now the front door just fuckin opened whoa whoa I said literally right behind me as I was walking out of the room the doors dude did something follow us that was with Lowe's closed it like Ashton no can't be just fucking open close it again we closed a lunch it 11 okay close that one I was just still wasn't Spanish that mean about feeling I had I was like when we were walking back to the room I'm like something with my doesn't happen tonight why did that happen you okay I'm gonna go to bed hopefully when we wake up nobody's done the hedonic moment has come it's the next morning I did not sleep well I definitely had sleep paralysis I'm very excited what you stole the bed from there all right so here's my official review this place is extremely haunted mainly because so many people have died here the whole time we were here we didn't see anybody no other guests like one employee on this pole ship no it I mean first we heard the noise is tapping inside of the closet did you tap no no one's had them and all of us hurry I don't know if I've ever actually like witnessed something bad crazy even people who are skeptical I feel like something's here but I'm not like I don't think it's like trying to kill me then every single picture that Garret took had orbs in it and not just normal orbs like different colored ones yeah and one with a vase in it and then we went to the isolation chamber but then when I spent some time in there alone and started asking questions we listen back to the recording and we heard in answers [Applause] what then of course the crazy amount of doors that just open on their own oh my god closed on their own whoa look at that noises coming from every single corner of this hotel like using a squeak scream head what is that lights just turning on or turning off on their own whoa what the hell is that what the hell is that what's going on and I'm sure there's gonna be tons of other things that I didn't even notice until I'm editing this video so all in all I would say that don't want to come back and I am very excited to leave but I think what we should do to wrap up this amazing experience let's go get some food at maybe Chipotle and maybe show them your new lip tattoo my god [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
