to assemble the handle grab the round plate with the teeth slide it into this upright base and then twist the handle until it's tight and secure [Music] 
hey everyone its ally from inspire realized and today I am back with a 188 to date video it has been since August since I filmed one of these so I figured what better time to do what I ate then during the holiday season when it could be a little hectic to eat healthy because we're all really busy getting ready for the holiday and of course there's the temptation of sugar cookies in the office and the cocktail parties at night laughs so a big thing that changed since my last one heat is that in spiralize got its own headquarters I'm actually sitting in my office right now this is my desk behind me I'm just sitting here catching up on some emails having some coffee and getting ready to conquer my day one of my favorite things about having an office is I finally have a blogger mirror and I'm calling it a blogger mirror because it's just a nice big mirror where I can take outfit selfies every day although today is gonna be a heavy blog cooking day I have a lot of recipes to make to prepare for the little break we're having over the holidays so I'm literally I'm wearing my oversized the Divas t-shirt and some tights red Letta and my new favorite Under Armour kicks which I'm gonna link to in this video because if you're looking for cool sneakers that are comfy and stylish these are the ones never bite under our room just kind of random because Under Armour has never had that cool sneakers in my humble opinion all right well I'm gonna finish out my emails they're shop my coffee and I'll catch you up at Best Buy Best Buy all right I'm in my kitchen and I am ready for breakfast so I have some zucchini noodles from spiralizing yesterday that I have an is that black bag and I have some avocado that's going bad and a couple eggs so I'm just gonna whip up a little veggie frittata scramble a thing for breakfast with avocado all right I'm heating up my skillet over you know medium-high heat and once that's heated I'm gonna spray it with a little Pam this is the one I use the organic extra virgin olive oil it's pretty much heated up and then I have these leftover zucchini noodles and I'm just gonna add that in now I love this skillet if you guys follow me on snapchat you know that I always use this one I'm cooking it's a 12 inch skillet that comes with a cover and I honestly use it for all of my cooking nothing sticks to this so especially when you're making something with eggs if you're scrambling or whatever it's the best so I'm just gonna cook these until they wilt a little bit more I still want them crunchy it's this is a very wide skillet obviously so my eggs are probably not gonna cover all the noodles but that's okay yeah so now that I have those in I'm just gonna turn the pan and let the egg sort of cover a bit more of the zucchini okay so I made a really nice flat Alma type situation open-faced omelet all right so I'm just gonna let that set alright so I basically flipped in four different pieces this one broke up whatever I'm eating it no one's judging how pretty it looks it smells delicious got some veggies in here and now I'm basically gonna plate this and top with avocado right so I'm just gonna basically pour out my omelet I mean this skillet is so amazing the fact that nothing ever sticks to it it's incredible and actually save the rest for my lunch today I think I'm sick so then I'm just gonna scoop out that have chopped it here in the middle again it's not super pretty season what's a pepper and that's it and it actually just found salsa in the refrigerator I forgot that I ordered this the other day it's still fresh because I didn't open it so I'm just gonna add some sauce on top and that is it that's my breakfast time to eat I check them back in it's about lunchtime I've had a pretty productive morning I've already cooked a recipe for the blog I got two more to do today and a lot of writing and add mini kind of stuff today I'm going back to basics and I'm making my favorite veggie sandwich and I love this sandwich because all the ingredients are really basic it's just a bunch of basically slicing and then Jam taffy into a sandwich and it's full of just really good tasting ingredients ingredients that are really healthy for you it always keeps me fueled for the rest of the day then I usually have a snack around like 3 or 4 o'clock and then a pre-workout snack but anyway I'm gonna build this sandwich if you have not tried my veggie sandwich I really recommend it to all the ingredients I buy on a Sunday and then I put them all in Tupperware or ziploc bags or whatever and then when I go to make the sandwich all of the ingredients were there I just grab them out of the fridge and that's pretty much just slicing them and topping them on slices of bread so speaking of bread I'm going to show you the one I use alright so I use this bread it is a zoo kiyul low sodium bread sprouted green it it's my favorite bread you just pop it into the toaster and it gets really crispy it's really grainy like it just has such great texture I love it so basically I have all my ingredients out right here I'm just gonna build a Sammie with you so I take one piece of bread and they lay it in the center of my plate and I usually start with hummus or avocado whatever side of the sandwich I'm doing first so I'll just put in about two tablespoons of hummus and if you're asking wow she's not getting a lot of protein there's actually protein in this bread in the hummus and in the spinach that I'm gonna put on here so it ends up adding up to a pretty substantial amount of protein I'm gonna take my spinach and the want to use is this Olivia's organics baby spinach I like baby spinach because it's easier to pack into a sandwich I think and I do a lot of spinach a lot a lot okay and then to keep that down and I'll just press the tomato on top and then I'm going to set that aside grab my other slice of bread and this is where I'm going to add the avocado so this is the avocado leftover from this morning just like to use everything up as possible I'm gonna add that here and then I use a knife again just spread it out and lately I've been doing a little bit of freshly ground pepper on top gives a little nice little extra flavor and then on top of this I'm going to do cucumbers I do four slices and then I'm gonna put in my sliced onion then lots of carrots which I use a julienne peeler on actually have it right here this is a julienne peeler and I can leave a link to this one in the description of this video because I know you guys always like to know where I get my kitchen tools pretty much built the last thing that we need to do is add this grouse it's gonna grab I don't know like a really plentiful hinge I guess and I put that on top already to just build up the sandwich put it together and this can be a little tricky and the most frustrating thing is if it falls apart so actually what I do first is I add in a little bit of mustard on top I'm like a mustard freak I like mustard on every sandwich I love dipping my sandwiches in mustard okay got that in there and then since this side Boop since this side looks a little easier to flip I'm gonna flip it so grab it put it on top and then I kind of just push down it compresses it a little bit and then I will take over here serrated straight to the bread knife read a knife and just slice that in half [Music] okay and put it on my plate and that's it and usually I actually use a toothpick but I don't have toothpicks in my office I'm gonna flip this around for you so you can see the inside yes there you go ah load of the veggies super filling the best veggie sandwich you'll ever have go make it and I'm gonna eat this in the meantime all right guys we're getting to see the behind-the-scenes I just cooked another recipe for the blog this is a zucchini noodle fritter which I've been meaning to do for probably a year and a half I just had a fritter and some greens as a little snack figured I would record this in my what to eat because I did just eat that but I want to show you behind the scenes of me photographing the recipe and I can't wait to put on the blog it so this is the area that I take my photos it's kind of a mess right now because I'm obviously taking a photo but if you look behind here here is my setup and these are the fritters I made eight and see the zucchini noodles in the fritters and I just served with like an easy arugula salad and that is it so what I do is I get up on my stairs here and I take a photo and then I put on the blog a lot more goes into it than that but that's it all right so I'm on my final recipe of the day and if you can't notice that the lighting in here it's getting really dark so I'm hoping that the photos come out well it's kind of a stinky part about this time of year it gets darker earlier this is just like really grim outside just product of living in New Jersey this time here but I'm cooking sweet potato noodles and I'm making something very delicious for the holidays and I'm just gonna be drinking this kombucha the ginger berry flavor gt's so I'm just dipping on this cooking my sweet potato noodles and finishing out the rest of the day see you soon [Music] you guys it's about 4:30 and I'm just having a little snack a little apple well and I'm gonna end a little bit early today because I need to get to the gym so I'll probably end around like 5:00 5:15 workout and I'm gonna be making something from my and spiralize everything cookbook tonight so I will see you in a little bit bye so unfortunately I have the major technical difficulties with my camera so I cook this whole recipe from inspire lies everything and then Lou and I sat down and ate it he in this moment is telling me that tastes just like spaghetti and meatballs it's my vegetarian meatballs with celery AK spaghetti from the cookbook thanks for tuning in guys and I hope to see you next time hi [Music] 
hi it's Ally Fremen spiralized and today we're in my kitchen and we are making my vegan burrito bowls with spiralized peppers and onions if you've never spiralize a pepper and onion before prepare to be wowed it's an easy way to prepare these classic veggies and fer this burrito bowl we have all the good Mexican flavors in there we got all the fixings so my favorite weeknight meals - makes it so easy and it saves well so you can have those leftovers for lunch the next day so we're gonna start by prepping our peppers and onions for the spiralizer for the onion we're already prepped all we need to do is slice the ends off and then we just need to peel the skin off of the onion because it is not edible the bell peppers are a little more interesting so what I like to do take a step before I start spiralizing I cut out the top of the bell pepper and I pull it out and I Pat seeds out in a garbage can or a sink so that when your spiralizing you don't get a big seedy mess so I'm gonna set aside this cutting board here and when you spiral eyes you want to just put a plate down so catch all of the noodles this is an in spiral Iser so I'm gonna show you how to use this first you want to make sure that you were perfectly suction to the countertops you're gonna take these side Lover's place them down so your sections good put that plate right up to the spiralizer and your next step is selecting your blade so for these peppers and onions we're gonna use blade a I'm gonna take this green knob on the side switch until I'm set to blade a and now we're ready to go so I'm going to start with the green bell pepper which we prepped before so it shouldn't be as messy as the red peppers in a bit so I'm just gonna Center the pepper right on the spiralizer as best you can hold it while you push that back handle in give it a little jiggle so it's nice and firm make sure it's Center and then you're gonna grasp this back handle and then you're should have turned and you want to use light to medium pressure on this because you don't want the bell pepper to break but as you can see it is perfectly slicing a bell pepper and you know I would challenge the best of chefs to get a slice that consistently and it's fun because you get these really long noodles and then when you're making the burrito ball the consistency is just much better than a chop slice bell pepper and that's pretty much it those are the green and red bell peppers so our next thing we need to spiralize is a red onion which is my favorite and I think that if red onions or any type of onions make you cry they do not make you cry when you spiralize them now that we have our peppers and onions ready to go we're just gonna set a large skillet over medium-high heat more on the high side so now that I'm heating that up I'm just gonna add in about a tablespoon a tablespoon and a half of olive oil once it's shimmering we're gonna add in the peppers and onions all right and now I'm going to season them with some salt and pepper all right so the key to making these really flavorful for that breed of all are the spices we're gonna start with some chili powder and next we have some dried oregano and lastly we have some garlic powder now you could use fresh garlic as well I think this is quicker especially on those busy weeknights okay and then you just want to grab some pasta tongs and toss I'm just gonna keep tossing these until I think they're all coated all right now I'm gonna let this cook while I go assemble the breda bowls so we're gonna start by making the pico de gallo we have some chopped white onion and then we have a minced jalapeno we have some chopped tomatoes and we have some chopped cilantro and then we have a line that has been juiced and then of course some good old fashioned salt and pepper and once everything's in there you just give it a nice good toss and now the fun part is assembling the bowls I like to make them very pretty so I can put them on Instagram and you might want to do the same so we'll start with our base which is precooked quinoa and then we're going to add in our canned beans now this is just canned beans and I drained and rinsed them and then of course our picado guy oh just to make a little bit room for the star of this meal which is the spiral eyes covers and onions once you have your peppers and onions in there the final step which is everyone's favorite is avocado and that is it those are my vegan burrito bowls with spiralized peppers and onions peppers and onions are perfectly seasoned and they give the dish a warm savoury feel I love the pakoda guyot gives it a little bit of tartness the black beans in quinoa are nice and hearty and give you that protein that you need so I hope you love this recipe and I hope you're amazed by spiralized rippers and onions for more recipes like these you can check out in spiralize com

ground cinnamon for that classic big dessert dish we have a healthy baking oil from coconut oil maple syrup as a more natural sweetener we have almond milk and vanilla extract for flavor and color we have solid of course and then that coconut flour which I love to use because I think coconut flour makes everything a little bit sweeter and we have walnuts for a nice little crunch and they have mashed banana because this is a banana bread and we also have a single banana which we're going to use as a ton topping and of course finally the zucchini which we need to spiralize so we're gonna get right into it I'm gonna start prepping my zucchini all you're gonna want to do is slice the ends off flatly and evenly or if those of you who haven't spiralized before if you want to slice your zucchini in half it'll give it better leverage when you're spiralizing we're gonna take this banana we're gonna peel your banana you want one that's pretty right but not overripe and then carefully with a paring knife or small knife you're gonna want to basically slice it in half and then you're gonna get these two perfect banana halves and we're gonna use these banana halves to the top of the banana cake that we're making today all right so now that we've our plate and we have our blade selected on blady we're ready to spiralize so I'm gonna take the zucchini I'm gonna just Center it right onto the spiralizer and I'm gonna push this back handle in here to secure it and then we have a side handle here I'm gonna grab that and then all you do is turn the handle and I like to use light to medium pressure when I'm spiralizing zucchini and you'll see the noodles will just fall out the other side and onto the plate so now we have our zucchini noodles prepped and now we just need to grab some bowls combine our ingredients alright so we're gonna start with coconut flour add that right to the bowl and then we have salt baking soda all right and then we have some ground cinnamon and you can add in a little bit of nutmeg here too for a little extra flavor now that we have our mixture here we just want to take it forth and mix it really well you're just gonna keep mixing until you don't really see any more of those cinnamon clumps in there and once that mixture is done we're ready to do all of our wet mixture so we're gonna start with the vanilla extract and then the coconut oil which I have melted cooled to room temperature and then we have maple syrup which is a great natural sweetener you could also use honey and then we have almond milk and I always have a little bit of almond milk set aside so that if I need some extra moisture when I combine all these ingredients I have that right near me all right so now we are ready to grab these whisked eggs and add them into our wet mixture and this last ingredient are the mashed bananas now we're done here I'm gonna whisk this together and then once this is combined we're gonna add our dry ingredients to our wet and I always find that gluten-free baked goods are a little drier than your normal baked goods and what's great about this is even if it is look dry or looks a little dry we're gonna add Sookie knee noodles and the magic of zucchini noodles the moisture releases from the zucchini when it's baking in the oven and it makes the loaf or the cake like we're making a little bit more moist so as I add them in just kind of pull them apart just break them with my hands just a little bit and then we're gonna mix again and once you're done there we're ready to add in the walnuts and if you have a nut allergy you can feel free to omit the walnuts they're not crucial alright and now we are done with our mixture we're gonna grab a cake pan and I am going to add the mixture into this cake pan and I'm gonna now press the mixture into the cake pan so now once we're all pressed the cake gets pressed into here we're gonna grab those banana slices and I'm going to put them on top what I like to do here is just slowly push them into the batter so I have my oven preheated to 350 degrees and I'm gonna go pop this in for 40 minutes all right I'm ready to take it out we go all right so here we have my gluten-free zucchini noodle banana bread perfectly cooked you have a nice browning on the top those bananas really have their natural sugars just pop right out they're gonna be so sweet when you cut into them and then of course you can see the green zucchini spirals popping out this is the perfect balance of healthy and sweet really fun dish impressive to serve to guests because of those zucchini spirals and a fun new way to use your spiralizer today thank you so much for tuning in and for more recipes like this one you can head on to it's paralyzed calm [Music] 
[Music] hi it's Ali Furman spiralized and today we're in my kitchen and we were making my chicken parmesan meatball sweet potato noodle bake we're taking the classic chicken parmesan and instead of using chicken breasts we're gonna use meatballs and we're gonna use sweet potato noodles as a base top it with those meatballs sprinkle on the mozzarella cheese bake in the oven until it's nice and gooey and then garnish with some parmesan and freshly chopped parsley so there's only a few simple ingredients to get started with this recipe you need some chicken meatballs we have the mozzarella cheese of course and then with Parmesan and parsley for garnish and then I like to use a healthy jarred pasta sauce so since we already have one of those sweet potato spiralized I'm ready to get started with the next one we're already gone ahead and I've peeled a sweet potato simply slice the ends off flatly and evenly now it's very important you do this especially with sweet potatoes so that it secures nicely onto the spiralizer this is the in spiralizer I'm going to show you how to use it just first you want to firmly secure it to the countertop use those side clamps to really get it suctioned and the next thing you want to do is set your blade setting so we're gonna make this a spaghetti style dish so we're just gonna turn this knob and set it to blade D we don't just take the sweet potato Center it on the in spiralizer and then we have this side handle back here all you're gonna do is turn the handle and you want to use medium firm pressure keep going all the way to the ends and as you can see we have all of these people tato noodles i love the color now that we have both of our sweet potatoes spiralize and all of our ingredients ready I'm ready to head on over to the stove and we're gonna cook the sweet potato noodles I'm gonna have a nice large wide skillet I'm gonna place over medium-high heat so I'm going to add some olive oil tablespoon 2 tablespoons alright now that the oil shimmering we're ready to add in our stew potato noodles and you will quickly find that your kitchen will smell extend potato fries that I love so we're gonna now season with salt and pepper and I like to use freshly cracked pepper and then you want to grab your pasta tongs and you want to just give this a really good toss typically you want to cook sweet potato noodles for 5 to 7 minutes I'm gonna continue to toss this occasionally but in the meantime I'm gonna start my meatballs so I have a wide pot here I just set it over medium-high heat all you have to do is open your healthy jarred pasta sauce and pour it right into the skillet use a whole jar once that's in there all I need to do is add in your meatballs I'm just gonna take a spoon here wooden spoon and toss the meatballs together you're basically gonna wait until this has a nice strong simmer we're gonna let this cook for five seven minutes also alright so these two potatoes are nice and cooked now what I'm going to do is I'm going to spread those noodles out into the skillet and now I can take the heat off the skillet and the next step is take my meatballs which have heated up perfectly I'm gonna take them and I'm gonna top the noodles you want to spread the meatballs around and now what I'm gonna do is just pour over these extra sauce and then that final step is to take my shredded mozzarella cheese and I'm just gonna sprinkle that on top of the meatballs alright so now we're ready to pop this into the oven I preheated the oven to 400 degrees and I'm gonna cook it for 5 to 7 minutes or until that mozzarella cheese truly melts and is gooey all right so that mozzarella cheese is nice and gooey and melted on top of that sweet potato noodle bake ready to take it out of the oven you want to make sure we garnish with parmesan because what would chicken parm be without parmesan and then just for some freshness and a nice color we're gonna add in some chopped parsley that is it that is my chicken meatball parmesan sweet potato noodle bake it's fun to sort of scoop out a bunch of Meatballs and noodles and it's a healthier spin on a classic Italian favorite thank you so much for tuning in I hope you love spiralizing sweet potatoes with me for more healthy recipes like this you can check out in spiralize com I hope to see you again soon thank you so much bye [Music]

hi it's Ally Fremen spiralized and today we're in my kitchen and you're making my meat so zucchini noodle ramen with chicken this is something I love to make on a cozy day where it's a little chilly out and I want something hearty but still something light and healthy so we're gonna get started by prepping our zucchini and spiralizing it still to this day zucchini is my favorite veggie to spiralize it's super easy you just want a medium-sized zucchini and to prep it you're just gonna slice the ends off you can slice it in half and I'm gonna do that for you right here just to show you that will give you better leverage when you're spiralizing so it won't wobble on your spiralizer for this soup we want that ramen kind of texture so I'm gonna use a spaghetti style blade and zucchini noodles are nice and crunchy but you put some longer so they're softer they're really really versatile and what you'll see in the soup when you make it at home is that it will absorb all the flavors of the soup and give them a little extra flavor which a ramen noodle can't do so now that we're done making our zucchini noodles everything is prepped and we're ready to go I'm gonna take a large size pot we're gonna set it over a medium-high heat so we're gonna start with sesame oil and once that oil has heated up we're gonna start with all our aromatics ginger and garlic green onions some sliced yellow onions and once you have those onions in you can start to give it a little stir all right and now we're ready for these shiitake mushrooms you can really use your own variety of mushrooms that you prefer but I love shiitake I love how they cook and wilt down so they're thin and you get a nice little bunch of mushroom in every single bite of the soup we're gonna add that right into the pot and the next ingredient that we're going uses bok choy so basically what you want to do here is stir until that bok choy starts to wilt and those mushrooms start to release their moisture and start to shrivel up a little bit all right so now I have some low-sodium chicken broth if you were making a vegan version of this soup you could not use chicken and you can use veggie broth and then add in your own sort of vegan style protein like some edamame or some quinoa but since we're using chicken I'm gonna use chicken broth so now we're gonna bring that heat all the way to high is we want to bring this to a boil and just as we do that you can just grab your soy sauce I'm using low-sodium soy sauce very gluten-free you could try tamari or coconut aminos all right so now we have a really nice simmering roar on the soup so we're just going to lower that heat down to a low medium low and now we're gonna do the miso step so it's really simple you're going to just grab a bowl and you're gonna want to grab a table spoon of miso paste I use yellow miso paste and then you're gonna want to grab a ladle and you're just gonna want to ladle in about 1/3 cup of the boiling broth you're gonna just whisk that until the miso dissolves into the broth and you'll notice that it starts to look like miso soup and pretty much once it looks like miso soup and it's a little more opaque you know you're done and then all you have to do is pour that right back into the soup so I'm gonna give that another good stir and I'm gonna just put the heat back to medium medium-high and now all the flavors have the super developed so we can add in our zucchini noodles which are of course the star so now that we have our zucchini noodles in the next thing we want to add in is our chicken now this is just a poached chicken breast that I shredded myself now I usually tell people 3 to 5 minutes on those communal is anything more they'll get a little mushy but you're pretty good in a soup so we're just gonna keep stirring combine everything so we are pretty much ready to go the last thing I'll add to the soup while it's cooking is just a little red pepper flakes all right so this soup smells delicious so I like to use tongs and a ladle to make sure that I get not too much of a mess this is how I like my ramen good amount of soup there it's got all the veggies we got the protein in there from the chicken and now we're just gonna garnish so I'm gonna grab some green scallions from those scallions that I chopped in the beginning I have separated the white and the green and then I'm just gonna do some sesame seed and there you have it that is my miso zucchini noodle ramen with chicken perfect for a cozy day in if you want to eat something healthy but you want a lot of flavor this is it and it's a great way to use your spiralizer if you need more ideas on how to use your spiralizer and some more healthy recipes please go to inspire life's calm and check it out
