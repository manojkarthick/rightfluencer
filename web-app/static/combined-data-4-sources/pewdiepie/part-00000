Weekly update #2
I FORGOT to post last Sunday  so I'm just gonna post now.

MONDAY: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSmJW1Ww4hI

Multiplayer fun with Jack  Ken and Mark! This game is even more fun with more people. I love doing multiplayer videos  because its not so much trying to be entertaining  its just us having fun playing.

TUESDAY: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neg-2qTG2Uc

THE WHOLE EPISODE 2 OF WALKING DEAD MICHONNE  DAMN THATS LIKE 1 AND A HALF HOUR PEWDS! I KNOW!!
BUT WAIT  THERE'S MORE: ME PLAYING WITH THE HTC VIVE.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9plfmbiQ57w

The reaction to this video from you bros was very unexpected to be honest.
It's either "THIS VIDEO IS THE FUNNIEST SHIT" or "WTF  THIS IS SO WEIRD I CANT ENJOY IT".
Personally I think its "THIS IS THE FUNNIEST SHIT"  ya'll should know to expect this channel is weird by now...

WEDNESDAY: 
ARE YOU READY FOR 3 VIDEOS??? WHAT IS THIS? FRICKIN 2011 PEWDIEPIE????
BOOM
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ix5pxqF7AA

Quantum break is fucking cool  you bros should definitely check out this series. It's probably the best xbox title we have seen so far.

Scare PewDiePie ends with episode 10. I was actually legit pissed when I realized it wasnt a party because there was so much drama in the show and I just wanted to chill with all the people I filmed with. Either way  I had the time of my life filming this show and just wanna say HUGE thanks to everyone who supported this show!
But even bigger thanks to everyone who worked on it!

Also uploaded Dark Souls Part 3  it might seem like a throw away since I uploaded 3 episodes  but I put so much fucking time on editing this. People always say for some reason "I'm only motivated by money". But these type of videos takes 20x times more to make rather then say.... the quantum break episode. But the quantum break episode still gives me 2x as much ad revenue. 
I love Dark Souls and I love editing them and I love sharing these episodes with you bros; please watch them!

THURSDAY: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpDnU7xhrYo
Slither.io  this is the kinda game I knew it was gonna get popular on YouTube. Aaaaaand what do you know? - Everyone is playing it now!
I love the edits in this video  some say the Paul Walker part was offensive. To me it was just about me and Vin Diesel  but either way its a great video in my opinion.

FRIDAY: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GY2NeEkdzyg

FRIDAYS WITH PEWDIEPIE ON A FRIDAY WTF THIS IS BIGGER THAN WINNING THE LOTTERY!!!
I thought Id bring you bros along on a regular day of my life  you bros really seem to like vlogs AND THEY ARE SO EASY TO MAKE.. IF VLOGGERS EVER COMPLAIN ABOUT "UH TOO MUCH EFFORT MAKE DA VIDEO" TELL EM THEY ARE A POOPY FACE CAUSE THEY STIRAGHT U PBE PALINYYIOFASFNIAIFNAINSFIANSF".

So anyway  I also uploaded another Quantum break episode  ARE YOU WATCHING THIS SHIT YET? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBkN-e_Sogc

SATURDAY: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgeHTafo9mg
I died.
The video is very "clickbaity"  but its also very funny so.. win-win?

SUNDAY:
This is the weirdest fucking video Ive ever uploaded.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4ktS0uowFk

I didnt realize it was so weird until I watched it.
I dont know why I thought: "hey making a video where I just try out facemasks  thats a great idea  right?"
It actually turned out very funny  but I think most people are still freaked out by the body suit I wore. 
FUNNY STORY TIME.
I bought that suit in Japan  it wasnt actually for sale it was just displayed on a manikin. I had to ask for it and they first said no  but I managed to somehow convince them despite the language barrier. LOL

And hey! Another quantum break!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyRJfjz-GMw

Im writing these post so you bros get an idea how much thought and time goes into making videos each week. Not to pry on it  but also because Im proud of the work and I want you bros to watch it with a bit of perspective I guess.

Such a great week  proud of my work. Hope you bros are enjoying the videos!

trucks. We all love and care about Youtube and I think that's why a lot of us are often very critical of the website... because its important to us. 

I want to make a video talking about certain parts of YouTube  that as a creator can be frustrating. I'm writing here to get your feedback as an audience or maybe a smaller channel: what you feel like would need improvement. 

Don't just write "this or that sucks". I wanna get actual feedback if possible.

**clap** **clap** **clap** meme review *clap* *clap* *clap* *clap* meme review
*still clapping* *clap* *clap* *clap* *clapping insanely meme review brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr Welcome everybody to meme review. The show where we will go through all of the memes. No matter how important or trivial the meme will be. We will review it on my new original show . . . Meme review FIRST MEME . . . Which is my favorite It's the Ben Swol meme It comes from Kylo Ren in Star Wars Being topless for a few seconds in the latest movie Star Wars: [The Last] Jedi Which was by the way if I may say so . . . The greatest Star Wars movie of all time. I love the humor, I love the characters, but I especially love this one scene for five seconds Where Kylo Ren appears with a high waist . . . Like my god. How do you how do you get it that tall fam? uhm... *laughing* With very tall waist and He's his man's man sickles Are ginormous. I remember watching this in the cinema I turned over to Marzia and I said, "My God that man's breasts are . . . GIGANTIC" I don't know if I'm disgusting or . . .*long pause [brain fart] If I'm turned on and what was with the high waist?! Naturally . . .*another brain fart   
When you see something weird People . . . People exaggerate it 
*awkward laugh* I like this meme by the way, "What made you this way? *it's a birth defect There we have him with Lena Dunham. Dunham(?) doesn't matter Look how swole you've become Something far worse has happened to you The protein shakes, where did you hide them? *dat laugh* *awkwardly inhalling* My God. How did he get so swole? Kylo Ren's shirtless scene in The Last Jedi was weird But, things really got out of hand when Luke Skywalker squeezed one of his four nipples and drank Kylos unpasteurized, green milk. What happened in this movie? What went wrong, or should I say . . . *Whispers* What went right? My God. This was the Death Star. This is *inaudible* Starkiller base I don't . . . I don't understand this one to be honest, but it shows you . . .*brain fart That the man has giant boobs. S-he bet you he has bigger ones than her. And it sort of makes you understand the free the nipple movement. Why can Kylo Ren show his disgusting men stickles and women can't flaunt them in public? Hashtag free the nipples here Here, We have one of my favorite images And it really captures the swollness of the Ben Swole. You don't want to see what's happening here, but . . . Can- Can I request an editor making me into the bench small right now? *amazing edit* The protein shakes. Where have you taken them? That's no moon. It's Ben Swole giggle Here we have of course the crossover meme, the monkey haircut You know we had to do it to him, petting dog meme, and reloading gun with battery meme? What the heck I don't Sir, we're detecting a massive object emerging from hyperspace. It is Ben Swole everybody These high waisted pants are to die for *yup and look We can add me into that meme *no plis* Now that's a fresh meme, boy, I prefer the real Supreme  Leader. I said the real Supreme Leader perfection Grandpappy what is it great see see it's not the first time We've been blessed by nipples in Star Wars, but I do prefer Ben's swoles someone made a Ben's swole in in dark souls.. Of course you have to make all of them. This is this how memes work these days? You know you gotta catch them all who would win my heterosexuality? one wide boy Have you bought my chair now this meme is fresh, it's It's it's universal And it is star wars I'm gonna rate this meme a 4., nah  yeah a 4.3 *gotta love dat music boii*   *meme incoming* *told ya* Next meme. on Twitter You may have seen these type of tweets if you play bring me to life by Evanescence at exactly eleven 5908 on New Year's Eve the first Wake me up will play at exactly midnight start off your New Year's, right? *done pewds* This means started from a username a blonde ocean Which which pointed out that if you start listening to nights by Frank Ocean on December 31st at this time? The transitioning of the song will sync perfectly within the next year, so let's say you're playing Brotha brofist song pewdiepie bro fist *amazing song, am i right?* By 1911 56 the first bro fist Will start will be the first one of the year start your year, right? Now this is a really good shit mean Like the Evanescence one is funny, but If you play stranger things theme song and December 31st If you can live your 2018 like a stranger things episode you're welcome like I've got enough Tentacles in my life. Thank you very much if you play star by Smash Mouth at exactly 11:15 9 The first hey now, we'll start exactly at midnight start to New Year's right That's it. That's funny. Smash smash mouth is a funny meme Everybody Goochy goochy goochy games you can spread their ass on new China if you don't play a Gucci gang by 11:58 You will feel a lot better going into 2018. I'm gonna rate this meme a Solid Two and a half because I don't like it okay I've seen other people trying to make this meme and you're not amusing me enough for you wanted to give it more than a two And a half Okay, it's too much text. Okay. It's like I have to have to laugh because I read all that text oh Yes, I was mildly amusing next meme Place the next meme is the probably one of the bigger memes of December the Thai political crisis breakup meme Now I didn't know It took me a long time to find the original these meme apparently It's a joke about having sex with a woman that supports this Thai Politician I imagine it would be the same as going home to a woman and Find out she has a picture of Hillary, Clinton I Don't know what the representation is but at the same time. That's the joke you know I just noticed. There's a little weird guy in the balcony. That's funny here. We have another one of battlefront 2 Here we have the a AJIT PI one where fuck his wife like he fucks our cut Here we have a AJIT spy going home with a woman sees the Internet Well the edits on this one is creative, and I will give points for that I will not forget here here We have this one where bike cuts. It's sort of a reverse one cuz my cook Is upset that he's not getting cooked it took my a long time to figure out but props to you there We have a man that just decides to recycle bottles And here we have Mimi and Marcia look at that incoming call Original content, I guess it's the same one really these are two different memes, but they are sort of the same thing Reject your whamon? Because you have a better call Bonus meme! We have time for bonus meme everybody. Consider yourself lucky. The chairman of the FCC- I'm sure you've seen this god-awful video where he- You know, in my previous video- I don't want to take credit, okay? but in my video about net neutrality, I told- I told Ajit I was like "Ajit, I don't understand what the point of retracting net neutrality is You need to do a better job at explaining it to people so people understand" That's what I said, and then all the sudden He makes- all the sudden! huh! huh! huh! Ajit, I know you're watching this you f*cking weird- you f*cking... nerd. Got them. Think- you're not gonna be able to watch me more, Ajit, if you ruining net neutrality *laugh* Well Ajit decided "Well, I'm gonna make a BuzzFeed video" Explaining why reducing net neutrality won't change anything "Hi, I'm Ajit Pai. I'm the chairman of the FCC." "Recently there's been quite a bit of conversation about my plan to restore Internet freedom" "Here are just a few other things you'll still be able to do on the Internet" "You can still drive meme right into the ground" You can still ruin memes. As if the Harlem shake wasn't ruined already but then he also had the- the wonderful bit where he is looking at 'Game of Thrones' and the devil horns just can't have escaped him and people thought "Wow! we can meme this!" So people started adding Ajit Pai approving of different things. Here we have Ajit Pai approving my best video on this channel... 'Drinking piss for views' We have Ajit Pai watching his favorite show! It's a 911 meme everybody. Now, that's pretty edgy. We have Ajit Pai watching Ajit Pai. *laugh* Here we have Ajit Pai watching one of the greatest song this year. Ajit Pai reacting to Doki Doki meme I'm gonna rate this meme a solid It's almost a four but to be honest. I'm a bit tired of all this net neutrality shit. Please- just stop... Thank you for watching another episode of meme review. Last one-hit trending. So, keep up the support. Check out my patreon link in the bottom. And as always- *CLAP* *CLAP* meme review™ Merry Christmas

I AM DEATH DAMMIT WHY? WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS?! "Voltaire, John Locke, Calvin, and Hobbes, all sorts of people come in and they did Renaissance" "Renaissance is basically the history version of feels versus reals, and reals won all the time, but then some" "Philosophers in the 1800's decided feels were better than reals, which brings me to fucking Kant" "Kant looked at all the people using reals and he wrote a big book called:" "'I'm not listening because this hurts my feelings'" "He teamed up with Karl Marx Karl Marx was this guy who didn't feel like going to work on Monday" "And he wrote a big book called:" "'I am lazy and the government should take care of me'" "these two lazy crybaby 'Manginas' inspired a bunch of other crybaby" "'Manginas' who set up the Frankfurt School who recruited their team of feminists," "communists, and people who care about black people, and sent them off to destroy all straight, white men" "Friedrich Nietzsche saw this bullshit and debunked all their YouTube videos with real" "atheism and science and then their videos like dislike ratio was terrible which" "basically means none of their shit passed peer-review." That's true, that's true having a terrible like dislike ratio is the pinnacle of destruction you're done, You're done, mate. If he made sure they got that many dislikes, that's ultimate destruction right there ultimate annihilation. "That's just a stupid boulder" "It's not just a boulder. It's a rock (Iraq)" Awhh, it hurts... It's so dumb it's so dumb That's just a stupid Boulder" "It's not just a boulder. It's a rock (Iraq)" God damn it It's like you have a sneeze Goddamn it Good one good one. These are getting better and better Recently when I became deathly ill I used this remote control to contact life. Call my 24-hour emergency Medical response service watch, you just press this button and speak into the air I'M HAVING CHEST PAIN I love these edits, they're so good. Goddamn it.

NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO What the heck is going on people? Use Tide Pods for washing, NOT eating. MEME REVIEW! MEME REVIEW. Do not listen to this man. For he is just trying to hide the succulent flavor. The ssswour sweetness and the euphoric sensation- Of the Tide Pods. I am NOT saying eat the Tide Pods. I am saying... *devil voice* ENGORGE YOURSELF IN THEM. DISCLAMER: Do not actually consume tide pods or any such detergent, this is a joke, and felix is not to be held responsible if you chose to do so. (you're welcome brad.) Welcome to MEME REVIEW. YouTube's  favorite show of all time. This is an important series that we are reviewing all the memes. Meme Review! Numba 1!! It could possibly be the greatest meme of all time. This meme means more to me than any other meme we have previously discussed because- It is my meme, my children. Yes, that's right. Take a seat. But can you do this? *Christian music* No, you can't. Unless you bought my chair. 399 by the way. We here, we have Logan Paul. Logan: Hey, PewDiePie, my merch is better. PewDiePie: But can you do this? "Can you do this" The greatest meme of all time. Because that's right my sweet children, It is MY meme. This meme started with me announcing my chair. And I was just going through the basic features of them- of the chair. can your chair do this? I don't think so, okay? This thing is the goddamn Lamborghini of chairs, it's not a chair, it's a lifestyle. as generous and wonderful I am, I had a nice tutorial of this chair. buy my chair it's only 399 [laughing ] Yes, yes it is only 399 and I'll have you- let you know, but can you do this! I don't think so! the meme continued *wheeze* in later episodes of LWIAY (Totally original idea, btw) and from there it just spread like wildfire It just went left and right, can you do this? Whenever you hear someone says... Something and you go, "but", immediate reaction is *extreme distortion* BUT CAN YOU DO THIS More addicting then, dare I say the dAmn DanIELLLLLL Here we have men, women, deficient... and Pewdiepie and you can't do this that's the joke because you can't do it. Only the exclusive club members that owned the 399 chair of God can enjoy this meme properly somebody touched my spaget someone in this house [laugh] So you can touch spaghetti with this meme. I'm the tallest tower in the world. but can u dew this 399 that's a great price! that's a great offer! That's a great price! consider yourself lucky! Hey look. We're on an airplane. but can u do dis 
[laughing] Excuse me, sir. I'm gonna have to ask you to put your chair up right now- [demon awakens] How's it going bros my names PewDiePie! umm Today we have these muscle relaxants, I'm gonna put them on me. Okay, so do we know our partmar...Partner partner Okay, first question favorite ways to relax I don't know uhhh Mariza: poods can you- Pewdiepie: sew? Mariza:Can you. Pewdiepie:Cover the pugs? Mariza: Every night I ask you Pewdiepie: Give you a glass of water? Mariza: Nooo Mariza: Poods can you- CAN YOU DO THIS EH? EHH I DON'T THINK SO EHHHH [Laugh] That's right! That's right. You can't, you can't do this. Only I can do this, get with the times [choking noises] That was a Ugandan spit, that's right, the- ugandan meme really died out quick didn't it *overlapping video segments of Pewdiepie talking about his chair.* PewDiePies: but cAN YoU dO thIS cAN yOU DO tHis Humanity has peaked!! This is it. This is the high point that we've all been looking for when it comes to the memes It's never going to be a better meme than this! My favorite one is still this one. It's so good Obi Wan Kenobi: It's over Anakin, i have the high ground! Anakin (PewDiePie's voice): BUT CAN yOU dO ThIS [Laughing] So gOOD! it's- oh man Such a funny wonderful relatable meme. PewDiePie chair added to cart, $399 very nice [laughing] Now of course people tried they they wonder, "hum, maybe I can do this". So they try and challenge me Sending me stupid images of fake chairs. That's not my chair, and I bet you that chair Is not 399 as impressive as it may be yes, yes, they say yes the chair can do this But no, no it cannot I am sorry sue-me-ma-Sen. Get the **** out! Hello, My name is Yuri. I have timid expression, mature sex figure and big boobies I can write puns with deep meaning using complex words, and I will die because I love you But can you do this, [laugh] We have incredible fan art from this meme uhh- look at this pixel art Beautiful! We have animations! and even more incredible animations I love this one btw. We even have songs about can you do this? bUt can you do thIS but can you do thIS butt cAN YOU DO THIISS BuT can yOU DO THIS but can you do this?!?! buut can you do thIS BUT CAN YOU DO THIS butt kan u do dis [beat banging] The origin of this meme is 100% mine, and it does not come at all, at all! From this old meme from like what 2012 where they say: "yo you your smartphone think you're so great Huh? but can you do this?" Or maybe then th- the twoDS "you think you're so great huh, but can you do this?" "Ah you SNES classic minis think you're so great, Huh? but can you do this?" It even got so far that the creator of this webcomic had to tweet out "Tfw you started making some comics with the catchphrase 'But can you do this?' in 2013 But then PEWDIEPIE uses it and everybody thinks you're refer- referencing his chair meme That's great and all... BUT CAN YoU DO THIS I DON THINK SO *intense rock music with intense voice* This meme is mine, it is mine, and I've copyrighted it and I will send 6,000 lawyers your way, lolnein. If you want a war, then a war you shall have. 'Cause you do not --- you may--- you may talk trash about my dog, You may talk trash about my channel, you may talk trash about my girlfriend But you talk trash about my Meme, and you will FACE the wrath of- *back to normal*  gAH! gAaH! I will kill you!! I will destory you!.. HAHH Now this meme, to be honest, it's... It's a PewDiePie meme. It's not gonna get a high rating. It's immediately two points... Let's say it's a 10 out of 10 meme, all right, let's remove two points right off the bat 'cause it's PewDiePie related. Let's remove two points right off the bat because it's a Normie meme at this point. Remove another two point five points Because it has absolutely no racism, sexism Suicidal undertones, none of that! No problematic undertones, it's actually family-friendly meme so remove another point and uhh Which leads us to the overall score of 10 OUTTA 10!!!! This is a 10 out of 10, the first 10 outta 10 meme that we have ever had on meme review. and probably ever will, btw. Uh, I'm really proud to finally have the first 10 out of 10 meme on meme review, clap it up everyone! We've done it, together. We did it. 10 out of 10 meme. Well done you and well done me. Here we are. Now, of course, this meme has to die. *bong* This meme is dead, okay Oh, don't be sad though all memes have to die, so don't be too-- Don't be too sad, but I don't want to see this meme ever again alright It's gonna be, it's gonna be pretty bad, Okay? I'm gonna get really angrey. Don't post this meme anymore It's not funny, it had a good life span We- we should not taint this meme by overusing it when it's not longer funny It was a good run everybody, it was a good run. Give yourself a pat on the back. NEXT. MEME. "Skedaddle skedaddle, Skedaddle skedoodle your.. ding dong is now a noodle." This meme.. is a garbage meme. Anytime I do a you laugh, you lose, someone is posting this god-awful meme, and it just annoys the hell out of me.. and this is it: "SKIDADDLE, SKIDOODLE, YOUR DICK IS NOW A NOODLE." *video plays shitty quasi-earrape* This is the worst meme I have ever encountered in my entire life. "Hey look, it's a--it's a you lafh you lose thread, Oh, that's- that's- that's great- That's great. That's- see what- Oh look! It's this one It's so funny. Every time I watch it, it gets better. --NOODLE! *shitty "earrape" music plays again* Stop it. I'm saying stop it now before anyone gets hurt. *"look at this photograph" soundtrack by nickleback plays* "sKiDaDDlE SKdOodDLe, uR DiCC iS nOw A NOodLe!1!!" Pewdiepie: IT IS NOT. DON- It is not! Stop it! Stop it! stop- This is the worst meme I have ever encountered in my life. I'm rating this, that's right, a zero Garbage meme. I don't- [another Ugandan spit] I spit on it BOONUSSS MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEME This week's bonus meme everybody, clap it up. We have time for it. Lucky you. "Pop team epic" or "Pup-- pup tap epic". It's a manga, that has now come out as an anime. It's not really memes from the manga, It's more the sense that the manga is the meme itself... *choppy static* *Groan of brewing anger* [Spit] Pewds reading: "Isn't the red color wonderful?" "So you can hide the color of blood with this." "The hybrid car is very quiet" "Right, so you can kill without making a soun-" *chuckles* Check out pop team epic. It's basically an anime turned into one big shit post, it's beautiful, I couldn't recommend it enough. It's not #SPON or anything, It's more like, uh, if you're probably gonna see this appearing here and there and now thanks to me, your fellow meme..review... person, you can be like aha! I know where that's-that's from. this meme, uh, It's not really memes, so I'm just gonna give it a seal of approval Everybody.

But on the downside, I'm invisible to everyone except for the first guy who sees me and I have to make him ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) As many girls as possible so that I can collect their ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) juice *WEEZ* AAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGHHHHHHH The witch wants it for some reason Okay, I got it you're crazy. You're perverted girl. I'm gonna leave now No, it has to be you, I need you! Let me help you become the chick banger №1 in town. Okay, I'll give it - I'll give it a try Perfect! Just you and me and all the- I can't read this. I cannot! Let's start tomorrow morning with your first lesson. Here we go
So here we are. What a wonderful day to collect... HU55Y JUICE Look over there. This chick seems to be on her way to college Do you see her beautiful tits? She might seem a bit boring to you, but I'm sure she'll become great Dig-dig-dig-dig after you show her how we roll So don't waste any more time! Go talk to her! Let's see if you know the basics of dating a chick! All right, I know the basics. Okay. I know more than the basics, I know all the levels Let's go and talk to her. And don't worry, I'm invisible to her. Hey, who are you? HOW are you? Oh hey Hey, how are you? Hey! Do I know you? No, but the moment I saw you, I knew I had to say hi. Wait is that Hatsuke... Miku or whatever?
Wow, why is my heart beating so fast now? It's not just your heart! Look at you. Your ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) juice is running No, I'm not saying that. Maybe it's because I'm the per- All right, I'll pick that one. I have no clue what you're talking about, but I think I like you. So hi, I'm Laura! I'm the best in my class! That went better than expected. Each girl you see from now on will be added on your phone book. So you can date as many chicks as possible. That sounds great my ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) are almost exploding! Just checking Not so fast my hero! She was wet just from talking to you!
But you can't just approach girl and... Alright, okay, alright. Alright, who wrote this? Who wrote this? Before you can ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) a girl, you have to date her... WhAt? Are you serious? Ah This changes my perspective This is the date board, use it... Okay. Alright [x4]. I get it, alright? I feel like I've played similar games, so I think I know how to do this. We're at the beach now, everybody, in case you haven't noticed. We're at the beach. Okay, so I connect the balls. Nothing says romance as collecting balls. Oh gee, oh look at that. That's a long ball. Whoa this red ball is gonna be off the hook dude.
Look at that connection of balls. Incredible. My father once told me at a young age: 
"Son. *inaudible*" Woo That's not what he said, that's not what he said, okay? I could really see us going - doing this again. Great. Hey, school was quite fun today. Not as much  fun as hanging out with you, though! AH! My god. *inaudible, wtf* that spank bank First date and first picture: done. You're doing great! Can anyone understand me? But dating one girl is not enough. Let's go to the beach and meet some other chicks. But I thought we were at the beach. To do so, just go to the map and tap on the beach icon. Allright The Juicy Bar Great. Now let's go to the beach. Shannon! Shnanny - Shannon. Let's go and say hi! HOAH! Uh, oh my god snort OMG! Did you see that guy? He was totally starring - staring at my perfect ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Honestly it's not hard to not stare at your ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
No, sorry Honestly, it's not hard to stare at your ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°). You're you're presenting it like it's a trophy. Oh, Devi! You're just way too shy! You have a perf- You have perfect curves And any guy will run after you if only you'd show them a bit more! ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) You know I'm not that kind of girl! *hehehe* What do you mean by that kind of girl? Erm... ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) OH, BAZINGA! Wooow, other girls would take this as an insult. I take it as a compliment. You're crazy and you know this! But I gotta - I have to leave now. I'll meet a friend at the café. Yeah, alright. Okay, enjoy your Virgins Anonymous meeting! BAZINGUH! HEUHAHAHA Now it's getting interesting! A ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) one and a shy one as *inaudible* at the café. Let's hurry up and approach that fine ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) I am well immersed in this. Are you staring at my ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)? Hey, oh god, no, uh, okay. Are you always that direct? Only when I'm confronted with beautiful girls. This game, I will say, is probably the closest I've ever seen a videogame to real life interaction. Finally a game that really approaches realism, really makes me feel immersed and not taken out of the immersion by how... ...unlikely this conversation would ever be to happen, because these conversation happen all the time All the time, believe me. I have seen a ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) or two Oh, that's a bit cliché! By the way, I'm Shannon. The hottest chick in the beach area. At least this was not a total disaster. Let's get to the café quickly and get the number of it shy... Uhh... Uhhh... Okay, Devi Why can't we... Oh god. I got a deeper voice now. Oh! Hi! Didn't I just see you at the beach? No! Maybe that was my twin! Camel ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) You really have a twin? No, I was just kidding. You s-seriously, thought... Oh, sorry, oops I've heard - I overheard your argument with Shannon Please don't think all guys are looking for ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) like her! There are also boys seeking to true love and real relationships. I am a nice guy, okay Nice guy PewDiePie - I am a nice guy! Wow, I'm flatted! You seem to be different! All the other guys just want to get in my pants. Oh, no [x6]. Not me, for I am a nice guy You seem honest and gentle. I can see it in your eyes. I'm so happy that you've followed me. Could it be too early to ask if you can put my number into your phone? Save it as Devi. Oh my- OMG. I just met a guy. He was so handsome. And I gave him my number. So hopefully he will call me! Are you kidding me? Uh-oh Uh-OH When did this happen? Just now! He moved so quick. I can't believe I gave him my number already. I'm really excited for you. You you should send me a picture of him when you see him again. Oh, I've left? Oh, okay. So-  so that you can approach and ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) him? No way! Come on! I would never do this to you! Just if he is interested in a hot 3-way with you and me. Oh, I hate you! Just kidding! [x2] I'll have to leave now! See you, honey! I got one energy, everyone. If you want to be the best ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°), oh my gAWd They just hit me out of nowhere with the... you have to get to know the girls you're dating! Getting paid to play this, this is *inaudible* Just talk to them. After answering 5 of their questions right, you can then ask something about them. Okay, good to- good to know I know! Sometimes it's just that easy! Now you're prepared. Go to the map and visit one of the girls. Oof OOFF UHHH I- I don't know if I'm ready for that. I'll- I'll definitely buy it All right, so where should we go? I kind of enjoyed Devi. Alright, so... We can talk or date. But then we have to give her some diamonds right let's begin It's the way you won't go off Oh fee don't Humpty Dumpty Sat on the wall boom Come on come on come on.

Here's uh their bitcoin lending profit interest people were like "oh man, we are gonna make so much money i'm gonna invest in this!" it's a classic ponzi scheme where you take money from some investors and then you pay those investors back by getting more investors *repeating* and then you pay those investors back by getting more investors and go on and so forth and then pulling the plug grabbing all the cash thank you very much that is Pewdiepie explaining *laughs*- you're welcome so a lot of people lost their money uh people were posting suicide hotline on the bitconnect reddit *reads what's on the screen* but that doesn't stop Carlos from being his usual loving self... *Cheerful singing* hey heyy heyyyyyy Hey hey heyyyyy *still singing* Hey hey heyyyyy goooooood mooorning good afternoon good evening to everyone from around the world this is Carlos Matos broadcasting live directly from the Bronx, New York U.S.A waso waso waso waso waso waso waso waso waso waso WASSSSUUUUPPPP *odd lunatic-style laughter* *quietly/introspectively* Oh my god.

Take it all in. *Dramatic slow motion view* Look at that! BAMMMM! *fire effect* Custom chair, son! Custom stuff, other things. (LOL) Oh Wow! [it's free real estate] *insert meme* All right, where do I begin? Let's start off.... Hey, I'm over here. Let's- *laughs* Let's start off with what everyone wants to see, Which is of course Marzia. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Marzia: The Chair!
Pewds: The computer! Chair is very important too. The computer, brand new baby. I got this today. I just barely set it up. Uh - I'm very excited to finally be showing it off as you know I've been working with Origin PC Wonderful people. Wonderful... That's what they are. They are people. And I got it today. I just set it up. It looks so sick. I didn't think I could get like a more beasty computer than my last one, but here we are. This is not a beast, this is a monster. Edgar: I'm a monster too The Specs But pewds, what are the specs?
 Atatatata Okay, this. Like they even signed it, so cute We got the Origin PC Genesis. This is their case. I love it. It looks amazing. Custom painted. Uhhh... Unfortunately, you don't see it, but on this side it says squad fam. If you look here inside, we got the atata... What is that, hmm? What is that? The Brofist logo, custom and even on the graphics card. It looks.. This is the Mona Lisa of computers, guys. Okay? I know you're jealous. Very nice case. It's so easy to access everything in the back. I constantly have to change stuff, even got the front nice and covered, of course. You know the most important thing is that you can show off different colors to your Your wamen, aren't you impressed? Like it changes colors, Marzia Each of these computers are custom made, and I am so proud to be the first one to unveil this brand new model of a computer and be the first one to own it, to actually have it. So cool! We're gonna give away a computer as well. That's been kissed by me. That's right. So check out the link in the description for that. Anything that you want to access I don't know, for some reason. I don't know what this does but... I don't know what I do here, but if I needed to do it. I can do it. Okay. It's got an Asus Prime X299 I'm guessing that's the motherboard. It's liquid cooled, Intel Core i9, baby! 2.6 Gigahertz! God damn that's powerful. I need that when I'm playing Roblox Hehehehe... 64 gigabyte DDR4 memory Look at them, they are litten up too - I can change the color on those bitches. Why are you laughing? It's cool, okay? What's so funny about this? Dual liquid cooled nVIDIA GTX 1080 (Ti) With my little signature on there. SLI, that's for when I'm recording Happy Wheels you need that extra extra power. Okay? You need that super strength... This is like, two really strong Swedish men right here It doesn't get more powerful than this is what I'm trying to say 500 Gigabyte Samsung 960 Evo And then we have 4 Terabyte Samsung 850 Evo SSD. The memory is somewhere inside the computer. Marzia: It's really good(?) It's super fast memory, which is good for me obviously. Marzia: Cause he have no memoryyyy?? Okay... great! Good one... 1.3 kilowatt EVGA supernova G2 PSU Marzia: What are those clear thing? Which clear things? Marzia: The tubes? That's the liquid cooling That, it is cool. Don't drink it, though. You'll feel bad. Now, of course you know I'm not just some pleb that gets this amazing computer. Of course, I treat her with respect Look at the cable management here guys, my god, so if you come back [To Marzia: come here, come here Marzia] VeRy NiCe Very nice, so all of that goes in here and then all the crap gets, we don't need to lift this one But uuh it's... it's very nicely organized in there. Okay, very nice, then we have all the cables going up (up up up up up) Up, up, up, up, up... watch your head Marzia. Oh, no, what's happening oh? *Marzia dying inside* So obviously, I need to be able to move this desk up and forth but the cable(s) They still need to be the right length. Perfect solution. Incredible! Felix, you're a genius. I know!! Look at that cable management! Whenever I see someone with a nice PC I'm like, well show me your cables... You call that cable management? [spits on those cable]. You disgust me. Let's take it down a notch First of all: Origin PC, God bless you! Uh, I work with a lot of sponsors, but they've been just a joy to work with. I cannot recommend their product enough I am so happy with this computer if you want to check it out yourself, link in the description Obviously, uh, Appreciate you supporting them and supporting me at the same time. Namaste. *clap* Moving on with the rest of the setup. I have three Asus What do they call them? They're bent, they're curved, they're curved three, so? AH! Okay, ah So nice, very nice. You know how nice it is to this have curved screens, three of them. This is how you get women, Marzia. Marzia: Thank you, for letting me know No, nononono, this is how I got you Marzia: Sure... The mouse mat. Look at this mouse mat. [Marzia: How big is it?] It's soo big Look how big is it. [Marzia: OHH MAH GAHHHD! LOOK HOW BIG THIS IS! (that's what she said) VErY NiCe.  Got the Corsair mechanic keyboard, but it's silent. You know when I record videos, you don't want to hear my keyboard half the time If I'm clicking. VeRy NiCe textured key... very nice, right? [Marzia: Mhm...] You can say very nice Marzia: Very nice. (Plays circle game and Felix falls for it) Did you just... me? *gets punched in the arm* AGHHHH! Got to uh thank you Uh... What is- what do *rest is inaudible* Marzia: You know your stuff, bro? It's a mouse. It's a m-mou-mouse. Click on it. It's got a nice click on it, right? Right? [Marzia: Oooh] You feel the power in the click cuz you know I have so much power and I need it to translate. When I'm slaying noobs. You know I'm saying? You know you know exactly what I'm saying Microphone. What I'm using is uhh I got these recently It's like golden, but you can't really see it AKG Honestly, they're all the same don't want to spend money on a nice microphone. It's an XLR so it goes into this Roland, eh audio interface... I've been through like five of these, none of them work... This one barely works I don't understand microphones, can someone help me? It's always some issue with audio, and it doesn't even sound that great, hahaha... But I double up with pop filters because you know I'm going pEwDiE pIe (PAH)! You don't want your ears to explode. You're welcome. I THINK ABOUT YOU! (Earrape). When I record Basically just pull this down bam bam Got my Canon Usually I record with the camera Marzia is using right now, but this, I put it up there just so you get an idea it goes straight in right into my computer and uhh Since this is a new computer. I don't have the... I don't have the like software or whatever I usually record with OBS. Just turn the shit on BAM we're good to go recording straight to my computer Very nice and easy, it's all made to make these (videos) Oh I want to stand up? Ohh no big deal chair get out of the way as much as I love you Get out of the way "Hey guys it's PewDiePie!" Huh? How easy was that? Done! Send that shit to Brad. Done. Of course, got my, Legendary headphones. Yyyou can't find these anywhere... Because we sell them on the website but, you can f... I mean you can find them... you can, you should find them... got the beautiful Pewds signature on them look at that. Look at that, throw off the snow goes well. Oh my god. Oh They fit like perfectly. Hey Pewds... You have pretty cool headphones. You got a pretty cool setup. You got a brand new computer, but can you do this??? Hahahehe Uhhh (groaning) So comfortable Obviously, I love this chair. It's gorgeous. It's sexy, but it's still subtle. Clutch, I love you. Thank you for making this with me. Oh what's this over here? Oh? Godzilla, what do you do? It... Excuse me good fella? To keep the Burglars away, you know? My 50 million plaque, no big deal... Almost at sixty now Who's counting? Got uh... this one, speaker, very nice. It was given to me by Spotify. Thank you. I love it! Very nice, Swedish design. And of course my Kaws figurines. A lot of people asked about these. I actually have a tattoo from one of his figurines. Oh, it's just like, the most unintentional hypebeast thing to do, I didn't know Like it was part of some kind of culture to have figurines, but, I love them. You gifted them to me didn't you? [Marzia: Mhm.] You did. I love them, thank you! Got it lit up with the custom, whatever. I don't know. It's just, it's nice. You know light can really change a room. This is a very small room, but I really like it that way cuz it feels cozy. Like before I used to be in an office and I had so much space, and it just felt weird like when you're in front of your computer you want it to be your little man cave right? Was that it. I don't know Marzia: What about your green screen? Oh, of course! So Genius as I am, I bought a projector right? sound isn't the most pleasing sound but I I painted it green... Probably could have picked a better, more greenish tone, but it works. It works pretty well. Boom! Green screen right away. No problem! Easy! Are you not impressed like that's genius... I know. Have you seen anyone else on YouTube do that? No, because I'm ten steps ahead of everyone. Now I could probably just pay some guy to do all this for me, but and, make it 10 times better... But, it's more personal this way. You know? See it's quiet when it goes up. I don't understand why it's so loud when I take it down... Of cou... [Marzia inaudible interupts] You think you know everything, don't you? What's that behind the computer Felix? Oh, don't worry. I got all my shit, in these boxes. I also put up the oc(ulus?) eh, the (htc) vive sensors, so that I can... since you guys looked(?) the VR videos So everything's meant to be as easy as possible. I think when you're recording videos every single day, you really need things to just [Snapping with fingers: snap, snap, snap, snap, snap] It saves you so much time yeah, no, I don't want to just like: "Oh I have to shoot this video, I gotta set this up..." like it's, it's all: Bam Bam Bam, green screen. [Crazy Big Shaq like sounds...] And it's nice. Everything matches perfectly. You get the perfect black, red, white cube It's all very well thought out, even small details. You know? Oh, what's this? This is just my amazing Honor 7x, with my custom pop socket. Also matching. Of course it's matching. Why are you even asking? You really feel like a king in here. Wait, I'm not done yet. I'm not done yet... Okay... Well, I'll see you later, eh Leave a like! For real I need you back here though The genesis pc It's the most advanced custom built computer in the world. It doesn't get better than this. This is the top of the top, and it's my pleasure and privilege, to be owning one of these bad boys. If you get one of these, you get them for life you get 24-hour custom service for life, okay? They're not just selling you something and shoving you out in the desert. They say hey, we got water too. I know what you're thinking. "Oh Pewds, you're just showing all this stuff off!" What about me? Don't worry! I got you! Check out originpc.com/pewdiepie We're gonna give away a computer that I've been using. It makes it better if I've been using it, okay? All the files will be there, all the history, all the data... Think about it. You're super zoomed in right now. Yeah you are, I can see the lens.

Hey, it's me. Uh, I thought we're gonna talk about a video I made a year ago... It was about happiness. It was about forced positivity... Remember that video? I don't think being happy all the time is something. desirable, at all. Now if you watch my older videos, I might seem a lot happier... I might see a lot chiper a lot more positive and that's because...(susense poods) I faked it. Basically I talked about how a lot of youtubers, had to keep up this sort of facade of happiness and oh look how great everything is, to sort of draw people in and be entertained by you. Cuz no one likes to hear a mopey ass. little (mouthing a word) People... people are generally drawn to, eh, happiness, and, uh, I got really fed up and really tired of keeping this facade that uh Yeah, I'm really enjoying this game. I'm really having a great time playing this game Oh wow, I sure love playing Minecraft every single day for years. (Laughs in Thot) The video prompted a lot of responses and a lot of discussion And I thought it was really interesting and healthy and great thing in general that we brought it up. I remember really just playing games and in the back of my head, I was like: "I'm really hating this game. I'm really not entertained by this", but I sort of had this idea in my head that Well, it's my job and people want me to play it so I should just do it and you know... But it wasn't fulfilling for me, and it wasn't making me happy, and I noticed recently a lot of uh streamers AND YouTubers talking about this... eh sorta saying that they don't feel very happy, or as happy as they used to be; they, they don't feel fulfilled... It's a damn shame. And I see a lot of people in the comments, sort of being like: "well, it's your job. You should just suck it up. It's not that hard. YouTube is not a job." Ehehe! Which is true by the way... It's not a job. But I always feel bad when I see this because I can relate to the entertainer. I can can understand their perspective, and so I thought I would make a video just sort of Explaining that perspective cuz I think I think it's important for-for everyone the-the problem with being a YouTuber or-or... ...or an online entertainer is that you constantly have to outdo yourself. To keep people interested in what you are doing... You have to constantly keep pushing boundaries, and you are essentially.... co-competing more or less with other entertainers and other YouTubers for-for-for the audience to give... ...you the time that you want. This is not just to keep up your YouTube channel or whatever. It's also to keep up your livelihood. I-imagine your job or whatever you do being... a competition It's-it's not a healthy thing and I think a lot of people ass Get swept up in that but they have to keep Pushing themselves, and I think it's it's a good reflection of what happened with Logan Paul I know I keep bringing it up and that's not my point here. I don't think Logan necessarily is a bad person. I just think he really got caught up in that idea that he has to keep pushing himself to, get those numbers and if you make videos every single day It's really tough to keep... make people keep being interested and keep coming back. uhhh So I can sort of understand it and I can sort of relate to it in a way For me personally, I was really miserable before YouTube. YouTube is only really just done so many amazing thing to me And I-I don't want to seem like I'm complaining I'm-I'm-I couldn't be happier, but I think I still even though I talked about this a lot I think a lot of people have this illusion in their head that Money and fame is gonna bring them some sort of happiness. And I think a lot of YouTubers and a lot of entertainers when they get this get to the point where ackchyually I have everything I want or thought I wanted, but I don't feel happy and I don't feel fulfilled and that just makes them even more unhappy and less fulfilled and uh It's a very... it can be a very negative thing. Even though it's maybe might be ha-hard to understand as an audience as a as a... As a silent viewer or whatever. A few years ago, all I used to do was YouTube. It was seven days a week... (now I do six days a week) ... I would make videos. I would go... wake up, go to my room, make videos and that was it. I didn't have any hobbies, I didn't have any other interests. I wouldn't hang out with friends and looking back that was an extremely... Unhealthy thing to do. And I would do whatever videos My fans wanted me to do; the fans that I have gotten because I had this very serious approach to YouTube You know it's my job. I have to keep doing this. I am so lucky to be in this position I have to respect it. My personal well-being or health That's number two, but it got to a point for me where I just felt like Enough, this is not making me happy I don't want to keep doing this. I'm either gonna quit it or I'm just gonna say all right well I'm gonna do it my way and if I lose a couple fans in the process then I can afford that. I'm in a position where I can afford doing that and I was really ready for my channel to Just come down crashing, an-and that would be it, but at least then I would be fulfilled, at least I would be happier I w- I was met with a lotta-a lot of criticism a lot of a lot of angry fans, that said "oh you are not playing amnesia... You've really changed, or you're not playing this game anymore. You really changed" but... eventually I... It took some time, but eventually it broke through and all the sudden I had people loving what I was doing because There was actual passion behind it, there was actual things that I enjoyed, that I could share, I... I got hobbies that I really enjoyed and I could share those as well, like whiskey videos something. I enjoy and I started exercising meeting friends and all these things that I used to do and it just It made such a huge difference for me, and it might just seem obvious But when you're so swept up into YouTube It really isn't and it also had the opposite effect that I thought my channel will go down But it it did really well eithe-either way. My advice to a lot of youtubers and entertainers is do what makes YOU happy If you lose some fans in the process - I think in the in the end it will be worth it And I think a lot of us need to stop taking their own personal health eh... after.. Whatever it is they're doing. I am really in the the... the best place I ever been and uh... I'm just having a blast with YouTube and everything I'm doing right now And I'm so happy I made that choice And that's sort of why I wanted to share this and I also wanted to give some insight for you guys to understand Yes, YouTube isn't really a job, but it's also if it can also be extremely tough, and it extremely weighing you down It's the easiest and the toughest job I ever done It's not like I don't want people to pat me on the back being like "yeah, it is a really tough..." "... you're doing a great job...." That's not it at all But I you don't deserve to be slapped in the face for it either Be happy be nice to each other and have a good smile everybody for every once in a while make sure To smile and ALSO make sure to leave a like on this video if you found it helpful at all Clap it up everybody. I need an outro if anyone can help me with that... a brofist? ahhh... (sniffle snuffle the fist) mm- There- there you go... there you go (FINALLY)   Are you happy now? (YES) 'aight... I did it...I did the-... I did the pandering HAHAHAHAHA!

Time for another LWIAY episode... I wonder what memes they're gonna post this week... Let's get real here. They're all just... they're all just jokes on your expense Felix They're all making fun of you. You are nothing. You're worthless. You can't beat Hey, how's it going bros? My name is Pewdiepie *cue stolen intro stolen by Jacksfilms but like Pewds is better and yes that's how it works* Welcome to another week of *on the brink of an orgasm* LWIAY. Rolls off the tongue like a spider that's crawling your mouth while you were sleeping. It's a fact, look it up We're gonna go through your meme submissions from last week. Oh wow how exciting! ha What did you post this time? I can't wait to find out. Here we go. Any chair memes perhaps? Let's explore! This is probably-- it has nothing to do with chair memes *maybe with back problem memes?* Where is it? "But can you do this?" *i bet you can't* "399 -- that's a great price!" That's a great price. You know what? Have I told-- I don't know if I mentioned this, but I have this own custom-made chair, and it's only -- get this -- it's only 399 That's... great price You can-- think how many isopods you can buy for that price? Huh? Huh? But... can you do this? *$399 everybody* *what else can you ask for?* Think about it "PewDiePie fears no man". "I fear no man, but that thing, it scares me." Ahahahaha. L-look at that. He can't make handshakes. It's actually one of those things. That is a genuine insecurity It's been with-- lingering me-- with me for years. I just don't understand There's so many different things, like they go in for this, and I'm like "what do you want?" Can we just do a handshake like everyone else-- handshakes is fine! I'm fine with a handshake! I have a great handshake! If you ever meet me *spit on 'em* Let's go, brother This is great cause I absolutely hate this song *why does this exist?* Ok, well *what an actual waste of time* Okay, all right, well, I hate-- uh, great. I'm glad you spent time doing that. Good for you. Good for you You made it to the video "How to get girls around the world" "Want a tide pod?" "I will chaw you da wae my kwean" "show bobs n vagene" "b*ch lasagna." Sweden "Hej Monika" "But can you do this". No, it should just be "hej Monika". "Hej Monika, hej på dig Monika" Best song in the whole world. Party in the Backyard -- hell yeah. Hell yeah man that's the best song Turn that sh*t up Is that "Hey Hey Monika"? Is that "Hey Hey Monika"? Hell yeah man, turn that sh*t up man. Crank that up to the max, b*ch! "Making your own content... copying another YouTuber's content... copying another YouTuber and claiming it was a coincidence" *Pewds did it first* "Copying another YouTuber"... *that's an actual fact* *claps* I don't know what you talking about Guys I feel like I have to set things right last LWIAY I, uh, I memed that Jacksfilms copied my videos L-l-l he-- Jacksfilms is kind of like the The Simpsons of YouTube He's done so many episodes of his show, YIAY, that you're bound to make some stuff the same the Simpsons already did it essentially is what I'm getting at. It turned out that I had done like a couple same video ideas as him, some intentional and some unintentional And I just embraced the meme that he was the one copying me even though clearly all his videos were uploaded way before mine. You can just check the dates. It's not that hard to investigate, but I memed it a little bit too hard and people thought it was real and started hating on him and it just made my fan base look even more cancerous than it already is -- good job guys, A+ -- and because some people didn't get the joke, which is what's fun about the joke, so here I am again explaining the joke and ruining it as I always do. Legit, check out Jacksfilms, subscribe to him. He's a-- he's a legend on YouTube. He's one of the best comedians on YouTube everybody, so there you go. And he's also a great guy I, uh, I I feel bad having him... get a bunch of shit for a meme that was sort of unsolicited but funny nonetheless. Now it isn't anymore, con-congrats, another dead meme everybody. There you go. "My content got stolen recently. I was pretty bummed out about it, but I think whoever stole "it was probably more happy to get it than I'm sad to lose it, so whatever". "He did it! #1 on Trending" No, *we* did it. We're a community Except I reap all the benefit, but *we* did it. "Pewds should get an isopod as a Slippy replacement" Eww... I mean yes! I would love an isopod! Thank you, please, who wouldn't want that thing in their house? I would love to have one of those They're so cute. Is it isopod hour yet? Oh shame, shame it's not. LWIAY versus YIAY. That's right! It's better! yOU can't cOpy SomethINg if IT'S BETtER Oh, "smiling for seven seconds so the video is 10:06 long". No, I smiled because smiling is contagious, *that's right* okay? If I smile, you smile, it's like that Justin Bieber song. And, smiling has been proven to give you more endorphins, making you actually feel happier. Even if you're not! So just keep smiling and you get happier. It's great. I'm so happy! Is the video 10 minutes? *rare footage of jackspedicy* Come on, PewdiepieSubmissions isn't that bad, don't sell yourself short, guys. They're-- they're getting better I'll give you that. They're getting better. The memes are getting a little fresher, little less cringy and overall, uh make me less suicidal every time. It's great. Thank you. "Ta min hand, och visa mig vägen" "visa mig vägen, show me the way" That's right, "visa mig vägen", that means "show me da way" in Swedish. "Logan Paul: 'I didn't realize people who commit suicide'"... "'kill themselves'". It's a classic error, everyone makes that mistake at least once in their life. "The Onion is satire, didn't you know?" What? "We are waiting". "We're almost at 60 million subscribers, if we hit 60 million, "I'm going to shave... one hair off my beard." I didn't do it. Oh my god I have to shave the beard, of course! *bye pewds* *is the vid 10 mins yet?* *will he come back?* *maybe* *when it is 10 minutes, of course* Woo, this is tough. I don't really know if I should be doing this, man. Which one should I...? Which one should I do, man? Oh... Maybe we should zoom in Oh, there's... See that one? Huh? See that one? It's gonna die. It's about to die. Dude, I got at least three of them! Aaaaah! "Ayyy second try uploading this digital artwork I did. Squad fam leader Pewds" "dvrks0ul", very cool fanart. Thank you very much There you go, I threw a kiss at you You have been granted immortality, you're welcome Woah, what is this? *guy in video:* "May I have your attention please" "May I have your attention please" Alright, this better be good. "Will the real Pewdiepie please stand up" I'm standing I'm standing
*guy in video:* "I repeat,"
No. "Will the real Pewdiepie--"
Ok... Hell yeah! That's right Hey! Ayy! Good shit, man, very, uh, respec, respect to you man "It's official, he made the original" OHHHHHH! How about that, Jacksfilms!? Oh you thought it was funny to tape the fidget spinners to the sunglasses Wow, what an amazing original creative idea. Where did you think of it Jack? "Pewdiepie's new chair, only 3.99" Hey man, let's not make fun of homeless people, guys. That could be me in the future. *clap* LWIAY vs. YIAY. Here we go. "Has a crappy host", ding, ding. Okay, fair. "The show is unoriginal", ding-- *sudden realizes* RRRRR who made this? "Has their parents disappointed". That's true, mine are very pleased. "Uses fans for views"? What? What? Oh that's... that's so uncalled for. I would never, I would never do that, guys. I hope you understand where I'm coming from here cause I would never use you for views. I care about my fans like no other YouTuber Jacksfilms, Jacksepticeye, Markiplier, they don't care about their fans. They're just keeping up a fake façade. I truly care, okay? "LWIAY: last week I asked you" "But what did you ask Felix? You're just looking at memes" What do you m--? What? What? No! "Upvote for Pewds to do another greenscreen competition". Ah, he-heck it. Let's do it to the n-- the... nex-- this one, I'll, uh, I'll add the link to it in the description It's been-- it's been too long. I've s-yeah, I've seen this one Yummy!

Link in the description S-thank you guys so much for another LWIAY.

It's a repost of me reposting a repost. Congratulations. If Felix says 'stop reposting my tweets,' then why he reposts our memes? *Illuminati Music Plays* Shut the fu- Can't be the most hated person on the Internet if there is no Internet *Laughs* YouTube rewind was shit.

Hey, that's her now. *stumbling with words* Clearly that's the meme, loo- *stumbling with words again* Do I have to make the memes *for you* now?! Is that what this has come to?! Learn how to f- *Christian channel* Learn how to bleepin' meme! If you're gonna post on my reddit! Do you think this is some sort of joke?! "No Title Needed." Buddy, If you're good at something, Never do it for free. "Stolen memes" I think I make five bucks from these. *get the fuck out of here...* "Haters," "YouTube demonesation... demone-tization," "Media," "Pewdiepie," "Reddit." Ah... Can you add another frame to this where Reddit puts a dagger in my back? How 'bout that? Then it's accurate. Then I will give it a little *laugh* Pewds in high school. ry = ln (cᵉ) + ln (ni/v) ry = ln ((cᵉ)... C raised E. (C raised to E). I don't know the.. English Terminology... you're al- you're always so up in my ass about things, like I said the A 2 B 2 squared and *complaint noises* In Sweden, we say A 2, *ehh* i kvadrat (squared) *swedish* Means *ehhh* Squared. So it's- jus- just shut up... is what I'm trying to tell you. And that becomes E R Y When you remove the ln... Which becomes C E N I B, which becomes ver- *laughing* V times E raised to RY Okay, very it becomes very nice Now this is math This is why I dropped out of high school Which I didn't, out of university, I dropped out of university ok I'm not some sort of pleb that didn't make it through high school who drops out at the high school When I say very n- *stutters* very nice, it's not just me Having the lack of better word and repeating myself constantly because I'm not smart enough It's me challenging you guys with complex mathematical equations to see are you paying attention, is he saying very nice or VERY nice. It's a it's a black and white difference, and you can't argue against it I'm putting way too much emphasis into one single image, and we have a lot to go through so let's keep going. Tables have turned (very nice dead meme) *laughs* *inhales* Ok that was like I was a good good example of a *stutters* Reverse petting dog meme, well done. I created a reddit account just to submit this. ok, well it has to be good. I will be aborted soon-*laughs in the middle of word* I'm not even gonna finish it *laughs again* Rewind 2017 Raise that finger doggy. There you go. (very nice) That's, that's how you do the image Inspiring quotes by famous people. "A man is but the product of his thought Thoughts of what he thinks he becomes". "Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world." *while laughing* "Buy my chair, it's only $399". Yes, yes it is only $399 and I'll have you let you know, but can you do this? (nope) I Don't think so. Am I doing this right? That's a pretty good Photoshop. I got it Well done good job. Oh, it's a Doki Doki meme. (ok) Watching pewds play Doki Doki. *laughs* Pretty accurate I must say. Got what you wanted. Hey look at that? Told you. I told you I could have held their hands Good meme, good meme. Well done. Well done. I see no difference. oh my god Actually, yeah, what the heck? One doesn't have a pedo beard.. goddamit. Can I? The real reason Why pewdiepie wasn't in YouTube rewind, it's because the video wasn't ten minutes. Yeah, Why did they not make it ten minutes? but they know that they can just make the outro three minutes longer, and then they get three times the revenue Imagine if you had me work, and you have to do a specific amount of work, But you could get three times more for that work, if you happen to make the video ten minutes long *laughs* When pewds has died like five thousand times? but it's still zero deaths. Told you guys. I challenge you intellectually and I'm glad that you're thinking. When it's January and your shirt forshadows the future... *exhales from nose harshly* I Remember wearing that in January. I Foreshadowed the future. Okay. I wore that thinking; yes. This is actually true I even said it in videos 2017 is the year where it's all gonna go down for me, because I knew the media where the media was going with it Okay, I'm not stupid low-effort memes guys literally only want one thing And it's effing disgusting original content *claps sarcastically* Good job *laughs* *claps again* What happened? Listen, this hair, this hair... I Fuckin rock it okay. You wish, you wish that you can have this hair. Get into trending, come on. I haven't seen a single one of my videos get to trending in 84 years 2017 - 84 is 1933. (wtf) Federal election were held in Germany in 1933 Adolf Hitler height, PewDiePie height, Coincidence? I think not. *what the fuck am i doing with my life* S T A H P First "very nice" on the Christian Channel, very nice. oh shit, you're right. *flashbacks* ♩I will remember you (I will remeber you - Sarah Mclachlan) I will remember you, Will you remember me?

REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE Hey guys, what's up? Welcome to another video *dab dab dab dab dab dab dab  Mhhhhhhhhhh (7th most handsome man of 2017, ladies and gents) I'm sick Which is okay, because I wanted to make this chill video for quite some time showing off my figurine collection Yes, that's right. Who doesn't want to know about my *???????????? Manchild hobby? Who doesn't care about toys. I know you do HHMmmmMmm!? Hmmm MMMmmmmmmm ...Mmm. for real, uh you may have seen in the in the back I usually have some figurines there, and I got a lot of questions about them, so now I'm going to tell you and start off right away with the ones I typically have: the Kawz figurines Badupbadup Ba Da Bup! Dabuuuduppbup buh dup babowww got got all three of them, baby Marzia my **lovely** girlfriend gave me these for my birthday I'm very happy with these. These are probably one of my favorite and that's why they just look so good. Now Kawz is an incredible artist.. I... Uhh.. I've been following his stuff for a couple years These sort of figurines would go for like 50 bucks(50$) back in the day And I think now they these just one range from like $200 to (only $399, pewds?) 500 maybe I don't know. it's insane how popular they become they've sort of became a hypebeast Symbol almost which is really strange I got this Kawz tattoo you a couple years back A one-in of one of his figurines my favorite one which I actually don't own. It's fine I haven't I have the tattoo I don't need that... and I saw it in the background of like a DJ Khaled video And I just cringe so hard maybe it's unfair for me to judge DJ Khaled's opinion on art But I just I think a lot of people just want these For the not for the sake of the artist and the artwork just because they're... they're a symbol now. They've sort of become a symbol of The hypebeast culture we it's a shame because I think Kawz the artist has a really interesting history. He started off as a Graffiti artist just scribbling on top of ads in New York City super cool stuff but then I think he got promoted a lot by really big celebrities like Kanye West and Pharrell Williams and DJ Khaled, and I guess me now if you want to get one of these I recommend watching out for fake ones Make sure that the bottom has Medicom TOI China, so it's signed if it's really cheap, it's probably fake I've seen a lot of these go for like 20 bucks on eBay. It's fake. You don't want to get fake stuff That's not cool. I love this one this so this is the version that has the intestine exposed and the why I rub that so essentially it's a the Mickey Mouse undead version I don't know. I don't know what it is to be honest. This is an amazing piece of art Let's put them on the show. I mean come on. They look great. They look great next one you probably haven't seen It's a figurine Custom-made from Japan. I bought it in this store called Mandarake (Mandarake Mon) which is in Tokyo Shibuya? they sell a lot of custom toys and figurines and Vintage toys as well, I thought this was a vintage toy Marzia gave me this one as well, so Marzia paid for half of these my head screws. It's.. It can move its leg This one is from KIKKAKE toy. They do different versions of these like different colors Different stuff like that. I think they are about 23,000 yen, which is like $215 or pounds which is a bit expensive? Yes, but I always like to get one of these from Mandarake when I go to Japan as a memory of that trip And it's worth it like I know For some people it might be outrageous to spend that amount of money on a figurine, but I'm I'm very pleased with it It's a fine piece of art, and I would never get rid of it. Another... Collectible type of figurine is this brick bear You've probably seen these they do a ton of different variations of these. This is the Mount Fuji version It's very cool. It's another thing I bought because I wanted to get a memory from another Japan trip I've been five times now, and it never gets dull. I know it's kind of a... *"sexy" voice* He's a dweeb. He just loves Japan, but how can you not? It's so much fun. Every time I go and I want to get a memory of a figurine so I got this one this one is probably like 50 bucks 20 Bucks some variations of these I swear like a thousand or five thousand they're insane I probably wouldn't get more of these even though they're... You can technically collect like a bunch of different ones (Who turned off the lights?? Hold meh!) It's a bit too simple for me I don't I don't really see the mass appeal of these to be honest as much as I do with the Kawz This feels more like a collectible figurine toy. Kawz's work seems more like Artwork to me at least that's how I see it. And speaking of which another gift from Marzia *timid chuckle* I'm paying for (OOF dog?) a Gary Baseman porcelain figurine careful not to drop this extremely detailed Extremely beautiful. This is number... 224 out of I think 815 I think this one is like 500 pounds. Pretty expensive , but it's made together with a porcelain company Lladro. I love this art I love Gary Baseman's art. He's another very underrated artist I would say compared to Kawz definitely check him out if you want to get some like cheaper But still really cool figurines. This one is more expensive because it's a special edition, but I love this one I just realized he has the eye that actually looks like that tattoo that I have Hey, I got tattoos of my figurines how about that? Gary Baseman does just like Kawz? Incredible piece of art and paintings I mean, but then he got into 3d art And I think that's where he really shines. I think this sort of stuff is just so cool Again, this feels more like an art piece of art, then then a figurine or something like that. I don't know Next up we have--very proud of this one! It's Gundam of Zhu ku, I don't watch Gundam, I just loved building them I don't know if that's a shameful thing to admit or not But typically I would say building models so basically I built this myself Just putting all the pieces together You have to build the skeleton and then from all the exterior it took me a couple days at least it's not very well, built because Pieces tend to fall off. I'm gonna try to be careful, but like it can go into rocket mode so we can pull all these off, and then this should come off as well. Does anyone care about this?? I care so shut up. You can open up the helmet you can take off the *Pewds breaking stuff* You can take off the the thing and then move this up and you got a little dude sitting there, and he can go into his power mode and *Power mode initiated* There you go look at that *OOF* I think is like every single piece of this are just bits put together So you're not really I guess unless you glue it You're not really supposed to fiddle with it and has so many goddamn moving parts. It's ridiculous I'm not making a great case for this, I... This is the only piece I broke, okay? Shut up Someone's gonna make a 20 minute video explaining what I did wrong as a response Listen! I'm proud of this be quiet. There you go. Look. he's fine. He's fine Zaku is fine. Anyway, I would love to build more of these This is a perfect grade version, which means it's one to sixteen scale if you want to get one I think this is like 150 bucks, but you can get a smaller version I think like I said, I think building models is kind of lame (nice try, Pewds. Nice try), but just because they're so well designed these... so cool It's like you get a cheaper really cool figurine. Next up, we have this Godzilla figurine. Yes! this is actually just a toy. Uhm, for kids I love Godzilla I mean how can you not love Godzilla? You have a country that gets... that goes through two of the most horrific Bombing of history and then out comes this metaphorical figure That is just so badass but what I love most about this thing is that a lot of people come over and they look at this and If you move the legs, it does that! and it pokes their eye out It's hilarious Next up is another figurine for my second trip to Japan Mandarake again; it's a custom toy. I love this one. I have no idea where it's from I don't know what its referencing, but Illuminati, amairite? Look at that I love how asymmetric it is.Like all the detail it really feels like it's... it's Personally just hand-drawn and made which I think is really cool. obviously, that's not the case. That would cost I think a lot more, but I think it also has some Nazi symbols on it  (Noooooo) Which is a bit strange... and these titties? I just realized. But it's probably the Buddhism, but for the sake of ad revenue I'm gonna put this one away now Thank you Remember what I said about the fake Kawz you gotta be careful because this was gifted to me as well. This is another gift ...and It's fake. It has no sign at the bottom, the plastic feels kind of cheap, It's kind of squiggly Like you hear that?  *clacking and clicking* Which is a shame, because I love this art. I love this figurine. I'm not okay with art theft I'm very strongly against it, but since it was a gift it can't be helped It's a shame, but I still love it. It's still it's still a nice gift I can't...  I'm still very happy with it, but yeah, be careful if you're buying Figurines to make sure you don't don't get fake ones. My third trip to Japan, I got this bad boy Mandarake as well So cool. I thought this was a vintage toy when I bought it But it's a it's a custom made from Japanese symbols. I don't know what they are. I love the scarf detail I guess it's some sort of desert monster It's like a scorpion or something like that turning to a... I don't know. it's very cool That's all I know: it's very cool. Come on. Got another original fake Kawz figurine I love the design of this one This one is real. I feel like they... Kawz literally was like since these figurines got so popular. He was all just like you guys would literally buy anything I put out You know I can-- I can just mess up the figurine you guys will literally still buy it and Lo and behold!! This is worth hundreds of dollars. I love... it's still incredibly... Well-designed for being just a mess and it stands up fine like it's It's really cool. I really love it even though it's kind of kind of a statement. I feel like against Against the consumers or its movement I suppose now from my latest trip in Japan I didn't pick up any thing from Mandarake. I did buy this Blame! figurine It's Killy. Blame! of course, he is the best manga of all time It's a shame the anime wasn't that great, but at least you get some cool figurines out of it And I'm very happy to finally own some Blame! merchandise, or blam I also got the Safeguard which is hilarious if you want to pose it I *pewds amusing self* I don't think this is how this toy was intended, but it's very cool I didn't particularly like the Safeguard design in the.. in the anime, but the figurine looks really cool, actually. I also got this, you probably saw in my blog It's not a Gundam. I'm such an idiot It was in the Gundam section of the store, so that's why I got confused and everything is in another language But it's really cool. It's got the little guy on top which is dope. I can open up here And I think there's a guy in there as well. Yeah, it is so it is kind of a it's like a mecha The eyes lit up as well Which is pretty dope. Very happy with it, nevertheless. Even though it wasn't what I wanted. I also got this golden Gundam, which is so cool. I built this as soon as I got home It looks so sick. This is like 20 bucks Amazing. How cool is that? Come on. I don't know. Just a quick show, because I realized I probably have been going on for quite a while I think the back comes out Yeah, it does. I guess this is like his wings or some So cool. Drink (water, kids) every time I say "so cool" in this video LAST, BUT NOT LEAST! Tadaaaaaaaa My favourite figurine. It's not a figurine you can probably tell that it's Gary Baseman, again I have a Gary Baseman tattoo as well, actually. I love his art This is like his... his Icon figure, Toby. And he sold this... I think I saw a tweet or something that he's selling these and I was like WHATAMIGONNADOOOOO??? I don't think I bought anything that quickly. I got number 94 out of a hundred. I'm so happy I got one of these. It's incredible I don't know how much this is worth Like I feel like this would be worth a lot at this point, 'cuz Toby is like his main figurine. This is so cool I usually don't like plushies and stuff. I guess it's not a plushie, but It stands up, because of his tail I love the art It reminds me of Monkey Bone. If you've seen that movie. It feels like a Like a cursed item that you buy *giggles* You buy somewhere and then your whole life gets messed up Just like mine did. So dope! And that concludes my figurine collection. Which one was your favorite? Let me know. Do you collect figurines as well? Let me know. I hope I will feel less sick tomorrow I think I have a little bit of fever, so it kind of makes sense to do a shill video I hope you enjoyed it, please leave a thumbs up if you do I would really appreciate it a lot That's it for me for now. Have a great one. Goodbye (  Feel Better!!! &lt;3  )

No one answer, then he said that none of you have had your heart broken they don't know the pain they don't know the pain. It's like getting shot with a 50 Cal straining the nuts (dafuq) That's how it feels and even that can heal you can heal you can grow back your nuts, but you can't grow back a heart (life lessons with papi poods) cHrIstIAN ChAnNeL "People think it's fun and cool to be "woke" lol, it's actually pretty shitty and frustrating being conscious in an unconscious society" basically society You. here. me?

Hello, bros. It's time for an update vlog. I've been holding out on you. I've been waiting to do this Cause I thought a year review was in good time for the holidays to do ummmmm It's been quite the year. I don't know if you've noticed   it's probably been the most insane year of my life literally so many things just got completely switched up side down lost a lot of friends lost a lot of... a lot of things but I'm looking back on 2017 and it doesn't feel negative it doesn't feel like I'm necessarily a bad thing and I will try and explain why at around this time last year I made a video saying I was gonna delete my channel at 50 million we're at 58 million right now, by the way, thank you very much I know you're gonna think I'm joking right now but I'm gonna delete my channel I swear to you at 50 million subs, when we hit 50 million huge landmark coming up huge deal, never been done before, no one's even close I am deleting my channel so dramatic, hehehe f*cking assh*le (trying not to get demonetized) I'm gonna delete my channel at 60 million, guys I promise, it's definitely going to happen um that was sort of a joke but at the same time, I didn't feel like that was necessarily the case I really felt like I wanted to delete my channel uh, because I was so stuck in between al these business side of youtube you didn't see a fraction of it, but for me, to do youtube every single day upload daily videos, and still be going on trips for all these different events, uh going on trips for business stuff uh, having calls every single day talking about, you know, revelmode and all these things I was working on and working on Scare Pewdiepie being away for a month I was so BURNED out and I know, boohoo me, right? I put myself in that situation but I realized: "this is not.. whehehehhh.. I'm stuck here!" and I- this is not what I want I just wanna make videos! wheheh- what the hell happened? I literally went through like, an ACTUAL mental breakdown it just got too much for me and I think I have a really strong mental ehh- psyche, like I can handle more shit than most people I- I feel confident saying that but it really got to me at a point, and and I'm not tryna get brown- like euhbleuh points, like I- that's not the case so, when all this stuff happened in February, when all the stuff about me being a Nazi came out some things of it was awful the fact that season two of Scare Pewdiepie got canceled, just sucked, I don't... ehh and in retrospect, it still doesn't make any sense to me so many people worked on that show it's, it's, it's really it's a shame for everyone that involved, and I'm REALLY sorry for everyone involved uhhhh but it also got me out of all these things that I didn't even enjoy working on, at the time I was so fed up with it so.. it was sort of a blessing in disguise and, and this year in general the main thing throughout all these bad things happening I regained SO much support from you guys uhhh, and it's something that I never thought I would get back I had sorta given up on the idea that my fans were really gonna have this commu- have this sense of community again and, uh you know, for all these bad things, to trade that, I would take it, i- it's just been amazing then, the AdPocalypse happened oh boy and I vowed to go family friendly that worked out GREAT, didn't it? to be honest, the- when the AdPocalypse happened, I did get hit REALLY hard, it was a time of panic, 'cause all the sudden all of your videos are- you're not getting any income with the- all the wall street stuff happening my CPM, which is, like, my average income-thing dropped, because I was kicked out of- um youtube, uhhhhhhhh what is it called? their special ad-program or whatever but then I realized, hey I can literally just put one extra midrole in the video and it doesn't make any difference, like, I actually don't lose anything and, uh, so I started doing that, as a way to, like, you know what, FU, Wall Street, you're not gonna make me go down, you know? uh, it's not like I NEED the money, it was more like, uh I wanna show them that this is not gonna affect me in any way so in case you're wondering why there's a midrole, there you go! umm, at the end of the day, I used to have an office I used to have a bunch of people working for me, uhhhhhhhhhhh, but I also realized I didn't want that I used to have, like, a secretary, helping me get coffee and, like I- I don't really feel comfortable letting other people do stuff for me it really wasn't what I wanted at all so I just, panicked, I got super sick like, the worst sickness of my life and, I decided to- hey, I can just record from this place it's so much more convenient, I don't have to have other people in the other room when I record, uh, this is how I started making videos, in this room and, uh, that's how I wanna keep- I wanna keep it simple I would always say like "oh, uh, youtube isn't the best, because you get just me and it's not me and a producer and a writer" but how do all these people help in me, do all this stuff and it really felt like I was getting against what I was so spoken about before so I got really sick, and then Jake Paul stuff came out, and it was like the best- that was like the best thing that could- that could happen because, I fi- I had something to just make a video of right away when I was away which is always nice and this is when I decided: "I'm gonna grow a beard" Is Keemstar tryna roast my beard? I made a video called: "I'm tired of trying" where I basically talked that- I really used to be very focused on trends, I used to be very focused on, like, how well a video did, that would take up a lot of my mindspace, and it I think most youtubers think like that I realized, I don't wanna I wouldn't wanna shape my channel that way, I I wanna do what I wanna do, I wanna make the videos that I enjoy making, and, uhhh that has been my mindset for the past couple months, and it's just turned out SO much better, you know whether it's me, talking about something that I enjoy, like whiskey that, for me, has just been really fun I've been enjoying just the- sharing stuff that I like, and I think you guys have as well and it's been really fun to, and it's such a better way of making videos maybe it doesn't get as many views, but it's more fun! and I would rather watch someone talk about stuff that they like, than fucking play a game that they don't really enjoy I started doing these L-LWIAY videos where I react to your reddit stuff and that was just the best idea ever I know it's like, a meme, that it's not original content and it's- or whatever, but it really sh- came back the the sorta community on the channel uhhh, seeing your humor and my humor sorta collide into different type of memes it's just so cool and so fun and uh I love it so much, I love that we fi- we have a community on this channel rather than just me just doing random bullshit, playing random games uhh, I'm really proud of that, and I'm really proud of that we are at this point, where we are and it really- thanks to everyone for posting in these I started doing you laugh you lose-es which was also the kind of thing people didn't like in the beginning, they were like, what are you, just looking at other people's clip, what are you, Ray William Johnson? OH JESUS WHAT THE FUCK I enjoyed it, it was just like, I enjoyed making them, they were fun, I love laughing at these stupid clips! so why shouldn't I make them? s- and I'm really glad I kept doing them because I think you guys actually really like them too ohhhhhhhhh man and I started streaming, 'cause I was really into pubg and I dont think I- before, I was so pre-occupied with youtube I had literally no other intrest it was youtube, or nothing it was all that was in my head, 24/7 a day so I allowed myself to enjoy other things and actually playing games again on my spare time that's why I enjoyed streaming so much this is the day before the slip-up I hate how- it's so fucking unfair, dude shoot me shoot me where is this nibba? oh my god FUCK YOU then, the slip-up happened, and, uhhhhhhh definitely, you know, once a year, not even worth, once every ten years, not even, but like twice a year? you fcking idiot uhhhhhhhhhhhh and this time, it was sorta different, 'cause I felt personally responsible, I felt like, you know, this is my fault I shouldn't even, I shouldn't even defend this and uh, that's what I did, I'm ehh, really glad for all the support I still got even though I clearly fucked up, but I'm glad people accepted my apology uhh, and I was able to move past it I really started making videos just that just about stuff that fascinated me like chris chann uh, or just talking about memes or IT'S NOT ORIGINAL CONTENT yes, I know, but I LOVE talking about these things I LOVE sharing these things and I think it's so much more interesting to hear someone talk about something they're interested in and, uh, that's just been my approach would I ever make a fucking Star Wars review in 2016? hell no but did I really have a lot of thoughts about the movie that I wanted to share? yes, and that's why I did it and I think it's such a better approach and I'm so happy I stuck with it so much has changed this year but at the end of the year, I am so much happier I'm so glad I'm here, FINALLY internet is gonna be installed on the 22nd maybe that has happened already, even me just keeping my fcking beard, 'cause it's the kinda thing where everyone in the comments will tell you "just shave, just shave" and I'm like "I like the beard, I'm gonna keep it" it's really- I know it sounds stupid but I I really think I- I'm really proud of myself for gaining a lot more confidence in myself uh, to resist what other people say I should do, or how other people tell me how to- how to do things it's so easy to listen to comments, I really think everyone does uhhhhhhhhhhhm but ehhh I think, at the end of the day, people appreciate that you are you, and not just a product of what other people want you to be uh, that sounded a lot deeper than I meant it to be I'm also just really grateful, that I can keep making videos, at this point you look at anyone else that's been number 1 on youtube, and it's practically a dead channel, and they didn't last very long so, for me, at this point, to still be relevant enough that people care what I say and what I do and- and click on my videos, that really means the world to me because I still very much enjoy videos, I get so many 'haters' saying like: oh, if I was PewDiePie, I would just quit making videos, he already made millions what an idiot, MAYBE I'm passionate about it, maybe I still enjoy it it's like.. I really think 2017 is the year where I've lost, uhhh a lot of support from youtube, but it's the year where I've regained the support from my fans (aww) and that, I will never forget! 'Cause I went through so many changes so, it felt like, uhh so many of my fans hated me, or whatever I'm just so glad that, finally, we have a community and finally- AGAIN, and finally we have, uh, I have people that I really feel like there's people that support me I really do, uh feel like that finally and that, that really means a lot so thank you! it's been- despite all the downsides, it's been an amazing year and I'm really proud and happy looking back, believe it or not uhhh, you learn from your mistakes, and, uh, that's just life! THAT'S LIFE! it's a Room reference everybody thank you to everyone for ehh hanging out with me this year can't wait for next one and as always, squad fam- should we do- should we do a brofist? I'll let it slide this time :) brofist &lt;3

Thank you very much ok alright ok Feels kind of stupid making a video like this because who cares what PewDiePie has to say about literature if you follow me on Twitter, I've been posting I've been reading a lot of books lately and a lot of people were asking, "hey Do a book review" so here I am. it was three people that asked actually it's really weird I don't think I've ever read this much in my entire life. It just sort of happened, and I've been loving it I had a blast this month reading these books Consider Phlebas, Brave New World, Fahrenheit 451, Children of Time, the Picture of Dorian Gray, and 12 Rules of Life. I basically wasn't - it's not a new year's resolution or anything like that I used to read, YouTube sort of made me completely stop And I've been really desperate to just do other things in my spare time and I've been loving it and I plan to keep, keep on reading and maybe uh, this could inspire you to read as well or uhhhh Might just be interesting to hear what I have to say. I don't know probably not, shut up! First book is: Consider Phlebas or plebas or phLeBaS. You know this is an important writer because the title of his name is five times big as the title of the book I didn't know anything about Ian M. Banks. I know he's from - he's a Scottish writer? this was written in nineteen 1987. I don't think the title or the cover has anything to do with the book I just knew I wanted to read a sci-fi I got this idea that I just want to immerse myself in a completely different universe and Space seems like a great place to go. I've been really interested in AI lately, and I thought Maybe, maybe I can discover that. I just searched up classic sci-fi and this is what came up. It's about the main character whose name is Horza, and he's a very interesting protagonist He's a changer as it's called and Whenever I, uhh Whenever I read a Old literature that is considered a classic But hasn't been made into any form of movie adaptation because Hollywood would literally take anything and make a movie out of it - But they don't - I'm always thinking why? Why has this not been made into a movie and well I think it's the protagonist. How do you make a movie about a character that can change into other people? It was very interesting to have a character, that's sort of OP (overpowered) in a sense. He can change into other people - not as seamlessly as x-men or whatever; that blue girl or whatever - But nevertheless he can do it he has teeth that if he bites you you'll become paralyzed and if he even just scratches you and He will have the same effect. He doesn't really use the powers as - just as a superhero It's more of a way to as a power struggle This is so uninteresting. I realize sorry, but the main cha - I just find it interesting that the main characters like he has these really great abilities and that made it really fun. It's basically about Horza who is - I don't; I feel bad for not remembering this - but he's with the Idiran, which is this space group of people. Man, I'm explaining this amazing. and Idiran is at war with The Culture which is this uh space group of people. And Horza is uh, he wants Through some strange turn of events, he wants to retrieve this AI that had crash-landed on a planet called Schar's World That's the story. A lot of things happen in between but if you write a summary of the plot it can be extremely short But it is a space opera in a sense that a lot of cool stuff happens You know? They, they fight at a temple, They play this crazy space game; things that it wasn't really necessary for the plot but it was fun to be part of the journey and That's what I enjoyed about it. Iain the writer loves the culture. It's very clear while reading this that he loves describing What? the civil - space, civilization is, what their morals are, what their ideas are and He spends a lot of time on this and personally I found it a bit boring after a while I wanted to know more about Horza. Why is he part of the Idiran? Why does he want to retrieve the AI so badly? What is his motive as a character? What is that drives him through to to want this so badly? We never really find the answer to that which I find to be kind of annoying But it wraps up nicely in the end and it's overall just a fun space adventure I think that's really all it is so I would rate this 3 out of 5 stars It was alright. It was okay. Moving on: I wanted to read a dystopian futuristic Sci-fi. I read 1984 by George Orwell before and it's one of my favorite Books it was a book that really left that impact on me I and the meaning and the story tied together really gripped me and I think about it a lot. A lot of people suggested Brave New World by Aldous Huxley, which is very similar to 1984 but they sort of tackled the same issue but Completely different perspectives. Basically, uh Aldous describes a future - this was written, 1934 I think or something like that, a long time ago - and Aldous describes a a future horror scenario Human as a society. I think the year was like 2150 or something like that - we have a society where we are just perfectly content There's no problems, there's no diseases, people are born out of labs Through the Bokanovsky effect, people are born in- without a mother or a father They're just genetically produced. People are born into hierarchies So you have the hierarchies and social casts of alphas being the top guys Beta Gamma Delta's is that the right order and? Everyone is just content where they are. The alphas are happy they're not deltas, and Delta's are happy they're not alphas, and if there's ever a problem for the people in the society they just take soma; they, they brainwash themselves with drugs, and they just feel better It's sort of plays on the blissfully ignorant sort of way of living And this is how people want to live this is how people are happy to be. Then, another character gets introduced who grew up outside of civilization, he's called a savage He is basically us he is he has the same ideas and values as we do and he meets this new world, a brav- the Brave New World™️ the civilization that is completely different and the contrast between the savage and the civilization was hilarious I laughed so much while reading it. As an example: He tells the civilization that he has a mother. *civilized Pewds* a mother? HAHAHA I love her *civilized Pewds* you love her? HAHAjsHA It's very funny, I'm not even sure it's supposed to be funny But I, I laughed out loud a lot of times while reading it, but then The story like I said it might not seem as bad as in the beginning, but the story turns very grim and You understand that things are- this is not a way to live. This is actually a horror scenario and The ending left - just like 1984 - a very big impact on me. I think about this book a lot after reading it I love this book. I think it's a masterpiece 5 out of 5. It's an incredible piece of literature. I could not recommend this enough if you like a dystopian future So you probably read it already anyway. It's very interesting as well to compare it to 1984 1984 which is written by George Orwell Described a future just to oversimplify. He described a future Horror scenario as well where the government doesn't want you to read books I guess you can say, but Aldous describes the same fear, but he describes a future where society Doesn't want to read book- we just rejected it where we reject the knowledge ourselves So it's very interesting to have to two fears brewed into different uh, perspectives. Moving on, I don't need to go on too much So naturally I wanted to read more dystopian because I read two, and I loved them, so a lot of people suggested Fahrenheit 451 written by American writer Ray Bradbury, and you see here on the back: "Ray Bradbury's gift for storytelling reshaped our culture and expanded our world." - Barack Obama. I hated this book comparing this book to Brave New World, it makes this seem so shallow and so petty. I'll try my best to explain why I didn't like this book because I know a lot of people love this book and I know a lot of you probably have read this book because ironically your teacher told you to read this book- I bet you that's the case. And the irony of that is that it probably will turn people off right reading books Because it's not an interesting story, but it carries a very important message So, so teachers want kids to understand his message about why literature is important But it's just gonna turn them off. That's how I imagine it. Anyway, I need to explain what this book is about, sorry It's about Guy Montag who's a firefighter, Sorry, he's a fireman, but he doesn't extinguish fires, get this: he, he burns books Burning books, guys, burning books is BAD obviously That's an important message But I just found it to be told in a very shallow and uninteresting manner the meaning was the story And not the story itself, which I found to be kind of annoying. I didn't care about guy the firefighter. I didn't care what happened to him and It just made it not really interesting I read that apparently this book was written in a few days or maybe it was a month and you can tell I compared his writing style to, to Huxley it's this is a joke. I felt like sense it didn't really have a story, I'm just reading Ray Bradbury's ideas and his fears directly, and it just came across as kind of petty and Anti innovation, maybe at the time it was more reasonable to have the fear that in the future We're not gonna care about books anymore. That's Ray Bradbury's fear. His fear that we're gonna listen to the radio While doing other things and he makes a good point actually now that I think about it about, how we want to consume media so quickly now, that I did resonate to and he he sort of goes over the top with it he seems like the kind of person that will tell you don't spend too much time in the front of the TV because your eyes will become squared and to me that just seemed like Against innovation in the future. Yes, he was probably right about how quickly we want to consume media But people still read books just because we have computers and television and radio That doesn't turn off from anything Maybe I misinterpreted But that's just how I understood the writer. Because of that I can't give this book too high of a rating I will give it a two out of five I don't really understand its price, and I would not recommend this book I would much rather recommend a book like this or 1984 Next. book. So I asked Marzia what her favorite book was it's the Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde another, *smol kiss* fine piece of literature, and I understand exactly why Marzia loved this book, it has a meaningful, uh a meaningful story with sort of horror elements to it And I think, uh that hits, uh that's what Marzia would be interested in. The story is about Dorian Gray who gets painted by Basil, this painter and The third character, which name is Lord Henry. It's kind- I don't want to get too much into each character, but basically Henry, and it gets really infatuated by this Picture of, of Dorian It's just such a beautiful picture that he painted That Basil painted, and, and Dorian himself really adores his pic- painting, every one loves his painting But it's between them that that it's been painted *Doria* This is incredible and incredibly beautiful, man He's, he's the perfect perfect being it's described as and he's a He's in a high social caste. He's well regarded He's rich, and he has it all, basically he has everything you could possibly want But he realizes that he's not gonna have this youth, this beautiful face forever, so he he sort of wishes that he could have it forever He wishes that he could look this young as his picture and as beautiful as a picture forever and that becomes his curse because he doesn't age at all and, Instead the picture becomes a reflection of his soul. Lord Henry, I would describe as - he's older than Dorian. he is, he's lived a fuller life than him and he has experience and I think he looks at Dorian sort of as him- himself in the past and he gives Dorian advice through different things And maybe I'm describing the plot too much Sorry it-I, I think it's just interesting Dorian uh Makes a mistake and here's what I really resonated with this book He had the choice to either double down and just treat it as he did- it wasn't his fault I think as anyone can do when you make a mistake you can either own up to it Or you can confess that yeah, this is my mistake. I made a terrible mistake. Lord Henry, I would almost say is his, you know Devil on the shoulder and he tells Dorian No, you didn't make a mistake at all what you did was fine and even myself while hearing Henry's Claim, I was like yeah, actually he didn't do anything bad - Obviously he did - But it made it resonated to myself with like mistakes I made especially on YouTube where you turn it's hard to confess to the world that you made a mistake it may not seem like it and I Went through that myself in my head where I'm like well, I didn't really make a mistake It's not really my fault, and I shouldn't have to own up to this but I'm glad I did because you don't want to end up like Dorian Gray because Basically since the painting, It's a reflection of his soul, the painting becomes more tainted By this path that Dorian has been led upon, and it's a very interesting story about vanity about how one mistake can lead your whole life astray and It's extremely well-written, and I really really really enjoyed this book I thought it was fantastic and I totally understand why it's Marzia's favorite book I would rate this 4 out of 5. Next up: I wanted to read sci-fi so I read Children of Time by Adrian Tchaikovsky this has been bought by lionsgate I think the film studio, so it's probably going to be made into a film How are they going to make this into a film? I don't know! does anyone know? I think this was more what I was looking for when I in the beginning when I wanted to read sci-fi I think this is what I wanted to read, this tackles some really interesting topics like AI, time, human evolution, speciesism- How we value other species - it was very interesting. To describe the plot without any spoilers I think the best way I can say it: It's humanity's last hope is on this ship, and then there's also Humanity's old Empire as it's called sort of lingering in space, and then there's this planet where Humanity wants to go to but there's there's things on the planet so there's a power play in between the planet Humanity's last hope and the old Empire and you follow each of these perspectives more, or less and, It's just very interesting. It really made me look differently on, How we value species; I look at the humanity in the future, but overall it was just a fun space adventure. I really enjoyed it. I thought it was it was fun from the beginning to the end I didn't really like the main character, I guess. I didn't- I wasn't as gripped by it as, I think a lot of all the people probably would be, it has an incredibly unexpected Character in it without spoiling it and I don't understand how they're gonna turn that into a film Maybe I'm making it seem more interesting in that it is but if you want to go on a modern space a sci-fi space thing This is why I'll never read or- write a book This is it. This is very gre- very good, very great I almost said, um I've been talking a lot How are you still here? great because I'm trying to cut it short I don't think I'll ever read this much in a month because the last book I read which I finished last night Which is probably why I'm so tired is 12 Rules of Life: An Antidote to Chaos by Jordan B. Peterson. You may know about Jordan B. Peterson already. He's very popular on YouTube For being sort of a free thinker; he's sort of a controversial figurehead as well And I think he's gotten a lot more flak than he deserves Because of it, because he's very cut and dry with his ideas Which is why he's been so embraced by the internet and disliked by media which I can sort of relate to Have you seen that interview he did with uh channel 4? It's sort of gone viral It's became a meme almost because the lady that tries to interview Jordan Try and strawmen argue against him. she keeps going, "Oh, so you're saying this," *actual vid* "but you're just saying that's the way it is" You're saying, *unknown* women have some sort of duty, Jordan: so if you want me gone Why you should dominate, but you're saying basically it doesn't matter. if, it made, It made, her goal was to make him look bad and trash Jordans name in this interview He completely shut her down, and he made her look really vicious and really spiteful And he'd really made me want to read this book because of it cuz I was like wow that's really impressive and the Channel 4 News lady if you read the damn book you wouldn't have fallen into that trap he even discusses strawman arguing, and why that's wrong in, in the book - Ha gotcha - anyway, about the book itself. Twelve rules of life. I didn't read the title it's a self-help book I don't think I ever would have read a self-help book. It gave me a lot of new perspectives that I never thought I Would even have, it was very interesting even reading about advice that doesn't resonate with me at all But just to understand all the people. Jordan goes very deep in philosophical thinking and psychological thinking and he makes this very Simple claims, right? uh tell the truth for example rule eight or at least don't lie we know that We know not to to lie and we know the moral implications of that but he goes so in depth in a philosophical and like I said a Psychological way, and how that by telling lies it really, twists your worldview. I really resonated with it that was the only rule where I was like I don't ever want to lie this is he really makes a great point here So I thought that was really interesting . There was a lot of rules I didn't I didn't need to read at all about raising kids or like how to deal with- the cope with the failing marriage and that sort of stuff. But you can tell Jordans goal for this is to help people you can really appreciate that at least I think he Unfortunately does it in a way that he goes on a little too long sometimes. Sometimes I find it a bit, uh Beating the point to death and some of the analogies that he made seemed strange at times. They didn't really seem like they fit. He draws, uh, He draws comparisons and analogies from Disney movies to old biblical stories And there's a lot of religious analogies in this book a lot of religious analogies And I didn't realize until the very last chapter. I was like he's religious I thought he grew up in a Christian household or something like that and and the reason that he drew a lot of religious analogies was because To prove the point that we always knew about this or maybe this is something that we we've known for thousands of years Through this biblical text. Whenever I look at self-help I can't help But feel a bit critical like is it what is this some sort of cult book or something like that? and, and finding out that he was religious in the end and it sort of Changed my perspective on the book I know that's kind of stupid maybe but he even, even Jordan himself brings it up that the past can, can be changed from the future and and finding out he's religious, eh It's not that big of a deal, but I feel like it's probably unfair for me to say but anytime self-help I'm like this is just some sort of cult following bullshit It's not it's not at all, but it made me look more critically at the rules Which I think you should do any time you get advice, about how to live your life. so I think that was fine, It didn't it didn't ruin anything for me, but I Surprisingly like I said. I really enjoyed this book. It was very fun to read, I will definitely take some lessons from this book Absolutely and it also made me understand other people around me better. That was the book I read in January I want to keep reading. I hope this was fun to listen to I know I've been going on a long time 30 minutes It's probably cut down a bit. I had a lot of fun talking about these books I Had a lot of fun this month having a hobby that doesn't involve YouTube. I used to, I used to read but YouTube just took over my life, hopefully this might inspire you to read more as well And maybe you'll pick up one of these. Next month, if you want to join me ehh, Book Club! I know already which books I'm gonna read next month; not all of them But I know I want to read Beyond Good and Evil from Frederick Nietzsche. Everyone talks about Nietzsche all the time I never read anything from him and Jordan mentioned him a lot, so I I knew I wanted to read this I'm gonna read Life 3.0 By Max Tegmark which is He describes AI and how it, how it may or may not affect us in the future. He is a Swedish genius, I don't know if his genius, but he, the people compared to the Swedish Elon Musk and Elon Musk Even praises the book. My parents recommended this as well, so I started already a little bit, and it's very interesting And I want to read what you guys suggest me leave you- let me know in the comments If there's anything that you think I might be interested in. leave a like if you enjoyed, I really hope you did (Captioner: I certainly did) If anything this is just one video Compared to a lot of other where I go and act like a *Dorian* so that's it goodbye Bye now, Squad FAM Is my *Dorian* hair up like this the whole time?

I'm sad to report that he passed away today I don't know what happened. He's just he's got Slippy's gone, all right. I got him as a meme. I got Slippy as a joke. I didn't think I would actually care for the stupid toad But in the end I did I loved that toad. I was really trying to my best to look after him Despite most of the information about toads is how to kill them because they're an infestation in Australia I figured we'd end this episode in his honor [?] for Slippy I think that's what he would have wanted. Rest in peace, Slippy. Let's do a little montage of the slippy moments of this channel Slippy is either, is he there? Hey! *sad harmonica music* "why'd I think it was a good idea to get a god damn toad?" 
Baby, can't you see? I'm calling A girl like you Never warning the dangerous I'm fallin' Oh! Johnny! People ask me. "What's your favorite artists of all time?" and I always know the answer on the tip of my tongue- Johnny Legendary youtuber Johnny D his voice makes my heart melt into a million pieces and then repairs it again with his incredible aesthetic and style. Johnny D is the greatest artist on YouTube You ever watched it one of those channels that isn't really popular You kind of don't want it to be? *chuckle* it's just so interesting to watch -From a distance (ya know?) - what is happening here? What- a- what is he gonna do next? *chuckles* That's Johnny D for me legend (Johnny, sings "Firework" By Katy Perry Johnny: And let it... shine Johnny: Just holddd the light like the fourth of July Baby you're a firework  come on tell me what youre worth   Think part of my favorite thing about Johnny's channel is the community of the passionate, the dears that always leave comments supporting - "it makes me cry because I can't sing as good as you" But I think what I really truly love about Johnny D's channel is his a- his love For gangsta rap music Johnny is of course an OG himself. -somewhat slurred rapping- -rapping- -slurred singing- He's got the flow perfectly down. If anything I would say this is better than the original. Johnny D also likes to interact with the community. He-He-He-He answers comments. He says he's not too old to sing which - of course of course - Johnny D   Will never stop singing. He's been on that YouTube grind! You go to his channel instead of just Monica It's a- it's just Johnny it's just Johnny and more Johnny and more Johnny annnd more Johnny. But sometimes you get some differences Karaoke plays Johnny. What is this?         [Pewds snickering] I See you're an *ass* man as well Johnny. [CHUCKLE] He's simply just recording the music here He likes the music and he wishes that those the girls would get out of the way so he can film the TV screen so Obviously he can sample that song for his karaoke later Hey, Johnny, you god d a m  savage John is typically rocking his classic look of the sunglasses But when he has the sunglasses and the Hat, that's when you know Johnny is about to go hard. [pewds] "That's right Johnny!" [PEwds] "HELL yeah you are!" I'm wanna know everything about Johnny. Oh hell yeah there he is   Aww he's so sweet Look at 'em Johnny: shots shots everbody! shots shots shots shots shots shots shots if you have a favorite classic song you know Johnny D has covered it Could listen to this all day Screw having Christmas music this is what I'm listening to I Really like this video "Heaven must be missing angel taveras.mpg" of course Johnny D Knows what the best compressed video format is mpg all the way I render all my videos mpg! Come on. and I know what you're wondering - "How long has Johnny D. been doing this?" Those are a lot of videos. Let's have a look - Seven Years! Oh. my. god. -Pewds singing with Johnny- You know the rules and so do iiiii   -Pewds stops singing along, laughs- That's the thing with Johnny you just want to sing along finally have someone to sing along all the classics with! [Pewds reading a comment] His voice it is so majestic it has the porportions (properties pronounced wrong) To heal even the most horrid wounds in this universe. Even Hellen Keller would shed a tear by this video! Mozart, Beethoven, Bach, and many more historic music composers would bow down to this being. His voice is unrivaled to even the most popular singers. When this man passes on to the afterlife, his legacy will be forever etched into this world. Johnny of course also does live performances. Not only does he record the local bitches at his club, He also entertains them. He goes hard, even in public. I wonder who's filming this. [pewds laughing] Oh! -Johnny very slurred rapping- This one! I love this clip so much! [Chuckle] -Johnny- Ohew! You see some videos doesn't get many views it's really just disappointing and disheartening to see my man Johnny D Be on that YouTube grind literally for eight years now, and it's all Jake Paul and Lele Pons bullshit Where's Johnny D's recognition? Give this man The power he truly deserves He's becoming powerful . . . [pewds is now rapping with Johnny] I can't keep up! I can't keep up with this flow! No one can go hard as Johnny. No one. This man is a Christian by the way Just Well that was That was just me telling about my favorite channel Johnny Dee Johnny, If you're watching this I would love to suggest the "thing goes skrat" or perhaps Smash Mouth if any of those songs would be performed I think it would make me and a lot of people very happy also don't be afraid to dabble into - I know you - I know you're an OG rap fan, but Don't be afraid to dabble into the new rap scene. 21 savage, maybe Gucci Gang by Lil Pump. I would love to see these songs get covered, but that's that's all for me for now Thank you for watching this video, and thank you to Johnny D Leave a like if you enjoyed and as always squad fam out Hey, Monica Hey, Monica Hey Monica.  Hey, Monica. Hey, Monica But a Monica -Swedish singing- -more Swedish singing- -Swedish singing- -Swedish singing- and hey hey Monica a Monica

OOOOOOOOOOO *laughs* MOST FUNNY PEWDS VIDEO 
*Sexualized Moan* Hoh! Hmm!!! E-heh?! You ever see something online and you make that exact expression? Well then this video is for you. Prepare to get your best "hmm" face on cause you're-- we're about to go on a "hmm" journey where we gonna "hmm" at things. Is this joke getting old? Yes, it is already. Great. Hmmmm... Hmm That is very interesting The men are having fun in the-- in the living room while the women is doing the dishes Hmm... hmmmmmm... It's interesting how back in the days we were so wrong. Look how wrong we were. Hmm! Very interesting So dumb. Well I guess houses need electricity too Interesting. It all makes sense. That is not "hmm", that is disgusting. That's disgusting. Take it away from me, please Mmm. What? Pancake, the classic one-in-a-row game. That's not that that's a Photoshop, that's not real. I'm not gonna "hmm" at that one, that's a faker. That's not "hmm"-worthy at all Huh Uhh, that's not huh "hmm", that's "hmmmm"... "Is this real? Why does it look so weird?"
"The mirror is curved." OHHHHH Why, of course! HMMMMMMMMMMMM! Look everyone it's YouTuber high school. Look at all these normals look at their fuckin' haircuts Good one. Why? Just why? Why? Can I ask that at least? Hmm, now I see it Hmm, what is happening here? That man is invisible. But if he's invisible then why is he wearing clothing? Oh the socks, it's the socks, okay, I get it. It was the socks all along. Hilarious. Now that's... Absolute mad lad. Why would anyone do that? I wonder what a chair tastes like... hmmmmmm! Who would ever know? Have you ever tried a chair? Oh It took me so long. Cause he's a puppet, right? I didn't really watch Muppets as a kid. They scare me Now that's "hmm" Was Lincoln an alien all along maybe perhaps, I think yes, yes confirmed Mmm now that's, that's a radiator Hmm, I don't believe that is actually a functioning light I believe that's Indeed a basketball, a basketball inside the light. Very interesting. Well done, well played. That is not a laptop. That is a toast-making machine Or is it? Hmm. "We've all had this mistake at least once rushed out the door and grabbed the panini press instead of the laptop" It happens to the best of us, it truly does. But at least you get to do some delicious toast while you're at school It's a USB into a USB charger. I've infiltrated the system I wonder actually what would happen what would happen you have those self-destructing USBs, right? But where does it end? Did the pencil become a teacher or did the teacher become a pencil? There is no teacher. I need to do this next time I'm in Italy So cute :3 That's just a funny idea, I don't know. That's not-- that doesn't make me "hmm", okay? That does *not* make me "hmm" I wanna be "hmm"! Is that a Photoshop? No way. That slice of banana looks just like the dog. Is the dog the banana? Reincarnated soul? Perhaps What... am I looking at? Elmo please! Stop! This is not "hmm" this is "hmmMM" Do you ever hate when you take off your sweater and you realize your legs go all the way up into your-- your chin? Wait. I can just click there? I had no idea Seriously I didn't never knew how to use reddit before. Jesus Hummm! That man is turning to uh Wood! Oh my god, that's disgusting but also hmmm What the hell is with this picture?! Stop! This is a cursed image. This is not making me hmm. That's making me eugh! Dogs can't take selfies, everyone knows that Stop looking at me Yes, maybe he did run off to South Africa and took some age-reducing drugs and came back to the New York subway Hmmmm. It *is* possible if you think about it... not too hard. Why? I love the girl's reaction. What is that? Why? What's the point? Hmmmmm! Truly making you think here on the PewDiePie channel, truly making you elevate your mind. Do you feel like you're being exercised? Not a lot of people would understand pictures like this, but not the hmm-ers *chuckle* Hmmmm Oh my god, there's a cat inside the cat! Hmm! I'm getting really tired of hmm-ing in every single picture I mean that just make sense, I would do the same thing, but then again... why would you need the chair in the first place? HummMMMM! Oh, I've seen this one Wow, some delicious Maltesers Hmmmm. Still delicious of course. Alright here we have Ed Sheeran I thought it was leaves. I've always had my suspect-- suspicions that Ed Sheeran had an army of leaves with his own face on it, but now -- hmm -- it's confirmed That is so sweet she's finally going to get a nose Hmmm, isn't it wonderful when people --
 hmm! -- get a nose That's just a great Photoshop, I don't know what else to say about that one It's kinda cute. What am I looking at, what is this? I mean: hmmmm! Can statues actually say no to cigarettes? How interesting How did that happen? Maybe you get smarter once you get your passport. That's what it is. "Where do you work out?" "At the library." I wonder who this lady is cause the face is blurred. Hmmmm... I need to get this. I need to get this haircut, please. How can I do it, huh? Is it possible? Probably not But hmmmm Wow! That's an interesting face makeup. Okay, I think, I think that was enough hmm-ing today Let me know in the comments: what makes you "hmmmmmmm"? Or perhaps "hmmm". Or maybe you're more of a "hmmMM" Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!

The trip is not over yet I bought this Gundam. I'm so excited for it. You can't really buy like good Gundams in UK all right It's still cool as shit, but it's not a model. You just put the pieces together I was really hoping to build it. I might buy another one then because I'm an idiot He is cool but I wanted to build him god damn it. Welcome. We're in Osaka, Osaka We've been traveling all day. This room has no windows in it, so it seems like it could be any time any time I don't know what time is it. A bit different view then from what we had in Tokyo We spend the last three hours trying to track down our tickets It didn't work, but we're here at the venue. Are you guys excited? Excited we got this again all right there we go Okay, so I mean, Osaka Getting a tattoo, a slippy tattoo from really cool artists. It's not just slippy, i like the folklore of it  and then when sleepy passed away. I was like oh, yeah I definitely want to get something. (rip slippy 😭) So I'm really glad i'm finally getting a tattoo. I'm really excited There it is, he's playing The legs are done. Looks really good Look at that so cool (those tattoos oml im 😍  sorry im on my period) I'm very happy thank you very much i love it That tattoo artist didn't speak a lot of English Neither do I apparently but he told us that it's illegal to get tattoos in Japan which I didn't (Marzia) Well he didn't say it was illegal That's true. It's not illegal to get tattoos is illegal to make tattoos Unless you have a medical license. I knew it was illegal in South Korea I didn't know it was in in Japan, but it's interesting I guess that's why we were in like this outside of Tokyo not in a studio. Oh Osaka, well Okay, we're at aquarium now, it's raining like crazy. My feet are wet, life is tough Good luck seeing anything hehee Oh my god, what is he chewing on? look at that fish right there Thanks. Those otters were wack!

Hey guys, It's PewDieP.... AHH!! *rumbling intensifies as Pewds screams* What is happening? *rumbling continues* It's the internet. It's coming for you! Logan, Run! Ah, it's the internet! They're coming for you, Logan!! RUN AHH! Yesterday..uh... (Retarded) Paul uploaded a video titled, "We found a dead body in the suicide forest..." *Sarcastic Tone* With this very tasteful thumbnail. This must be a great video! *sarcasm intensifies* can't wait to click on this! *sarcastismic peak* He didn't actually, show a dead body in his video. No pfft... I know he's out for that ,"daily grind", for views But.. surely even Logan Paul, has his limits. Now, I always knew, that Logan Paul was a JACKASS. So, I really wasn't surprised, by the fact that once Logan Paul found a dead body, that he acted like a Jackass. It didn't really come as a shock to me. But for those who don't know what happened, Basically, he found a dead body. He went up to the body. Filmed.... FILMED it, literally up close, And sort, sort of, a sudden thing you see on this off-brand web site. It's.. It's not the kind of stuff you'd see on YouTube uhhh very disturbing.... uh Really.. disrespectful, zooming on the body making weird jokes around it. And people always point out that "Oh, Logan? He's like the nice one of the Paul brothers He's the, he's the more mature one." No. He's not. I'VE BEEN TELLING THIS FOR YEARS! Jake at least seems like he's somewhat self-aware But Logan, he's a straight-up sociopath You know when you're doing that, those daily vlog videos There's always "What's the next big thing?" *dangles* You know, just dangling in front of you. Like "What's gonna draw in more people to the channel?" "Me filming a dead body!!" *grabs* Not even hesitating. Logan:  I'm definitely monetizing this video for obvious reasons. I will say before you watch this is normal I think this definitely marks a moment in YouTube history 'Cause I'm pretty sure...this has never hopefully happened to anyone on YouTube, ever. They try and sorta mask the whole thing with the 'sad music'. Logan: This is funny. I like how he points out This is a mo- mark for YouTube history like everything has to be an achievement to this man Logan: cuz I'm pretty sure This has never hopefully happened to anyone on YouTube ever (yeah because people care about the world) I did something that marks the history of YouTube. I'm amazed he thought this was appropriate for Youtube. So, eh, they go to the well-known forest, "Suicide Forest", which is outside Mount Fuji, in Japan Japan has a huge problem with suicide, it's uh- but it's known that you enter the forest to commit suicide, uh, in Japan. That's why it literally has the name "Suicide Forest".... Logan: Also known as...the Anime suicide forest *loud, dramatic sound effect* You know what's gonna happen. You don't have to add that sound effect... like OOHH IT'S SPOOKY. like it's so dumb. I can't hey uh Dear anime body-pillow in this forest, please, please leave us alone *shouts* foreshadowing everybody It's almost like he knew this is gonna happen who would have thought, entering the suicide forest, going off trail, we would find Logan Paul th-b-ph-that's crazy! Who woulda thought?! Never my intention! No! Logan: umm I really love to say this. I think there's someone hanging right there so here they found the dead body and Hey, hey film me. Hey all right film me so I can have this reaction. Logan: um I really love to say this I think there's someone of hanging right there Mmm. I'm not even fucking kidding. D'you see it? This is gonna get so much ad rev. I'm not even--, this isn't a fucking joke guys. That's a fucking person. Dude I fucking told you we would make loads of money. Logan's friend: I think you're fucking right. Logan's friends: "God.",  "YES.", "Dude what the heck." Another friend: Bring the camera let's go get our money. Did he just say "Bring the camera let's go"? There's a dead body there--Let's bring, bring the camera-- Let's go everybody. Let's go have a little closer look over there. Let's not call the cops Let's just bring the camera. Make sure you bring the camera. The thing is I don't want to show the video. It's so stupid. I'll just describe it because I don't want to show it, but he basically zooms in on the corpse. He shows the hands He's right next to it. He films it, it's just... It's so distasteful. It's so disrespectful, and it's so stupid. Logan: What the fuck is going on?! Logan's friend: I don't know dude*Retarded scream* Logan: WHYYY??! ...It's sinking in bro. This wasn't supposed to happen man. Oh, my god stop fucking showing it What's wrong with you? Logan: There's no going back. I've seen things I can't unsee. Logan's friend: We found, a dead. Body. Logan: ...YUP. WHAT THE FUCK...?! *chuckles dryly* Man: You can't enter the restricted area. Logan: What? You can't enter the restricted area. You can't enter. Logan: You told us a little too late, bro. We've seen a little too much, already. Like you didn't fucking know it was restricted to go off trail, like, come on dude. Logan: There's kids running around what if, what if the fucking kids stumbled upon this guy. Oh, there's kids. Just like all the kids watching your vlogs, Logan. Which you showed anyway. What are you saying? That's your audience right there. Now the video got on trending... Uhhh, people, uh, people were very upset different celebrities...Aaron Paul tweeted. Philip Defranco pointed out that, that there was Six hundred thousand likes on the video before it was taken down. His core audience doesn't give *distorted* Unless YouTube does something, this doesn't hurt him. It's true. It's true. Yeah. I was surprised when I saw the video and Not many people seem to give a shit Not until Twitted this morning. I'm like. Oh. Yeah, people are actually pissed off about this. Good, because it's so stupid. I mean, it literally says in YouTube's policy that you can't "include disturbing or disgusting video footage." I think this classifies. I do think so, and seeing it then appear on trending, it makes you go like "W-what is happening?" What is, what is this? Can you imagine the thought process that went into this like "Oh yeah, so let me just make this face." "And then we'll add him here right well" "Make sure you can see him, properly." "and take off your stupid *Christian Channel* hat..." Here's what you do if you find a dead body... in a vlog. You either...don't...don't film the body at all or at least cut it out of the vlog because it's inappropriate and disrespectful to show, even if you blur it, OR you just cut, cut it there You can talk about it afterwards if you want to bring attention to it. That's completely fine. I think it's an important issue to talk about, and we shouldn't shy away from it, but... Just cut it. You don't have to show it. And we definitely don't need to see you zooming in and walking in on the face of the person. It's disgusting. The thing is, I sort of understand the mentality... This would make a great vlog. Logan has made 440 vlogs. He does it every single day, and there's always "What's the next big vlog? What's gonna be the next big thing that draws people in?" Of course if something like this happens. He's gonna want to capitalize on it. He's gonna want to try and draw attention to him. And he knows it's gonna get more attention if he films the body, shows it in the thumbnail, all these things that he did. Now a lot of people in his defense said, "well, he demonetized the video, he added disclaimers" Well, he even point out himself that there's no way the video is gonna get monetized anyway. Logan: I'm sorry for swearing so much I'm already getting flagged for demonetization, bro, fuck-- So it's not really a noble thing to NOT monetize the video, if you know it's not gonna monetize anyway. A lot of people were pissed off at Logan for laughing, or ridiculing the situation. I don't really have a problem with that personally I think a lot of people deal with this sort of thing in their own way. It's obviously a traumatic thing for anyone to find a dead body. For me, the problem is showing it. Uh, showing the body. Filming the body. Acting like a jackass, still, in front of it. There's no way you needed to show that. You could have reviewed it afterwards in the Edit and said "Hey, let's cut this out." Since then, Logan has issued an apology, which is the first apology I've ever seen that has an emoji sign in it. *Pewdiepie chuckles* And the hashtag! He also, uh, mentioned himself... 26 times in this apology. He points out that he didn't do it for the views because he already gets views. Yeah fucking right, dude, shut the fuck up. You might be fooling your kid audience, but you ain't fooling me, alright, You 100% did it for the views. You put a dead man in your thumbnail. Explain that? I'm surrounded by good people "Dude what the heck?" "Get your camera let's go." "There's a thing that is now in our lives" I think what this video really does is it encompasses everything wrong with YouTube, the click bait, the sensationalism, the thing that's got to keep pushing. At the end of the day, he just shines bad on everyone. Now I'm, by no means, a good example of, of talking about this, but no one is perfect. We, we all make mistakes. I-I think. Yeah, I know, but this one. *laughs akwardly* I have a few experiences with this sort of thing, but... actions speak louder than words in my opinion. Which seems to be overlooked every time. Uh, for me at least? I never did anything towards another human being. I just said things that you weren't supposed to say, and uh...to me, it's a big big difference. In my opinion, he did apologize, you know no matter how bad the apology is, he did apologize. People are outraged and they want some sort of like "Oh. His channel should be taken down" or this or that and obviously I don't believe in that, no matter what. I don't believe in that "lose your job" kind of hate mob, he should...that some bigger sort of consequence should come out of this, but he definitely deserved to be criticized, at the very least. Suicide is a serious issue, eh, and shouldn't take...be taken light and...lightly. Can't speak. I'm gonna leave some link in the description where you can look up for help. Get help if you need it. There is help for you. And that's it for me for now! Squad fam out. Yo, I'm about to burn down this house, so you fucking ready. Are you ready? I'm about to spill fucking burns like diarrhea. I'm about to nuke the whole city like North Korea. Are you ready? Dead person in the suicide forest. 
Remember when vine died and everyone was like:.. Pfff HA This doesn't affect me in any way possible. So uh... Look at all these cry- crying Viners. That's hilarious Why, why are they even crying you know?

Whatever the expression is, I don't speak English. apparently *laughs* Video: "Twitter decided to delete vine" But we didn't really think of the long-term effects you know What are the long-term effects of vine dying going to be? Well I'll tell you what... "HEY GUYS!" vine refugees they're...

Piques was an amazing Viner that refugeed in to Instagram Which if you ask me seems to be the wrong move to take I know that you can make a lot of money on Instagram Very easily, but at the same time. It's not very monetizable. I don't- I don't see a lot of hashtag ads happening here. Piques does uhh... Wha- uehu- what you do on Instagram which is uhh... yourself sitting on or in front of a cars With a funny caption like when she says sit on my face **Canned Laughter** Or. I'm blue if I was green I would die **Canned Laughter** Or when you have a nice car, but your ugly tag and ugly friend **Canned Laughter** What really shines in Piquet's content is...

*clap clap* Meme Review! (Oh god we're back here again) *clap clap* Meme Review! Meme Review, the most important show of our time, of our generation. And in the future, they will analyse these videos under a magnifying glass, and saying: "What touched these people? What touched their heart, what touched their soul? What made them think, what made them believe? And what made them not want to
(fades to gray) KILL THEMSELVES?" Well, the answer is simple - to not be part of a Logan Paul vlog. Heyyy... Now, this week's Meme Review could be the strongest one yet. Blessed be thy memes. We have some great material, and dare I even say it - the Meme Of The Month The Meme Of The Month could be in this week's episode. First off, we're gonna start off with the "SOMEBODY TOUCHA MY SPAGET!" You probably seen this meme already, if you follow this channel, which of course you have, cause you're a meme connoisseur. This video was posted by the user 'Darkcode', (on youtube) and uh, it sort of made it into my "You Laugh, You Lose", [Flashback to the recent 'You Laugh You Lose'] (snort) Goddamit. That's right everybody, I am taking 100% credit, and all the royalties for this meme, for making it skyrocket so high. "PewDiePie kills all the memes", the haters say. Excuse me, "Somebody toucha my spaget". This is important stuff. This is- this is where it's at. Now, the "SOMEBODY TOUCHA MY SPAGET" meme, of course, you get different variations of this
"Somebody touch ___" What can you add in, instead of "spaget"? [Intro of "All Star" by Smash Mouth plays]
"Some- BODY TOUCHA MY SPAGET!" I love the tracking, it's so good. We have of course, the "Thomas the Tank Train" Somebody toucha my spaget, which makes more sense the more you think about it. SOME - BODY - TOUCH - MY - SPA - GET, SOME - BODY - TOUCH, TOUCH - A - MY - SPA - GET, SPA-GE - SPA-GE -
SPA-PA-GEETTT, SPA-GE - SPA-GE -
SPA-GEETTT, (facepalm) SOME - BODY - TOUCH - A - MY - SPA - GET! Someone (toucha MY SPAGET) spend hours, making this. Thank you for your great sacrifice. We, of course, have the "Blend S" version of the "Somebody toucha my spaget" meme. Smile, Sweet, Sister, Sadistic, Surprise, Service, SOMEBODY TOUCHA MY SPAGET! We also- And of course, when you have someone yelling really loud, really angry, there's bound to be the- the version,
that really takes it to the extreme! Take it to the Moon. [Ear rape] Because of course, who WOULDN'T be infuriated, by someone touching your SPAGET.
If somebody toucha MY spaget, you know, you would get the... the backhand. (ominous waving)
Like that. Never touch another man's spaget. It's written in the Bible. First paragraph, first sentence: "Never-a touch, somebody's [Earrape ] SPAGHET!" There's the "Ting goes skrra-PAGET!" SOMEBODY TOUCHA MY SPAGET! (echoes) SPPAGETT...! Someone spent hours to create this. Blessed be the meme with you, "MineTronic". "Little piece of SPAGET" SOMEBODY TOUCHA MY SPAGET! We even have the PewDiePie version of the meme! Is it possible, that I foresaw this meme? I think yes, which is why all the royalties should go to me. But then of course, we have someone that takes it to a hundred, and then a thousand. [Family comes in] "Somebody toucha my SSSPPPPAAAAGGGGGEEEEEeeeeettttt!!" I know what you're thinking.
We've come far. We've come far as a mankind. Incredible, just incredible. How could anything top the "Somebody toucha my spaget" meme? It is the perfect meme. It is the greatest meme. I'm gonna rate this one... a seven... point seven. {Earrape} Because it's a... AAH! Spaget! I just- someone just touched my spaget. It is now a 6. It's a great meme, but we all know this meme will be gone tomorrow. This is not The Meme of The Month. It's- it was fun while it lasted, but where else could you possibly take this meme? It's a 6, no one even cares. It's a 6, I'm sorry. It was fun while it lasted, It's a 6.5, I'm gonna give it a 6.5. *clap* MEME, (clap) Can I get a MEME (clap) of (clap) THE MOOONTH (clap)?
(Somebody toucha my-) SPAGETT Ugandan Knuckles, everybody. Ugandan Knuckles - it's The Meme POTENTIAL Meme of The Month, I can't say for sure. But it's- it's painting out to become a very, very strong meme. You might have seen these, huh?
The "Stupid Knuckles" thing. "I can show you de whey".
What do they mean? Why is there Knuckles everywhere, and why does he look so damn cute? It's origin stems from this old classic Vine, where a man chases another whaman, and asking: "WhY are you running?" [some weird screams] "Why are you running? Why are you running?" *small chuckle* Combined with Knuckles, and a little sprinkle of VR chat, has created probably one of the most god-awful memes, I have ever seen in my life. It is so awful, that it doesn't get better than this. It does get better than this, but it doesn't at the same... Shh! Be quiet. Basically, this meme started with Gregzilla making an animation, Oh my God, I keep getting me- Basically, this meme started with Gregzilla animating Knuckles, just for a few seconds. Gregzilla: So, without further Echidna...
 
Ugandan Knuckles: Oh no! Gregzilla: Let's take a look at Sonic's Lost World. Did you see that? Did you see that?
Can we see it again? Ugandan Knuckles: Oh no! So, a DeviantArtist called "tidiesflyer" took this picture, and turned it into a 3D model, and put it in VR chat. Now - that embodying the Ugandan vine, "Why are you running"? and embodying the memes of the Ugandan Warriors, which comes from the streamer 'Forsen', another racist streamer- I mean another Swedish streamer, who does uh, videos, where... his chat is basically all Ugandan Warriors that try and kill him, typically playing PUBG. Action is coming! Action is coming! [Eurobeat plays in the background] And, it's sort of all these sprinkle of elements coming together, [more Eurobeat] creating this god-awful, horrible meme, Ugandan Knuckles. This meme should never exist. This meme is if you roll the dice, and you get a six. That just doesn't happen. This meme is the most unlikely meme to have ever existed, and we are blessed for this horrific thing, to exist in our lives. You have this incredible, strong army of fighters, of warriors, that are united, and they are ready to strike at any moment. But they don't have a leader, and they don't know "de whey". They need to find "de whey".
Can someone please help these poor Knuckles find their way? They are looking for their Queen, they are looking for their Commander, and if they find anyone that isn't one of those, they will proceed to make clicking noises, and spit at them. That is basically the Ugandan Knuckle meme, everybody. I've just explained it, and I realized that takes all the fun out of it. *laughs* 'One Way', 'Da Wae'. They always ask him: "do you know de way?" But they never ask "how are you today?" This emo-Ugandan Knuckles came to me and said, "There is no way". (laughs) "Lightning Mykween", everybody. "Lightning Mykween". [Reads the tweet] "Someone referred to me as a 'Queen', a bunch of effing people with Knuckle avatars came out of nowhere, and started inhaling into their mics super loud." Beautiful, incredible. So beautiful. My God... I've got tears, real tears. Now, the Ugandan Knuckle meme is in danger, it's in great danger. It's gotten media attention, with Polygon calling it "problematic". It's a problematic meme, it's a racist meme. People are saying, left and right: "This meme is racist!" These people just don't know "de whey". We have people saying: "Y'all are aware, that Knuckles VR chat video is incredibly racist, right? Like literally, jokes that a middle schooler would make?" "Ugandan Knuckles is a racist joke. Please retweet this, because this does NOT need to be a viral meme. Stop giving it attention. Come on, now." (mockingly) Just give me more attention instead,
and retweet MY message, that Ugandan Knuckles thing is pretty racist, you guys. But there are SOME, who are resisting and saying: "The Ugandan- The actual Ugandan dude, who made the movie the meme is quoting, loves the meme, and retweets it all over the place." That's right! The guy that made the original Vine, loves the meme, which gives it a
"Seal Meme of Protection™" "As an African I can actually fully tell you, Ugandan Knuckles isn't even slightly racist. Imitating accent is funny, get over yourself." Although, you know, maybe I'm not the right person to talk about this, but... seeing 14-year-old white boys, going with an Ugandan accent,
going "Do you know de whey?" It's uh... it lessens the meme a bit. I wanted to give this meme a 9 so badly, but... It's an 8. (Ugandan dude) "We must pray for this one, we must pray for this one." It's a great meme. It could have been an actual, really strong meme, a really powerful meme. But it's up to us, to see where this will go. Are we... where else can this Knuckle meme go? Only the future will tell us, but for now - this meme gets an 8. But thank you for watching anyway. Leave a like if you enjoyed, and check out more Meme Reviews, and as always, have a great time.

It's been a while hisashiburidesu (Japanese for "it's been a long time") Someone, please kill me. If anyone would like to come in and pop one in the back while I played this that would be great Hey!! I see an annoying girl running towards me from the distance Waving her arms in the air like she's totally oblivious to any attention she might draw to herself The girl is Sayori, my neighbor and good friend since we were children. You know the kind of friend You'll never see yourself making today, but it just kind of works out because you've known each other for so long We used to walk to school together on days like this, but starting around high school She would oversleep more and more frequently and I would get tired of waiting up. But if she's going to chase after me like this I almost feel better off running away". Wow what a dick move, people used to do that when I was a kid. However I just sigh and idle in front of the crosswalk and let Sayori already catch up to me Next time I'm not keeping that boy said maybe but only because I decided to stop and wait for you You're saying that like you were thinking about ignoring me That's me beauty pay Well if people stare at you for acting weird And I don't want them to think we're a couple or something you're not that hot I'm sorry Sayori But you did wait for me after all I guess you don't have it in you to be me even if you want to I Hate this character already whatever you say Sayori Hey We cross the street together and make our way to school as we draw near the street become increasingly Speckled with other student making their daily commute by the way PCP have you seen it in the clip to join it a club I told you already I'm not interested in joining any clubs I Haven't been looking either That's not true you told me you would join a club this year Did I I'm sure it's possible that I did in one of our many conversations where I? Dismissive ly go along with whatever she was going on about Say, or he likes to worry a little too much about me when I'm perfectly content Just getting by on average while spending my free time on games an enemy. What a life to live it I Was talking about how I'm worried about Worried that you won't learn how to socialize or have any skills before I call it This bitch is telling me how to socialize excuse me your happiness is really important to me Oh, she's way over heads to us damn, and I know you're happy now But I die at the thought of you becoming a need in a few years because you're not used to being one You trust me, right Don't make me keep waiting you maybe Iran/iraq I'll look at a few clubs if it makes you happy no primer system Will you please promise me you training, okay, I guess I'll try with you dad yay Why do I let myself get lectured by a carefree girl more than that I'm surprised to even let my several enter I Guess seeing her worry so much about me makes me want to ease her mind at least a little bit Even if she does excite dad you rate everything inside her head We're in school hi everybody the school day is this ordinary as ever and it's over before I know it But that's not how school works. Okay. It's never over before you know it After I pack up my things I start blankly at the wall looking for an ounce of motivation clubs Say Ari wants me to check out some clubs. I guess I have no choice, but to start with the enemy Club Sorry Sorry must have come into the classroom while I was spacing out I look around and realize that I'm the only one left in the classroom If Ana kid she came in out of the class name, but I figured you City history a through K me and if me you even waive immunity Amy breathe You don't need to wait up for me our voices sucked up Okay, it's going to make you late to your own Club. We say you may need to me keeps me in retaking game You know what weird if you can Kingdom eager you say hurry? There's no way I'm going to your club Savories vice president of the literature club that sounds really boring Not that I was ever aware that she had any interest in literature in fact I'm 99% sure she only did it because she thought it would be fun to help start a new club Since she was the first one to show interest after the one who proposed a club. She inherited the title vice president That said my interest in literature is guaranteed to be even less Yeah, I'm going to the anime club Why do you care so much anyway I Can't do it clip yesterday. I would bring a new baby And that's tsukimi cupcake is it everything well She made Yeah, you have to go now Don't make promises you can't keep I can't tell if C. Or E is really that much of an airhead or if she's so cunning I start playing all this app I Let alone say hey Bang a set by for a cupcake okay Let's go And that's today marks a day I sell my soul for a cupcake what I? DJ. Glee follow saber across the school in upstairs a section of the school I rarely visit being generally used for third year classes and activities, so I already full of energy swings open the classroom door Everyone then a member is he I told you don't call me a new member. Hey, I glanced around the room Welcome to the literary Claire - Claire Claire Claire This is why I don't do reading games Jesus Christ, it's a pleasure meeting you Sayuri so who is next says old Sailor it always says nice things about you. Oh my god. What voice? Series Seriously you brought a boy wait. I'll get it eventually way to kill the atmosphere I Pizza bear what a nice surprise Welcome to the clip All words escape me in this situation this club is full of incredibly cute girls Wow which one is your wife The younger sister the older sister or perhaps dead girl next door type leave a comment now Sorry netsuke The girl with the sour attitude whose name is apparently netsuke is One I don't recognize her small figure makes me think she's probably a first-year. She is also the one who made cupcakes according to saiary Already says that quietly into my ear then turns back towards the other girls Don't say things like that it Yuri you appears complete Compared ibly more mature and timid seems to have a hard time keeping up with people like say you're a nut Sookie oh, well, it's nice to meet both of you, and it seems like you already know money can say 3 That's right. It's great to see you again pizza pay oh Wow tits out Monica smiles, sweetly We don't know each other. Well. We rarely talk, but we were in the same class last year Monica is that really a Japanese name. I never heard it Monica was probably the most public or in class smart beautiful athletic Nice rack basically completely out of my league so having her smile at me so genuinely feels a little Get the cupcakes hey, I made them out get up Then how about I make some tea as well the girls have a few deaths arranged to form a table as Sayuri mentioned, it's been widened so that there is one space next to Monica and one space next to Sayuri Net so Ian and Yuri walk over to the corner of the room We're not see you grabs a rap tray, and you're reopens the closet still feel like awkward. I take a seat next to Sayuri Maybe this club isn't so bad after all netsuke proudly marches back to the table train hane Okay, are you ready? That's icky lift the foil of the the train to real adult dozen white Fluffy cupcakes decorated to look like little cats. Oh my god. That is so cute The whiskers are drawn with icing and little pieces of chocolate were used to make ears. Oh my god. That is so cute Sachi I had no idea you were so good at baking Natsuki. He will you know? Just hurry. Just hurry up and take what I mean. Oh fine Sayuri grabs one first then Monica I follow Sayuri walk talks with her mouth full and has already managed to get icing on her face I Turned the cupcake around in my fingers looking for the best angle to take a back Netsuke is quiet I can't help but notice her sneaking glances in my direction if she is she waiting for me to take a bite I finally buy damn The icing is sweet and full of flavor. I wondered if she made it herself This is really good Thank You netsuke Why do you think me? It's not like hey haven't I heard this somewhere before? Made them for you or anything oh hey, I Thought technically you did say or he said well, maybe But not for you you you dummy alright alright I give up on that Sookie's weird logic and dismissed the conversation URI returns to the table carrying a tea set she carefully Places a teacup in front of each of us before setting down the tea pot next to the cupcake tray Where's the literature in this club okay, so far? It's just girls and sweets You keep a whole tea set in the classroom Don't worry the teachers give us permission After all doesn't it hot cup of tea help you enjoy a good book fair enough. I guess uh, I guess what Jesus Hey, hey, hey, don't let yourself get intimidated. You're just trying to impress e And that's not it Insulted URI looks away. I mean that you know I Believe you well tea and reading might not be a past time for me, but at least But at least I enjoy tea, I'm glad you're a faintly smiles herself in relief what the hell is happening here Monica raises an eyebrow then smash at me So what made you consider literature clip? I was afraid of this question something tells me. I shouldn't tell Monica that I was practically dragged here by syuri Well I haven't joined any club's yet, and she always seemed really happy here, so That's a great reason as any oh sorry, that's okay. Don't be embarrassed We'll make sure you feel right at home, okay as president of Literature club, it's my duty to make the club fun and exciting for MPP Monica I'm surprised how come you decided to start your own Club? You could probably be a board member for any of the major clubs Where's your leader of the Bay Club last year Hey, so you know? To be honest I can't stand no the politics around the major Cape if it's like nothing, but arguing about the budget and publicity and how to prepare for events I Much rather take something I personally enjoy and make something special atomy and if it encourage others to get into literature Then I'm fulfilling that tree Really great leader Yuri nods in agreement Then I'm surprised there aren't more people in the club yet. It must be hard to start a new club You could put it you could paint it that way Not many people are very interested in putting out all the effort To start something brand new especially when it's something that doesn't grab your attention like literature You have to work hard to convince people that you're both fun and worthwhile But it makes cool events like the festival much more important. I'm confident that we can really grow this club before we graduate read every when We'll do our best Everyone Enthusiastically agrees what a great time? Such different girls all interested in the same goal My dear Monika must have worked really hard just to find these three Maybe that's why they were all so delighted by the idea of a new member joining Though I still don't really know if I can keep up with their level of enthusiasm about literature So pizza pay what kind of things do you like to read well? Considering how low I've read these past few years. I don't really have a good way of answering that manga I mutter quietly to myself half joking Netsuke ahead Matt Sookie's head suddenly except. It looked like she wants to say something, but she keeps quiet Not much of a reader egg yes Well that can change what am I saying? I? Spoke without thinking after seeing your sad smile Anyway, what about you jury Yuri? Well, let's see Yuri traces the remembers she kept with her finger My favorites are usually novice that build deep and complex fantasy worlds The level of creativity and craftsmanship behind them is amazing to me and telling a good story in such a foreign world is equally impressive Yuri goes on clearly passionate about her reading She seems so reserved and timid since the moment I walked in But it's obvious by the way her eyes lit up that she finds her comfort in the world of books not people But you know I like a lot of things stories with deep psychological m. Elements usually emerged me as well Isn't it amazing how a radicand so deliberately take advantage of your lack of imagination to completely, throw you off for a loop? Foreshadowing everybody Anyway, I've been reading a lot harder lately foreshadowing again, ah I've read a hard book once I Desperately grass something I can relate to at a minimum level at this rate. You might as well be having a conversation with the rock really I Wouldn't have expected that Yuri for someone as gentle as you I Guess you could say that But if a story makes you think or takes me to another world, then I really can't put it down So real horror is often very successful at shake changing the way you look at the world if only for a brief moment oh Why is that weird I just That's against I start over to me for a split second This is so strange. What is happening what am I doing? Never mean That's right. Usually like to create a pet usually right - right Usually like to write about cute things don't you netsuke You left a piece of scrap paper behind last Club meeting it looked like you were working on a poem called Give it back fine fine. Yeah, your kid kicks knee pains Everything you do is Justice Kennedy what? Say he or ISIL is up behind. That's again puts a hand or in the shoulder. I'm not cute that's the key you write your own poems I Guess some teams. Where do you keep I think that's impressive? Why did you share them sometime? Yeah? That's a giver to rice we did late-teen ah? Not a very confident writer yet I understand how netsuke feels sharing that level of writing Takes more than just confidence The truest form of writing is writing that one writing to oneself you Must be willing to open up to your readers exposing your vulnerabilities and showing even the deepest reaches of your heart Do you have a riding experience to Yuri maybe if you share somebody we work you can set an example and help nesic it feel more comfortable enough to share her I Guess it's the same for Yuri We all sit in silence for a moment okay, I have an idea everyone Nuts again your liquid quiz a galley ad Monica Let's all go home and write a poem of our own Then next time we meet we'll all share them with each other that way everyone is even Plus Now that we have a new member I think it will help us all get a little more comfortable with each other and strengthen the bond of the club Isn't that rad Pizza pay? Money get smiles warmly at you once again Hold on. There's still one problem. Yeah, but it's dead Now that we're back to the original topics of me joining the club I bluntly came forward with what's been on my mind the entire time I never said I would join this club Sayuri may have convinced me to stop by, but I never made any decision I still have other clubs to look at and I Lose my train of thought all four girls stare back at me with dejected eyes How can you say no to for I am a wife who's just one maybe to hell no three I rather burn in hell for you. Just can't but I'm sorry, I thought You want oh, I different, I'm defenseless again these girls how am I supposed to make it clear headed decision when it's like this That's if that is if writing poems a surprise. I need to pay in order to spend it every day with these beautiful girls Right, okay? I've decided I'll join the literature Club everybody yay One by one the girl's eyes lit up Sayuri wraps her arms around me jumping up and down oh You really did scare me for a moment If you really just came in for cupcakes I would be super pissed Then that makes it official Welcome to the literature Club yay. Ah Thanks, I guess Okay, everyone. I think with that we can officially end today's meeting on a good now Everyone remember tonight's assignment write a poem to bring the next meeting so we can all share Monica looks over at me once more Pizza pie I look forward to seeing how you express yourself Yeah Okay, can I really impress the class star Monica with my motive mediocre writing skills? I already feel anxiety welling up inside me Meanwhile the girls continue to chitchat at URI and nastika clean up their food That's right saya, and I never walk home together anymore because she always stayed after school for Cleanse sure might as well With that the two of us depart the club room and make our way home The whole way my mind wanders back and forth between the four girls Sayuri nesic Yuri and of course Monica well I really will I be will I really be happy spending every day after school in a literature Club perhaps I'll have the chance to grow closer to one of these girls all right I'll just need to make the most of my circumstances And I'll make sure a good fortune will find me and I guess that starts with writing a poem tonight Wait I actually have to write a poem what big words you think your favorite club member will like Something good might happen with whoever likes are pulling the most what? Okay, so I'm gonna go with Wait there was nuts Akita Yuri, and Yuri, I think Yuri is my Bey That but So extraordinary death Marshman so she like horrors right?

Kitty's definitely Pure fuck this is hard man anchor of course. That's her Uncanny yes frightening yes easy Reid was our nice gravy our dessert as well melancholies her Fantasies what Captive Inferno fear what Oh I don't know who we impressed here actually Hey again Pizza Bay glad to see you didn't run away from us. Hahaha I Took a quick break glad to see you didn't run away on us hey Man, don't worry This might be a little strange for me, but at least keep my word. I at least keep my word. Well, I'm Back at literature Club. I was the last to come in so everyone else is already hanging out Thanks for keeping your promise pizza pay. I hope this isn't too overwhelming of a commitment for you Making you dive headfirst into literature when you're not accustomed to it Come on, rocky deserves any slack Sigh you already told me you didn't even want to join any clips if you and last year - I Don't know if you plan to just come here and hang out or what? Hoping to get some ass boy Hell yeah, I'll join any literature club Buddy, but if you don't take us seriously, then you won't see the end of it Netsuke you You certainly have a big mouth for everyone who keeps her manga collection in the club room oh Singha but dinga That's a good find yourself stuck between saying Monica and manga We swiftly defeated Natsuki perhaps plugs back in there into her seat If you mean baby were giving me a key Make it clean. I mean how dependable? Say all right. That's because your room is so messy. It's distracting and you almost set your house on fire once You two are really good friends. Thank you. I might be a little jealous Hey, you need pizza kid became become Sayuri As usual Sayuri seems oblivious to the weird situation you just put me into oh yeah, even sympathy you know wait Sayuri me not really, Debbie, Shh It's really nothing What what is it? Yeah? Never made say? We made it sound like a big deal when it's really not What do I do II I'm sorry Yuri. I wasn't thinking I Guess that means it's up to me to rescue this situation Hey Don't worry about it first of all I wasn't expecting anything in the first place so any nice gesture from you is a pleasant surprise It'll make me happy no matter what? Is is that so? Yeah, I won't make it a big deal if you don't want it to be all right, well here Yuri reaches into her bag and pulls out a book I Didn't want you to feel left out so I picked out a book that I thought you might enjoy Oh Best girl you're a It's a short read, so it should keep your attention even if you don't usually read Oh best girl And we could you know? Read it together Discuss it if you wanted this This is how it's this girl accidentally being so cute. She even picked out a book she thinks. I like despite me Not me natural reading like you're a thank you. I'll definitely read this I enthusiastically take the book Hey Well, you can read it at your own pace. I look forward to hearing what you think? Now that everyone settled in I expect Monica to kick up some schedule activities for the club, but that doesn't seem to be the case Sayuri and Monika are heading having a cheery conversation in the corner your his face is already buried in a book I can't help but notice her intense expression like his weight when she was waiting for this chance Maybe not Sookie's rum rummaging around in the closet Man it looks like no one wants to be bothered today I Slumped down into the nearest desk how am I supposed to occupy myself with something literature related by myself like this I guess I could always read some of the book Yuri gave me obviously that's the right thing to do right now But I'm feeling a little too tired to believe I could probably fall asleep right now I close my eyes and end up listening and on your thyroids conversation with Monika Could be Julie the clip see Hmm well we can't give up the festival is our chance to show everyone what there It sure is all about the problem Is that the idea of literature Club serves to dense and intellectual to be fair you have must have extremely high IQ? But it's not like that at all You know we just need a way of showing that to everyone something that speaks to their creative minds They didn't send a bindi What do you mean? Even if we commit with the most friending ami-nee busy Willie came in first, please Lyrics Jeremy they was very important to figure it out you get people to show up in the first place no limping And after they came we can do it the thing to speak to that greeted me What is this Sierra's taking this really seriously? It's rare to hear her deliberately likely Talking deliberate hmm. That's a good point In that case do you think food will do the trick you ain't King well, I guess we could Good thinking You invited all my friends good thinking oh hi my nuts hi Monica. That's the kid would love to do that That's a comedic base camp geeks That works perfectly That wasn't why you suggested it. Haha get cake baking Cupcakes it is then Anyway we still need to work out the details of the event itself I Find myself smiling in the end Sayuri is still her usual self by therein lies the Unexpected reason I admire her no No
You don't like her unlike me was trouble finding any motivation at all Sayuri can put her mind to things and make them come to life, I suppose That's why I ended up letting her get on my case about things I can't help but wonder what it would be like to see the world through her eyes That's too close I Opened my eyes to find se or his face filling my vision. I nearly fought out of my chair Wait it's Mia material it's your foot sleeping like that That's our school really have a napping Club You sing a plea to get Nicky Never you in a collab you can have this tape for any meanie You know it needs to be don't say that so loud. I glanced over my shoulder to see if Monica overheard It's true Yeah, I know. I know you're always looking out for me so Yuri That's the problem What about you you look out for me better than you look out for yourself. You're still over sleeping every day aren't you? That's not very convincing how many days is past week have you gotten up on time I? Know it Meda pretty pretty Tootsie, I can't even do that look say you're a it's written all over you II Say a glances around herself hey You were clearly in a rush this money look your hair is sticking out all around here. I Run my fingertips down the side of sailors say you were here trying to straighten out oh, oh that's a good move That's a good move, man you really need to brush this for this my Really educate me. I won't fall for that There's more than just your hair Look your bow isn't straight either and there's two-faced stain in your collar right there? I? Try to wipe off the stick oh That's in that. That's in the Titov region Of course they would Nobody's gonna tell you about it because they don't want you to embarrass you fortunately. I don't care about that And you don't even keep your blazer button up seriously saiary why do you think you don't have a boyfriend yet? Me Sorry, but you'll thank me later I'll start to putting our blazer from the button once you see how much better looks you'll change your mind What is A miss just thinking do we really strive a friend you did see Kensie? Hey? Don't say that you'll make me feel weird and stupid about it Vicky do in hippie really please ah I guess he be careful the bread you might cut Ha Why is this one so hard of course I Struggle to fully close the paneer a chick Does this thing even fit you properly Did we make Betty Oh If you ever button it you would have noticed sooner that it doesn't fit you anymore, what are you smiling about? Don't say that out loud Anyway you look much better now so uh Why does it feel strange to see Sayuri's blazer burn up like that but it's so tough? This is really strange for me to read. I hope you'd realize that Sorry hey something I brought us our blazing ones more Syrup it's arms are out and twirls around so if I keep eating Peyton Danny won't get away from me What kind of logic is that? and why are you saying that that's like a good thing because If I hit it boyish pretty, then he wouldn't make me you deceive cookie And you take medicating me than anyone else would anyway So that's why I keep I'm keeping it unbuttoned stop saying all these impaired things things if I didn't say anything embarrassing II Jeez, well anyway just focus on trying to wake up a little earlier. Oh Only if you focus on getting to be really Fine fine, it's a deal. I guess be really are better taking care of each other. Then we are taking care of our teeth Yeah, I guess so huh, so maybe you should Come wake me up this morning You're doing it again say re Happy I was joking with you But it's impossible to tell with you sometimes okay, everyone. Thank god someone else Hey Monica. Suddenly calls out. Why don't we share our poems the pose we wrote now I can't wait to read this Yeah, the same I fail to sound enthusiastic, but serious still trots a way to retrieve her poem by the way Do you did you remember to write a poem last night? Yeah, my relaxation ends. I can't believe I agreed to do something so embarrassing I Couldn't really find much inspirations as I never really done this before Well now that everyone's ready why don't you find someone to share with? Okay, wait Say, you're a Monica enthusiatic pull out their poems I'm really curious about this poem thing say your is on wrinkle sheet of loose-leaf torn from a spiral notebook On the other hand Monica wrote her sin come in a composition notebook I can already see Monica spray pristine handwriting from where I sit. That's again You reluctantly complies while reaching into their bags. I do the same myself I kinda wants a orys poem first I'm Definitely most compared comfortable sharing it with Sayuri first. She's my good friend after all oh, it's who I share it with No I babysit to keep reading Sayuri You must be seriously overreacting I'm not a good writer at all I Honestly have no idea what I'm doing waiting. Maybe this way because I wouldn't either ha ha Geez I'm sure yours opinion has to be a little bit more constructive than this maybe even at Sookie's are You sure you don't like it. Just because I wrote it I'm sure this party. I think I understand you better than a lot of people you know So when I read you pain It's not just it's Like I can feel your spirit Sara hugs the sheet against her chest you're so weird saiary, she clearly wants to fuck Me huh you're really pretty believe me not to mention the fact that I'm standing in front of you in the clubroom Well of course. I'm not really into yet, but that doesn't mean I'll break my promise see Before it's be deep, then you see if it is you know Tran new things for other people That's everything only really good critic Thanks a hurry I'm not sure if they already sees the full picture of my motive him then again I can't deny that she's part of the reason. I joined knowing how much this means to her at all I'm gonna make sure you have necer finger, okay There would be my way of thank you all right. I'm going to hold you to do that then hey Now your emag going to me. Don't worry. I'm really beat it We'll see about that It makes me feel like you missed me Kissing my forehead to help me out of bed Making me rub. Did I sleepy from my eyes? Are you asking me to commit and play are you testing for me to wish where we are' needy? Look up at the sky blue It's a secret, but I be trusted to if it wasn't for you. I would sleep forever oh Sorry This is just a guess, but did you wait until this morning to write this? No She said it'll be You can't answer just a little bit - a yes-or-no question I'd forget to do at least me Well at least that makes me feel a little better at myself. Do you be me? I don't think it was that bad. Oh? And because she said I won't break this Icy creamy beat oh yeah, I didn't mean to say that it was a bad poem It came out nice, or how should I put it? It sounds just like you? Yeah, especially the last line Even though you were late to school, it's Babies creaky well, I guess there's no point in arguing anyway. Thanks for showing me Monica's Beep oh yeah, but next time I won't forget And I'm gonna write the big poof ever Well, I guess I'll I look forward to all right, so let's go Yuri next Hmm Yuri stares at the poem a minute pass is more than enough time for her to finish reading oh Sorry I forgot to start speaking um It's fine. Don't force yourself I'm not I just need to put my thoughts into words Hold on. Okay. This is your first time writing a poem right? Yeah Why do you ask I'm just making sure I guess that he might be after reading through it. Oh So it's that bad. Huh, No? Did I just raise my voice? Oh? I'm sorry Yuri bears her face in her hands I couldn't help but notice that it it's been several minutes, and we really haven't gotten no anyway I Might take Yuri, and oh it might take your a while to get used to new people it's fine. I didn't notice What you were saying? Right um. It's just that there are specific writing habits that are usually typical of new writers and having been through that myself I kind of learned to pick up on them. I think the most notable thing I recognize in new writers Is that they try to make their style very? Deliberate in other words they tend to pick a writing style separate from the topic matter and they form fit the two together The inner soul is that both the style and the expressiveness are weakened once you refines her train of thought It's as if her demeanor totally changes her stammering is completely gone as she sounds like an expert of course That's not something you can be blamed for there are so many different skills and techniques that go into writing even a single poet I'm not just finding them and building them But getting them to work together is probably the most challenging part it might take you some time But it all comes with practice and learning by example and trying new things I also hope that everyone else in the club makes you value make gives you valuable feedback Netsuke can be a be a little biased though. Why is how? well nevermind I Shouldn't be talking about people like that. Sorry. It's okay I'm not sure if you is apologizing to herself to me or not Sookie Do you mind if I read your poem now, please? Do I'd love to share my thought process behind it Hira smiles dreaming Lee as if that's a rare opportunity for her Which itself is kind of funny after all isn't this supposed to be a literature Club Ghost under light the tendo's of my hair Illuminates beneath the amber glow bathing it must be this one The last remaining streetlight to have withstood the test of time The last yet to be replaced by the sickening blue green hue of the future I bathe calm breathing air of the present by living in the past the light flickers I flicker back that was beautiful I'm I'm sorry. I have such terrible handwriting What I wasn't thinking that at all but it took you so long to read ah Well, I just don't read scripts very often. I actually think your handwriting is pretty Hey That's a relief Also, I like the column even though it's short. It was really didn't scripted it wasn't too short I Usually write longer puns not at all. I'm really glad you like it I'll be honest since it's our first time sharing. I wanted to write something a little more mild Something easy to judge digest I suppose Are you into ghosts Yuri? Oh? Yuri means ghost in Japanese if he Actually the story or is it you may know I don't know Now I'm confused actually the story isn't about ghosts at artbeads Bay really I Must have totally missed the point Well, I suppose you did only glanced over it after all but remember that poems often express their own thoughts feelings and experience in their work They usually do more than tell a simple story or paint a picture in this case perhaps the subject of the poem is only being symbolically compared to a ghost Lingering in her last remaining place of comfort unable to let go over the past and soon to be left with nothing That's a lot more solemn putting it that way I'd even thought of that that's impressive. It's nothing really Well, it makes me happy that you think that just remember that it won't be long before you pick up on these things, too Yeah, maybe you're right. I guess I'll have to keep trying. I'm counting on you alright. We got two more We'll end with Monica I think Oh God Well it's about what I experienced from someone like you That's a little pun when excuse me. It's not like it's like I said it was bad. I Just didn't walk in emotions So basically it's not cute enough for your taste Do you want to get smacked? I'll pass right There anyway, I need to show you mine. I like you like Eagles can fly monkeys can climb crickets can leap horses can race I'll skim seat to the skin Braund Eagles can fly people can try, but that's about it What in the world yeah, I told you you weren't gonna like it I like it what Just be honest I am wait why are you so convinced that I wouldn't like it well because Everyone high school things that running has to be all sophisticated stuff, so people don't even take my writing seriously But isn't the point of poems too for people to express himself your writing style. It wouldn't make your message any less valley yes, exactly I Like when it's easy to read, but it's it's but it hits your hair like in this piece So you never wonder right they do great things. Give me really disheartening So I decided to write a bit Yeah, I understand But the other nice thing about simple writing is that it puts more weight on the word play Like it's set up for a rhyme at the end, but then made it all flat on purpose It helps bring out the feeling in the last layer So you did I guess more went into it than I realized I liked her poem Why am I reading poems in a videogame, and I'm genuinely entertained by it That's what it means to me I'm glad you learned something I didn't expect that from you the youngest one of you Did you I guess not you didn't expect that Burnett? I? decide to humor her with the last comment I Don't really care. How old everyone is, but if netsuke is feeling proud then I won't take that away from her alright where Monica left Hype, it's Bank having a good time so far. Oh, yeah good glad to hear it by the way since you're new and everything if You ever have any suggestion for the club like new activities or things we can do better I'm always listening don't be afraid to bring things up okay alright. I'll keep that in mind of course I'll be afraid to bring things up I'm much better off. Just going with the flow and not until I'm more settled in anyway Want to share your pond with me it's kind of embarrassing, but I guess I have to Hey Don't worry pizza pan bro a little embarrassed you know But it's sort of buried that we all learn to get past soon. Yeah, that's true I had Mona get my pun hmm. I like this one It makes me think of something Sayuri would like is that so you and Cirie are really good friends, right I? Wouldn't be surprised if you had those sort of things in coming. Oh well Hey, we may be good friends, but saya and I are actually really different hmm Well that may be the case, but maybe there are also similarities that you wouldn't expect The way she talks about you. It sounds like you two are really care about each other well be Even if you show it in different ways it ends up being more similar than you think So I think that's the kind of vibe I get when reading your poem You sure you're not reading into this too much Ha ha ha it could be oh gosh I sound like Yuri, but in any case Sara's writing has a has kind of a gentle feel to it I can tell she likes exploring with emotions like happiness and sadness Who knew that someone so happy would enjoy it sad things too. I wish we had clubs in our schools It seems so great. Maybe it's just glorified for obviously well. We'll see where he goes. Yeah, that's totally unexpected Well each to our own you shouldn't be afraid to experiment a little bit either I'm sure I'll end up trying different things online It could take a while before I feel comfortable doing this that's ok. I love to see you try new things That's the best way to find the kind of style that suits you Everyone else might be a little bit biased towards their own kind of styles, but I always help you find. What suits you the most So don't force yourself to write the way everyone else wants you to write It's not like you have to worry about impressing them or anything ha ha ha ha ha Anyway, do you want to read my poem? Now? Don't worry. It's not very good You sounded pretty confident for someone who claimed to not be very good Well, that's because I have to sound confident that doesn't mean I always feel that way. You know I sink well. Let's me Hole in the wall It couldn't have been me see the direction the spackle protrudes a Noisy neighbor an angry boyfriend. I never know I wasn't home I Peer inside it for a clue no I can't see I real blind like a film left out of the Sun, but it's too late my retinas Already scorched with a permanent copy of the meaningless image. It's just a little hole. It wasn't too bright. It was too deep stretching forever into everything a hole of infinite choices I realized now that I wasn't looking in I was looking now and he on the other side was looking in I Was a glory hole I Like you, so what do you think? Hmm, it's very freedom if that's what you call. It. Sorry. I'm not really the right person to ask for feedback That's okay. Yeah, that kind of style has gotten pretty popular nowadays That is a lot of poems. I've been putting emphasis on timing between words and lines When performing out loud it can be really powerful What was the inspiration behind this one? Well I'm not sure I know how to put it I guess you could say that I had some kind of epiphany recently It's been influencing in sing my palms tipping an epiphany Yeah something like that I'm kind of nervous to talk about deep stuff like that because it's kind of coming on strongly Maybe after everyone is better friends with each other Anyway, here's Monica's writing tip of the day Some sometimes when you're writing a poem or a story your brain gets to fix it get Fixated on a specific point if he tries so hard to make it perfect then you'll never make any progress Just force yourself to get something down on the paper and tied it up later Another way to think about it is this if you keep your pen in the same spot for too long You'll get a big dark puddle of ink so just move your hand and go with the flow that's my advice for today Thanks for listening Whoo I guess that's everyone I glanced around the room that was a little more stressful than I anticipated It's as if everyone is judging me for my mediocre writing abilities. Even if they're just being nice There's no way my opponents can stand up to theirs This is a literature club after all I say hey I guess that's what I ended up getting myself Into across the room so you're in Monica are happily chatting my aunt's land on Uranus Sookie They gingerly exchange sheets of paper saying there Respective puns as they read in tandem I watched each of their expression change Matt's eglise eyebrows furrow in frustration meanwhile, Yuri smiled sadly Did you say something Because they are the complete opposites that's a good dismissal lady returns upon to the desk with one hand I guess you could say it's Fifi ah Thanks Your sis here Did you complete did he completely miss the symbolism or something it's clearly about feeling never giving up How can that be cute I? Know that I just meant the language I guess I was trying to say something nice Hey You mean you have to try to it been hard to come up with something nice to say Thanks, but that really didn't come and ate it oh um well I do have a couple of suggestions If I was looking for suggestion I would have asked someone who actually liked it Which people date by the way that you're related inputs if I dictum Sir Bateson dead. I gladly give you some detention of my own fate the boat Excuse me. I appreciate the effort, but I spent a long time in Satellite Excel, I don't expect it to change anytime soon unless of course I come across something particularly inspiring which I haven't yet and Pizza pie like my poem to you now. He even told me he was impressed by it That's a oh that's a good son disdain. Set oh I didn't realize you were so impressed invested in trying to impress and remember Yuri Hey, that's not what I uh? Yeah, you just you raise ends up as well Maybe you're just jealous that pizza pie appreciated my advice more than he appreciated yours And how do you know we didn't appreciate my advice move are you bad full of your shoe? cat buy Know if I was full of myself I would deliver to go out of my way to mix everything. I do overly cutesy oh Well you know what I wasn't the one whose boobs Magically grew a size bigger as soon as pity buy started showing up netsuke Netsuke, that's a little This doesn't involve you Make face Suddenly both girls turn towards me as if they just noticed. I was standing there Pizza pack she's just trying to make me look bad If she could get over herself and learn to proceed, but simple reading is more effective, then this wouldn't have happened in the factory What's the point of making your poem all concluded for no reason that the meaning should jump? I don't that read it not forth into a difficulty It may explain it to repeats me Wait there's a reason we have so many deep and expressive words in our language It's the only way to convey complex feeling and meaning the most effectively Avoiding them is not only unnecessary limiting yourself. It's also a waste you understand that right pizza pie ah Well How did I get dragged into this in the first place It's not like I know anything about writing, but whoever I agree with they'll probably think more highly of me That's a key, that's a googly eyes. Let me drying up any words. I had in my mouth, so instead I turn to Yuri Yuri expressions, so defenseless that I can't bring myself to say anything to her Sorry, yeah, everyone is fighting is making to say you're uncomfortable How can you two keep fighting when you know you're making your friend feel like this PGP Well, that's her. That's her problem. This isn't about her. Hey I agree It's unfair for others to interject their own feelings into our conflict Yeah, at least Yuri wants to tell Yuri. What a stuck-up jerk? She's be? Shh she would never It's Yuri maturity that made her upset in the first place excuse me are you lit? Exactly way everybody here exactly where nobody likes dead Vicky Gary I get it my friend I said you might never went to get along and be happy My friends and wonderful people Nothing because definitely it being Do you mean, but could they give them any feelings? It's okay wait? I mean it's being a beautiful beginning my hey Everybody's so damn deep do everything because well if Magic is cutie dick. Nothing ray mutated, and you in space are the same eating very sweet bacon, baby face Naomi sour saiary it stands triumphantly monica's stands behind her will denies expression What did I just say I'll make some tea you're really rush this up. That's a guess. It's down with a blank expression on her face staring at nothing So this is why I say Yura is wise president. I whisper to Monica she nods in return to be honest I might come off as a good leader, and I can organize things, but I'm not very good with people I couldn't even bring myself to interject as president. That's kind of embarrassing to me, huh? Nah, it's like I can't blame you. I wasn't able to say anything either well I guess I mean Sarah is amazing in her own ways isn't she? You could say that she might be an airhead, but sometimes. It's weirdly suspicious that she knows exactly what she's doing I See take good care of her okay? I Would hate to see her again herself hurt That makes the two of us you can count on me Monica smiles sweetly at me causing my stomach tonight She's such a gent Such a genuine person really does make a good president regardless of what she says if only I could get a chance to talk to Her a little bit more Okay, everyone. It's just about time for us to leave how did you feel about sharing phones? Well I I'd say was Bertha He was all right, but we'll mostly pizza pie how about you? Yeah? I'd say the same It was neat thing to talk about with everyone awesome in that case we'll do the same thing tomorrow, and maybe you learned something from your French team so your opponents will turn out even better I Think to myself I did learn a little bit more about the kind of poems everyone likes With any luck that means I can at least do a better job impressing those I want to I'm out to myself with new found determination really t weiqi Sure, let's go Say already beam send me it truly has been a wireless and say Orion has spent this much time together I can't really say I'm not enjoying it either Sorry about what happened earlier What do you mean?

Violates Terms of Service I'm not gonna call out YouTube for their blatant favoritism when in fact the people reuploading logan paul's video got taken down and flagged with a strike But Logan Paul's video was approved and not even age restricted. That's not favoritism. That's just uh- that- I- I'm just I'm just glad YouTube is keeping you know the same rules for everyone It makes sense it seems fair to me I'm sure Logan Paul's show "The Thinning" will be canceled just like I- my show was cancelled as soon as media attention gone into somebody toucha ma idea *laughs* I love how I've been seeing this meme just appear in a lot of different places I saw it on Twitter *all star by smash mouth intro* some- -BODY TOUCHA MA SPAGHET somebody toucha my spaget skrattar du: me förlorar du: also me *laughs* Just can't help yourself I gotta say these are pretty good memes you guys are learning you guys are improving You're like you're like an AI you can be taught well done my heart: resting exercising: When somebody toucha your spaget: Take all these horrible things that happen sexual harassment, murder But it went someone toucha your spaget, that's when you know you have to stand up and use your voice SOMEBODY TOUCHA MY SPAGET Ethan and Post did it before goddamnit.

Are you tired of hearing about Logan Paul? (yep) That's great. Me too!
(see what you did, logan? you made the man scream) But before we move on to the next drama that will inevitably happen and forget about everything that went down There is a few more things that We need to consider BUT Pewds YoU SaiD BaD WORd, so YOU aRE NOT alLOwed tO CRiTICize hIM Shit. I forgot, damn it. Damn it. God damn it- keep forgetting. I said the badword. Oh well *slight chuckle* You gotta give the Paul brothers some props, you know. They... They got a good ball game going on, you know. One person does something and all of a sudden you-you've completely forgotten what-how bad the other one was And then just back and forth. Uhhh..As you can tell Logan Paul is in deep pain after this incident. He's..- He's suffering immensely. Clearly his audience put-..uh..-put their feet down and said: "No, Logan. You..- You stepped over the line." 
A lot of people are pointing out, with the suicide forest video that "It was just a mistake, okay? Everyone makes mistake-you make mistake too, Felix." That is true. I have. I'm guilty. Ahh, but people also started watching Logan's older videos and noticed a continuous pattern. [Logan]: "So as you guys know I am a little sick, my voice is kinda gone" "but God blessed tomato!" [Sound of douche throwing tomato at a wall] [F]: Did he just throw a tomato... on a wall? That's hilarious [Logan]: "...Deliver you guys the most entertaining" "Exhilarating incredible content EVER!" [F]: Please throw another tomato on the wall, cause that was hilarious. *extreme coughing sounds* [Logan] "I think in honor of being sick, we're now gonna be selling [Logan and friend laugh] official Logan Paul masks at {website}" get your own sick mask, and prevent the Bubonic Plague from spreading in your town." [Waiter]: "This one is uh, just for display."
*pointing at centerpiece* [Logan]: "Oh so I can't eat them? Ok, that's my bad." [F]: "...god." How old is he? So while in Japan, Logan Paul clearly knew about the Japanese culture. They really value respect above anything. [Logan]: "I just got to be careful to not like disrespect their culture cause Logang, Japan is all about the respect." [Logan's Friend]: 'Actually it's true.' [Logan]: I know it's true, so... I gotta take my {chotch?} levels and bring them down" *LP screams like an idiot* [F]: "I didn't edit that, to make them look bad. HE he edited that." *laughing* I didn't even have to do anything. Oh man [Logan]: "This is where you throw coins into the well. You make a wish and they come true" [Logan's Friend]: "What are you gonna wish for?" "I wish for..... ...health...  uhh... ... happiness... and hella bitches" [F]: "You know when you're in a church, or mosque, or Buddhist temple there's generally the approach that you.. Keep it down a notch. You're a bit more quiet, like I'm not religious or anything like that, but even then I-I'd still-- You know you need to show a certain amount of respect and you're at a Buddhist temple Just throwing in money in the thing like whatever It's so dumb. [Logan]: "What'd he do?" Some of the authorities weren't happy about them acting this way and Their guide is the one that apologizes. He's the one that has to step up and be like, "I'm sorry for this person" *police and guide talk* [Logan]: "{Shusei?} saving the day with his flashlight. [Logan]: "What did you do?" [Friend]: "I was just cleaning myself with water!" and then he's like 'out, out'" [Guide]: I'm sorry. Filming's. Filming's" [Logan]: "Oh, it's the film- oh, it's the vlog" [Logan]: "Alright guys, we're gonna see you back in a--" [F]: "because you're at a Buddhist temple. It might be a tourist attraction and a lot of people there as someone who really loves Japan and loved visiting there I'm always really on guard whenever I'm there I don't want to be that person, that Logan Paul, and his friends are I don't want to be It's not attractive It's not someone you want to be [Logan, unironically]: "you know how it is in Japan there all about the respect." "So we're gonna be respectful for a little bit. I know it's new but we got to do it sometimes" [F]: "Literally the next cut *extreme coughing sounds* "He's not sick" [F]: "I get that he's sick, and then that's a problem, but then wear the fucking mask dude. In Japan, it's a big deal to be spreading germs, like, they have the masks not-not to protect themselves from other people being sick They have them if you're sick, to not admit it to other people. It's another respectful thing, that if you are sick You don't spread that disease around It's considered really rude to be sneezing and coughing out in public as well, and it's simple things that you could have looked up You've been to Japan twice you should know this and if you think I'm just nitpicking at this point. Don't worry. It gets worse. *Logan bragging about his sub count*
*lol only 15 million* [F]: "Oh my god Logan, can you be more unfunny and annoying? God damn it this is just Uhahahah UhAhAhAh Uggggghhhh [Logan]: "he has no idea. Hello. [Driver]: "Oh" Hi. How you feel?" [F]: "Logan's- slogan his whole identity with his brand is, "be a Maverick." That's his merch That's what he sells, that- that's what he acts like, but you're just being annoying- you're just being fucking annoying. This is sort of attitude that he's emitting towards his fans like, "be like me be an asshole be an idiot" This is okay. You know you've gotta be edgy. You gotta do stuff that no one else does. But it's like- I get that- I get that not everyone should be the same but goddamnit I hope no one else is like you. [Logan]: "If you want to see the fish at the fish market in Japan don't party with 'thots' the night before" "I'm also not giving up hope." "See now that's what I'm talking about!"
*logan yells at fish* [F]: "So Logan Paul goes to the fish market Which is very famous and... it's already sorta shutting down because they don't want tourists in there because they're being too... it's being too much of them... it's becoming too much of a tourist attraction. It's really just people working there. It's a fish market after all, and then you have Logan Paul of course furthering that even more by just buying fish To walk around in public with Like you have people literally scoffing at him, but can you imagine how many of those there that is edited out? And of course what a maverick What a legend I can't believe he just did that that is 'le epic' Wow. I wish I was that brave to do that cuz men that's pretty edgy [Logan]: "I just want to say one thing though Japanese people are so nice" Logan! Let me just explain this because I don't think you get it They're- they're polite, but that doesn't mean they like you okay, they may not tell you "Hey fuck off. You're an asshole" But they definitely think it And if you think I'm nitpicking, don't worry it gets worse. [Logan]: "This was my life" "the Game Boy Color" [F]: "so Logan goes to the market to buy a Game Boy *logan yells* "Why?" indeed why. why? what was the joke? [Logan]: "Excuse me Sir, "The game seems to be malfunctioning" "Mucho broken-o"
*felix repeats* 'mucho broken-o' mucho broken-o!! Can we- Neil deGrasse Tyson cringe meme? Oh God. [Logan]: "Here we go" .. "Heck yeah, bro" [F]: "Logan Paul clearly cares a lot about his fans when they ask for a signature
 as a good good old meme. He signatures as as a good old meme, he signs as "chu" [Logan]: "Don't mind me. Cause I'm American Pant's comin' down" "Toyota, I choose you!" You gotta respect the culture. You can tell how much he enjoyed this meme. Just look at his face Hilarious you got me. I am the Pikachu. That's what he's saying right there with this with this expression These are just the scoffs that we see okay Just I'm just like imagining the ones that get cuts out imagine that the ones that are like 'oh, that Maybe that was a bit far' ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh This is literally just his last three videos before what happened what happened Watching them it all kind of makes sense, why he reacted with such little empathy as he did. He doesn't really look at these people as People he's treating them like something else. I get it people are tired of Logan Paul by now I'm- I've clearly made mistakes, too. I'm not allowed to criticize it. I agree 100% with that sentiment I've always said like I've argued with friends about Logan Paul and people always bring up like "oh, no, Logan Paul He he's like that older, more mature brother. Logan Is not that bad compared to Jake" From one sociopath to another okay. I'm a youtuber. I know how they think. I don't watch Logan's videos I've seen briefly of it, and it's enough for me to know his character and who he is. He's the kind of guy that plugs his merch when his friend's dog died [Logan]: "I'm with you, the whole Logangs with you. We got your back. Yeah, it's gonna feel weird It's gonna feel weird for the next few days. Unfortunately, it is just a fact of life and another fact of life is literally right now you can get your merch on loganpaul.com/shop, link in the description" (hahahahah so funny) [F]: "he's the kind of guy that, fakes his own murder... in front of in front of little kids as le "epic meme" (and nothing of value was lost) *children screaming* [F]: "He is the kind of dude that invites his fan to be in a song with him to boost his ego and of course plug the merch He's the kind of guy that makes out with his brother's ex-girlfriend GoOd mEmE The kind of guy that tells people to meet him outside of VidCon when clearly told not to do that That's a danger for everyone someone could seriously get hurt don't do that *does it anyway* There's no joke I don't like Logan Paul. I don't like his type of person He's the kind of person where I feel like- if I even tried to have a normal conversation with it just wouldn't work. He would always just be like: *makes noises in Swedish*
"IM A MAVERICK, EHHH" It seemed like I got in a lot more shit for a lot less And like I said, I don't think he should have any sort of repercussion or whatever from YouTube But at the same time #bringbackscarePewDiePie Season 2. That's right! If nothing is gonna happen At least bring back scare PewDiePie season 2 we shot the whole damn thing, alright. It's there. It's waiting ʰᵃʰ hah HAH Remember when plugging your merch used to be something kind of frowned upon like Okay, alright, you can tell you can do it when you launch it Maybe you can tell like, but don't shove it into people's faces. Okay? I Don't know. Squad Fam out "but god blessed tomato!" HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHH 
(upbeat music) (Applause) [Amy:] "Wow..." "Thank you, thank you all so much for being here to be a part of tonight is amazing! Welcome. It's so cool to get to do a show not only with four women, but with three of my best friends. Ah. So thank you for being a part of tonight, give yourself a hand." (Applause) People always assume that I'm shallow cuz I'm really pretty. (crickets sounds as nobody laughs) (stepping sounds) "But no, I'm really not, I'm not shallow at all. like, the guy I'm seeing right now isn't even good-looking." (Applause and upbeat music starts) Amy Schumer is not funny. I f***ing hate Amy Schumer. I'm Amy Schumer, and I like dick in my ass! *fake stock luaghter* MAH? MAH? MAH? *Yelling and punching* (music stops) How's it going bros it's your boy PewDiePie I am a level 12 white knight And I'm here to defend Amy Schumer from all you alt right  hateful white male angry *gargling* gargling sounds Amy Schumer it's the greatest comedian of all time. You guys just don't understand Amy Schumer like I do. You don't understand her comedy. When Amy Schumer says my vagina When Amy Schumer says, "My Vagina."   She's not just saying my vagina. She's saying something deeper about *echoes*life (Again echoing)About life Damn it! (Amy) Vaginas (again)Vagina Vagina Vagina Vagina Vagina Vagina Vaginas Vagina Vagina Vagina Just do women's comedy stuff, you know talk about how fat you are and how you want to have sex with guys and say, "Mah Vagina," alot. vagina *wheezing laugh* When Amy Schumer is making a bunch of incoherent babbling and noises? That's the pinnacle of comedy. Don't you understand? (Amy Schumer making hoo hoo etc sounds) mmmmmmmmmm WhoooooWeeeee Ajabajajawa *grunting* If you don't like Amy Schumer, then it's because You hate women. And I'm a level six Respecting of women as everyone knows me by, so this doesn't apply to me of course (Interviewer) Particulate (Amy) uhhh (interviewer) they apologize from you know this isn't gonna be a good speech? (Amy) yeah (interviewer)I wonder what you make of that. Where did we? how did we get to that ... place? (Amy) I think because so many people hate women *Pewds spits out water* there's so much anger toward women... Um... *Pewds goes into a fit of coughing* It's big serious *Inhales* That's right. If you don't find Amy Schumer funny, It's because you hate women. Take a deep look at yourself. Take a deep look into your mind And think why? Why am I not laughing at these funny jokes? Oh, that's right... I hate women. *incoherent noises* hahaha Hilarious  *Under these glasses I'm crying So funny. Sorry, I just was busy laughing at Amy's jokes. Now I saw Amy Schumer *sounds of sunglasses being places down* Now I saw Amy Schumer. I was introduced to her maybe five years ago Before she really blew up, and she really wasn't as intolerable as she is today. What happened? Let's explore. It all started when Amy got accused for stealing jokes. Not just once but... Many times. At least a couple. (Dave)You ever blackout while you're drinking? or as I call it time travel. (audience laughing) (Dave)Yeah (Amy)Has anyone ever blacked out and been awake when they've come out of it? Thank you. Thank you sister It's kind of cool. Cuz you're it's like you're a time traveler (Amy)You're just like back in your body like 'cause balls are disgusting. Aren't they? Wow! And they stink. Yeah they do. All right, I'll speak for my balls. On my best day my balls might smell like a foot. On my best day. (Audience laughs) my pussy... smells... Like a small... Barnyard animal. Okay? hahaha You want to hear the same jokes from other comedians being told in a less funny way? Just watch Amy Schumer every- (laughs at own joke) hmmmmmm.. *5 (Laughs) The examples goes on and on there's literally dozens. I don't want to keep being ah... Repeating myself. You get the point But stealing jokes is just the worst thing you could possibly do and I can even fathom the thought process that would go through someone to sink that low to steal someone else's ideas, that they worked hard on, that they spend their soul and passion into to just get ripped off by someone else less funny How could you do that? How could anyone sink so low? Anyway, have you guys seen my latest LWIAY episode by the way check it out think you'll like it. Amy had to brush Off these allegations by saying "No I did not steal joke." Even though there's evidence of me saying I watched these comedy specials themself. Maybe she didn't do it intentional. I don't know. I don't really care (burps) But it's what started Amy's downward spiral or upward spiral of her giant massive ego. When her Netflix special came out, the funniest thing that has ever been released by the way. I literally died. And came back from watching it Or at least I wish I'd died I watched the whole thing I'm not joking I've seen some shit. But in case you haven't seen it, here it is summarized. pussy pussy pussy pussy pussy pussy pussy pussy pussy pussy pussy It was getting so many down votes that it literally had one star rating on Netflix Remember what Netflix used to had star as ratings which was a useful way to for you to find out what you could watch else based on recommendations Well they took that off because Amy Schumer's Netflix special just had such low ratings that it was just too much to bear So what did Amy have to say about why her special got such low rating well she basically blamed the alt right? That's right the reason why? My comedy special didn't do well. It's not because I'm not funny. It's because... She spin the wheel at home Ding ding ding ding ding.
It's because this very far right leaning political group Doesn't like me yes of course Amy, hello. In case you are watching, you have a massive ego problem, and it's time for you to deal with it, and I atatatata Yeah, I know that you just want to brush this off and call me alright or anything like that But I think it would really help you to just admit that there's something wrong. It would be great just just Take the first step Please because you're just going more and more down when you're faced with criticism you can either accept it disapprove of it or you can say ah no, it's because you hate women or Because you belong to this political group. This is the problem that a lot of celebrities with massive egos have when they're faced with criticism. It's always everyone else's fault. It can never be themselves and which leads them to just go batshit insane. And they rationalize this theory in their head of why... ...you're faced with criticism, and that's why they just they lose it. Amy, you've lost it. It's pretty... Come on! I think the reason why I'm so annoyed with Amy is that she's hiding behind this banner of social justice and that she's such a great person. You know but she's literally just like everyone else which is fine by the way, but she's got a person that uh if someone calls her fat, it's a huge deal, and you're body shaming. But she literally bought a shame other people for being too skinny. Recently it came out that Amy wanted to be paid just as much as her male comedians, like David Chappelle and Chris Rock. Apparently, she was only paid half for her Netflix special. Oh boohoo. I see this being done a lot in entertainment field where people compare male and female and say, "Oh, well this person made this much and this person they made this much Why aren't they making the same salary? They're both female?" Just because they're different genders. That's the reason why they're not making the same amount No, it's because people didn't like your show, Amy. People didn't like your special. Dave Chappelle's special is one of the best comedy specials of the year, unlike yours, which flopped. You have to understand that it's not about gender here. But of course, that's the reason why. Because it can never be you Amy. It's always someone else isn't it? My comprehension if, um, if Trump won. It's just it's too crazy. If it isn't Hillary in November, does your act change? Does your outlook change? My actual change because I'll need to learn to speak Spanish because I will move to Spain or somewhere. Amy, have you heard of Saudi Arabia? (editor shows Sweden flag) I think you would love it, there's no one Trump there. Please go. Sincerely, everyone. Have a great time now. (Amy's show)
So I think slowly as the show goes on, I'll begin to look more and more like a snowman. (laughs from crowd) and it feels like a lot of... (guy in background)
Show us your tits! Ok, wait. The guy who said, "Show us your tits," come up here. It's...it's too good. Come out here.
Everybody point at him, so I know which one. You f***ing rats typical Swedes Look at them. Here's the thing. If someone get heckled, you're supposed to make a fool out of them by making a joke. OK, and you are wearing a shirt that says, "I...what?" What does it say?
(pewds) ohhhhh, sh*t ...you don't speak English. You just yelled, "Show us your tits." Now, don't get shy.
What do you do for a living? (background) Sales.
(Amy repeats) Sales... How is that working out? (crowd applauds) That's not a joke. It's not a joke. (pewds laughs) She's incapable of coming up with a joke on the spot. What, did you just yell out again?
Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, now it's time. Bye. (pewds)
And he just gets kicked out! My god, f**king swedes man. Bud Light party here to discuss equal pay. Women don't get paid as much as men, and that is wrong. And we have to pay more for the same stuff. What?! Yeah, cars. What! Dry-cleaning. What? Shampoo. What? You pay more, but get paid less? That is double wrong. I'm calling everyone I know. What the f**k are you saying... That is wrong. And we have to pay more for the same stuff. What? No, you don't. You don't have to pay more. Why are you lying? Imagine trying to stand up for the women's movement by getting paid for...for promoting beer, and then just spewing a bunch of lies. Bud Light proudly supports equal pay. That's why Bud Light costs the same, no matter if you're a dude or a lady. Are you kidding me? WHAT! Oh, I never thought of that...that. Have I told you about my chair, by the way? It's 399! I know! What a great price! It costs the same if you're a boy and a girl, you might think. Excuse me. We're not so progressive liberal, Amy Schumer If you're a woman...(whamen) Get this! This chair cost 399... Dot zero. You're welcome, women across the nation. And thank brave people like Amy Schumer for making what is already possible, possible. She got paid to do this by the way, just letting you know, just letting you know. But honestly you call yourself a comedian, but you don't do it that much. Like, I go fishing a couple times a year, but I don't introduce myself on TV as a fisherman. Wow. Oof ow So that means just because I fucked the donkey once, I am not a donkey f**ker? Thank you, Amy Schumer, that means a lot. Basically what these two are talking about is when you should first have sex in a relationship, and he's he's saying you should wait a little bit more And she's saying well It doesn't matter you should just have sex right away, and she's very confident about this kind of being like well I'm older than you and you're stupid I have to say my last 3 relationships Which each lasted between two to five years we stuck with each other almost immediately and it's because I Knew that I wanted to be with them. You know Except for the five year mark What a great case for lasting relationships Man, I think my favorite Amy Schumer clip probably the funniest thing She's ever done is when she literally steals a joke from from Ellen DeGeneres and then tells it to Ellen DeGeneres, it's absolutely brilliant. Let's watch. I look like I've been feeding and I'm eating popcorn The way I think we all eat popcorn Which is you know at first time you always kind of start out kind of like lying to yourself like oh? Like one piece at a time you know and then and then like you get a little more real right And then eventually you just like you get real real, and it's just gaw! And something about the darkness we just lose all of our inhibitions in the darkness is the popcorn really that delicious We must shovel handfuls of it into our mouths Do you eat popcorn like that though? Are you a popcorn lover? When she was growing up everybody laughed when Amy Schumer said she wanted to be a comedian Nobody's laughing now That's it for me about Amy Amy if you watch I hope you enjoyed please leave a thumbs up and as always keep on My vagina (coughs) Heh brofist! bah! ehh.
(bye everyone)

I guess still still self-absorption a high Perhaps, but it's a pain What we see here is largely influenced by his actual regrets interval Try to remember that we were that what we see here has more to do with relevance than importance to him Something still feels out to me, but alright. See you on the other stand let's go Akim us everybody Someone commented that I didn't know Pierce was Japanese. Yes, it's true.

Very very deep beneath the dark Kingdom of Grounds lived a little worm who everyone would always laugh at because of his farting problem Ashamed and humiliated he lay down at his pond of tears Unaware that he would soon give birth to great miracles Poopdie was his name and what a great name it was *backwatds gibberish* 
[Sarcasm incoming] Before this video begins I have to tell you guys. Something that's kind of been going on behind the scenes for a while. I haven't really wanting to address it just hoping that it would go away. Uh, but sometimes you just gotta- It's just better to talk about it and hopefully things will just get better, but I saw- Jacksfilms tweeted: "YIAY is better than LWIAY- Don't @ me" and that was kind of like the last straw for me. I have been copying Jacksfilms and his show for literally weeks now- And I know it's usually like a joke like oh ha ha ha you copied me or whatever, but it's gone too far. I'm getting really sick of it. So I just wanted to show you guys. Because you know I'm always honest with you. What happened. So basically, Right. I made this-uh- Intro, and I made this. 
"It's time for me to review your submissions. I asked you to photoshop these pictures now I'm going to review them" like a really fun original idea. Which I'm all about. I'm all about being original, but I have like really good original ideas like a lot of times. I have really good original ideas and then just like day after, this guy- a nobody YouTuber. B grade tops-tops Youtuber. JacksFilms: "I tweeted out some pictures of me holding up a blank sheet of paper And I let you guys do whatever you wanted to them"
 and it's like fine. You know what, one time I'm not gonna comment about that. But then I did this- "What's up squad fam?" "That's right, squad fam." I started calling you guys Squad Fam. as like a fun original idea that I came up with myself. And then of course- Jack: "What's happenin' squad fam?...uh, fam squad ?" Jacksfilms: "What's up squad fam?" He just rips it off. Like it's not funny. Fine. Okay TWO times. Fine. And then I do this, right? "I asked you to make a thumbnail for this video" Of course- of course later. "Yesterday I asked you to make me a thumbnail for this video." How did you come up with that idea Jack? How did you come up with that idea?! It's really starting to itch on me for a long time, and then he tweeted this tweet. "YIAY is better than LWIAY" and I'm like dude now you've gone too far now you've stepped over line. And then he even like Has the same intro. And then he dares,  he dares to call me out on his channel. I had the integrity so far to keep this between us, and then he calls me out in a video. I'm trying to be the better man here guys I really am. Jack: "I want you to stoping copying PewDiePie and his show LWIAY By the way have you seen PewDiePie's new intro? May I show it to you?" Thank you jack for the intro Now let's begin this episode of LWIAY -  the greatest show and don't @ me I will @ you with my six thousand lawyers. I'm sending this cease-and-desist. This ends now Jack *devil voice* THIS IS WAR Last week I asked you to post on the PewDiePie subreddit some good old memes. Today we're reviewing them. That was grammar everyone "This is the gaming room in our new apartment rate my setup." This has nothing to do with me It's just a meme but can you do this? Yes, you can because it's a DS It closes, everyone. moving on "I have $399. What can I use it for? PewDiePie wants to know your location" Good...good meme everyone "my spaghetti" "Got touched recently. I was pretty bummed out about it, but I think whoever touched it was probably more happy to touch it than I am sad to have touched it.. Then I'm sad to have it touched. Total happiness in the world increase" I'm- I'm surprised. It's been uh-  it's been living longer than I thought Flying kitty made a really really good song So good, I'm glad I'm glad it's always interesting to see. I always say who knows how long the meme will live, of course old memes will die but Some rebound. Some come back. Some come crawling out of the hole it came from Oh god another one It's another music remix wow "Somebody toucha my spaghet" "In thisa house" "Somebody toucha my spaghet" "In thisa house" "Somebody touch my spa---" "Spaghet spaghet" "You break de chair" "You Goldie you touch my spaghet" That's good, that's a good song he protect. He attacked but most importantly he helping John get his YouTube channel back. Oh my god I almost forgot! Johnny Dee This is the most heartbreaking thing and most vicious and cruel I have seen in recent time- Johnny Dee Got a letter from someone saying hey I want to help you record a video and I want to help you record and Johnny Dee Was like oh, that's really cool, so basically you guys pointed out that Johnny Dee's channel got deleted No one knew really what happened, and then this new channel surfaced and everyone was like "Oh, is that really him?" and then he explained here in the video, and it's the saddest thing I'm Johnny Dee. The real Johnny Dee and uh.. everybody's been wondering if it's the real me or not.. basically Johnny Dee is like a karaoke channel on YouTube. I made a video on him because I think it's so great what he's doing and I wanted--- I wanted to give attention to it and you guys were so sweet like I saw you guys leaving really nice comments He was really enjoying it. It was like a really nice thing, but then someone stole his channel I've been sorry to tell ya I got scammed Because I didn't think anybody could be that much evil. Guys I spoke to youtube to try and help get his channel back again. I don't know why it's taking so long I don't know what they're doing to help him, but he made videos for nine years He had nine years worth of content that just got deleted, and I think that's a damn shame. But at the very least I feel a bit responsible 'cause this wouldn't have happened unless I made a video on him, so please Support Johnny Dee. He has a patron and I'm gonna leave it in the description He also has a new channel, which I'm gonna link as well. Go subscribe to it Go- uh, go help a- help a man out. So there you go. He portec, he attac, but most importantly, he helping John get his YouTube channel back. "I'm going to regret this but, do you know the Ray" These are so stale at this point aren't they "happy 60 million pewdiepie!" "You probably won't see this, but I made this a week before you hit 60 millions." That's awesome! Thank you very much. Got the new merch, got the new 60ml merch Heh? It comes with a sticker so you can update your 50 million as well. Check it out, link in description. Oh my god, great! GREAT. STOP POSTING IT you know, it- get- it--- I'm gonna rate this one a 1 out of 10 just cuz it has me in it "Skidaro skidiro, this meme has a zero" Okay, alright. You get a pass. "I really hate ads on YouTube, I get way too many of them." "I never get ads on YouTube." "What how??" "oh it's because I only watch Pewdi- GODDAMN. "You don't understand." Upvote if you want Pewds to explain and show us the pics There you go. There they are. There's Edgar naked [Laugh] Awh Yeah here it is again People get the wrong idea. They think that I stole his idea when it's the complete opposite Just check the dates on any video. I did it first It's not fair. It's really not fair. I'm trying my best to come up with original content, and when I do it gets it gets played off as unoriginal I don't understand. "you don't understand." Do you know da wei do you know le wei? Do you know  la wai? Do you know L- [Laugh] Ey that's a- That's a nice little meme there, that you had there. Good job. "PewDiePie has more subscribers than the population of Italy" HAH Pathetic Italy I spit on you bonus memes but the 10 minute mark has already passed it's almost like I don't know how long the video is actually going to end up being and I'm trying to help my editors a little bit, but they- "Oh, okay you didn't make the video long enough Felix" "So, you c- you can't afford paying $300 for a chair, and I've completely lost touch with reality that that's not" "Typically the amount that you would pay but can you do this?" "But can you do this?" Oh my god no. Hell yeah! Damn, man that's awesome!! Buy the damn chair. "Don't you think that this star war picture actually looks like old PewDiePie fighting the new Pewdiepie" God damn, my god. You're right "congrats for 60 million pewds" Thank you, but we couldn't have done it without each other. Thank you guys so much for 60 million subscribers It really means a lot. I never thought we would hit it I know that sounds like a meme, more like oh gotta try to be humble, but Honestly, I really thought 50ml was the last big milestone so I'm really- I'm really proud and I'm really happy that you guys have subscribed and You know 60 mil club 70 mil, let's get it. Thank you guys for watching and leaving a like I really appreciate it and as always squad fam Ju Jitsu [Keep in mind that captions are not for your funny, funny commentary.

*claps* You're all bad. *claps* You're all bad. *claps some more* Meme review. Welcome everybody to my brand new show called... meme review. You guessed it this is a completely original idea that no one has ever done before. And uh, therefore I am proud to copyright this idea so that no one else can do what I am doing. meme review© I will take down anyone with copyright infringements I have lawyers BEWARE! or else I will be very ANGRY! On this very first meme review its--this is a historic moment of this channel, we're going to pick a meme, somewhat recent. Maybe you've seen it a week ago, it was a webcomic and it goes like this... My bike got stolen recently. Sad face. But I think whoever stole it was probably more happy to get it than I am sad to lose it The total happiness in the world increased. So whatever. Now despite being the most retarded sense of logic I've ever heard it's an innocent little webcomic. But boi oh boi, did the internet not take this well. People immediately started to parody this way of thinking. Uh, and uh some of the responses are very funny. Sonic got killed recently. I was pretty bummed about it but I think whoever killed him was probably more happy to see him die than I am sad to lose him. The total happiness in the world is increased So whatever. As long as total happiness in the world is increased Whatever. Amirite?! We also have, My bike got stolen recently. I was pretty bummed out about it. But then I thought... *breath in* WHERE'S MY FUCKIN BIKE?!! these are pretty innocent parodies Owlturd even, uh, retweeted them himself. But then there's uh... *giggles* then there's uh...the..the more... DANK ONES?! *AIR HORNS* My wife got fucked recently I was pretty bummed about it but I think whoever fucked her was probably more happy to get it on than I am sad to get cucked. The total happiness in the world is increased. *laughs* *breathes in* Uh, after this amazing way of thinking sort of spread around the internet this comic strip got renamed to "Bike Cuck". The creator of the meme reached out and said "Please stop calling me Bike Cuck." and their response *laughs* was "I guess he just doesn't appreciate that the joy others experience in perpetuating the bike cuck meme is greater than the joy he would have experienced it not being called bike cuck." As can happen with the internet and things going viral it can be a bit overwhelming... and, uh, Shen even said that he's gonna take a break because of personal stuff and then of course people made... My favorite artist stopped-- *laughs* My, favorite artist stopped posting recently I was pretty bummed out, about it but i think whoever bullied-- *laughs* *laughs some more* uh..was... Okay Alright but I think whoever bullied him into it was probably more happy to do it than I am sad to lose him The total happiness in the world increased so whatever. Conclusion of this meme. I really enjoy Owlturd's work some of them are really really funny uhhhhhh When I was looking around he's, he's a great artist no doubt about it And he even said himself he's okay with the memes and the reason he took a break was because... Uhhhhmmm "Other personal issues" that somehow appeared at the exact same time So you know he's embracing the joke and which is always appreciated it never looks good if you don't, at least. But and even some of the responses that I saw underneath his tweet Literally if you go to the--the tweeting question the first response is "This precise bullshit is why hedonism is exactly trash. Any society based on your bullshit concept would collapse I'm not saying you should be more upset. I'm saying that the reason you aren't means that you don't understand utility or deontology. Learn." "And while I'm at it... *epic music* *laughs* It's like Jesus Christ, dude. At the end of the day it's just a webcomic "And while I'm at it... how regular, and high an income do you have to write something like this... oh my god I understand him taking a break and... At the end of the day Wh--wh--who, who am I or anyone else to tell them how to feel about something happening, you know? Although the whole letting go something I-I sort of understand that in the sense of when I donate stuff that I maybe have a personal attachment to maybe uh... some sweater that I don't really like anymore but it has some sort of sentimental value *ring* And my door is ringing goddammit *answering the door* Hello *elevator music* *door opens* *burps* But this is not the first time, web comics have been criticized there's the famous Buzzfeed, web comic Books of Adam which which uh Some would say not me of course i love, Books of Adam, it's my favorite web comic of all time some Some would say not me of course i love "Books of Adam" it's my favorite web comic of all time some would say it's a bit lazy I mean I don't see it I see attention and detail into every single strip and, uhhh, I definitely don't see Reuploading the same webcomic two years later which i have never done with my videos *laughs* *wheezes* But, my favorite webcomic meme of all time will claim Is this if--if you know, this meme you know, what this means if you don't know, what this means... it's hella confusing what about this meme does this ring a bell? this is the same meme it is this one now I had--I had seen this meme for a long time and I didn't really get it and it's a sort of meme that you need to know the backstory of to get so in case you have-don't know the backstory don't worry I'm going to spend the next ten minutes explaining it to you *laughs* because there's nothing inherently funny about this, uh, comic strip itself but at the same time it is *laughs* Now this, uh, comic strip is from "Ctrl+Alt+Del" which you, may have heard of before uh, it sort of came from, ah, the renaissance of webcomics back in 2008 the, the four-by-four kind of comic strip was popularized and it was about, uh, two guys sitting on a couch playing video games very hilarious but surprisingly "Ctrl+Alt+Del" was very popular it did really well for its time and uh, it sort of worked that Tim--Tim would add himself into the cartoon in the best way possible i would say "My name is Tim Buckley. I'm a 24 year old gamer I've played every violent game in existence and I have never killed anyone *music intensifies* There are millions of gamers just like, me and we're getting sick of people like you blaming your problem on us There are millions of gamers just like me, and we're getting sick of people like you blaming your problem on us! Ignorance causes violence not videogames man up and take responsibility not video games man up and take responsibility We outnumber you We outnumber you and the people that think like, you don't fuck with us and the people that think like you don't don't fuck with us fuck with us." *garbles* "don't fuck with us" Despite being very popular "Ctrl+Alt+Del", uh, it sort of became more and more criticized over time for lacking how to tell a joke properly which is ironic of me to talk about but Tim would often blow out the punch line Before the end of the strip and uh sort of beating the joke itself to death and it became a meme to remove the middle strip and somehow his comic strip, would be then funnier "All ready to go?" "I don't know..." You haven't told me where it is that we are going." *car accelerates* "Aaaand...Done, finally." "...When did we get a bowling ball?!" *laughs* "Ctrl+Alt+Del", was also criticized for having way too much unnecessary text now where have we heard that before a webcomic with too much text I can't possibly think of anything oh, uh, ohhhh, ohhhh Oh now the year sort of went by between uh between slightly sexist jokes and uhm slightly racist jokes again, ironic for me to talk about Out of nowhere comes this comic strip titled "Loss" and it sort of hit people uh for being so blatantly out of nowhere that it sort of became the joke itself no one was expecting this and the 4x4 panel of comics is typically used to make a setup and then the last strip being the punchline and now the last strip being the punchline of a miscarriage *breathes in* oh my god *laughs* Which, again really displays Tim's inability to properly, tell the story now don't get me wrong the miscarriage here is not the joke the joke is that The edits of this make fun of how completely misplaced it is and the way that Tim handled the subject matter *troubled, deep, and heartfelt sigh* In such a terrible, terrible way that the joke itself became an inside joke and boi, oh boi did it spawn up some of the greatest meme creations I have ever seen *laughs* ugmmmm It's just the some of the most obscure shit I've ever seen And people really appreciate The minimalism out of this meme that you can really reduce it down to just a few lines and it's equally, emotionally captivating as the original how how is this possibly-- oh I see it *laughs* even the fucking kanji can be interpreted as a lost meme is that a loss meme I think it is. Even in Dark Souls, someone made the meme inside Dark Souls someone say that the CAD meme or lost meme it's the perfect meme perhaps the greatest meme of all time it's universal, it's adaptable, and it turns the joke against its creator it's a beautiful meme and of course There is this *laughs* so now you know, about the loss meme *laughs* god dammit *wheezes* Do you get it?! *laughs* I would rate the bike cuck meme an solid 8/10 I'm not--I'm not And i'm gonna have to stick it to the lost meme for a 10 out of 10 This has been episode 1 of meme review Thank you for leaving your likes one like means the world to me *staring intensifies* Thank you guys so much for watching and as always squad fam o-out the last thing you see when you die Pewdiepie, more like Behind The Meme, jk love u 
**Very Nice Claps** Movie reviews **Very Nice Claps** I'm sorry, ok I'm not plann... I wasn't  
planning to make more.. *ALIEN VOICE* BUT HAVE YOU WATCHED THE NEW STAR WARS!? OH MY GOD! I'M THE BIGGEST STAR WARS FAN EVER!!!!! (i get it dude) *NORMAL VOICE* Im not that really big of a star wars fan Um.. * think about life choices* Seeing all the following all the following and excitement for this latest film, I was actually pretty excited about seeing it as well. But while watching the film I find myself just.. Not enjoying it. (YEA IT TERRIBLE) I thought it was... Really bad *light chuckle* (Yep) But then.. I go *GETS A SEIZURE* ...... FELIX! This is Star Wars! Everyone loves star wars! (with emphasis.) Stop being such a cynic and enjoy the film! * pewdipie inside feud* So... I keep watching.. but then, out of nowhere, comes a joke so bad that it makes your whole face just.. *ALIEN FACE* turn inside out *GETS A SEIZURE AGAIN NO FELIX! This is Star Wars! It's got... 94% on Rotten Tomatoes! ( I read that someone hacked and changed the tomatometer) If you don't like this movie.. then yo- there's something wrong with you! * super serious Pewdipie* Okay?! *jumble of words at the beginning*  There's clearly something wrong- You don't know how to criticize a movie. Felix. That's why you don't **BRP** *imitating haters*Stick to your meme reviews, Felix You don't like Star Wars So I keep watching, okay, maybe *sad pewds* !? It was one bad joke.. *PewDiePie noises* It doesn't matter! *pained chuckle* I love Star Wars! Then, another joke hits you. *ANOTHER SEIZURE* *noises* Oh god, what was that? Was that even a joke? What the he- *SEIZURE* Ah! Another joke! Ah, God damn it. *laughter* You know- a movie has bad humor if I'm the one criticizing it. For bad humor. movie review It felt like the Lele Pons of comedy. Just uh, people getting hurt and you're expected to go Hah! That's funny! *1 LIKE = 1 PRAYER* PLEASE DONATE He got hurt. He fell! (i hope he died) That's hilarious! (exaggerated laugh.) I see so many people defending this movie online des- despite the 94%... critic review How how HOW does this movie have 94% how? dont get me wrong, it wasn't bad.. but 94%? Jesus christ So many people wanna like this film so badly and seeing people's reaction to- eh to it, an-and defending it is-is hilarious to me. I found this tweet, uhh and I seen a lot of people say the same thing Man, a second viewing of the LAST JEDI really did the trick. Turned me from a like to a lover. Pewds: I love the movie now! But really, once you've seen the movie 6 time, that's- that's when it starts to get good. ok? *GIGGLES* I've seen reviewers not wanting to.. give the movie a rating right away because, they want to like it so badly. They want to make sure.. that they like it *pops collar* what movie will you eugh- give that sort of criticism to? What mo- H-how do you not show incredible bias, by-by admitting to that? Like *ZOOMS IN* how- how are you a reviewer if- if you need to watch it twice to give it a review. *ZOOMS OUT* I've seen some people deflecting saying Dumb person: "Okay, well if you didn't like Star Wars (the last jedi) that means you hate Social Justice" And I, yes.. tha- that's true I do. But I didn't mind it in thi- in this film, I thought it was alright I d- It- it didn't take away from anything I didn't care It was nice to see a strong female lead It was nice to see a mo- more diverse cast, even though i hate forced diverse casting I thought it was alright! I see so many people doing what I like to call "Twitter Rick &amp; Morty Deflecting" Where someone or something is facing criticism And it's all just thrown away by nitpicking one of the Many valid criticisms it's getting and just reducing that down to some sort of lower IQ Its as the cast said: Rian treats the audience as if hey are intelligent and can work things out for themselves;... ...Some need to realise that the film cannot do everything for you. *Intelligent Pewds* To be fair you need extremely high level of IQ *breathes in* to understand Star Wars (the last jedi) When the Porgs hits the windshield of the Millennium Falcon That is saying something deeper about life *has an existential crisis* If you didn't like Star Wars (the last jedi) that's because you- you don't like Social Justice If you don't like Star Wars (the last jedi) that's cause you- you're a fanboy *ZOOMS* It's like, *ZOOMS IN MORE* no. None of these things applied I just thought it wasn't *Felix's mating call* to put it simple, I didn't like the film because the characters felt holo The movie completely ignored common sense to further the plot in a way I think ehd The most forgiving fan would still cringe enternally in disbelief The comedy was so out of place it felt like I was watching Avengers And I think switching directors mid-through in a trilogy had the effect of all the setup from the previous film Being completely thrown out the window Now I didn't dislike everything about the film I thought the CGI was really cool there was some scenes that were just mindblowingly Amazing to look at I was like "Wow, hey Marzia, that's pretty cool isn't it?" I really like Kylo Ren and Ray's character And I think the movie would've been a lot better if they just focused on them *laughs* But let's get into all the bad stuff. First of all, the comedy. My god, *not just yours* **pewds laughs at my supreme joke** The movie started with General Hux which, in the first film was a very serious character he was he was almost like the reincarnation of Hitler All of a sudden being in this movie (the last jedi) in the very first scene Comic Relief It didn't make any sense at all and as a viewer you were completely taken out of the film There was this weird prank call with a pilot trying to- trying to distract him It felt like I was watching Austin Powers Or some- some Saturday Night Live skit Of a parody of Star Wars Fine, you know what if you wanna make that joke, fine. But *Pewds weighing an apple* Changing a character's personality completely for the same of a joke Why- Why? Why? *sad pewds* Uhh.. Then there's the Porgs, those cute little penguin things I like them! I thought they were alright. I- I knew people were gonna hate them but- *shrugs a tiny* They were funny They were cute, and I like 'em And I will buy FIVE of their *thinks* *changes mind* Six of them All of them! I will buy all of them *in the world??* There was one bit with the Porgs where Chewbacca is in the Millennium Falcon And the Porgs are in his-- Cock Pit And one of them is wearing this, like, headset thing It looks like he's wearing a VR headset And, It was very cute, him doing that, and it was very funny him doing that. But. It didn't make any sense, him doing that. "Awkward silence" "Awkward silence [Intensifes]"

Hi, I'm Brooke Baldwin and you're watching Pew News. *Cheesey news station music* *Pewds sounds congested in this video* We have so many news! *pew pew sounds* Pew news this week because I've been away and there's been a lot of stuff ... I wanna talk about So let just jump... into.... *very faintly*   ..it Our first story comes live from a cave in Zimbabwe from YouTuber, Casey Neistat Casey Neistat sat down with Youtube CBO Which is short for... Chief Bro.... O... Robert Kyncl. This is the first time this has ever happened, guys. This is a big deal YouTube is finally talking to its community :3 [...] It was very informative Robert:  By the way, the one category I didn't mention is..ah ...and we would like more and more female creators on the platform. Right? Casey: You hear that? Big opportunities on the platform. But not for me. What are you... ? *chuckles* Casey: This is a big question I have--I've always had, which is that in all my years in television, I never met a TV studio head... ...who wasn't at one time a TV producer and in cinema I've never met a movie studio head that who didn't produce movies. But no one on the YouTube sort of senior executive leadership side has ever made a living as a creator. *offended* A tut tuput Excuse me, Casey? EXCUSE ME, Casey. This is why you need to listen to Pew News because we get the facts right 100% of the time. We have a hundred percent track record of authenticity and... Handsomeness Did you forget about Susan? Come on! I guess this is kind of why I think the question was a bit redundant, 'cuz... Let's say you're... you're the head of a book publishing company, doesn't mean you necessarily want to be a writer. Just to do that. It doesn't really... you don't have to be a YouTuber or YouTube producer Who the h*ll produces YouTube videos? That doesn't make any sense and then Susan did make a channel? And she never upload anything because why should she?! Like... She's not a creator. It doesn't make any sense. She probably doesn't want to. She's probably busy doing other things It doesn't make ANY sense. She did do an update that we talked about last Pew news Which I thought was great. YouTube needs to do more or Susan and other big heads.. big heads? Needs to do at least... Quarterly updates with its community because we've been left in the dark for too long, man And I thought that was a good first step, but I'm not sure about this YouTube channel I'd be so happy if she just becomes like a shit post [laughs] show or something. So, Casey basically asked the question "Why does it cost me money that your system doesn't work with the demonetization?" What it... what if you view it as a way of saying "we think this might not be advertiser friendly?" So we're gonna cut your revenue on it, but we're still playing it So it's costing you the... It's costing you, the Creator money while we figure this out. And I think that I know I as a creator found that very insulting. I've known that very upsetting. Why do I have to take your algorithms mistakes? Why does it have to cost me money? How does YouTube address something like that at the kind of scale that...? I remember you uh... calling on this issue. Maybe you as an audience, don't really care, but just picture that just one day you ... you do a full-time job in just one day for no reason whatsoever you're not getting paid that day I think it's extremely frustrating when you're trying to run a business. That's what I'm doing, essentially, even me. I have employees, technically. *guilty* Eeeee.... and For some reason to not get paid because their system sucks It's very frustrating and to be honest there's such a divide between YouTube and youtubers that I don't think they understand what that feels like I would love for a Figurehead of YouTube to say you know what until we fix this problem I am going to cut some of my revenue as well. I don't necessarily... I'm not calling anyone out or anything, but that would make me at least feel like okay now they're on it now. They care now they want to fix this I know I know that YouTube suffer if the video isn't monetize as well, but as an individual creator It's extremely frustrating, and I'm sure you can understand as well a lot of a lot of CEOs do this when a company is in crisis,  they'll...they'll cut their earnings short, so it's not like that crazy a thing. [Casey:] So, I invite you to now just kind of use this platform as a way to tell all of us creators in the community what matters to you. What do you stand for and what is next for YouTube as a platform? *clank of dropped clipboard* [Robert:] Sure. So So what we stand for is... uh Is really for freedoms? Freedom of opportunity. Anybody to make a living on YouTube, you know bring revenue from the entire world and there are many wonderful examples. Freedom of speech; as important as ever. Freedom of information; accessing it I grew up in a communist country in Czechoslovakia behind the Iron Curtain It's really important You know the openness and freedom of speech and freedom of information is really important to me and that that is why I... I love what I do and then the fourth one is is freedom to belong. I was really glad to hear this. I think YouTube, whether you like it or not has become such a Important piece of culture that it needs to maintain freedom of speech at all cost and I think within the current political landscape it seems that The line between freedom of speech is just getting twisted all the time, so to have someone like Robert Say that I think was a very reassuring, and I hope They keep that mentality through the end *Eerie ethereal sounds* *PEW, pew, PEW!!* *pew, pew, PEW!!* *Pew, PEW, PEPPEPEPEPEPE* *PEWPEPEPEPEPEPE* [Emergency alerts sounding in background]
It would seem that YouTube just made a tweet... talking about finally addressing to the monetization issue: Roses are red 
Violets are blue... subscribe to black creators (Silent laughter) What? I mean like, I support black people and their rights as a human *laughs* I don't know why I laughed. It just sounds so weird. I don't mean for my statement to be racist but like isn't this a bit much?? YouTube: No. You know subscribing to black creators is great and all, but what I truly think is that you should subscribe to all creators because ALL lives matter... Your... your move, libtaaards *Imitates Edgar's gruff growl* *laughs at self* Skye Williams tweeted we black craters are fffk-ing fantastis... fantastic with or without you and your soapbox Don't tell people to sub to me, because I'm black. I want people to sub to me, because I'm an excellent content creater I find it really.... This statement from YouTube to be extremely.... Harmless. I mean, they're really just saying hey Support minorities, but at the same time... At the same time. It's saying so much more as well! Which I don't even want to get into, but it's a really strange thing for them to come out of... out of nowhere, but Hey, man, you got to do what you got to do. You guys, this is uh... Don't ban me. If you want to subscribe to some black creators subscribe to Sives Brad Woto Flight Reacts and videogamedunkey Our next news *Emergency alert sounding in background* The piano sound alarm is going off again. Wow! It would seem that Black Panther scored 98 percent on Rotten Tomatoes *Alarm sounds once more* We got another pew news sound alarm it would seem that Kim Jong-un just scored another... Hole-in-one. Wow! How amazing! What a believable trustworthy world we live in how about having, that's great. The last news is probably the most important one! Fiverr Guys got banned from Fiverr without any form of notice. They made a video saying again They got banned these were the guys that got banned through the controversy with fiverr and and me with The Wall Street, Journal thing that happened last year... I spoke to fiverr It's a big company the people I talked to we're really trying to get them unbanned and then they finally did it And now something has happened again, and they've been on this site for four years And now I don't know where they made a video explaining that fiverr Just banned them with no reason or explanation why fiverr is consistently updating and evolving its marketplace to better suit our community and the needs of skilled freelancers and entrepreneurs across the globe Therefore this kind of services are unfortunately not in our editorial focus anymore and were sidelined from our marketplace Sidelined you kick them out you banned them. This is the problem that constantly happens with big websites. We don't really have any Union. There's no Union for internet creators There's no fight back if stuff like this happens. You just left stranded and Only thing we can really do is speak up about it, so I really urge you to write to fiverr Talk to them explain. Why this is wrong and don't spam a bunch of hate just Be considerate and be smart, companies Don't give a sh About anything but their own image. funny, fiverr guys did nothing wrong unbanned them Please fiverr if you have if your fiverr if you're listening I know we had we had our bumps in the past But I really truly feel like these guys don't have anything to do with this. They haven't done anything bad! Why not keep them on their site and let them earn their profits like they're doing That's it for Pew News.

**Pewds Jams out peacefully** DOKI DOKI  hello everyone and welcome to another month of. Pewdiepie's literature club THAT's RIGHT 2018 is just full of surprises I've been loving reading all your comments about suggestion and what you thought about my Suggestions and ideas and it's been a great time. I had a lot of fun reading this month as well We got a lot of stuff to go through Did you do your homework? PAHA we're gonna discuss the books that I said I was gonna read I Think I got all of them. Why don't we just jump into it? I really got to say though It's been so much fun and for me to discover How much joy you can get out of reading, I know it sounds really uhm Maybe obvious, but you always hear people say oh, it's so important that we read and it's so I wish more people would just read but people never say how fun it is to read it's like its completely forgotten I wanted to start off with recommending this book called 'I am a Legend ' I think this is a great book if you haven't read anything in a while and don't really know what to get into It's very light, and it's very gripping from the beginning to the end. It's a story about Robert Neville who is The last living man, and he's bunkered up in his home because at night Vampires come out and they want to- they want his blood. They want to kill him they sort of tease him and taunt him To get him out of his house because he's bunkered himself up in a way that they can't reach him protecting himself with garlic and just following Neville in this horrible horrible scenario that the vampires want to kill him and He can only go out during the day if it's sunny outside Immersing myself into that horrible scenario was so wonderful in a way I don't know how to describe it otherwise. Neville is a scientist so he's sort of try and make sense out of the situation and make sense out of the supernatural in a way thinking. Why are they afraid of garlic? Why? Do they only die if I poke him with a with a wooden pole? It was just really interesting to follow and apparently this is the book that popularized, popuralized? popularized...anyway that made ad-pocalypse scenarios popular like the zombie fad or whatever. Which for someone that's so sick of that idea, this was Ironically so refreshing. You may be familiar with I am Legend because of the film with Will Smith and he does follow it pretty similarly Similarly?I CANT SPEAK but in the film They're zombies there were these weird zombie thing, but it's But it's like thEY'RE VAMPIRES. That's the point of the book. You can't just change that Completely miss the whole whole idea and the ending of of this book, which I won't spoil of course But I will tell you it was one of the it gave me chills it really hit me hard. It's a very clever and interesting ending that really stuck with me and I Loved it for it I thought it was entertaining from the beginning to the end and that's why if you haven't read anything in a while You can definitely get into this if you don't mind reading a horror, and I'm giving this 5 out of 5 stars hooray Next up we have Dune which oh boy I said I wanted to read more sci-fi so ton of you suggested that I would read Dune. This is apparently What people say even here at the back? It says the greatest science fiction novel ever written It's about this desert planet called Arrakis That contains the most valuable element in the universe which is the spice melange which is this Spice that can be used for many different things But it gives you the ability to increase your lifespan It allows for interstellar travel to be possible, but to harvest despise You do put yourself at risk from these giant earth worms so And it's an extremely tough landscape, water is a currency in itself almost so it follows the story of Duke Leto Atreides, his wife lady Jessica and Paul who gets caught up in the conflict between the houses That are trying to fight over control over the planet because whoever controls the planet controls the universe because you control the spice They get caught up in the conflict and that Sort of where the story takes speed in my opinion. It's weird because they really spoil a lot at the back of the book I Definitely don't recommend reading in the back of the book, but I was literally 200 pages in and I thought to myself This hasn't happened yet We haven't gotten even here yet, so the book takes a long time a long time to really take speed in my opinion But what it does is an amazing journey that I love taking part of Unfortunately there are so many names and so many Concepts and so many characters that I got really lost the first few hundred pages I think that's why people love this book so much because it's so incredibly rich But since I didn't pay I think as close attention as I could have done I would have enjoyed the the last What is it, 300 pages a lot more if I had paid more attention. Because I constantly had to remind myself 'oh okay, what was that again? Oh okay..What was... what was that?' I kept forgetting and it was hard to -honestly, It was hard to keep track on it nevertheless. I loved it I loved following the journey it was badass to say the least it's interesting How Dune is such a popular and well-loved sci-fi? But it does have a film made out of it, it even has a game I think. Maybe I'm wrong, but it never got really as popular as a lot of what it inspired It clearly inspired to Star Wars. I can see a lot of resemblance. I think Game of Thrones even The creator of that even said himself that he was inspired by Dune. This clearly inspired so much of our entertainment, but it hasn't really reached that mass appeal. It's it's not nearly the biggest Star Wars I think someone said the reason why is because it doesn't really have What made sci-fi popular back at when it was written. It doesn't really have robots It doesn't really have computers and these were the things that people wanted out of sci-fi back in back iN THE DAY so it'd be interesting if Dune somehow makes a rebound and gets remade into another film and if that becomes popular or not that would be really interesting because or maybe a TV show or something like that since there's so many Arabic names you can have a diverse cast in there and Studios can pat themselves on the back and be like wow we did such a great job. It takes place in the desert. It's about harvesting the most important element in the universe controlled by the rich. It has a bunch of Arabic references. Are you talking about oil perhaps Frankie, Frankie Herbie? I think this book can definitely be interpreted in different ways even though. It's really just a badass space adventure Given it four out of five stars Dune was the book I said, I was gonna read. Did you read it as well. Did you share my opinion about it? I'm not by any means saying what I think is right or wrong But it'd be interesting to know a lot of talking. I hope this is all right. I don't feel Feel very self-centered for me to do all the talking, but please do share your ideas as well I do wanna, I do want to hear it. Now moving on I wanted to read Murakami, Kafka På Stranden, Kafka on the shore. I read this in Swedish because I wanted to brush up my Swedish skills, which didn't really help. Kafka on the shore is the story about self-fulfilling Prophecy it's a story about a young boy that runs away from home, and you follow him in one chapter And then he alternates to another character which is an old man Who's not very bright but he can talk to cats and he's looking for some things you have a character running away And then you have a character looking for something in it and one at the beginning of his life And one at the end of his life you sort of see their stories come together But the old man can talk to cats somehow, and it's a very very uh surreal story it almost feels like a dream at times when you follow it it is very honest and open about the fact that it's the story   retold in a way almost the story of the ancient greek mythology of Oedipus* I think it's called odaepuss (oedipus*)? Which if you're not familiar is it's the story about a king that was told to him a prophecy that his son would kill him and Take over his wife *light inhale* (ahEH) and So he banishes his son to try and stop this prophecy, but the prophecy still gets eaeh fulfilled anyway he ends up- the son ends up killing his dad, and he ends up with his wife it's a very twisted sort of tale and So is this book. uhm definitely. It's filled with the metaphors and It's categorized into surrealism which I can definitely agree with Because of that I don't think this book is necessarily for everyone. I think with Murakami's storytelling it seems that the feeling is more important than the story the the mood and he spends a lot of time explaining and describing things that might seem trivial and That might be a bit tedious if you're not really on board But it's funny cause Murakami even admits this himself in the book. He sort of leaves you hints on how he thinks you should interpret Reading which I thought was pretty funny Murakami's presence is very clear in this book Which I actually really really like I feel like I'm learning who he is by reading his work. Which is really interesting Even if you don't understand everything in the book and what it means, it you can still draw your own conclusion And if you're completely wrong that's okay, that's be- That's besides the point at least that's a hint I picked up on, another hint was how he really does love describing things that might seem trivial like I mentioned And he even mentions Dickens himself that he would spend I don't know 20 pages just describing how a cabin looks like and You do get a lot of that in this book as well. I feel like I have to mention since it is the story of self-fulfilling prophecy about Ending up with the wife- his mom, it does contain incest which genuinely Disgusted me. Now I, I know Murikami he's a pervert and so am I but I did not appreciate those chapters I can't even pretend that I enjoyed it. It was just disgusting and Because of that I don't know if I should be recommending this book to everyone. I will rate this book still, four out of five. I still really loved it, and I I really look forward to reading more Murakami. I love his work. *clap* Are you still *clap* with me everybody? yEaaAh. Now after reading Dune and Murakami which are pretty hefty novels I wanted to read something more simple something lighter. I know I made other promises of books I was gonna read But I I just I I thought I need to break with something so I decided to read American Psycho Which is a very dark satire comedy and It's about Patrick Bateman, which is this Wall Street Worker, who is rich. He is handsome. He's charming. He's successful He's great in every single way, but he's a psychopathic killer (yay) So you basically get to follow the life of? Patrick Bateman his internal monologues what he goes through every single day and the interactions he has with other people and just Following that was so funny. I think there's like a whole chapter Just describing the brands of of the things in his apartment which might sound really boring, but it was hilarious I found myself laughing out loud so often while reading this which was Honestly great, what's really scary about this book, is that how much I don't think it's just me, I could really relate to Patrick Bateman. Maybe it's the YouTuber ego I really thought about that a lot How I think we've all been in the situation where *has a moment* how do I describe this so I don't seem like a psychopath If you're in a line, and you're in a hurry you immediately start thinking of everyone else as a nuisance. They're in the way they're in your way to reach your goal since Patrick sees himself as such a perfect person as such a Elitist being he really sees everyone else as and as a shallow person they can't even be compared to him, and I think that's what becomes his demon because Because he puts himself in such high regard everyone else becomes completely insignificant And he -that becomes his pain He wants other people to feel that pain, and it goes extremely dark and extremely graphic with its Violence and gore. To me, I can understand if that would turn some people off, and I don't think I'm like 'Oh I'm so edgy, I don't care', but it wasn't really that Bad I guess I don't know it doesn't go on overboard at least It's very interesting to me how even though he's a psychopathic killer You still really like him. and I thought a lot about Why that is, why do you like this horrible person. Is it because we do care so much about these? positive traits that he does have like he's handsome and Sophisticated and rich, or is it because you sort of just get attached because you follow along I don't know, but it's an interesting question number tha less and it's a great piece of satire And I really loved it four out of five. I recommend if you want to read a comedy neXT BOOK. This is a book that I said I was gonna read, and I think a lot of you Hopefully picked up as well because I would love to discuss this with someone, that has read it It's live 3.0 from Max Tegmark Which is a Swedish professor at MIT in Boston I think (it's actually in Cambridge, MA but shhhhh) He does a lot of AI research. I wanted to read this book to learn more about AI and Max really describes The problem that media has really twisted the idea what we think AI is with movies and such and anytime AI is being spoken up you have the the Terminator robots with the red eyes And I think I think even in my AI video that I made I put that as the thumbnail Which is very cringe-worthy now after reading this book? but nevertheless He's explaining that that's not how a AI is going to be at all and he goes through every Single aspect of how if we invent AI that is smarter than a human What sort of consequence that is going to be. AI can obviously bring us a lot of positive and good things? But there's a lot of unanswered questions that we haven't dealt with yet, then and some questions that are very tough But just because they're tough doesn't mean we shouldn't think about them Professors and researchers in AI are all kind of torn on the issue some people say oh We will invent AI smarter than human beings in a 100 years and some people are saying no it won't happen until maybe a thousand years and some people saying no we will never Be able to do that. Theoretically it's possible it's not an impossible thing and if we do invent AI that is smarter than human beings that is going to have a massive impact on humanity people are saying it's gonna be the last invention that mankind will need to make and It's going to not just shape. Humanity, but also the entire universe and. Following all these steps in the book was so... interesting and so Immersive it felt almost like reading a sci-fi Because some of the things discuss are just so Unbelievable the reason why it's important that we discuss these ideas about AI now, is that Sure, we invented the fire, and then we invented the fire extinguisher afterwards, but in the case of AI the damage of not being prepared could lead to Consequences that are way beyond us so we need to start discussing these ideas now the sooner the better basically and It's interesting cuz apparently this sort of issue with AI has been a very niche idea for a long time And it's not until recently and with the outcoming of this book as well that it's it's again, Thankfully gotten speed. I think keeping that in mind. This book is incredibly important basically Max talks about way before we even existed in microorganisms And the very first set of life and then going literally billions of years into the future and even to the end of the universe and uhh these were the chapters that i loved. The ending chapters, so fascinating I feel, I feel Dumbfounded almost by so much of space that I had no idea about and I think a lot of people actually don't either discussing the hypothetical ideas of about dyson spehres And how we could gather energy in a more efficient way from black holes and all these things that just seemed so impossible, but theoretically Theoretically, they're possible But now with the idea that AI might be might be. Thing in the future it actually seemed like that could actually be a thing and that's so cool learning about dark matter which I had no idea about and how we don't even understand what it is really and What implications it has on what, where we can actually reach in space and in our universe learning about O'Neill cylinders. which I've seen in like Si-fi's and such I didn't know there were things so basically if you look up you'll have the Sun in the sky even though You're living in this. I don't know weird structure in space orbiting so cool aAAEH Maxwell's talks about conscience, which I thought was really interesting because you're almost getting into philosophical area of what does it mean to have conscience can we outrule the fact that AI will have conscience or not, how do we define it? all these things I was very very intrigued by and I want to give this a five star (me too) I feel like I should but at the same time when you're discussing a hypothetical scenario Or some scenario that he admits may or may not ever happen I think Max really wanted to address every single issue with AI. He he really lays it all out on the table But I found it sometimes to be a bit tedious, and I wish he spent more time on other bits But I also understand why he did that and I also think that's it led to me unexpectedly enjoy bits that I Didn't think I would so. Great book Really recommend it that if you're interested in this sort of things we have one more book guys And it's another book that I said I was gonna read we have Beyond Good and Evil with Frederick Nietzsche and oh how naive I was to think that I could read Nietzsche I wanted to read this because I heard so much about Nietzsche, and I wanted to leave- uh read philosophy I Read a lot of comments about it people saying dude you can't just jump right into beyond good and evil, you need to sort of ease your way into it and It sort of made me almost scared of reading it I was like should I even bother like what's the point. But I thought to myself 'hey, I said I was gonna read the book. I bought the book. Why not you know even if it's too Complex for me. Why not give it a try?'and so I tried my very best immediate to - Faced with two issues which is the language? I think I would have done better if I read this in Swedish, maybe I had to constantly look up words then again, He also right off the bat starts off by analyzing other philosophers Which I'm not familiar with so it was really hard for me to really understand what he's trying to convey just From the beginning. I was like whoa okay, and But nevertheless there were bits that I really did pick up on that. I thought were really interesting for example, He points out that when we look at things like a tree for example We don't really look at all the details of it We sort of we don't look at the leaves necessarily in all the branches And he says, Nietzsche says we do the same thing when we read something we sort of pick the words that we can Associate with things that we think we know already he Nietzsche points out that in that sense We're all artists And we're all inventors because our knowledge is actually our own make-belief which I thought was so true While trying to interpret this book because the things that I actually really picked up on where the things that I could Associate with things I already I already knew Which is very interesting Nietzsche believes that philosophy is The philosopher's confession of his character in a way and You know, I wish I may not understand everything that was in this book But I do know that a lot of people love Nietzsche. I felt like I could understand why people love his character because he's very Present in this book. He's very charming, I would say. Obviously there's a lot of in this about religion he talks about how we're We're atheists, but we're still religious And he points out how we we don't really look at God as father figure anymore And we sort of replaced our Religion with science which is *diva* oh my god so true? stupid neil degrasse *angery* tyson *intense gargling* there was a lot of bits that I didn't understand at all especially the chapters about race I talks about the German race and how complex it is and talked a lot about the Jews and I Didn't really understand what he was trying to say, but what I do really like about Nietzsche Which I think I understand at least is that he's ideas come from a realist point of view And he criticized other philosophers that sort of try and make you feel good with their poetic Ideas almost, but he wants you to analyze What your thoughts are and where they're coming from and he also recognizes that We might think we know what the motive is behind our intentions of actions But it's actually far more complex than we think it is, which I find myself, after reading this, trying to question myself more and what, what the motive behind My intentions are (money) and and it's been a really fun mental exercise for me to try and do actually so I'm really glad Despite this being clearly above my league- reading comprehension. I'm really glad. I still gave it a try and I didn't run away scared of it, so did you read it perhaps? Did you share my ideas? What did you pick up on? What was your knowledge? I had so much fun this month too while reading these and I had a lot of fun today Discussing these books with you. Thank you for for letting me do that and break away from- to something different I made a list of the things that I want us to read next month I really wanted to read Moby Dick just an old classic thought might be good I wanted to read another classic which is, my eye is so itchy im sorry, the Old Man and the sea I also wanted to read another philosophy and a lot of people suggested Man's Search For Meaning. I thought as well if you maybe don't feel like reading something as long or Something like that we would read a Murikami short story, so I thought we would read Toni Takitani, so maybe we can discuss some aeeh Short stories where economy has amazing short stories, and I think that's probably want to be strength. That's it I'll see you guys next month and let me know if you picked up any of my recommendations Or if you're going to join me along on on these novels and yeah, thanks again really appreciate it please do leave a like if you enjoyed and made it this far and aHeH brofist

*clapping* Meme review *clapping* Meme Review *clapping* MEME REVIEW *clapping intensifies slightly* Welcome to another episode of Meme Review the most beloved show on YouTube. (very funny) YouTube put this last one on trending, which means that I'm doing something right!! (yay) That was a lie, *disappointment intensifies* I don't know why I lied about that. Let's have a quick look from last week's Meme Review™ What were the memes we discussed? The bike cuck meme, which we saw some-- eeeehhh different iterations of which was nice to see. Uhhh We also have Fantano posting: "My content got stolen recently -meme review stolen bike meme- I was pretty bummed out about it, but I think whoever stole it was probably more happy to get it than I'm sad to lose it, so whatever." What... Is he talking about? (meme stealing intensifies) I did not steal Meme Review™ from anyone Okay? (unoriginal content intensifies) Meme Review™ [demonic distorted voice] IS AN ORIGINAL IDEA -l- [echo] Now the first meme that we're gonna review [echo still going in background] for this week's Meme Review™ is arguably the greatest meme (yes) of all Time (Yas) This is the kind of meme that sets our civilization apart and elevates it to another level (is that a good thing tho?) This is humankind taking its next foot into the future I'm talking of course about "Petting dog" meme™. "Petting dog™" meme must be the greatest meme© of all time©. Basically you have anyone doing anything. Oh look, I'm dog meme'ing right now That's how easy it is and just replace their arms with a "petting a dog™©®". Ho-h- How does this meme work out then? HEH HA HA *IEIILllle* The thing about this meme it's that it has many layers, it has many layers of adaptability. *layers intensify* Almost anything can transform in "Petting dog™" meme. Her: he's probably thinking about other girls... Him: petting dog-- You even have CATS petting DOGS. Isn't that insane! CORY IN THE HOUSE (the musical) Now that's a little dank You know? It has a little bit of dankness to it, because clearly, Cory is black and the hand that's petting the dog, is... white. {and severely deformed) That is not allowed. That is cultural appropriating. Ah, but of course, there's some innocent ones and-- I think the flawness(?) in the meme is what makes it funny. Here with uh-- Josh's-- Is it Drake or Josh? I don't remember. (its josh) Here with Josh's hand looking completely deformed. (cyberbullying) We have, uh, Stranger Things with the dog meme I'm surprised They didn't go for all the tentacles, ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) they--they decided to simplify the meme to a single tentacle of "Petting dog™" meme. isn't this meme just the greatest? My personal favorite with the "Petting dog™" meme is the fact that you can take anything that might seem as [distorted] BAD. You know any--any form of hand gestures that can be seen as a negative hand gesture, can be saved, through "Petting dog" meme. Here you have me for example uh, you have uh, Caesar Doing the thumbs down. *cracks up at own meme* I made this meme myself, I'm quite proud of it. *continues cracking up* The origin of this meme started on the "me_irl" forum, Which I found out people aren't-- people aren't too fond of this, the me in--irl, but it started off with This tweet as well Getting a lot of attention. I think it was first documented around November 15 So it's a-- it's a somewhat fresh meme, some would say. Now, this isn't really that funny, it- *breaks out in laughter despite what he just said* Maybe it's the skill acquired in, eh, to pet this dog, the way he goes out of his way to pet the dog. That is funny about it, but, uhhhh you know, there are some very dank eehahahah Options for this, of course there's always you know other ends of each spectrum, it's also very layered meme of course, there's--there's the "Petting dog" meme "Petting dog" meme, I'm surprised they didn't go further to be honest. Uhhh, Then we also have *layers intensify I don't really... know.... yeah, as you can see it works for anyone it--dit-- it transcends humans. It doesn't just have to be humans and, uh like I said anything bad-- not that there's anything wrong with this image --can turn into something good. I made this one as well, so I've seen the original... (scarred) It also ehhhhh, is a very compatible meme, (incoming extremely layered crossover of 6 memes) it combines with many other memes as you can see here The "Petting dog™" meme really transcends our universal being, it's the py--pytagaraside©, ehhhh What was it called? Pytha--- The triangle? [monotonous word correcter] Pythagorean Theorem You know? How--how (incoming sciences) philosophically the triangle-- the mathematical equation A^2+B^2 equals C^2 is a universal like math is universal anywhere in the universe A^2, B^2, C^2 (A² + B² = C²*) is going to be the same no matter how-- where in time or where in universe that is the law of the universe (felix suddenly becomes an educational channel) we are describing something that is taking-- Transcends all of our mortal form and just like that this meme does the exact same thing (!?!?!!?) So I'm gonna have to go ahead and rate this meme a solid... 5.5 outta ten! all right, so we're don-- We're done with the "Petting dog™" meme so you can go you can go now, Edgar :( bye! Now... for the next meme *excessive clapping* please *zoom* for meme review *ZOOM INTENSIFIES* next! *punctual Clap* *clap* *clap* Monkey haircut as we've seen here in the... Combin--in the cu--in the crossover meme we have the Monkey Haircut meme critics would say that the dog petting meme was spawned Originally from the monkey sad--so sorry-- the sad monkey haircut meme™ now this one is a bit older its origin seem to be hard to pinpoint uh, but it started with this viral video of a cute little monkey Getting a haircut, but it's sad. It's not happy about haircut. Monkey is not too pleased about haircut Why are you giving a monkey a haircut?! but it was the monkey haircut that started this... Sh- (remembers hes a Christian channel now) bad Photoshop... new hands sort of thing Here we have Donald Trump. It's actually very good match Donald Trump giving sad monkey haircut. We got Rambo giving sad monkey haircut. We have We have, uh, Donald Trump in wrestling giving monkey haircut. We have monkey, giving monkey haircut We have anime girl giving monkey haircut. We have, of course, the loss Iteration of the monkey haircut Gordon Ramsay monkey haircut. Big Shaq! monkey haircut. Stalin monkey haircut. And we also have the inception version of it the monkey haircut giving monkey haircut Uh, we also even have a pewdiepie version of it, which I made myself (noice) But I gotta say there's something about this meme that just kind of annoys me... I don't know why It just never stops! Here we have haircut man Getting haircut giving monkey haircut the biggest crossover of memes I have ever seen              *layers intensify* we have, of course no arms man-- Beach person giving monkey haircut anime whamen haircut Edward Sissorhands haircut Whatever the fuck this is haircut. (post malone??) I think what makes this meme so popular... is because how, ehhh shittier it looks the funnier the meme. here we have another one I made and It just becomes funny, I would have to give this meme a solid SIX. It's better than the petting dog meme because the original one is always better Ah, I'm gonna atatata myself there (???) and gonna have to say this i--I'm giving this a 4.5 ouu- Nah, I'm gonna have-- it's a ★★★★★ It's a 5 everybody its global It's easily adaptable its original. I think it could have gotten some more points Actually, you know what it's a 5.2 because of its melancholic depression undertone, which I think will height--heighten any meme Next! Wooo- (incoming earape) *earape explosion* This is the meme that we have all been waiting for this is the meme that I pick The best one for last and not because I need this video to be ten minutes 
   *clapping intensifies* It's December, come on. Give me that revenue, January, is gonna be dead (woah calm down) and I need another meme I need a banger, I need a banger. What do we got? oh? Now that's it That's a good meme right there. Well done so Xenoblade Chronicles 2, recently came out and one of the characters... uhh... looks like *ding* truly mind-bending material here with the-- uh, with the back looking like... (literal 
92° angle from oversized bobs) eeuhh... She needs a serious chiropractic visit. Now it's not like Xenoblade has the best track record of its proportion... *wheezes* People were quick to point out, how... Dalia, which is the name of the character, looks like a yoshi that dre--grew a head We immediately have people making comparison to the-- (OH DAMN) I think- *HUEH HA HA* to other things looking similar to dahlia's character design and uhhh From different anime combinations that created this atrocity Such as dick butt Captain America perhaps (( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)) now social justice warrior were quick to point out how terrible this is To objectify a whamen, to looks like--it's something goddamn wrong with her 'if you ask' me, ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) This is perfectly fine human anatomy Okay? if anything Captain America has bigger knockers than Dahlia of course the internet was furious about this How could--how dare they make a disproportionate whamen in a fictional... video game disgusting whenever I'm play-- now that I'm playing Xenoblade I literally have to close my eyes. I can't even look at it (ahhahaha) it offends my very being and it offends my very core Now, "this is not much of a meme, Felix"" you might say . "Uhhh, what are you--what are you talking about here?" *ponders* *has no answer* Thank you for watching meme review I'm gonna rate the last, uh Dahlia meme probably a solid two and--two and a half because, uh, it will probably be dead in a couple days (like your monetization) meme review Thank you for watching another episode of meme review What meme do you want me to review in the next episode? leave a comment down below because oh boy do I need help We're on Episode 2 and I'm already grasping for straws is that the expression? (nope) I don't-- *dies* squad fam out meme review (clap count: 57) 
YOUTUBE REWIND! !DNIWER EBUTUOY The new YouTube Rewind is up! *slow claps* And I thought I would react to it for a good ol'- good ol' time I've been a part of YouTube Rewind since uhhh 2013 It's always been very cool to be a part of, I remember when they did the first one. Everyone that wasn't in it was like, "Holy, holy heck! ... (Christian channel) ... I would love to part of that, that looks cool!" And I remember in the comments in the 2012 one, I wasn't in it and people were so pissed cause I think I just became the biggest channel or something like that and they was like, "Where. Is. PewDiePie?????" But I was invited for 2013, it was a very fun and easy shoot. They came to Brighton to shoot it with me. I can't believe I've been in Brighton for so long.. I was like a little easter egg in the end. Because of all the comments in the last video they were like, "Alright, we'll put him in the end so people—" The tension! Will he be in this one?! Who knows???? There it is! Man... I look soo different. They just asked me to do a bunch of weird stuff with it. I'm like "I don't know.. I'll scream at it.." But it was cool, it was a really fun shoot. I think rewind for me, has always been really good because— and (for) YouTubers in general, cause it's such a huge production We're not really used to being in front of cameras with other people. For me, it was really good practice. because whenever you're here it's my space, I know .. my stuff but like if you have a whole crew in front of you with their cameras, I don't know who they are? I don't even think they know who I am? And then you're expected to do your thing, like that's super weird so... I though rewind was really good to like get more practice. 2014 I loved this one. I actually got a bigger part in this one which I thought was pretty deserved, you know? Uhhh... and it was also in Brighton. This one took forever to film. My god— we went soo overtime. Literally everyone left. Still. I loved filming this one. First of all, it turned out fucking great. I actually had to jump through like an actual piece of wood or something like that You have to be brave. I did it so many times, I must've done it at least 10 times. Uhh, and it started really hurting after awhile. I had a stunt- professional stuntman helping me out and it was so fun. It was suuuper fun. I loved it. 2015 everybody! This one was weird. I'm not gonna lie. I was like... They were like, "Okay so you're gonna be with Zoella" I'm like... Okay.. Why not Marzia? You know she's lives in Brighton too, right, like...??? Like why isn't Zoella with Alfie, he's a bigger YouTuber, too?? (should we do it?) ( lets do it! ) Super cool. Super cool. 2016! I don't think I- I was barely in this one. I was busy shooting uhhh... Scare PewDiePie. I think I was going through my mental breakdown period. Yeah it was YouTube- It was Scare PewDiePie season 2. Yeahyeah- that was it. And uh, I happened to be in their studio so they were like, "Dude we gotta have you in." Really uh... really important role in that one. (sarcasm) I always really enjoyed YouTube rewind. They do take a lot of time and I think you have to give up a day and for someone that's on a daily YouTube grind that's a big deal. But it's worth it because it's such a cool production to be part of even if it's just for 2 or 3 seconds. It became pretty clear to me at least that rewind isn't really like, in 2012 when I first saw it I was like, "Okay this is something cool that all the creators are part of to celebrate YouTube." But.. I mean, it's an advertisement. It's an advertisement for YouTube and that's fine. I'm not saying that there's anything wrong with that but it's sorta like when you realize that, it doesn't really become the same thing In my head at least, it used to be something that you wanted really to be acknowledged as a creator. For 2017 YouTube Rewind... I AM NOT IN IT. Big surprise! I know! It wasn't because I said no, it was because I wasn't asked. Yeah.. no... it's- it's cool.. 2017 has been quite the year. It's sad in a way that I'm not part of it but like, I understand why. Like I'm not salty at YouTube for not inviting me or something. But at the end of the day I care more about YouTube. I care more about what's good for YouTube; what's good for the platform. Than me being in it and I don't know... pissing people off? I don't know. I haven't seen it yet but we'll watch it at the end of the video, I really want to react to it. Some speculations; I wrote em down. Lele Pons... There will be many Lele Pons! we saw this from uh.. susan wojcicki's video. we had a bunch of viners. and that was like.... FAKKK!!! probably some political uh.... statements some the movement probably left! Jake Paul the Pauls, probably have a big part of it I think they had a, had a big influence on this year so it makes sense fidget spinners I have seen, because 
they have teased it hopefully some decent music this time around probably, like It's kinda a meme with the Rewind that you don't know who all the YouTubers are because but uh I think that's a cool thing in a way, like there's no way you know what is it, like thousands of channels have over a million subs, it's insane. There's 2,000 channels, and this was in 2016 that have at least one million subscribers. Like, that's INSANE. When they announced the Golden Plaque, there was a dozen on it. There was a dozen of channels. [YouTube Rewind music] (not gonna lie, listening to this whilst subtitling the video makes me want to die) Okay, they start off with the- Latinoo?? Oh? I don't- know, what is happening, it's too fast I recognise Vanoss, obviously and uh Hola Soy German oh my god, oh my god What is hap- fidget spinner! Ah, that's dope. I'm glad they got Kendrick, that's- that's really cool. oke Ayy, we got the meme in there, the- great. I feel like I'm reacting so badly to this, there's not much to say really. Uhmm.. oke Faaaa... what? I don't legit, no offence, obviously, they're in UK, right? that looks like British churches to me, maybe I'm wrong. Who are they? I didn't want to make this meme because it's so tired, but who- this song will definitely cuck me over. That's a cool SET. Everybody, OF COURSE. I'm glad they got Phil in there. That's a bit weird- I don't think I've seen him in the others. Yes. YES. UNITY! H E  W I L L  N O T  D I V I D E  U S I feel like I could've uh, I could've done that. I definitely could've held someone's hand. See, I could've been the middle part there, right? Cmon, I ca- [mating call] You gotta admit, I could've at least, maybe like maybe I could've been like a subliminal message. Uhhh, like a one frame sorta thing, like uhhh, maybe joke about that the whole uhhh Wall Street thing maybe a little meme about it That's the Kumbaya moment over with, that's nice That's- that's also very cool. There he is! Of course. I thought there'd be more of them, to be honest. I thought they'd really focus on the Paulers. Oh okay, there was more. Oh yeah, because they had drama. Remember their drama? Wow. That's nice though. I mean, it wouldn't be YouTube Rewind without acknowledging the cancer. Hey, it's Poppy. Ah nice. I'm glad he's in it. Not sure what they're going with here. [laughs] Ayy, we got Mark. Man, I guess it's gotta be so hard to do this and fit all the people in, right? You got 2,000 channels. 2,000 with more than a million subs. Planking, why? Is it over? Okay, it's over. I think I hit all the predictions, didn't I? I think, I think my favourite moments was KSI. Cos I thought he'd be hit by the train. I'm joking. Ha ha ha ha. Really, really enjoyed this bit. This bit was really good. This bit 10 out of 10. Made me want to die. I don't know why went with the greenscreen on this one, I just had it down already as I couldn't be bothered to put it up but uh that's it. Thank you for watching, goodbye. Squad fam out. 
How's it goin' -before this video begins I got an exciting announcement. Me and Marzia, together for the first time, launched a project together. Our own brand... ....called Tsuki.

Or a... ...Creature of the night. -You can still wear Tsuki. We also have some home product as well. It's all ethically made and uh- It's all designed by us. So yeah one of the items I really wanted to have was his mock neck -that you got this Tsuki logo on it Uh, I love this thing. We also launched an oversized hoodie. Super comfortable, super cool fit on it very unique. We also got our pink t-shirt with the Tsuki logo along with a cap. I love this cap so much (finally one that actually fits my damn head). We even have (if you're feeling very fashion-forward and cool like myself) a beret! That's right *hehehe* Bet you didn't expect that. We also have very cool Tsuki socks along with a Sookie planner, candle (that we selected with the scent) and yeah check it out t-the... ...Stock is limited so, once it's out, it's out.

Three-two-one   Meme review -clap clap clap- Meme review -clap- Legend Johnny Dee finally did a cover By Gucci Gang we did it together -Johnny raps Gucci Gang by Little Pump- Better than Eminem *chuckle* Better than original! For real. People ask me all the time "Felix, what is your favorite meal?" "What is the snack that you eat before your videos to get you that edge?" And I always say Tide Pods Tide Pods are...  delicious. They are so tasty Salt Savory Moist Dry All these components just packed into a Tide Pod. It is so good Now They came out with a Hot Pocket Tide Pods and I gotta say I'm not- this is not #sponcered but I wish because it is delicious The crust of the Hot Pockets containing the savory of the Tide Pods it really hits your stomach in a way that I can't- even begin to explain It's not just me that love Tide Pods, of course. Squidward another famous e-celeb, loves loves Tide Pods Even Spongebob loved Tide Pods. There's even Mexican style -chuckles- There's even Mexican style Tide Pods, which I haven't I haven't tried yet But I can only imagine that you don't need it. You clearly don't need any other condiments in there cuz that's   That looks good by itself. He also got there Totino's pizza roll detergent those are Sorta like an off-brand Tide Pods, but nevertheless still probably very delicious! "Give up your seats to someone carrying something more important" That's right. If you see a pregnant lady carrying a Tide Pod, you need to let her sit and take your spot   "Excuse me, I didn't know you were pregnant with a Tide Pod. I am so sorry. Please have my seat" Don't judge me, but Tide Pods are fuckin' delicious and basically, I just ate 47 oF them Damn, that's a lot of Tide Pods. I don't think I have ever eaten that many Tide Pods People cooking Tide Pods Just sharing. What is the best way to enjoy a Tide Pod? "No more eating xanax in 2018 we eating tide pods from now on" That's right. Now if you don't get the joke -chuckles- Somehow it became a meme that you're supposed to eat Tide Pods uh and eh We have all these websites like "BuzzFeed" and "Mashable" saying Don't. Don't eat Tide Pods. and I feel like I should say that too but they're just so delicious. Some people, some "haters" in the tide pod community says that it's Toxic (scary music) oo00ooOOo0o- Or you could die aaaAAAaaaAAaAAa Clearly these people don't know the great word of the Tide Pods And how delicious they are Now the origin of this meme some people speculate is from "The Onion" supposed  two years ago but recently got a lot of traction. For whoever the fuck knows what reason. "I can't believe I have to say this but... please don't eat Tide Pods" I guess you want them all for yourself, Mashable! Don't think I'm onto your game I'm even matching my outfit with Tide Pods. Step up your shit, Mashable I bet you wish you were a Tide Pod cuz I wish that every night. Please God, make me eh into Tide Pod Someone some brave soul wrote to "Gushers", the candy brand, and asked hear me out There was a fruit snack that looked like a laundry pod not any specific brand one because you know legality But what if it looked like a laundry pod we all want to eat them so bad. Thanks for your time I hope it takes off... and they blocked her. Disgusting. We also have Tide Pod-chan and probably the most beautiful Being ever created in this universe. sorry Marzia Tide Pod-chan wins every time. Tide Pod-chan. Here we have a furry account enjoying some Tide Pod pizza. Look at that! Wow! having a... having a great time. Look, uh... *Tide Pods kick in* That Looks so good! I... I feel jealous *stutters* but at the same time, it's wonderful. It's wonderful that people share their own recipes. I feel sick. We even have famous chefs like Gordon Ramsay Delicious. Finally some good effing food I haven't been eating my whole life until I discovered Tide Pods. "When you're listening to someone speak and you can feel your  Tide Pod hit" So, go forth. Share the Tide Pod, the Great Wisdom . No longer it would be a secret for the unknown. Share the Tide Pod with a friend, have a snack have a Tide Pod Tide Pod meme is a solid 8.1 I would say it could even get to a 10 if someone dies I think someone needs to die for a meme to, to get to 10/10. You know what I mean? (claps) next (claps) meme (claps) please (claps) Thank youuuuuu You know we're gonna talk about Logan Paul memes everybody. They're fresh They're hot and they're gonna burn out fast. "*seeing a dead man* Logan Paulers: Yo you alive?" We have the Sayori hanging meme and Logan Paul reacting to it. Horrible. Despicable. I can't believe he did this. Literally anything hanging, Logan Paul just can't help himself. He has to react to it. There's just too much clickbait on thumbnail. How could you do that Logan? How could you do that? "Yoda watching sacred texts burn in The Last Jedi (2017, colorized)" We have Logan Paul playing the famous game, The Forest. Logan Paul reacting to po- poor Kermit. What even Kermit ever do Logan? You don't have... Goddamnit! Will someone stop Logan? "When your friend asked if you want to hang out" (T R I G G E R E D) That was good meme. Here's Logan Paul reacting to Spongebob hanging. Logan, please "Understand that suicide is a real and big issue and use your platform to make awareness for it. Clickbait suicide for money and views" Well done Logan Paul. Someone pointed out that on the trending page we have Logan Paul and the second trending one was "Man of the woods" Everyone is just click baiting *chuckles* These days they can't help themselves, Logan Paul. That's Jon Tron. Please. Logan stop it! Stop reacting to all the bad memes! The "Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei" Logan Paul? Really? Now I'm gonna have to put my foot down and say I am officially challenging you in a battle. Now the beautifulness of the Logan Paul meme is that the moral high ground of the meme It's not making fun of suicide. It's making fun of how stupid Logan Paul is. I'm gonna rate this meme 7 and a half logan paul: did we just find a dead person in the suicide forest It's... It's a meme where everyone can just get on board Logan Paul fan or not. Everyone likes to laugh at a stupid thing. Oh! Look he make a mistake? Good thing i never make any of those. I'm I'm fearful that the meme will run out fast It's gonna burn out fast. I better get this video up A.S.P But I think in a couple months from now on we'll still see the Logan Paul *weird noise* Face appearing somewhere else that's sort of relatable Maybe maybe we'll turn into a nice little crossover meme in the future. The future will tell us all about this. Now we have time for one more meme. Can I get a... BONUS MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEME BONUS MEME Lucky you. We have time for a bonus meme. This means Special... time for everyone. It's the okay sign meme. I don't get this meme. At all. I don't get it. We never played this game when I was young but apparently if you do the upside-down errrrrrrr Hand sign and you make them look at it you're supposed to catch them off-guard like "Hey, buddy. Look at this!" You get to punch them. it's called the circle game. what the heck is what is this? What is I don't understand? It's just kind of annoying. Let's play the circle game, sucker. nice little meme generator Dotnet here. I'm rating this meme a 0. That's right, the first 0 on meme review I hate this meme  it's so stupid   I hate it so much.

HELLO EVERYBODY!!!!!!!!! AYYYY STOP. Wha-- whott-- why? I just don't get it
I always catch you fuckers watching this sick shit THIS IS SICKENING. THE DISASTER ARTIST WOOW PEWDIEPIE, DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THE NEW MOVIE THEY'RE MAKING? THE DISASTER ARTIST? No, no. I've never heard of it!!!!!!!!!! Please tell me more!!!!! SOMEONE NEEDS TO TELL YOU THAT THEY ARE MAKING A MOVIE ABOUT TOMY WISEAU AND THE ROOM, IT'S CALLED "THE DISASTER ARTIST" OH!! WOW!! THAT'S INCREDIBLE!! HOW DID I NOT KNOW THIS?? You need to see the trailer for "The Disaster Artist", it's about Tommy Wiseau. But if you've already seen it, then ignore this. Oh..ahahahah Stop making fucking stupid videos and do a review on the Disaster arti- Shut the f.. up! Okay, fine. I'll make a review. That's right, I'm a movie critic now. The Disaster Artist is a movie I never thought would exist. Similar to the other movie review I made: BLAME. A movie I never thought would exist either! This is my niche! I have finally found it! I review movies that I never thought would exist. The Disaster Artist is a movie about a movie about a book about a movie about a book ... about - Now, If you have seen The Room, you know exactly what I am talking about The Disaster Artist is based on the movie The Room I made a movie (review) about The Room I really recommend checking it out And I explain why I love The Room so much It's a movie that is HILARIOUSLY BAD and unlike a lot of bad movies I've talked about a lot of bad movies before on my channel This is like when Luke Skywalker Took off the mask of Darth Vader Why did he need that anyway by the way -ok great- What is that thing? The Room is [the] kind of bad movie I can re-watch Infinite amount of times I never get sick of it I love showing it to people. I love sharing information about the movie because the more you know about The Room, the more intrigued you get by it. So when the book came out, from one of the guys that was in The Room explaining how The Room was made, called The Disaster Artist by Greg Sestero Reading that, I just got a new-found love for the film. It's actually a very, very interesting story, about unlikely friendship, and Two people, finding success in failure. It's a very touching story, which you wouldn't expect. Tommy and Greg are actually very close friends. Which, when you watch The Room, you would never have guessed. I mean, they're complete opposites. You have Tommy, who is really old. Uh, sorry Tommy, if you're listening He's clearly not American, but he wants to be. But he's also very rich for reasons we never find out. And then you have Greg, who is young, American, and doesn't have any money. But what draws these two characters together, or people together because this is a true story - is them wanting to make it in Hollywood. Wanting to become actors. And the movie shows that. It starts off with Greg seeing Tommy at a drama class, and Greg is just so intrigued by Tommy. How he is so fearless in his acting He's not very good, but he's so ...there's something that draws him in about him. They become friends, and despite their differences, they decide to move to LA together. And try and make it in Hollywood. And the book and the movie pretty much pens out the same way here. I read the book about two years ago, so my memory is a little fuzzy on the whole thing. Tommy doesn't find any success in LA, he's He's not a good actor. Greg finds some success, but nothing really too overwhelming. and I think they are both in the time where they just wanna give up on their dream that they had together. But then they, Tommy comes up with the idea: I'm just gonna make my own movie, and you're gonna be in it. And so, The Room was born. And here's where the book and the movie really sets apart as far as I remember: in the movie it's very Hollywood. where, "Oh, we're gonna make a movie and it's gonna be great!" "Everyone's gonna be super happy!" "Yes of course I wanna be a part of it!" When in reality, described in the book, Greg didn't wanna be a part of the movie at all. He actually just accepted to be part as a line producer of the film, so he wasn't even gonna act in the movie. But he would be a stand-in for the actor for his role as Mark Basically, he would just stand in the frame of the camera, so the camera knows where he will be. But Tommy wanted Greg to be in the movie. The movie is about them, after all. It's a reflection of their friendship. Like I said, you would never have guessed it, but it is the truth. So, Tommy basically would just slowly start replacing in Greg more and more and , to the point where he would just take over and start acting in the film. Without even telling the original actor. Which is Which is hilarious and horrible at the same time. And there's a lot of bad stuff like that, that isn't in the film. There's a lot of stuff that maybe you don't wanna really tell... that's left out How they constantly changed crew while making the film. Arguing with actors during the film, refusing to pay people during the film. These are the sorts of things that were left out of the movie. I understand why they did, because it would've been too long, too convoluted, and too complicated. But I think they did a good job at tying it all together they tell the story about their friendship and the making of the movie. And I think that was the main point. I do think there was some miscasting in the film, it seemed like they were all just friends that wanted to make this movie in my opinion. Which I understand, it's like "Oh you're making a movie about The Room? I love The Room! You have to put me in it, James!" But other than that, it was...I couldn't have asked for more. I thought it was extremely entertaining. I was laughing througout the whole thing. There was a lot of inside jokes. Which not as many people were laughing at. But at the same time, I realized while watching it You don't even have to have seen The Room to enjoy The Disaster Artist. I think that's a really, a feat of its own. James Franco renders Tommy Wiseau in such a hilarious, relatable and endearing way you can tell that James was really invested in Tommy's character. I watched an interview with Seth Rogen where he explains it, which I thought was really nice. It was incredibly personal to him, in a weird way and he felt this weird kinship with Tommy Wiseau who's the guy in the movie so we really wanted to just support him. Someone makes a piece of art, hoping it's received one way, it is actually received for the exact opposite reasons that you hoped it would but the result is actually the same. You become famous, people like you. You have movie stars making movies about you. You make money. You get, uh, you're in profit - Yeah, you're getting paid. And Franco has someone who has done a lot of weird art shit throughout his life. Constantly being misunderstood, misinterpreted people thinking that the shit he thought was great was stupid and vice versa. It was incredibly personal to him. In a weird way. And he felt this weird kinship with Tommy Wiseau, who's who's the guy in the movie. You can truly tell that James was deeply invested in Tommy's character. Watching the teaser trailer for this film, I got kind of annoyed, because they had already changed so much, they skipped bits that were hilarious so I was really worried about this film. I did not hit her, it's not true. It's bullshit. I did not hit her, I did not. Oh, hi, Mark. Take 67. Action. I hit her!
No! Do you wanna change the line? You're doing great, man. I did not hit her, it's not true, it's bullshit, I did not hit her, I did not. Oh, hi Mark. In this scene, at the end, Tommy would never look up, he would always just forget what he was doing and forget that he actually needs to look at the person if he sees someone. Oh, hi Mark. So apparently, what they did was everyone would just wave at Tommy when he was finishing the scene so that he would look up. And then he would just look up and say "Oh, hi, Mark." And that's how they finally got the shot. He'd also hit his head multiple times while going out of that little box. So, it's almost like the movie skipped out on a lot of hilarious stuff in my opinion. And I remember reading about this in the book and it was just so funny to re-live that horrible, horrible scene. And knowing what went down for it to happen. I think the main difference between the movie and the book is that the book ends right before the premiere. The movie starts. But the movie ends a bit after, with a nice happy ending. I'm not sure if the ending was actually that happy. I think anyone that was involved in the project of The Room probably went through a really rough time. I think it affected a lot of peoples' lives really negatively watching interviews from a lot of the actors involved with their careers and their confidence being destroyed for everyone. Tommy, for Greg, for all the other actors as well and the people making the movie not being credited properly. And I don't think the ending of the book was a happy ending. But I think, now that the movie is out and you have people loving The Room you have people so dedicated to it. People like me who just find so much joy in it. It's been re-made by Hollywood superstars into a film. And it's a great story. It's an amazing story, and I really hope, so, even though they completely changed the ending it makes sense now. I think, and I really hope, that everyone involved in The Room with this film coming out, The Disaster Artist, find a closure, insane story of making The Room. I think, I really hope it ends in a positive way for everyone involved And it seems like it. It seems like Tommy has found a lot of joy in all this attention, and Greg as well, and it's a life-changing thing to be a part of and it was nice seeing it sort of being wrapped up. Maybe I'm reading into it a bit too much, I don't know. You can still really very much enjoy the book, it goes way and beyond on details. and it's hilarious. It's good details, that I actually really recommend. There's also an audiobook version of the book. Which I also really recommend, because Greg reads out all the lines. And he does Tommy Wiseau's voice so great And it really shows that he's actually not a bad actor. The movie doesn't replace the book and the book doesn't replace the movie. I think you can enjoy them both individually. It's not like it spoils anything is what I'm saying. I'm gonna give the movie an 8.5 it was hilarious, I would love to see it again. Some changes that I kinda disagreed with, but over all, very satisfying, I really enjoyed it. An 8.6 I'm gonna give it. Go watch it! Let me know what you think. And this has been Movie Review with Pewdiepie. Leave a like, and Squad Fam out. You know what they say,

World premiering, introducing for the first time, Pew News! **Fake laser gun sounds** The most legitimate news source on the Internet. *More fake laser gun noises* [News Theme] Pew News, the place where we talk about things that happen on the internet. Topics that are of interest. News number one: J.K. Rowling is under the, the fire lately. J.K. Rowling responds to gay Dumbledore controversy. J.K. Rowling the wonderful author who didn't take a second before calling me out publicly for being a fascist. Thank you. Thank you J.K. *Kiss* Basically, what happened was that J.K. Rowling, The queen of afterthought, after writing seven books, She... she thought it would be nice that if Dumbledore, without any hint in any of the seven books That Dumbledore, one of the main characters was a homosexual. A nice little afterthought, you know of course and you know why? Because they're no different. That's why that's how genius I am. Because, They're no different from normal people. That's why I don't even have to write it in. I will however, take all the glory for being — *chuckle* for being so forward thinking, you are welcome. So now that the new movies are coming out with Dumbledore's   past or, his previous character as young. It was exposed that none of that will be shown. *Laughs* Dumbledore, will in fact not be displaying Uh, that he is into boys. And J.K. Rowling sort of responded to, uh, people's criticism about this, people weren't too happy. Kind of calling her out for her Hypocrisy that hey, I thought you said that he was a homosexual character, then why isn't he all the sudden and J.K.  responded with? "I'm gonna mute you," that's how you know someone responds well to criticism when they — she won't even listen to it . *Laughs* J.K. Rowling, which of course also so progressively thought,  yes, Hermione was actually black . As clearly evidence all over her seven books displayed like here... and here Here's the tragic case of me actually agreeing with Polygon "Fantastic Beasts sequel needs to show Dumbledore's sexuality, not just hint at it." You have created a world with werewolves, wizards and all kinds of shit. I don't watch Harry Potter, or read the books, but I know there's,  you got magic in it, but a man publicly Displaying that he- his sexuality. That's too far.That cannot exist in this world Thank you very much! It's like she wants the cake and eat it too, and people call her out on it, and she's a crybaby. J.K Rowling is a lost billionaire woman who can't face criticism. Nothing new here. *Laser sounds* The next news: Logan Paul went skydiving and his main parachute didn't open! ah! *Somebody touched my spaghetti!* Oh my god! I think that's the wrong emoji that they used, they should have used the that emoji,  or perhaps.... Many of you asked what my opinion was about Logan Paul returning to YouTube, and it's pretty simple: he should be able to return, there shouldn't be any problems with it, and I personally, I don't have any problems with it. I for one loved seeing slow-mo shots of Logan Paul with a serious face. Maybe petting his dog or uh, maybe just wrapping his fingers together. That's that's what I subscribe for Logan Paul, and I'm glad that he is back doing what he's doing best. Yes, touch the stone! Oohhhh! Awhh! Can I just say, I love his haircut! It's just perfect, it just made me completely forget about everything I need a new haircu-. I need a new... that's better. I guess the thing about this video is that Logan Paul's Initial video, that started all the drama, 
It was made.. to make himself look better in the eye of suicide. That's what he did, He just did it so. Miserably that it just completely collapsed, and at the end of the day this video was doing the same thing, He's trying to make himself look better in the eye of suicide There's really no difference, but the general thing to learn here that it's okay to do that, It's okay to benefit from suicide as long as you're doing it in the right way. One important note that I got from the video was that he met up with this gent that survived from jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge, which is Obviously doesn't happen and he was met with instant regret, and he uses that to speak out against suicide, And it's a great story. And it's great that he's getting featured. Basically when I was during my media storm Everyone told me to do this exact same thing, Everyone told me you need to meet with people, you need to travel around the world to Interact and show people that you've learned, you need to appear on interviews, and I just, personally, felt that that was very disingenuous, It seemed like I'm obviously just doing it to repay my image or to repair my image. I'm not doing it out of pure good intention Which sort of spoils it completely for me, and I just thought that would that's just disingenuous, I don't want to do that, I would rather just show people that I've changed through my videos and time. He also did an interview with ABC with.. Michael. "Michael I'm 22 years old. I'm gonna be honest with you Michael. Michael I've gotten to meet.." (Felix) Michael "So he's 100 yards away from the park and I- It just it  doesn't make any sense and I- I believe it happened for a reason." So apparently because it was just one hundred yards from the parking lot And and Logan Paul found a dead body it happened for a reason. There's a divine-  Logan Paul is on a divine path of Redemption. This all happened for a reason. Who would have thought it would have happened? No one ""(Interviewer) For parents out there because where you're the father thirteen year old twin girl It's very hard to know everything that your kids watch, and there are a lot of parents (Logan)"Alot of parents" (Felix)  Who are not gonna pay for your Merch anymore *evil laugh* "Every parent, I meet whose kids are under the age of like 12, I go hey You you let your kids watch my stuff? That's right parents. Don't worry about everything that happened. It wasn't Logan Paul's fault It was your fault. Okay. You should not have let your kids watch his videos What are you stupid parents come on, man? What are you doing, parents? Obviously it's not Logan Paul's fault When you put out content like that do you realize the age of your audience? It's odd because Michael, I'm 22 years old It's not like I'm making Content necessarily for kids. *mhm* You 100% are making content for kids Logan. You know your demographic *crazily screaming kids of Logan* Every youtuber ever knows their demographics, that that's how you are successful, it's in your analytics. And it's also, you meet them. I.... I know people say well Only the young ones show up at events like this and stuff like that But no, when I did my meetups ever older people there too. They were not there's all kids in fact there were more young teens and uh, Young adults than kids you're lying. You're just lying. I try not to live my life thinking about money PFFFFFFF *thud* *inhale* *inhale* I'm sorry, what? Can you repeat that, please? I try not to live my life thinking about money *Pewds tries his new language called Brawn.* Your whole channel is built about money, Logan. It's the only thing that draws in these little kids to look up to you. Oh look at all these flashy cars you have, the mansion. Your whole brand is built around it, Logan. Are you kidding me? The twenty seventeen year review video. Where do I begin? I guess I could start with this *dramatic intense hype music* At Twenty two years old I bought my first house for six point five million dollars, but it wasn't quite satisfied So I had a koi pond put in *intense music again* Painted the walls of the guest house *intense music again* (idk why I am doin it) Bought a giant truck known as the Yeti *intense music again* Bought a school bus and then turned it into a cool bus *just music* Installed a home theater system Blah Blah Blah More material objects guys the point is I bought a lot of things including this Rolex I try not to live my life thinking about money *Pinocchio magic sound* Like I said Logan Paul should just keep making videos and be honest. That's that would be my advice and as long as he's not I'm gonna call him out on it. Now which brings back to this headline, Logan Paul went skydiving and his main parachute didn't open he posted on Twitter that uh he had to cut away his main parachute because it didn't open and uh He had to use the blue reserve parachute. Remember the guy that jumped off the bridge and survived? Well now, Logan Paul. Has someone that he can relate to it. Normally, I would think better of people but Seeing Logan Paul's behavior, and I think I'm someone that can understand this sort of mentality Where you're just dishonest, I really truly think that he just jumped with the second parachute I would not accuse people of this shit. Just out of superstition, but seeing all these Track record of dishonesty And doing literally anything to redeem your brand. I'm gonna call it out. It seems too perfect for me to see him Talk to a guy that jumped off the bridge and survived And then this is gonna be his first vlog, right this is gonna be his comeback vlog I haven't seen it hasn't come out yet But I'm pretty sure this is gonna be his vlog and now he gets a chance to feel like yes You know, I survived a jump. Now I feel now I feel the same way, and if you think I'm crazy People are already saying it, maybe now you'll stop seeing suicide as a joke first you have this video, and then thiis very specific..thing happens in relation to it.. Obviously Logan knows his next vlog is gonna have to be important It's gonna have to have some sort of message. You can't just keep making videos and move on I'm not buying it I'm not buying it. I know people will think I'm crazy like I've put on a tinfoil hat or something. I'm not buying it I'm not buying it for a second stop being dishonest Logan. That's all you have to do *Fake laser gun sounds* Next news Pew News that's right we have more Susan Wojcicki tweeted CEO of YouTube I think that's their position at least That she's been listening closely to your thoughts and ideas for the past year So wanted to share my priorities for creators in 2018. It's a long blog post going through basically Uh Acknowledging the issues I would say She sort of spices on some some good bits here and there, like like not everything is bad Hey, they have super chat now and in 2017 The number of creators making six figures grew by 40% so it's not all bad But she did recognize the de-monetization in this message. She says but even as our platform continues to do well around the world too many of you. Unfortunately had to learn about the new word in 2017 de-monetization. It's nice to have it acknowledged at least it would be nicer to see What is going to be done, I think I think a real good course of action would be to Stop letting people have this guessing game with YouTube. You're gonna have to start filling people in on what is going on And why for example a video gets de-monetized. Whenever my video gets de-monitized I have to play this guessing game of What caused it, what was it in this 10-minute video that that wasn't allowed was it because I said "Dorian" at that Point was that too much you never know It's so, I wish they'd just say: "Hey this doesn't fit into our Community Guidelines". I can go okay I'll cut that out, not a problem and then I can move on with my day and instead of having to spend hours of Reuploading reuploading spending so much time and I think this is a problem with most creators when a when a clip gets Claimed by another company they take all the revenue of the video So let's say I use audio from someone that I didn't know was copyrighted or something like that it's hard to tell I know it's stupid you shouldn't do it, but Sometimes it just happens, and they claim the video They get all the revenue and plus that if they don't even have to say why they claimed it, or what is claimed There's still so many issues with the system And they're making it harder for creators to earn their revenue that they deserve Uh! You have really creative people really making. Uh! Amazing stuff that don't get the revenue just to give an example you have this really creative meme Uh! Video that I re-uploaded because I wanted to react to it. It's a really great video probably took shit ton of edit to put in and it's to display the memes of. Uh! 2017 if I showed this bit in my video the company that owns this video can claim my Video and take all the revenue for this entire video just because I showed it, that's enough to justify the claim There's so many issues, and I think that's what needs to be addressed stop letting youtubers have this guessing issue I do think they are gonna make an effort, and I'm glad this is talked about from Susan direct I hope that Susan makes more statements like this I think it's great and it gives some transparency and and generally a direct reply to the community Uh *Fake laser gun sounds* *Clap* What are your thoughts on some of the stuff That we discussed here today, let me know. Also make sure that you check out the new merch now it comes in hoodie That's right. Leave a like if you enjoyed and as always Squad Fam out. *Nasty Giggle* Every parent  I meet whose kids are under the age of like 12 I go hey You you let your kids watch my stuff? *Pinocchio magic music* Oh-oh look my nose :c

They better not say your mom gay. My mom is not gay, no u no u M O V I N G *clap* O N *clap* N E X T  M E M A question that we've all asked ourselves since the beginning of mankind since we used to live in cage and scribbled up on walls Before we invented civilization helicopters and bungee jumps There was one question that was yet to be answered w h e r e  i s  u r  p e e  s t o r e d? everyone is asking this question is pee stored in the balls Scientists have been trying to figure out this incredible phenomena for a very long time and there's many different theories and assumptions Here we have brock obama saying pee is stored in the dick that's why it's called pee-nis cuz of the pee huh yea That makes sense. If we store pee in the balls where do girls store them? hmmmm In them titties? Do girls pee at all? hmmmmmmm Mike Tyson famous scientist says pee is stored in the heart I mean I don't understand where else it could possibly be, Mike Tyson now you're just being silly. Yoda says pee is stored in the balls neil degrasse tyson says peanuts are called peanuts because pee is stored in the nuts. he makes an excellent point I think this is the right theory. thank you neil degrasse tyson for your contribution to the science community Finally we know how to store pee. Therefore chicks do not pee for where would they store it. That's right women don't pee everyone knows this. it's a common fact it's the mandela effect where everyone believes one thing But the truth is actually completely different the pee is in fact stored in the balls Everyone knows this please spread this message across the internet so we can finally stop the debate and move past two more important parts of science like is the earth flat we're still working on that one But in the meantime There's some haters of course and the pee is stored in the balls community there's the critics saying if pee is stored in the balls then why don't they shrink when we pee? This can easily be explained but it will take too long and I don't have time for pity intellectuals like yourself. Why are you're all so big me need to pee I think it's time to move on from this meme next I forgot, to rate this meme my god this is a fantastic meme probably the BEST meme that we've EVER had it's getting a one it's such a good meme just kidding it gets a 6 point five point four next BAh Black Panther is out in the cinema and people are excited So am I. It's looking great I can't wait to watch it. People have a lot of opinions about de movie bla bla bla stupid limp tardes try to politicize the movie arghhh stupid stupid lib tarts makes me angry if you give black panther a bad review you are racist i don't care i don't care i don't care. He's right he's right I'm not disputing this. There's a lot of political claims about the film for exTample this old man's purposeless rolling black panther is another perfect example of white people putting their noses in places it doesn't belong and i agree 100% why this man was in this film it makes me so a  n  g  e  r  y If you're white and you don't go see Black Panther at the midnight release you are racist and if you're white and you do go see black panther at the midnight release then you're racist because you're taking up a seat of a black person. Come on come on what do you thinking so I carefully did not buy black panther tickets for the opening weekend because I didn't want to be the white person sucking black joy out of the theater. What's the appropriate date for me to buy ticket? Is next weekend okay?

Sqaud fam out!! (bye)   
Just keep hearing the fucking numbers! (robotish voice) It's a broadcast, Mason. The numbers are a Broadcast. (robotish voice) You've been brainwashed. THE NUMBERS... THE NUMBERS, MASON... WHAT DO THEY MEAN!? ah..... Let me just explain... what is going on, in case you've been living under a rock. Basically, I am the cause of the "adpocalypse." You may have heard of it. "You know Pewdiepie is actually the cause of the adpocalypse" "Pewdiepie singlehandedly ruined almost all of youtube" That's right. That was me. Okay. I take full responsibility. it's written ther-, I take full responsibility-- That was definitely me putting those ads on those, uh.... Videos. That was me. That was all me. You're right. Uh, sumimasen. The adpocalypse basically leading to a ton of ads pulling out of YouTube, and uhhh... effectively a ton of our videos constantly getting demonetized. constantly the yellow symbol flying across.. the board. You probably heard a ton of creators complain about this already, Just want to make sure we're on the same page. Now recently a lot of youtubers struggling with the de-- the demonetization, have noticed a striking Sss...pattern "...When a video gets demonetized.. it gets a FRACTION of the views. Does anyone else experience this?" (ticking sounds) "Once it's yellow, It is removed from any form of recommendation or trending" (ticking sounds) Even I, noticed this, "I noticed this too, Make sense from a business perspective even though it's dumb as hell." (more ticking sounds) So basically, once the video hits yellow, the views goes "hell"o I mean, bye, they go bye, that's what I've noticed, a lot of people did as well okay, but then YouTube--YouTube reply and be like "Eh, no! That's not the case!" basically saying that the yellow icon alone doesn't impact search and discovery But, if the video is also not suitable for a wider audience, then you might see a poor performance So they're basically saying "if a video gets to demonetized it has nothing to do with lower views okay? But if a video has... ehhhh, Explicit content Then it's not gonna get as many views but your video is demonetized... Because you don't have explicit content." Ehhh, they're saying yes, and no at the same time. It's like tennis. It's a going back and forth. (tennis sounds) we--we aye-- we dodged around the issue." (COD:Black ops) Gah, just keep hearing, the fucking numbers! The numbers! What do they mean? Now something recently, uh, very interesting came to light, Thanks to a study that showed that according to their analysis, YouTube is systematically suppressing content, that have limited monetization or have been completely demonetized. How did they notice this you ask? Through the numbers! (COD:black ops) Focus Mason! We are out of fucking time! The numbers what do they mean? (COD:black ops) Keep hearing the fucking numbers! Just want to point out, This is a Swedish study, So you know 100% how legit it is. Now, YouTube have a hidden variable called "Excluded_Ads" in the source code of all videos with monetization enabled You can access this variable by right-clicking and selecting "view page source" then simply press ctrl F and search for "excluded_ads". If your video is demonetized, It will have one of the following key variables: 102, 104 or 109 (COD: Black Ops) Mason: "Oh my god, the numbers are real!!" Unknown: They've always been real, Mason! Let's go and check this out, let's go to my demonetize section, which I also like to call all my content! *claps* Okay, okay, all right Excluded Ads there we go 46 64 76 89 106 115 keep hearing the fucking numbers Now after noticing these numbers youtubers started to try and figure out, What are the numbers mean? What are they mean? Thanks to the channel "Nerd City" the numbers so far that have been discovered 102: profanity and rough language 104 means sexually suggestive content 109: sensational and shocking 113: tragedy and conflict, 115: sensitive social issues. I don't know, okay. People are still trying to figure it out And if your video got demonetized do help out and share the cause. Butt what the study also discovered was that videos that did get demonetised significantly Got less traction than the videos that were monetized, at least if they have lower viewership So what our research shows is that demonetized videos, especially with lower viewership, are less promoted than monetized videos with the same viewership to a very great extent Such a significant difference can only be caused if YouTube is actively devaluing demonetized videos using some sort of function So videos with lower viewership can't compete against monetized videos But as the views gets higher, more and more videos are able to push through despite with the evaluation Thereby causing the visible pattern in the graph, which otherwise would not exist. so basically, uh videos like mine should technically push through even if they do get demonetized, but if you have a smaller channel, uh GOODBYE. you need some prior knowledge, and if you watched my last video on AI then you will easierly understand this video isn't that great? because, YouTube... the way YouTube runs, its recommendation system and their Demonetization system, is run through an AI a deep neural network, which we know what that is It's a self-taught AI which basically means... it's not YouTube going "hey! do this! okay, huh?" It's a- it's a- it's a- it's a- Entity. if people didn't fear AI before, just think of how much I fear the YouTube recommendation AI There's basic- there-- There's document about this published-ized, and it's actually really interesting I love how advanced this is especially if you go back, because back in the day with--with the-- The reason for an AI to even exist to have recommendation videos is because back in the day on YouTube The only way you would find a video was for searching the title, or the tags Now people started to immediately abuse this by writing the exact same title and the exact same tags as the video. Remember boob girls-- Reply girls- sorry that's their name They would basically show up in the recommended bar for popular videos because they would copy their title and their tags. So people started abusing the system, and it just didn't work anymore and YouTube had to come up with something better So it's really funny to me, How this is, uh...they had-- this "advanced study" on neural networks. It's thanks to boob girls Thank You boob girls now it's really interesting because uh-- A neural network needs a goal an incentive. They work just like human beings, if you know because you watch my video, for example the MarI/O self-taught AI, which was an AI that taught itself how to play Mario, It's incentive which was named in this case, Fitness, Was increased by walking in the right axis. You see the Fitness increases, That's his goal. And then through trial and error Mario improves, and can play the game better. YouTube's recommendation works in the exact same way, or in at least a very similar where It's incentive is based on watch time. The--the AI takes videos that they think will increase the watch time test it on a few people Did it increase watch time? a--if the answer is yes? Throw it--you know, throw it-- here's ah here's the video to everyone because it increases watch time on YouTube This one was demonetised Uh, Most likely uh- go away, ok? and it's a really interesting solution to this problem because if you solely based video recommendation on likes, then, controversial videos wouldn't make it to recommended But at least now we can better understand why demonetized videos doesn't get recommended or why they don't get as many views Becuase recommended is a huge part of our viewership since YouTube has really thrown out the whole subscription idea more and more out the window because their goal is to increase watch time That's what gonna give them better ads and it makes sense I will say Tom Scott did a video about this where he explains how the YouTube algorithm works He explains his thousand times better than I do But I did find it really interesting how he pointed out that the flaw in this AI Which is, that even though its goal is to increase watch time, it can't determine what the quality of the video is, it doesn't know exactly What- what the video is about, what -what does it contain? And that's what it's been trying to do now with the demonetization in picture where--where the AI will scan the video, it will scan the thumbnail, we know there's technology to do this We can use an example here. Here's my thumbnail. It's a person. It's okay It scans the title, it scans the description, the tags, and the caption to determine if the video is monetizable or not, because there's no way YouTube would be able to do this on all its content because An- it- so much is uploaded on YouTube every single day it needs an AI to fully function But I found it really interesting how he points out the flaw in AI. It can't tell the difference between videos that are suitable for children made with education in mind and Creepy trademark, infringing, unofficial efforts it just knows What kids click on and what they watch. so the YouTube algorithm promotes stuff that gets more watch time.. But it doesn't really know what it is It can do its best effort, too, And you can tell this is Something that YouTube had to do last minute because it recently came out what people call Adpocalypse II, and I'm not responsible for this one Thank you. Ads are pulling out now because it was discovered that really creepy and disturbing videos were shown and promoted to millions of kids because it was picked up by the algorithm and promoted to them Tom predicted it, it's kind of interesting there was also a search result, basically when you type in "how to..." it showed up "how to have s*x with your kids" it showed how to have sex with your kids. It's weird. Wasn't this video Educational? Don't we all understand each other a little better? BUT THE NUMBERS?! What do they mean? Only you can tell us what the codes mean. I find it really interesting because this is what happens constantly, Where Youtube can't say what they're doing because if they explain what they're doing people are gonna abuse the algorithm but it also leads to the effect of people discovering numbers and trying to figure out what they mean and they--we have every right to trying to, like this is our job. This is our livelihood We depend on this, having the videos demonetized is a huge deal and especially as we've seen now for smaller channels Obviously we as creators, need to work together to figure out all these things, but at the same time YouTube They need to hide the information from us, but in--inevitably leads to chaos every single time Who wins here? No one. That seems to be a common census in all my videos. Now is a great time if you want to support your creators Buy their merch, support their patron, especially if they are smaller Hopefully the AI will improve that's what they're saying and that's how self taught neural networks work. This has been PewDiePie leave a like and hopefully we can get this to trending if you share, like, and watch the whole thing twice watch it again Again and again, see this is what you really should be telling at the end of the video Hey watch the video again, shithead you going somewhere? Open a new tab and click again!! alright squad fam out. we did it Kyle, we got it (the terminator rises) No!!! NO!!

MEME REVIEW Welcome! Welcome everyone! It's meme review time! Yeah! Hell yeah! That's my favorite show on YouTube! Welcome to Meme Review. It's the show where we explore and review the latest memes, of course, for the importance of history to document-- wHy Is My fOrEhEaD nOt iN tHiS sHoT? A few weeks back on meme review 👏👏 We had a meme called the Tide Pods meme And I'm sure you're familiar with it now, now that it's gotten literally mainstream media attention because people actually ate the Tide Pods. [idiots] You're not supposed to eat the Tide Pods. Oh you're crazy! The joke was that you were wanting to eat them, but you don't eat them. Don't eat the Tide Pods guys. [wtf is wrong with y'all] I'm very serious right now as you can tell on my tone of voice and facial expression don't eat the Tide Pods What are you crazy? Oh my god. You could die! Don't eat Tide Pods you ruined the meme you, ruined the meme. What do you want me to say? Good job. *clap clap* Now that the Tide Pod meme is dead we, though, have a substitute. Don't worry. So, don't be too sad we have [a] substitute meme. And, of course, I am talking about the far superior meme over Tide Pod, which is... ISOPOD meme! That's right! Have you heard of ISOPODS Amazing size: 55 centimeters [22"]. Isopods: what do you know about them? Well, number one They are crust-- crustachaeans, not an insect. [he can't pronounce it] [Google:] Crustacean. They breathe through gills And listen to this... they don't urinate! How crazy is that? *Dude,* These peoples captured an isopod, a giant isopod, befriended the isopod *talking in the background* May I even say, beloved, the isopod [In the video:] *What is it? I have no idea.* *It's like* [queue the Lion King music] *HIS NAME IS BENJI!* What a wonderful name for an isopod. Shh- I sure wish I had an isopod pets Now don't worry these can live on land for a couple hours, and they can literally go years without eating They even brought Benji to Hooters [LOOK AT THE WAITER'S FACE] [Waiter:] *I'm done with you guys* *laughing* *pewds cringing* I know this might seem cruel, but they did return Benji to water. Now of course we don't want to eat.. the isopod, we just want to befriend them. Who doesn't want an isopod friend? I would never say no. If you're an isopod watching right now: (CALL ME) Look how cute they are: tickle tickle. Aw, that's an anime girl and her isopod- -pet that's adorable. Look how much that cat is having a good time with this isopod friend. Oh look, another anime girl with her isopod. I sure am jealous- -for everyone is having an isopod. Here they're having a little tea party. Oh, look how cute, look how happy she- ohh- the- She's happy with her isopod. Isopod also... Can be quite fierce, if they want to. Here's footage of isopods capturing a shark. They protect... But they also attacc. But when its isopod hours, that's when it gets real. Can I get an isopod hours in the chat? [impending ear rape] [told ya] It's isopod hour everybody! Hell yeah! That's really cool. Now I know it's you're wondering: Whe- where do these come from? Well, they are technically bottom dwellers, but I do also think they come from the old game, Halo; on Xbox. *chuckle* *Halo theme playing.* OH I LOVE THEM [hit it from the back bitch and isopod will eat you] The Tide Pod meme was horrible meme that led to a lot of people suffering in pain [no shit] Now I feel like we can do something positive with a pod meme. The isopod meme can really take off and bring happiness and joy on the earth, and give life meaning to some people, as myself for example. I will rate the isopod meme a solid six and uh-- f-- --five. 6 and a 5 everybody. The isopod, 6.6 because they're so damn cute, and I just can't ha- 6.8 and that's final. Isopod, let's see where it goes is it isopod hour yet? It just finished. It just finished *sad* NEXT MEME This meme is blowing up can we get a siren of meme attack? *siren sound* wOaH wOoAh Wow, this meme is about to blow, this meme is everywhere I don't know what this meme is called Basically: having some sort of uhh Giants attacking, versus something very small. Here you have seniors Versus hot freshmen girl. Here you have the boogie man, versus: my foot hanging off the bed. Here you have me Versus: unfinished water bottle by my bed at 3 am. There's also: me, my cousin, and her virginity. *laughs* We have: normies, and this meme in two weeks. Pretty much, pretty much. Minecraft invite from Kevin, versus: me doing homework, on a school night. Wow,  it's hard to resist an invite of Minecraft from Kevin. My uncle after a few drinks, [versus] my 7 year old-- *shout sound* Me, versus: my phone on full brightness at 1:00 a.m. Wow, such power. Me and just... women. Which reminds me, this meme is really just a me respecting women meme, but they just changed it with Giants *ha ha ha* It still works because there's so many video-- There's so many pictures to go from and there's so many 'relatable moments' such as: me, and my pencil that I just dropped Incredible. FBI employee, my laptop's camera. The one to establish a worldwide communist regime in which I am Supreme Leader and take all the funds for the government, Thus everyone is equal in the money They have, but nobody has enough money to form a resistance and plot a government takeover. Versus: my sanity Me Versus: The soda that someone left This meme format, dead memes, Instagram. Pretty much. Kid who works - kid whose dad work for Microsoft, my Xbox live account. You don't want to mess with someone that knows a dad that works for Xbix. My headache, versus, ibuprofen People spamming this meme format my enjoyment of this meme Well, this is a very adaptabilitible [wow poods] meme I don't- it's, it's so, *kiss* fresh that I don't even know its name I'm gonna immediately give it two extra bonus points for being, *kiss* fresh Oh, no the bonus points have been lost, this meme is already dying *autistic screeching* Giving it a five this meme gets a five *clap* *clap* Next meme please thank you, let's move on.

What is happening to this game. It's so different now. Yeah, not here either She's not gonna be in anywhere Either she's here or not here She's missing dagnabbit. How can she be in the machine, but nowhere in the memories unless she's here here system narrow down Eva's most recent position Nanny well, duh frickin Bermuda Triangle Guess it's back to the crime scene Something's up something's definitely up System load up all available recordings from here This video what is this? To the moon tube I'm heading out get ready get the forms ready get the forms ready for a filling wait what? Alright fast forward come on. Where is she where is she? Freaking Court corn cobs how can this one memory link be so hard to find? That idiot sure is taking his sweet time 9:36 p.m.. Wait a minute. Wait a minute what she was to here Fast forward yes, yes, yes few minutes later Are you on a computer? So we don't know what happened in between good. Could you run this record search and fan check for any aviation accidents? I? Just want to rule out the possibility of something out Okay alright a few a few minutes later two minutes later And she's got she's got there. She Neil can you hear me? Hello, are you there? Neil if you can hear me Listen I don't think she's real. She's She's all in his head and something strange is happening Hello, say something I'm giving up on you Goddamn this system glitched out.

What you did it team? Oh? My god that was freaky as hell What dammit visit him in the frickin genre beta that set up birth. Oh my god This game went from zero to 100. What do you want love? We can't leave this is our job calling signup safer has to be here the changes mom Belong here Fine you want to play hardball, let's play freakin hit, babe Again a few trip are we gonna fight? We're gonna fight. Please fight. That's right. Are you gonna be nice now? You may have lost you have may have they host subconsciousness, but I'm still the admin of this world Mother but I never thought I'd have to use this, but you leave me no choice It's 10:00 to show you my true power oh This gesture control interface was a terrible idea Yeah, Oh His transfer man uh Salamone Kauai this name Well the minecraft armor the golden minecraft armor the strongest armor of all Yay Don't forget to helmet Wow incredible This is so ridiculous This is what happened whenever isn't around yeah Eva Jesus If you think I'm going to show mercy you've been sadly mistaken Give up now and I make us ha ha ha old shoes she had the last momento Am she strong she took it back Please leave Oh Dad maybe That's why this is so not what I built that backdoor for I Guess even my code needs testing before practical use And what the heck happened to Eva I need to get to the bottom of this oh Now we're running the book I Can't really she was here wasn't she when something happen What do I do?

Shouldn't y'all made-up beings act in unison of Colin's subconsciousness Maybe even can't I mean save ISA no way so sherry what he want so wait It's the one widow that you tempt him with it's not no surprise that he got lost Hey Sookie do You mean it no what he wants, but don't know what he needs Look you may be part of his mind, but clearly you don't speak for his entirety could it be that you are wrong I Mean no offense, but you aren't much more than that in complete copy of Colin back there in fact I'm not even sure if there's a point in talking to you right now After all you're just an authorial figment of his imagination that never even existed Gonna hit you, but they start any different from what you're here to do Whoa We got all kinds of thing happening even Hey Sorry, I had to head out for a moment there She's all in Cullen's head by the way. Oh, yeah, I'm intermediate intimately familiar with that fact right now But what were you doing you just bail out on me? Oh? Even Oats business I was out administrating cicadas to curb call this brain activity Not sure how his mental process could override us, but it's getting out of hand So that wasn't a Christmas miracle after all It took a while to work out the door such as we still need his brain functioning Seems like it's working though the effects should be sinking in more now Oh Not dog sport Wow just what have you been dealing with over here, don't ask oh? She got zapped a half Batman What the heck is there just some you cold, Roxy sent me She said she saw issues with the Machine earlier and knew we'd be in trouble Wrote a patch in the car while Rob was driving up early. Wow she's not sure if She's really not that dumb. Huh did did she say anything else about the Machine? Aside from you doing a crappy job with the self repairs. No not like there was much time to talk Actually, I'm still not sure I've Colin is stable enough for this to work yet. Oh Huh, I didn't expect her to be locked down for good this soon Did we just catch her as a pokemon. That's amazing you miss it you missed a tire tired calling out quite a bit Well there was a it was hard fun. Yeah But whatever he was good thing this worked my dad. We'd have time Fred We trying I don't I do have some questions for you about this incident, though But those can wait until the case is done The effect of this ladies is temporary we have little time as it is Come on. Let's move on already what we still came Finally This might just be the most hassle. We've ever gone through for a single memory link. Yep seems about right Hmm, what is it? Oh? It's just something? She said earlier Hmm the whole thing was messed up. She did she turned freaky and ghastly on YouTube. Yeah, but that's not what I meant Nevermind, let's just get going in chat later Do we have what's the met meant oh, then I guess this is not exactly a journal after all Sheesh Are they just spreading hibiscus seeds wherever they go there? We go we got one? nice a memory link a Memento. Oh, it's time finally for everyone's favorite 10. Oh, No oh There we go And they don't stop coming and they don't stop coming and they don't stop coming and they don't stop coming I Know exactly what I'm doing? Look at that Genius Strikes again, oh my god Let's go through Bros, Racha chess squad famous What Packing up interative data for a blade selection Data Becker complete Institute - repository What in the world is going on That took a while weren't you right behind me, I just had to clean up some cement I'm inspecting And we never been here before have we Well let's go and see what we find out the vortex of all this I have a guess Well here's another one of these And wonder what's gonna happen? I still don't know maybe Fey is real. I mean she's got to come from somewhere She needs a d-stick that they didn't exactly stick this everything I'm sorry Landing her not like I had much practice on an actual grass strip So do you think this is case of schizophrenia Well with that the patient usually has trouble actively distinguishing delusions from reality But I in this case I get the feeling when he's that. He's actually well aware of it Still can't say for certain, but I'm leaning towards some kind of defense mechanism instead The more curious question is how she's able to materialize so vividly You think she's still able to yes hard to say, but she shouldn't be able to interfere for now at least This seems to be just a normal memory playback Hmm interesting Would you forgive me Haven't you ever heard of the phrase stop and smell the roses? There are flowers in Tiffany Hill tyranny every city They make it she can't just be in His head I don't believe that I Don't want to believe it We're going a werewolf is hunting her Hey, I was thinking it's a little windy today, maybe we should come back some other time instead Damn you we're practically ready Hey remember when we played catch me she came The wind it wasn't there a moment ago So shit's getting windy Okay, what did you marry me? Let's just rest here for a while Begin your braid avoid Timmy steeps hey, I'm the one who has to carry this thing up here. Oh I just said you dad couldn't throwing up. I knew that soon The cello got bigger too, you know look just come and sit here with me for a bit. Will you? Do you remember the first time we came here Reese fritzy The second time I or the second one I guess The one where I tried to race you up to her oh? Yeah, there was a damn moon She should really fit it to take me up there though Yeah It had been a while since I took anyone there It's still one of my favorite places. I've always liked how it overlooked the city It really has been a while hasn't it. I rather miss going there Will mean a sleeps away from their union. Why are you stopping every step along the way? Stop kidding yourself killing You're not tired and it's not the wing We've already came so far you know why well is it as I what we have to do what? Sorry what Why is it so quiet Are they playing Where are they there The first time we came here that Was the first time I accompanied to play the kids stay with me yeah it helped It still does actually We knew we like to break you stay for noon But you can never actually hear whether it was playing kick you why What Oh It's nice up here today you doing with this You don't have to leave anymore I Can fly now Wherever you go, I can go with you It really is two minute chief Don't you think you're getting a bit too old for me to see people? Would laugh for you if they knew They can laugh all they want, I don't care You made me who I am today I learned to fly because of you I kept playing the cello because of you You taught me to practice the scales I Can't teach you anything you don't know nor can I make you do anything you don't want Maybe all you really wanted was for something to be there even If it was this someone like me Who is she I Know it's mesmerizing haircutting But you've been spending so much time with me, and I'm and imagining. What couldn't be Don't you think you're forgetting? What actually is and all that could be? Sometimes stepping in this little world we made It's the only way to new Tizen appreciate all the beautiful things around you I Just don't want to be alone Sure if I go you'll be immune attempts even when did you want to be But that's not a part of growing up and it's not a part of life It's what makes fleeting moments without more inspiration and their memories pictures It's also a tragedy to seek out what you wouldn't find if you just stayed here with me There's a lady right there just waiting for you. I'm sorry the voice. I hate it right now I Can't promise it or let me speak it, but I know you won't find out that you need living only these pages emerged He brought me into this world don't forget II in my thinking same entity same I only meant to carry yourself oh He made me I know you know I will always be there to protect you And whatever comes if it's something we could do then. It's something you could do What do you say curling are you ready? I'm not I Don't know I don't think I'm ready for it to him I Don't care what you are or aren't you? Weren't my first real friend Hey this doesn't have to infer it One day you might look back and realize her face this precious life has passed you by And on that day you come back once more. I'll come back once more We'll talk like how we used to talk and you tell me about your day know about your life You'll tell me about what a happy life you had I? Know the nice memories you've had I might not have such a happy life. You know oh I get it now. You're sick. It's a dannion. You know they have another faith in you save carolling Of course you will I know you will It may take a long time and it may take a lot of work and effort But we met a cremes. I know you'll have lots of happy memories she a Thought missed him How much have you written in that book by now leave replace, it's made you so many times I must talk a lot, sorry birthday But I'm killing perhaps. You could finally spend more a page for anything It's your book. You don't know I have to always write about me anymore It's just like Liferay same book free with our kinds of different pages, and they should be Take care of you tampering hey, I still haven't said goodbye Long long time ago Why sorry can I just finish She never came back did she guess nein And when if she's a connoisseur and effect Mm-hmm Rosie do you think Colin's unhappy because she never came back again If Colin only wanted to see her again adapt she would have needed to call us He would have needed Scott yeah, but perhaps ransom that Ian meant that she was already unhappy he was already unhappy by then back to square one This place is diff stable anything again. We don't have much time left. Let's move we have to make do with what we had Wait do we even know what we're doing with him yet a Few ideas to try but still need to linked a momentous first Let's get back to the overworld and figure things out while we do that all right Uh-oh what the heck wait just a In my own way I will always be there to protect you Yeah, what's taking so long? Shit uh-oh this place forgot pie there's no tank to wheat frame Okay, let me do a quick same uh We're gonna have to end that episode there excuse me I've only been away a few minutes I Was like I? Wonder if it's actually that much left, so I looked up, and I didn't know what's gonna happen or anything But I looked up just to be safe, and it's true I I literally have we have like 20 minutes left, and it would be insane to stop now Even though this episode will be super extra long which I know you of course appreciate oh Okay, we need to connect the links The book to the book the plane to the plane and The Hibiscus to the Hibiscus he doesn't have any viscous so that's not gonna work Okay he's the only I think this is it. Yeah the Hibiscus was to key all along I Am good at this aren't I Maybe I probably just sold the puzzles so much quicker than everyone else, and that's why I thought the play time was different But I'm probably just such a genius that I can't help myself It's late alright I'm saying overtime I Think that's a little bit oh My god oh my god, oh Hell yeah I Just realized I shouldn't have red-faced voice in such a stupid fucking moist Such a such an emotional moment I'm just doing this stupid voice What is this place Hey look at that So I guess Fay was like his fake friend like a pretend friend. I don't know what it's called in English Excuse me call them call them, but when you go through the procedure and live that new life Just hold on to something from here It's not like that for you. I won't forget about you Damn He's I guess he's dying But in the blink of an eye suddenly, there's no more time, and I find myself here, just like everyone else I just want to feel like I've done enough in this world before I go you know That's why we are here calling. Tell us your regrets. What is it you want mr. Fix? We only have so little time in this knife, and we'd never be able to do all that we want no matter what we do There'd always be other things. We'd want to try other paths to take Uh-huh Did I spill it on your dress. Hey, just one more excuse to jump into the lagoon You know we don't have to waste all that lemon juice Have you ever tried riding with it Lemon juice no why ha then prepare to be mind blown by some elementary school magic Get this its invisible ink invisible ink Yep, writing appears in color only when you heat the paper up Come on I'll show you let's write something with it It's been a while since I written It was Fay was like a fictional character for him It's never too late to start again How about a letter to her each other of course we write about this trip It's been kind of a journey hasn't it? And at the end of it we could show each other whoa we wrote over it all Hmmm why was this not part of the memory earlier Why would you even consider Why would you toss aside everything we had for something make-believe. I'm not tossing anything aside We all have regrets Pia driving or a wrong or dream long past a dream land past a Sigmund Court, we give you that second chance to make things right? Because with our help, it's never too late Wait these don't seem to seem like just randomly scattered memories Could it be that the sedated sweating wearing off You are different even from the man you were when I first met you You're no longer aloof. You know when you're here. You're actually here I Know it's mesmerizing here Facebook after a pause Shifting her gaze back up to the sky, but you've been spending so much time with me and imagining. What couldn't be? Don't you think you're forgetting? What actually is and all that could be? Okay look I got it. I got your message you hear me. I know you're still here. You can come and get me now What damn it. I really thought it was her uh Wait is that really the only way yeah? Where did he have you been I Figured it out Eva. I figured out the impossible I mean I took an unholy a man of spoon it took an unholy amount of spoon feeding, but I Guess that's what it takes when you're on the inside of it What are you talking about? Yes Just what are you talking about? The Cydia team if we're off already you don't sound too, happy about it We're here. We're here to help Colin, and you're the mental process. That's in the way Well lucky for you that can be a men now can't it So looks like we're about out of time if you're going to raise me for good. You might as well hurry No, we're not going to no we're not going to erase you We're going to erase us Wait what Colin never needed our service either He already had her The ability to change his reality to live in a different world One that filled the gash for what he wanted all in his head She is what we do even And yet she lent she left, which which could have only meant one thing What are you trying to imply No that can't be right What we do is different from just this how is this different Because there's more to it. There's more to what we do we fulfill wishes we give meaning to people's lives We do it has to be more than just an imaginary friend It's a lot more elaborate for sure but for someone who had to fight just to let go of a fantasy and embrace reality so I can't read maybe our existence were merely an unwelcomed Hekla fire a reminder of the maker belief the imaginary and The endless possibility that make reality seem less than what it is Hey you two things aren't looking good with the patient I don't know what you're up to but you might want to get out of it and I might wanna I mean need to After all that huh I Guess none of this even matters anymore There's no way we'd still have to the time to implement any actual changes. No we might not have the 10 But what about her she? Started linked to the machines interface, right Without us all the procedures would be internalized so much could be done in a fraction of a moment You'd suggest in giving sole control of the machine to a mental process of the patient The ethical implications of that it hasn't been done for good reason It hasn't been done because no patient hadn't had us has had a chance like this besides What's eternity? Just leaving mark this is errata? But what about widow complications in the contract it says oh come on even? When it's a contract stop tests Guys go by I'll be right behind Don't say you need to trust you Are you doing this for us Well if I were calling and on my last breath, I trust you our two strangers in white coats right Strangers, huh? Your colleague was right about one thing There is more to what you do than just playing God with people's memories You've been here for just a day yet in All his lifetime no one has Truly seen the world through his eyes like you have and well your account of the first I've been able to meet - In some silly way maybe that's a part of what Colleen really wished for it was one heck of a meet-and-greet, that's for sure Full admin access granted to unknown root faith You're gonna be alright just a little nervous against well given the circumstances. I'd say that's pretty high rate Hey Judge Keith, don't you think that in some ways I've truly existed Well for what is where I? Think all our memories and everything in it can be nothing, but the fiction we tells our stuff Good luck out there Carl is counting on you I Mean how is she any different from what they were gonna do in his head, right? His blood pressure is dropping vital signs are fading fast. I think it's letting go Goodbye Kali I'm sorry for your loss. Please take all the time you need I'll be in their living room with the paperwork when they're ready. I'll let them know I Can't do the voices now Dr.. Watts always a little stark isn't he? Seeing it like this after just having been in there yeah, and it's what it is. I'm just a little cold If it felt warm in here Well you did back there do you think do you know if it were hard to say I try to dig through the data afterwards but well It's never been done like this before. I don't know how coherent he'll be Guess we got another mess of a report to write We can take care of that when the dust settles In the meantime I just remember something So did you succeed? There was a complication We try to cope with something unorthodox, but I'm not sure if we'll ever know what really happened in those nice moments Hey Sofia said you got a lighter uh yeah Oh of course he brought it in lemon juice I Never stood up very tall a live voice was fairly small But there were times I'd wanna shout though my thoughts weren't sorted out So I'd stumble and I'd fall I learn to fly because of you So if you left I could go to And everything you saw in me That's what I wanted to be Did I make it after all? Oh Is it only greater in my mind I'd still want it. We'll say because trading my yesterday Is to wish my life away As we dream men as we grow we Have to learn to let things go But let the wander never fade Though we've turned ten thousand pages flying higher stop I search for meaning, I'll instead I finally figured that out And all the stories inside me feels like I'm bursting at the seams And you're here after all All the grass on me Is it only green my ID still wanted the same because training my yesterday Is to wish my life away Oh Looking for something old-timer It's been a while, huh? You haven't changed much it as far as that now Jesus Christ I Got a coal or something Can you son-of-a-bitch dammit Yeah It me I don't know where Oh My god I this funeral Yeah Now where were we Is looking sketchy at all not looking sketchy eye on you I asked you to knock not hack my lock Switching to digital was a terrible idea Why don't you just keep both locks on? Dagnabbit rap I don't know why she even got you in both Look we don't have long are you guys still in or not you betcha? So it's this the solution you were talking about Yeah, that's right What Episode 2 finding paradise check Oh The story continues huh oh My god, thank you for being part of it. Thank you for making it god. Damn it All right oh There we go, I'm back I wasn't ready for it Okay, I'm keep writing reviews, and everyone's like. Oh, it's not as good as to the moon. I didn't even cry I'm like okay Well, I didn't cry really doing to the moon so I doubt this will hit me and then Jesus Christ a feeling the feels train just hit me I Wasn't ready at all. I don't know why I I think I Was less mature back then I know that sounds like a fucking hypocrite thing to say it with all the voices and shit I did but I Remember I enjoyed to the moon a lot But I don't know if I it had such an emotional impact on me like the second one bed and I can only explain it for that but Holy cow I'm really good. I play this. I'm really glad I finished that regardless of What Beus were or whatever? This is such an amazing experience, and I'm really glad I got to share it with you guys Please support this game buy it on Steam If you enjoyed it even if you watch me playing I think that that seems pretty fair And yeah, I don't know Thanks to can again, and thanks everyone for watching. I'm gonna go and pretend this last 10 minutes never happened because bro fist

If there's one thing that makes me really angry. *swedish inner hulk* It just makes my blood just wanna go and... *Grunt* I just wanna scream! *hulk gasm* it's cheaters I don't--I don't like em I don't like em *unknown gibberish* I don't like cheaters *more hulk gasm* But no one dislikes cheaters As much as Epic games. I thank you Epic games For your noble deeds. You may have heard the story. "Epic games is suing a 14-year old for cheating in Fortnite, and his mother is fighting back". Hell yeah. Epic games. This is Epic games, and this is haters, Sue you. I'm gonna sue you. Suing you left and right That's great that there's Epic games is suing this 14 year old and all but do they know? Have they confirmed if it's Clara or not? HAAAA Wait what the fuck? Clara! Hold on Clara. Give me one second Clara! Let me just message this girl. Give me one second. Why the f*ck is this on my computer right now? Where is this? How do I close this? Yo rock I need some help because I don't know what I'm looking at right now What the f*ck is that? Hello? I bet it was Clara. That son of a sneaky, sneaky snake. That sneaky snake. Clara always coming in with her cheats. Now. If you haven't played Fortnite. It's a battle royale, uh, type of game good old fun. And, uh, people like to cheat in it. T-E-M-P-Z Ghost Yeah, dude. Yo he just stopped and medded and literally now there's a fight right in front of him that he--there's no vision of whatsoever Yep instant headshot again Anoth--And he just shot at somebody that you couldn't even see. Uh, Yep another one, another one, yeah, he's a hundred percent fucking cheating. Oh my god. I'm fucking recording this shit. Is that Clara? that's cl--that's--that's--I think that's Clara now don't get me wrong I-I-I Don't understand why you would cheat? and that's not me making some. I don't understand how someone could possibly cheat in the game It's more like How fun is it to? Just watch the computer play the game for you, like you're not playing the game if you're cheating in a first-person shooter And you're being an asshole, okay, you're being an ass so stop cheating. That's right. Family fr-- nice guy PewDiePie telling you here, right as it is now don't cheat in video games. Cheating is a huge problem for fortnite and, uh So what does epic games the creator of fortnite do? they make a statement. They made a statement on their website saying that they're gonna strike down on these cheaters. They're gonna. They're gonna They're gonna get them. They didn't say how though They said "We don't want to give too many clues about what we're doing but we're going to roll out tools" epic games just going like Hehehe ehhh, we're not--we're not gonna give too many clues, how we're gonna stop these cheaters but, ahhh, we got--we have some ideas about a week later, it comes out that Epic sues Fortnight cheaters for copyright infringement It seems a bit weird to sue someone cheating for copyright infringement like that's how they strike down on them But apparently I might be wrong I don't really understand the whole coding bit, but they're (the cheaters) changing the coding Which they don't own the copyright to and they're not allowed to do that so that's copyright infringement I don't...I don't how do you mod then? what's--what's modding then? is modding illegal? Uh, in their legal document though, they They wrote, "cheats give a cheater power to do or see things that other players cannot for instance a cheat might enable a cheater to see through solid objects, teleport, or make moves other players cannot, such as a spin followed by an instant headshot to another player". I'd never thought I'd see a 360 no-scope being described in legal terms well done, Epic games Literally any online game will lose players if it gets infested by cheaters It's statistically proven every time that cheaters drive players away and for good reasons No one likes to play with the cheater It's--it's not fun their approach to this was to sue these players to stop people from cheating people are saying they're making an example out of these people both defendants face up to $150,000 statutory damages for copyright infringement Now I've seen arguments on both side of this saying This is ridiculous Even by game publisher standards ban the offenders and move on if your game is easily broken it's on you but then I have the other side of people saying Good. You know, we don't like cheaters. They're ruining the game I'm glad they are striking down on them. It's a very Divided topic and that's what we discuss here on the PewDiePie channel the thing though that this comment, eh Isn't taken into account is that Fortnite is a free-to-play game You can't just ban the player They're just gonna make a new an account and that's what was happening with one of the cheaters is that they made new accounts over and over and over and That's why they finally decided okay. We need to stop these guys Now then it came out through a document sent by the mother of one of the cheaters that he is 14 year old there was a plea sent to the jer- uh- judge from the mother who... People speculate as a lawyer, and she makes a pretty good case against Epic Games actually she basically states that Fortnite needs a legal parents consent for minors And that she never gave this consent epic games also claimed that they lost profit because of cheaters and that they are to blame for that But she's saying there's no way you can actually prove that She says that it's wrong for them to go against the players instead of the websites distributing the cheats and she's also pointing out that her son's name publicly was mad--was made public and that's against Delaware laws, so she makes a pretty good point. Atatatata so you might think okay Well Epic Games, you know they overreacted they-- $150,000 that's just stupid. Okay. It's a fourteen-year-old kid, but you go to the... The fourteen-year-old's channel And it has quality-quality content such as "GTA V MOD TROLLING (FT RAPIST)" Quality just the finest there's him cheating in GTA 5 I pressed y and I flew out of the car and smoothed across the ground into the bush alright, alright, say whatever you want he's not even back Alright. Yeah. We officially proved that you're the hacker man How to mod COD BlackOps on Xbox. storage and then a hover over-- All right now once you booted up the...you guys wanna click on the new authors And he also made a response video to the lawsuit which is It's hard to empathize with the guy. Yo, what's going on guys, Sky Orbit here in this video guys This isn't a modding video, so this is just gonna be talking about my a lawsuit with epic games, so yeah, uh, Let's get started alright So what happened was I was basically cheating and uh... The game Fortnite, and I'm pretty sure all of you know this really good that he just admitted it Well done! You know I downloaded a sheet from the internet unknown cheats taught me-- He promotes the cheating website... *inner facepalm* fucking hell, this guy's an idiot Well Fortnite cheats are fucking everywhere you can get them from any place, anytime, anywhere now in this lawsuit, Epic games is basically Saying that I coded a cheat and I was selling it and I admitted to me making the cheat Which I never made that cheat I never coded the cheat I never sold the cheat It was free to public. you could actually get it on unknowncheats.me If you guys know that website is it's basically just downloading hacks. It's a free hack You can get it from anywhere. So basically he was streaming himself cheating showing that he was cheating telling players Where to download the cheat and how they can cheat as well. Pretty scumbag thing to do Epic's response to this was basically "Epic is not okay with ongoing cheating or copyright infringement from anyone at any age." I don't really understand How its copyright infringement eh... Feel free to educate me on that there was another legal document filed From Epic Games where they quote the cheaters saying uh... "New (Now) method is exposed 
Epic Eat my ass." Defendant posted in... Defendant posted his Circumvention method to the cheat providers discussion channel so that other cheaters could use it and bragged "Now method is exposed." "Epic eat my ass." Also one of the other cheaters is a moderator and member of... addictedcheats.net so it doesn't look great for the kid it really doesn't I don't think he deserves it When..eh...I think when you're 14 you do a lot of dumb shit and downloading a cheat and having your parents having to pay $150,000 that doesn't really seem fair to me Even if you want to set an example... I cheated when I was a kid at games I cheated in tibia where basically the game would play itself But that felt like I'm-- I'm cheating the the game not other players you could argue that it was but it's different to me in a first-person game Cuz you're ruining the game for cheating it. I don't understand why you would but kids like to do it uh, but I can't say that I don't understand, why kids don't do it kids are stupid I think epic is uh- doing the right thing to strike down on cheaters. I absolutely do but at the same time I don't think this is gonna stop cheaters. Strike down on the websites distributing the cheats focus on having counter measurement to the cheats. I'm sure they've already working on that But... They own the engine it shouldn't be impossible to figure some system out. There's always gonna be cheaters But this just seems like a whole mess to me And the kind of case where just everyone loses The kids parents are gonna lose money and time and effort and epic games are gonna lose some of their PR at the end of the day no one likes a cheater. I don't like cheaters either Don't cheat because cheating is bad You heard it here first What do you think? Leave a comment down below. Who is right? Epic Games? 14 year old kid? Let me know in the comments and as always... Don't cheat because your... No Just don't do it Leave a like. *thumbs up* 
"yOUTUBE TOUGHENS ADVERT PAYMENT RULES" *HEAVY BREATHING* *le angry pewds* oH tHIS IS IT, YOUTUBE! Now you've made me really mad! I'm so angry *SLAP* I challenge you to BATTLE! *Dragon Ball Super: YouTube Black Arc* This announcement was trending on Twitter: "#YouTubePartnerProgram" Youtubers were tweeting about it having; different opinions about it Controversial... but the problem here is that They're all wrong. They're all wrong. I am the only one that is correct and if you don't know what I'm talking about, let me just explain what that-- what is happening. Basically, YouTube came out and said that SURPRISE! if you don't have 4,000 hours of watch time AND a thousand subscribers *devil voice* THEN YOU MEAN NOTHING TO US! They-- They didn't exactly say that. To be fair that's not what they said.. But basically that was it. I like how they added at the end of the statement: "One of YouTube's core values is to provide anyone the opportunity to earn money from a thriving channel." Well, now you're kind of saying one thing and doing the other. You can't do that. Now, my personal reaction to this, was-- the first instinct was: "Okay, so?" "Logan Paul filmed a dead body?" "And smaller channels have to suffer" Uhhh... how does that make any sense? It almost sounds a bit similar to the Adpocalypse, where Youtube said that "Youtube would no longer allow creators to make money until they reach 10,000 views." Big creator messes up, small channels suffer. I am so sorry about the adpocalypse, by the way, in case I haven't apologized, okay? That was definitely me that put those advertisements On those military, ISIS, racist videos, okay? I'm sorry about that. I feel really bad about it. :c Basically the reason why Youtube did this is because they said Phrasing: "It's been clear over the last few months that we need the right requirements and better signals to identify channels that have earned the right to run ads." So basically, adding the bar to 10,000 views is not enough for YouTube to make sure that ads don't appear on Videos that they don't want it to. And ah, you know, I gotta give YouTube props for always, always Anytime they announce anything it's always such a mess. No one really knows what's going on and it leads people to be confused and angry and, uh It's just the same thing every time. People are saying that so now If i'm not in the partnership program  anymore, does that mean my videos aren't gonna get recommended? Because they're Not earning revenue which each of us said No, to before but it's, still kind of like, "Uhh.. Is that really true?" Everyone seemed to notice it differently. People asking like, oh, okay, so now I'm not in the partnership program anymore.. uh but what about promotion? And I can't schedule uploads, and losing all these benefits. What is that gonna mean for me and why isn't that just a standard for anyone on Youtube, really. And also, people who are not in the partnership program anymore is asking like Hey, am I even gonna get paid? I know it's not a lot of money but am I gonna get it or not? like probably you are, but the fact that these questions aren't answered it's always such a mess and it's always so unnecessary. A plus for Youtube for always Communicating so well. Usually, I find that Youtube isn't half as evil as it seems to be. Doing these things, it's just they can't seem to communicate. What it is they're actually doing. And then, All these- All these- outrage comes in and- Then they just pull back even more. Now- we have youtubers, like, KEEMSTAR,  *roll the clip*
KEEM: So now everyone's asking me, well what advice you have for small youtubers? KEEM: QUIT. You cannot make it in this game anymore. Alright? You're not going to make it. KEEM: There is way too much competition. Technically he's not wrong it's tough as hell to be a youtuber these days. But the thing is, it's always been hard. Youtube, right now, really pushes for watch time. Unless you upload regularly. And long videos you are gonna suffer. And I think this is the real issue here. This is what you should be pissed off about. That put a lot effort and a- Really good channels don't get as much exposure as they might deserve because- They don't fit in this quota. And it's always been like this. Channels come and go on YouTube because they- Maybe fit what the algorithm of YouTube wants and it's always there's been a wave of people coming- and going. And that may not deserve it or not because of this. Youtube has never turned a profit. EVER. Since they they've done it. And I think they're really trying to change that. But if anything has shown- That youtube is not a sustainable business model- Atleast no one's done it right yet. And that's why there's no competition to YouTube just because it's so hard to figure out. Even If you have some- Youtube being so extremely successful with its creator. IT'S STILL NOT PROFIT. YouTube said, that he *they*, would maally-manually review all relevant content- By the end of march. Because of this Logan Paul  thing. They said that they're- Gonna have more than ten thousand workers reviewing clips by the end of 2018. Uhh... That's a lot of workers to review videos. Now here's my, my, main point with this is this tweet that i saw actually, yesterday. "Hahaha, my sister used to upload littlest petshop videos on youtube when she was nine and she accidentally enabled ad? revenue, which checked her adsense account Yesterday and she made 1,500 bucks turn up like that's, awesome i'm not, gonna hit on that i don't really have an Issue with it this is what you took trying to prevent with this there's only so many ads on youtube? It's not an infinite amount. You may be watching my channel sometimes and there's no, ads on it and uh, That might be because there was not enough, ads to go around it happens all the time that you watch a video Ads might be enabled but they don't show Up, because there's not enough to go around and i personally think that stopping channels that are Coming out of nowhere just to upload other people's contents, like movies and tv shows And that stuff cutting, off those people from making revenue and taking, away Ads from channels that are actually Dedicated and uploading videos it makes sense to me a lot of people get really pissed because of the 4,000 hours thing and i understand that that's frustrating but. People, did the math and essentially it comes down to like four dollars four bucks A month or something like and if you arguing, about that amount then, maybe you should, ask, yourself, why are you Making youtube videos it's always been hard to be a small channel always Back in the day, youtube used to have a, manual partnership program Where you'd have to apply and hopefully make it in and i trust me you needed more than a thousand subscribers to get into that If anything it's clearly been too easy to put ads on your channel and for bucks that doesn't seem like You're, looking at the bigger picture you're complaining, about that personally i didn't make, any revenue of youtube after making videos for a Whole year even more i think i had like twenty five thousand subscribers and youtube wouldn't touch my, channel they wouldn't partner it and it was extremely frustrating because i felt like i had i had the chance to finally push in and make it into a living but i Couldn't but it was way beyond four dollars? I understand that it's tough as hell to get to a thousand subscribers and i remember that seemed singing possible But if you're looking at it as a way to you should earn revenue before that so you can get a Few dollars that doesn't to me doesn't really, justify the the end goal that they're trying to Do here blocking out people from uploading Bad content to youtube or perhaps creating another, media system the only way i could earn, revenue back in the day Was to sign up with a network youtube wouldn't touch gaming channels and i only? Did gaming channel back then and so many youtubers not just, me but just got royally screwed over by networks Taking, what like half of their revenue and giving, what back people don't talk, about that but four dollars Oh, no like, yes it's it's hard as hell to be a small channel i know that but it sure as, hell Wasn't easier, back in the day i think it's great that youtube is partnering Channels now and this is what they have to do to make it happen And it seems just fair to me even though it might seem hard it's good a lot of people saying Well it's motivating maybe getting a little bit of revenue and seeing that you are earning something i agree but The ends doesn't justify the Means and at the end of the day i think it's sort of a healthy approach that maybe you shouldn't be earning Revenue the very first thing Maybe that should be a goal maybe you should be incentivized to work on your subscribers and building an audience first instead of earning revenue first i Understand that there's more things to it but to me Youtube is like a runner the fastest runner alive and then someone just tied his shoes together and he fell and now he's retarded I stole that joke from brad but it's, so true since there's no competition to youtube i think it's very important that when Bad things happen or when they, do bad things that we do? Stand up against them i think it's important that, we are united as a community but i also feel like This is not that big a, deal Save your energy, and save your outrage for something more important that will have a bigger Effect on the platform and I hope that smaller channels don't get discouraged by this. Keep working hard, I know it sucks, it's always sucked. Uh, I do see new channels try and it and it isn't impossible anyway i've been going on for too long and that's just my thought about it. What do you think -  is YouTube screwing over its creators? Here's a poll (pole it's a joke thanks pewds) And that's it for me for now, goodbye 
There's a disease spreading through are you, a disease plaguing pathetic b e t a males people attempting self-worth through a video game ukhhhhhh I am pewdiepie And this is speedrunning *screams* *more screaming* stop it uh Speedrunning, the concept of playing a game slightly faster than someone else, excuse me, playing a game that no one else is playing slightly faster than no one e l s e *high pitched voice*

YouTube's favorite show, yes welcome welcome and finally *claps* Finally I can learn about memes from PewDiePie who.. What have I been doing with my life until now.. 
I know don't worry. It's going to be ok you are in safe hands. I'm going to tell you all about the memes Let's just not waste any more time and let's get into the memes *claps* Please please Felix, tell me, what memes have you selected this week on Meme Review©. I need to know what meme *claps* *demonic pewds* *To Be Continued* *Right now* Well the first meme is of course Savage Patrick, it's a spongebob meme which some *mumble* immediately makes me wanna gag and Poke my eyes out, but it is actually quite good It's a solid spongebob meme Yes, when you secretly on birth control, and you ask him for Plan B money Savage Patrick My god this meme actually started as a women's movement meme for women to feel like they are also Savage because they are whamen can be Savage yessuh when he giving you head start telling you how good you taste? When he really he's tasting another man nut Savage Patrick oh, I am so pleased that finally women have a meme that they can enjoy and be all like they're Relatable and such I'm all for the women's meme movement there's just not enough women in the meme community scene and it makes me so proud and I Really cannot speak loudly enough for them When you're riding his face and you pee a little this is actually disgusting ok I can no longer approve of this meme. When you clapping shit from the back and her wig fall off so you put it on wait Absolute savage, my god. This meme plays of course on the absolute Mad Lad meme But let's be real here, any meme really just spawns on another meme they're all just the same memes balled together in different disguises When you're getting a prostate exam But your doctor doesn't know it's opposite day Wow Pewdiepie: *snot  comes out nose* edit this out Please brad and brad #2 Brad and Brad number two great great. I'm sure they'll appreciate that one great I can almost see what this one says that that look when someone is tryin to roast you and you about to end his whole life in one sentence Absolute savage Patrick. When she's 13, but you got the stiffy, Uh? Great it's not just savage Patrick It's more like, taking advantage Patrick I would debate It's probably more suiting name. When the sex is trash, so you spit on her back and act like you nutted, so you can dip(?) clearly This is a meme with an intellectual seal of approval. When you drink water that's free Savage Patrick. My god! How far can they take this meme you might say. Oh no When people say my 3d artwork is ugly, creepy and disgusting, but that was the plan all along oh my god Who made, Who made this crying face crying face crying face emoji that is disgusting, despicable! And I'm also Quite aroused. I would let that Patrick Savage me if you know what I mean. Me making plans in the group chat Knowing I'm not gonna show up anyway How relatable and joyous wow this meme is already shit, and it has barely even gotten started $399 everybody Excellent I think this one is actually my favorite. Me leaving the pot in the sink because it needs to soak Why is his eyebrows two M characters? Let's rate this meme everybody first of all it's a spongebob meme So we get to plus, nothing, because it's a garbage. That's right It's trash. iT bElOnGs iN tHe TrAsH gUyS. Second of all it gets one patrick Star. That's all it gets *claps* Next meme everybody, next meme Fortnite memes the best finest of all somehow Fortnite is now the most watched and streamed game on twitch reaching twice as many viewers as PUBG PUBG the game that started it all But then this roblox ass looking game came out of nowhere and said hey we're free You can play play us please and thus creating By its popularity a lot a lot of memes . Some of them starting off with the theme of romance Romans isn't dead i'm hiding in a bush to text you back in fortnight. Well real epic gamer dudes like myself Alright, we wouldn't boast about such such such acts okay We will just do it like it was an any day sort of deed alright I wouldn't boast about me giving flowers to my girlfriend I just do it because I'm a gentleman and I wouldn't tell people oh yes I am hiding it in a shack right now. Just so I can text you back, baby I would be too good to even have to do that. I'm sending you this text in a bush Stop crying face crying face crying face crying face crying face crying face That is absolutely hilarious, and the funniest thing I might have seen in my entire life Somehow the theme between fortnight and relationships continues. Her: He's probably thinking about another woman Him: But I shot him with a pump shotgun from close range And it only did seven damage this meme is stolen and we already reviewed it! Somehow the relationship meme in fortnite continues Find a girl who supports your fortnight goals I hate fortnite! Baby, you can do this Look at your mistakes analyse them fix them dominate Solo, oh my god, baby. I'm so proud of you sometimes I think that Stalin was right, not about the gulags, but of course about people playing fortnight As a father. It's my job to respect my son's opinion. UM.. Dad? Yes, my dear son? PUBG Is better than fortnite What is this? what is this huh? wHaT iS tHis? Are you trying to pretend that it's somehow the better opinion to prefer fortnite over PUBG That's like saying Roblox is better than Minecraft That's like saying Hunger Games, is Better than Harry Potter you just cannot do that you just can't say those things Hey kid, you should play fortnite. No Thanks. I'm already gay Gunshots fortnite people, if you get shot in PUBG. You gotta take it like a man and realise ptchung gotcha in fortnite you just have to build and then, I can't, I-I  never played the game actually I don't know what happens I guess you build stuff in the game? when Trump plays fortnite for the first time and sees that you can build walls wow It made a rebounce everybody look at that when ya boy is crying because his girl dumped him And you realized he has more time to spend with you and fortnite. Oh look how cute PUBG is better than fortnight oh, no, it's retar- no!

You are playing a kids game You realize that with kids cartoons. this male just played fortnite, at the moment he stands no chance of mating That's right. If you are playing fortnite you are a pathetic beta male that needs to just stop You might as well be speedrunning Hello Kitty Island Adventure Because that's about as pathetic as you are PUBG versus fortnite. That's right solid evidence I got solid proof here that real men plays PUBG And little whiny roblox minecraft kids play fortnite. It has been proven. Hey It's the PUBG Bros Mama, why-a you never remember my name? I am-a sorry free to play PUBG. Oh absolute savage Whoa, the fortnite memes gets of course a nine out of Six Do we have time for bonus me let's investigate Sorry we didn't have time for bonus meme, perhaps next time you will be more lucky

Okay, there seems to - oh wait There's a new attacker, clearly. Wreckin'. Oh, oh this is gonna be bad. Fuck. It's fine. You know what, it's fine. I see - I see what I must do, okay? I must launch myself up there, Which is easy. This is easy. Could the gameplay be a little easier, please? I mean harder. You know - EEE oh There it is, you've got to keep the momentum going, clearly. You gotta pop until you don't stop, And if you don't stop Then you ain't pop.

Doki Doki Oh welcome back to Doki Doki literature club we are on day four in the game day three in real life director yuri is still the best girl but you know i'm getting more than more charmed by these other wonderful women what am i saying this is the part where everyone is like now the game gets really messed up Poots it's been really hard to avoid spoilers i here's another thing people want me to play with the game files open everyone is telling me hey you have to do you have to play with the game files open otherwise you're missing a lot I'm gonna do that just I'm gonna keep it in my peripheral I got pretty good peripherals don't you worry but yeah let's just keep playing and our last save was Monday 13:36 it's time for us to write another poem where's my goddamn steam library there you are steam apps common doki-doki there we go alright I'll keep it in there and keep an eye on it death oh she likes theft so you have to pick what what they like maybe we should try in romance and Matt Sookie okay well I guess oh wow I am terrible what Natsuki sorry Erie [Music] who likes philosophy that's her any like clumsy oh she's clumsy of course in intellectual that's her um dark that's her what tenacious that's her I remember that unrequited not get Jim of course that's her damn the music's kid crimson that's her I remember that melancholy utter horror that's her OOP no there we go we did it we done deadly doodlee batted oh man oh man I'm the way no way that's not her voice I'm the last one here again Monica is such a thought don't worry I just walked into where were you practicing piano again yeah sorry ah ha ha ha you must have a lot of determination starting this club and now picking up piano well maybe not determination but I guess passion remember that the club wouldn't be here if it wasn't for all of you and I'm super happy that you're all willing to help out for the festival too I can't wait for the festival it's gonna be great sorry I mixed up nuts against a hurry before uh hey weren't you complaining about it yesterday Natsuki well yeah I'm not talking about our part in the festival but it's a whole day of school where we get to play neat all kinds of delicious food you sound a bit like sorry all the sudden Monica do they usually have fried squid squid that's a pretty specific thing to look forward to oh come on are you saying you don't like squid you animal people what is this conversation hey I didn't say I didn't like it besides what do you mean by you of all people because it's right in your name mom I think ek is squid in Japanese am I wrong am I wrong I'm wrong hey hey hey Monica that's not how you say my name at all also that joke make no sense in translation ah nevermind let's just focus on our own event for now okay fine fine your reactions aren't so as far as you recent say or eise anyway she likes to provoke as opposed excuse me where is Sayuri anyway oh there you are Sayuri is sitting at a desk in the corner room looking down at nothing I walk over to her hey Suri I waved my hand in front of her face hey you're spacing out again to me me you can go talk to any with ease huh is everything all right okay wait wouldn't it be it just feels like you're a little off sorry for assuming same things you worry too much you paid me insane sorry shows me a big smile don't break different having fun with every week well alright if you say so I worriedly glance at say re before turning back towards everyone else but the conversation has already dispersed with everyone back at their usual activities maybe I should ask Monica if she's notice anything about saiary recently since they've been preparing for the festival they must be spending a lot of time together i timidly approached Monica who is shuffling through some papers at her desk pizza pie what's up hey this might sound a little strange but have you noticed that anything would say ori lately anything up with her in what way do you mean maybe I'm reading into it a little too much but she seemed a bit downcast today oh you think so I can't say I noticed anything about her Monica appears across the room at Sai or E who is idly dragging a rubber eraser up and down her desk doesn't seem like Sayuri to me maybe there's something on her mind but I'm surprised I'm not the one asking you kids pay you certainly know a lot better than I do yeah but she's never really liked this she always talked to me about things that bother her but this time when I asked her she was really dismissive sorry I know it's not your problem I just wanted to ask if you know anything so I'll drop it now no no it's important to me too I mean I'm also friends with her I also care about the well-being of my club members you know she sounds like such a robot maybe I'll try talking to her myself are you sure about that she seemed like she wanted to be left alone are you sure maybe she's just having a hard time bringing it up with a person of interest person of interest what do you mean by that I'm saying that maybe the thing on her mind is you Peter Pan [Music] what me how on earth could you come to that conclusion well I probably shouldn't say too much but she already talks about you more than any anything else you know hey hey she's been so much happier ever since you joined the club it's like an extra light but it was turned on inside her what no way Saira is always like thing she's always been full of sunshine it's not any different now than I was always been you're so funny pizza pie have you thought that maybe you always seen her as so cheerful because that's just how she is when she's around you ah I said too much I'm sorry what do I know anyway I didn't mean to jump to the conclusion so just forget about what I said I'll try and talk to her so try not to think about it for now Hey all right Monica smiles meaningfully I know she I know she said to forget about it but I already know that I won't be able to get at her words out of my head Monica sends up from there her desk and walks across the room to where Sayuri is sitting i watch her kneeled down next to Saori and gently talk to her but she she's keeping her voice so quiet that I can't hear from here I sigh and sit myself down I notice I already told me not to worry about her and to have fun with everything else everyone else but that's impossible to do when she's behaving like this exactly how much do I care about her that I'm letting this weigh me down so much now it feels like I'm the one behaving out of ordinary but there's nothing I can do besides wait for Monica why does it feel like I'm being watched I glanced around the room suddenly I notice you're appearing at me from her book what is going on here but she looks away just as quickly with a flustered look on her face I realized that she won't get anywhere like this I never really seen you RIA proach anyone or to start a conversation on her own accord so I have no choice but to approach her myself by now it's a little easier for me to do that I stand up from my desk and I sit in one one next to her room her own I guess it's because we roll my story we get to I didn't mean to bother you or anything relax you didn't even do anything but I could tell up what happened oh you can hide there I could tell that you wanted to be alone with your thoughts alone with my thoughts my thoughts how were you able to tell that I was thinking like that well it's something that I do a lot so it wasn't hard for me to spot based on your posture and expression and not that I was staring or anything I didn't do anything creepy like that in any case you were right I'm sorry if I cost you any concern don't apologize your troubles are only the concern of those who willingly shared in that concern of course there are certainly those who find the most comfort in keeping to ourselves but if you would prefer to share what's on your mind then I would be glad to listen it's really not that big of a deal I was just feeling a bit uneasy by saiary Sayuri yeah she seems a little off today but when I asked her about it she didn't want to admit it to you to me Wow the drama that tension the action are you keeping up with this my god so I can't help but wonder if something happened to her I'm checking the game files nothing has changed as far as I can tell oh that's quite romantic hey Sammy mess say I didn't mean to say anything stupid back na it's not it's not that just what you do I didn't want you to misunderstand Sierra and I have been friends for a long time that's all I see we are just friends then perhaps it's unusual for her to be dismissive to you about her feelings or she gets it or maybe I'm just reading into it a little too much pizza pie the world is full of meaning often hidden deep beneath plain sight and there are many untold mysteries behind every person no matter how well you may know them ah so you think that there might be something behind this after all mm-hmm I think that saiary is a very complex person her mannerism on the outside don't always match what's going on inside her head and she may not always know what she wants I noticed her strange behavior today - I also feel some consent for her but in any case it looked like she was fully occupying your thoughts wasn't she well I guess that was the case saiary she really means a lot to You doesn't she i [Applause] hagas but you don't need to put it that way we're just good friends that's all hmm you're a son who looks deeply into my eyes her expression is gentle and curious as if she was searching for something embarrassed I avert my gaze begun thought sometimes a person's mysteries are untold even to themselves and you as someone honest and caring may uncover feelings you weren't aware were in you that is I think that she would be a very fortunate person to have you feel that way about her could this whamon be a little more into us my god Yuri you've given me too much credit I'm a pretty simple guy so I think I'm pretty good at understanding my own feelings I'm not nearly as sophisticated as you ah that's not a compliment is it that's what it is anyway as long as we're here why don't we do some reading well as long as you're okay with it yeah it should it should be I should be taking my mind off this whole thing anyway we don't know why don't we go ahead and get started yes let's actually I have a request do you mind if I make some tea first not at all baby thank you very much if there's one thing that can make my reading time here any better it's a nice cup of tea not to mention for yourself as well Yury stands up and makes her way to the closet I follow and watch her ass as she'd retreat wait what I should be to a small water pitcher from the shelf the kind with a filter inside can you hold this for a second sure Yuriy hands me the water pitcher and also fetches an electric kettle I'm going to plug this in at the teacher desk and then we'll go get some water she walks past me and sets the Cal down on the teacher desk I simply watch her movements simply simply to my surprise the way she moves really contrasts their speaking mannerism especially because of her long legs URI appears elegant and a methodical okay may I have the water pitcher Thanks I'll be right back I might as well walk with you yeah why not shall we go then yeah hmm where are you two off to uh don't cut me right now we're just we're just going to make some tea so I suddenly realize how weird it sounds to explain this to Monica we're we're just we're just filling the water pitcher oh okay sorry I was just a bit curious that's kind of a one-person job isn't it big and thought that's Monica please mind your own business for once or do you want me to tell me that there's something wrong with helping involved Paige Spain's club activities hey my mouth gapes I I suppose there's nothing wrong with that then let's go pizza pie uh yes you're pretty quick Lex is the room and I follow once in the hallway she suddenly puts her forehead against the wall I spoke without thinking how could I say something like that Yuri I just something about the way she'd said that it made me feel so irritated what's wrong with me no Yuri I think you did the right thing I wasn't expecting it but it's also not right for Monica to judge people like that eep-eep how come even when I do something bad you're being so nice to me because nothing that you do is just bad as you make it seem in her head nobody's perfect we have emotions we can't always hide behind them and may way fuck I can't read but you always amplify things in your head your mind turns a light rain shower into a hurricane No wouldn't you hate me for something as terrible as that why would I hate you I can't hate someone for having emotions what kind of friend would do that friend you say jury lifts her head PTP I really like being friends with you thanks Yuri I like being friends with you too I feel kind of awkward saying something like that but I'm doing my best to help you refill better anyway ah yeah shall we go yeah Yura and I walk to the nearest water phone once we fill up the water pitcher we return to the classroom [Music] pizza pie do you like long tea uh yeah anything is fine hey when you read sets the temperature on the kettle to 200 degrees that must be Fahrenheit [Music] water can't boil to 200 degrees it turns into gas now it's time to get the teapot you really oh yeah I read that like you really do this properly don't you of course I shouldn't do any less when I'm making tea for others even if I'm not an expert on tea or anything uh-huh in that case you'll only be even more impressed is she trying to impress me with tea ah perhaps I will Yuri fetches the teapot and begins measuring the tea leaves to my surprise she even starts humming a little to herself you must be in a good mood now he said so I was letting it show and you noticed I was doing a bit of thinking and he decided that I would try expressing myself a little bit more that is so weird it turns out it's not very hard for me to do when it's you who is around anyway ah that's great Yuri just don't push yourself too much you're always worrying about me P to pay it's very endearing that's Yuri wasn't kidding I don't even know if I can keep up with this i watch your i watch your rapport a cup of tea for each of us pizza pie I have another request do you mind if we sit on the floor today what why sy it's a little easier in my back you know I have such large tea I can read with my back against the wall rather than bending over at my desk oh sorry I didn't realize no worries I just had back pain fairly regularly so I do my best to manage it is that so I wonder why that is it's most likely because my ah my your posture right always hunched over like that while reading yes I have terrible reading posture that's why we were we should sit on the floor fair enough I'll go ahead and get the book I'll retrieve the book from my bag ah I have some chocolate as well it's this bag of small chocolate candies that I kept hidden from so you're a scanner reader I take it since it'll go well with the tea your and I sit against the wall tea cups at our sides as if in sync we assume the same reading position as last time each holding one half of the book except this time our bodies are even closer to each other I can't see too well Yuri slides closer until our shoulders are touching how am I supposed to focus on reading like this Yuri was always kind of cute but when she's being less apprehensive it's almost more than I can handle your tea cap Yuri hands me my tea cup holding it with my hand that's not holding the book I in a position that makes it even harder to focus what is this position huh because now I need to worry about making sure I don't accidentally touch her tracks meanwhile URI hasn't heard is a single thing she where just her intense reading expression and I can only presume the world around her has faded away I use all of my willpower to focus on reading after a few minutes I manage to relax a little I put the tea cup between my legs and fumble with a chocolate wrapper ah sorry I briefly let go of the book to finish opening the wrapper you can have as much to see one ah that's that's okay I won't take any are you sure well if I touch it then he might get smudges on the pages ah you're right I didn't think about that my bad no need to apologize I'll hold the book okay are you sure of course now why that's now your reopens to book with both hands she holds it so that I don't have any harder of a time reading it but as a result her left arm is practically this is why you can hide them in he practically resting on top of my leg well in that case URIs already totally focused on reading again I take a chocolate candy and pop it in my mouth then I take another chocolate and hold it up to URI she doesn't look away from the book she simply parser live as if this situation was completely natural but that means I can't stop here i oppressively close the chocolate in her mouth just like that URI closest her lips over it Hey yours expression suddenly breaks did did I just hear looks at me like she needs to confirm what just happened um pizza pie Simmi messy I guess I shouldn't have done that oh that's well you were just helping that's something that friends do right I mean not really in this kind of context but yeah yeah that's all it was not at all my metaphorical penis [Music] yeah then you don't need to stop or anything I see the situation has gotten really tense URI tries to return to the book but I can tell just by her expression that even she can't focus now my heart is pounding I nervously take another chocolate between my fingers but this time you're his eyes meet mine how did it even come to this URI doesn't avert her gaze I noticed her chest rising and falling to the rhythm of her breath I raised my arm like before URI parts are lips but it's different this time I take the chocolate and place it in her mouth and I feel her hot breath on my finger okay everybody Monika just getting you hot okay everyone ah your results back it's time to share poems pixie pad can you help Europe put away the tea stuff right yeah of course okay thanks the spell is abruptly broken ah I'll take care of the cups yeah URI picks up the tea cups from the floor I pick up the bag of chocolate and in the end we hey singly clean up without so much of a word between us I get the feeling this is something neither us will have the courage to bring up it's the favorite time of the day it's time to read some poem Hey finally let's check in on Sayuri I'm really curious about her poem well she looks chipper it's nice come on I can already tell you don't like it well you don't need to worry about a thing after all you wrote this for someone else didn't you probably hurry hey I didn't write this for anyone specifically maybe they really wait a minute oh but it's okay you're making new friends just like I was hoping they makes me really happy and you're happy to read in this clip well of course I am okay it's a big marriage to me Thank You PGP Harry is there something wrong all right just tell me if you need anything [Music] if you insist sayuri-chan Monique a we sincerely we're lucky [Music] before I can say anything else sorry cheerfully walks out of the classroom humming to herself what is going on with this whamon I'm checking the game files I don't know let's do nots again next me I guess do you really haven't learned anything after all honestly I don't know why I get my hopes up in the first place what I didn't even think this one was bad what did I do wrong poems don't need to be all deep sounding to express something don't go don't it's going to just sound like you're forcing it Alice you really don't suck at it honestly don't bother trying to write poems like this until your immutable I guess since we're trying to romance Yuri our poems is reflected as such and that's why she's critiquing it I'm kidding I'm curious if she would like it more if we tried harder in their own thing anyway mastication stops short all of a sudden don't don't tell me you're not just trying to impress Yuri are you [Music] what are you talking about I and keep your voice then you know Yuri would love this kind of this is angsty just because she's a talented writer doesn't mean I I mean looks like I'm in trouble I saw much struck a nerve though what I did is beyond me I am so done with you that's the gate shoves the poem and I handed her back over to me take your stupid poem if you brought it for someone pills just don't show it to me ouch this is what I get for letting our younger girls step in my business unless that was a mind-reader I was destined to be in a world of pain from the start at least not to get wasn't really the girl I was trying to impress in the first place let's check in on Yuri this is a lot quicker than the other ones we don't even read their poems this time I guess they because we had to get another one for the festival PG pay to riding his old has only improved in these last few days every poem you shown me has been nothing short of spectacular I can really feel the emotions I'm a little envious even I don't think I ever it ever came to me this naturally Yuri that's the wrong way to put it this never did come naturally to me but I've been able to improve so much thanks to you you really the example I was chasing is that so Yuri gently smash to herself this feeling I'm so glad I got you you got the chance to share my writing I never thought it would feel like this I remember you mentioning that yesterday I can't believe that you're so good at something and you never even shared it with anyone it's kind of a shame maybe but it's not like I really had a choice what do you mean well Yuri smiled sadly pizza pie during lunch time I eat by myself did you know that it's a great time to find a quiet spot and do some reading in fact I always have some books with me you could say I really enjoyed reading well that's one way to put it anyway but books are so full of amazing inspiring people people you want to fall in love with or people you just know would make a really good friend cheerful people who always put a smile on your face or deep thinkers and problem solvers who discover the mysteries of life so when you look at it that way I'm surrounded by friends every day you know and those friends don't laugh at me they don't tease me for spacing out all the time they don't make fun of my body type and they don't hate me for acting like I know it all people say that about you I'm not a know-it-all appears you pay it's the opposite I don't know anything I don't know how to talk to people I don't know how to make people see me as normal I don't even know how to make myself happy I have all these feelings and all I can do with them is read and write but it wasn't until now that I started sharing it with you that I really understood what was missing all this time but I haven't really done anything no she came s just being patient and respectful that's really important to me I know I'm a difficult person pizza pie I speak too slowly a second guess myself all the time I read too deeply into things but every time you always treated me just like anyone else it's so rare that I feel comfortable with myself when I talk to others but that's why every time I talk to you I just feel really happy I see well I treat you how you deserve to be treated Yuri and if other people don't see it that way screw them I mean I joined this club hoping I would make friends and I would say add at least one success wouldn't you if you put it that way yeah we really are friends now aren't we Yuri put her head in her hands but this time she's smiling as she does it do you want to show me your poem yeah I do let me get it for you Beach a Marvel millions of years in the making where the womb of earth chaotically meets the surface under a clear blue sky an expense of bliss but beneath grey rolling clouds an endless enigma the easiest world to get lost in it's one where everything can be found one can only build a sandcastle where the sand is wet but where the sand is wet the tide pens will they gently lick it at your foundations until you give in or will a certain wave send you crashing down in a blink of an eye either way the outcome is the same yet we still build sandcastles I stand where the foam wraps around my ankles where my toes squishing through the sand the salty air is therapeutic the breeze is gentle yet powerful I sink my toes into the ultimate boundary line tempted by the foamy tendrils turn back and abandon my peace to erode at the shore drift forward and returned to earth forevermore that was beautiful and I'm aware that the beach is kind of an inane thing to write about but I did my best to take a metaphorical approach to it yeah Natsuki already told me about it she did she didn't say anything weird did she she just wanted us to write about the same topic again I suppose it's better to compare the differences in our writing styles or thought processes anyway was her idea knowing her it's not a surprise do you want to do something like that she probably just wants to show off it's not like I have a particular interest in her writing style I just went with her request but well I suppose it's not bad to write something about something simple on location okay I can't be refreshing you know it's good for me to come my thoughts once in a while yeah I think I agree thanks for sharing [Music] we got Monica left the Thark one I wonder why we didn't get to read the other ones poems hi pizza Peck have you thought about what you want to submit to perform at the festival well well being in this club is one thing but performing in front of a bunch of people I'll have to give it some more time okay no pressure but whatever you do I'm sure it will turn out great it would also make me happy to see hahaha anyway let's take a look at today's fun sure I'll let Monica take the poem I'm holding in my hands this one's good a fist it feels like you're not only getting more comfortable with your style but the imagery it's better than the last one I read just wondering but have you finding inspiration endurance writing style hmm I guess so I can't deny that she's talented yeah totally I think our problems are the most romantic that's the best way to describe it she's like a totally different person when she picks up a pen I noticed that too or when she's talking about literature it's like light turn and light turns on inside her mm-hmm sadly it's hard to get much passionate conversation about her trust me I'd tread who knows what goes on in that head of hers I hope you don't mean that in a bad way no of course not just I just mean that I wish she didn't keep so much to herself but still defending her like that you must be pretty into her you can pull you completely misunderstood hahaha calm down I'm just kidding besides I made this sure she's already got a boyfriend excuse me wait really yeah a fictional one anyway money can't kind of whispered that last part to me it's just a hunch but well that's not really anything wrong with that all right men have wifeís women have responders oh well I don't know I was saying anyway I share my poem with you now all right all right the lady who knows everything and all tell tells of a lady who wanders earth the lady who know everything a beautiful lady who has found every answer all meaning all purpose and all that was ever thought and Here I am a feather lost adrift the sky victims of the current vernon rand day after day I searched I searched with little help knowing legend don't exist but when all else has failed me when all others have turned away the legend is all that remains the last dim star glimmering in the twilight sky until one day the wind ceases to blow I far and I fall and I fall and I fall even more gentle as a feather a dry quill expressionless but the hand catches me between the thumb and the forefinger the hand of a beautiful lady I look at her eyes and find no end to her gaze the lady who knows everything knows what I'm thinking before I can speak she responds in a hollow voice I have found every answer all of which amount to nothing there is no meaning there is no purpose and we seek only the impossible I'm not your legend your legend does not exist I'm with it I'm with the breath she blows me back afloat and I pick up the gust of wind I couldn't keep up that my headphones fella yeah I couldn't keep up that that ridiculous voice cuz it's such a beautiful poet you know I feel like learning and looking for answers are the sort of thing that give life meaning not to get too philosophical or anything but it was kind of on my mind so that's what I wrote about I see I never really put much thought into it in a way it's almost paradoxical because if we have all the answers when the world start to lose meaning makes sense her poem reflected that you know there's one thing I notice it seems like everyone in the club prefers writing about things that are more sad than happy are you surprised I mean if everything was okay we wouldn't really have anything to write about would be humans aren't two-dimensional creatures I think you know better than anyone I mean you mean one-dimensional oh yeah that two dimensional foreshadowing Monica's the one that breaks the fourth wall anyway here's Monica's riding tip of the day if you are ever too shy to share your branding sites because you're afraid it's not good it can be really disheartening to get a loop on response to something you put so much into but if you find other people who enjoy riding then sharing becomes a lot easier because instead of just telling you that you're running is good okay are bad they want to focus more on everything that went into it and the things you can focus on it's much more encouraging that way and it will make you want to continue improving it's almost like having your own little literature club don't you think that's my advice for today thank you for listening okay you three we're all done sharing perm right why don't we start figuring out hold on a second it's is it just me or did you say something strange if now I thought I thought she left that's why she was returned referring to us three I didn't know she was Hey something did sound a bit unusual that's right you deviated from your usual catch fresh when addressing the club [Music] catchphrase I don't have a catchphrase Jeeves why is the moon so weird today look even you risen immune to it stagnating air is coming foreshadowing to that something terrible is about to happen are they foreshadowing the foreshadowing faces many layers in your books maybe look the only thing different is that Sarah isn't here ah it seems you're right say you're it always helps lighten the mood a little bit doesn't she it's almost like everyone this balance it's run off a little which is not a rare where the heck did she run off to anyway I thought she just wanted to pee netiquette please show some decency come on well she wasn't feeling too well and went home early is that so I hope she's all right seriously of all times not to go home with her you picked the time when she's not feeling well so much for you two being all lovey-dovey uh no first of all stop my sister understanding my friend she would say Aria and second she's kind of been avoiding me today so I didn't want to force it huh that curious expression coming from Yuri out of all people come on gasps I tucked her Ireland everything was fine wait what did she say anyway we need to figure out the rest of the festival preparation so let's sit aside what everyone will be doing this weekend I already know I already know what I'm doing that's right Natsuki you'll be making cupcakes but we might need a lot of them and different flavors can you handle that all by yourself not Sookie chao-li accepted and as for myself I'm going to be printing and assembling all the purge of pamphlets Sayuri will be helping me to sign them and as for Yuri Yuri you can guys can you have me come up with something for Yuri I am useless and then no no that's not it ah you're the most talented person here you know and now Nessa keep adding tier G's even I can tell now I guess I never gave Sayuri enough credit but I can tell things are even harder on you when she's not around ah I may be the chess but I can't also be a leader on my own then I won't grow as a person if I can so you're a you have a beautiful handwriting you know so you should make some banners and decoration to help set the atmosphere atmosphere um about that I I love that mystery yours expression suddenly changes as she stares at our desk in focus and starts nodding to herself your mind is already racing I see that's great it'll be wonderful happier II but anyway that just leaves you Pizza peg the one who is truly useless hahaha don't say that in fact above nuts again Yura have some political have attached to handle especially Yuri if you know what I mean it would probably go a long way to give one hand one of them a hand you could always have me out as well [Music] sorry I spilled drink on Edgar I would be really appreciative of that ah that's uh is Mona again suggesting I spend the weekend with one of my club members how on earth are they going to respond to a suggestion like that ah I suppose I wouldn't mind a bit of help [Music] well even if you don't know how to bake there's always some dirty word I could give to you it's not like Monica gave me a choice and you wouldn't be sitting on your body anyway not sick it tries to mumble a bunch of excuses like that um if I recall netsuke you mentioned that you would like to handle the bacon on your own while URI is really trying hard Angie my man look at that a pizza pie may not like a bit to be around you if you only make him out to be a nuisance so therefore he may be more suited to assisting with the decorations oh I never said that how hard can it be to make a few decorations anyway sounds more like you're making excuses for pizza pie too what are you saying it would be extremely meticulous work and breaking effect just what do you think okay guys guys let's set down for a moment in the end I think it's up to pizza pie to decide how he'd like to contribute besides yes and really got the chance to spend any time with me yet you know and now I'm sure he's interested and literally just said I'm surprised as well sorry sorry hey I was just saying the chase can we just shuttle this already yeah pizza pie you're okay with this right in the end it's up to you uh of course very well in that case everyone's looking straight at me of course I'm gonna go with [Music] I don't know Natsuki because he might be fun you know I everything baking would be really fun say Ori because she was feeling bad and I promised her that if it comes to it I would pick her over Yuri Yuri because you know I want to fuck and Monica because she's a thought what'd I just say I think I should go with sorry but we can always go back and change don't worry if you don't like the option and I think Ken hinted at this ken told me like oh yeah something's gonna happen on the weekend you don't really have to play it you'll know what I mean and I was like okay if it's gonna be with anyone then I prefer helping Sayuri I mean we're already neighbors and but Monica said Monica said that so Yuri was helping her Jace do you really hate us that much no no no sorry I didn't mean for this to be difficult oh oh [Music] we're gonna have to pick my girl well I probably be mother it'll probably most useful helping at URI me are you serious but I want you nuts okay I can already tell you're about to say something me I was just seen so you'll be helping URI then pairs the pair yeah that's what I'm gonna do what I have a bad habit of overthinking these sort of things so I think your assistance will be very useful that's great to hear Natsuki and will you be able to handle beck and by yourself I mean yeah I already said it would be fine okay okay everybody can tell the netsuke is feeling a little sour so is that everything we needed to get over go over yeah that would should be about it are you guys excited well excited may not be the right word Arnie it's a horror game how is this a horror game but I suppose I'm looking forward to a little bit do you feel the same way a pizza pay me I guess you could say I'm interesting to see how this turns out that's good enough for me well about to you now what about you netsuke that's icky what why is everyone yelling at me I didn't even do anything and no that's not what I meant at all ah Yuri anxious a glances between everyone in the room I'm sorry for this I don't really know why he did see pie pick me and also your cupcakes are the best cupcakes I ever had they go really well with my tea and nothing that I do for the event will compare to that so so I'm kind of surprised threw away well I'm the one acting immature I already know that but you're trying to cheer me up all the sudden I know I'm not very good at it I'm sorry if I said something bad netsuke isn't the only one surprised Monica and I are also taken back by your his word when she already has trouble with words trying to cheer someone up must be far out of her own comfort zone but I begin to understand Yuri was trying to sound like say Yuri even if it doesn't work perfectly I can tell she tried to say something say her he would say at a time like this because they already always helps everyone smile and feel good about themselves but I can't do appreciate it I'm sorry for making a big deal out of nothing but I'm going to say this you better bet that my cupcakes are going to be the best part huh I believe you yeah I hope to see everyone do their best but with that there's nothing Marfa today so I guess it's time for us to head out all right let's get out of here then everyone packs up their things I start to follow Monica and that's to go out the door I say chat between each other huh hey I turn around I'm a mess I realized that I don't have any way of contacting you this weekend oh you're right I can't believe that slipped my mind should I give you my phone number I [Music] think that would be the best yes all right then your and I exchanged phone numbers okay then I'll be stopping by your house on Sunday yeah my house is that a problem no not at all I just thought I would be the one going to your house since I'm the one helping you I suppose that makes sense but if you don't mind I would prefer going to your house all right in that case it won't be a problem I decide to not press URI for a reason it's not like it shouldn't matter much either way I just need to make sure my room is clean I hope I manage to make myself useful in some way I'm not nearly as creative as you are don't underestimate yourself pizza pie I think that will make a very productive team even if you only choose me because you felt bad or something wait you don't actually think that do you I don't know it's difficult to come up with any other reason you may have chosen me you're forgetting the one reason we have most common sentient with the most common sense I chose to help you because that's what I want to do but URI thinks to herself with an extremely tense expression URI you're overthinking this you wanted me to point out when you're overthinking right yeah I didn't realize I'm telling you I want to that's all there is to it do you believe me hi URI things really hard again she looks straight into my eyes for a long time I believe you if it took her tremendous as if it took tremendous effort URI finally says that and relaxes our expression I'm really looking forward to Sunday yeah I am too after that exchange I make my way out the door and URI follows I can't believe this Yura is going to his gaze ah here it is coming to be it URI is going to be coming to my house and Sunday even though I would have preferred to do this with saiary my anxiety still shoots through the roof I guess I gotten pretty used to handling her at this point but who knows what may not end up happening when we're outside of school she even told me she was looking forward to I shake my head why do I feel nervous that say or he finds out about this it's not like we feel that way about each other besides like Monica said this is about the club and I have nothing to worry about if I just go with it then I'll have a good time I think I would still tell Sayuri so she doesn't feel uncomfortable if she finds out it's already Sunday a beginning increasingly anxious I think we should end this episode here [Music] these episodes fly by I'm having so much fun just reading it I know it's like very a complete opposite of my content you know very edited very structured very where it's trying to like compact but you can't do that here you have to read it that's what it's about and but I'm enjoying it it's really fun and I hope you enjoy it as well I really appreciate you tagging along showing support and that's it see you tomorrow with another episode squad fam [Music] 
Kids have bundles of energy, but they need the right snacks to keep them going that's why I give my kids, Fruit-E Bars *laughs* "Why am I not surprised that you haven't done a video on net neutrality Pewdiepie. It's sad how much you're disconnected from regular people." "PewDiePie, please make a video about net neutrality and spread awareness about it. PLEASE." "PewPie please everyone is waiting on you from the community to help make a video about stop FCC Taking control of net neutrality" "Do a vid on net neutrality. Please we need you" "I'm surprised the biggest guy on YouTube, a career in the internet, isn't just a little concerned with net neutrality unless I'm missing something otherwise, it would really help if someone who has access to more than 50 million subs to spread awareness through I don't know maybe a video PSA at least, but you know that's just a thought. Well carry on everybody Have a good day" URGENT if you're not freaking out about net neutrality right now You're not paying attention listen here, okay. I know what it's like to have bad internet alright Don't come to me being all like uh, net neutrality and everything is gonna be bad Ohhh listen, everyone knows we want net neutrality. What do you want me to say about it? Its... been all over Internet. It's literally been blasted. How do you not know about this? ehh, Your favorite youtuber has made a video about it everyone has talked about it. What do you want me to say about it? First of all in case you, for some reason, don't know what net neutrality is let's look it up "Net neutrality is the principle that Internet service providers and governments regulating the internet must treat all data on the Internet the same and not discriminate or charge deferentially by user, content, website, platform, application, type of attach-- okay, I don't care I immediately don't care okay? "But he isn't in the US so unless the UK government is retarded It doesn't affect him." Oh! it would seem this doesn't affect me Suck it America. No for real. Sorry, okay, the memes got ahead of me of course It's a serious issue of course it is let's see what--what people are saying about net neutrality Okay here we go on Come Onnn, ugh come on Still loading? still loading still loading have you ever been stuck on a really slow internet connection -One so slow that you just can't stream video
-yes Or you have to give up on using certain sites or apps -because they just take too long to load?
-Yeah, yes yes How did you know this? well imagine that certain sites were permanently confined to a slow lane like that? Practically they are! While others were allowed to operate at full speed. Oh my god! unless What-the-what-the-what-the-what I already have this problem You trying to sell me an issue that I already have? No, thank you. Okay. It would be like paying to board earlier for an airplane But for just about anything that you do online I love paying... extra, so I can get it earlier it's great! I don't have to stand in line with all the weirdos The idea that Internet service providers shouldn't be allowed to discriminate against or grant preferential treatment to particular sites also sorry, but--eh--stripe you can't wear stripe on camera like did no one tell you that? without net neutrality broadband providers like Comcast, Charter as well as mobile carriers like, AT&amp;T and Verizon Could slow Netflix to a crawl in order to keep you paying for their television package Get that excuse me get that man out of my face basically a world without net neutrality Might mean that you have to pay more to access the Internet content you want but it could also crush innovation because without a level playing field New apps and services won't be able to compete with entrenched companies like anyone gives a shit come on let's get real here people want net neutrality because they don't want the government to interfere with the internet ATATATATA Not so fast Pewds from the past here, made a big mistake here my microphone stopped working. I'm sorry It's late But I feel like it's important cuz I don't want to spread misinformation on what's clearly already a very confusing topic Uhhh, The FCC is a government agency and the government wanting to repeal net neutrality my immediate thought was oh, okay, so the government wants to take more control over the Internet And that's why everyone is so outraged when this is actually a rare case of the government saying hey, we want less control here and more into the ISPs net neutrality is the government sort of controlling and making sure that ISPs are held to a certain standard that they can't block access to certain websites and keeping the internet free and neutral, and I think that's very, very important, so I clearly got it wrong and, uh I wanted to apologize and set the record straight the head of FCC also villain of the internet Ajit Pai has come forward to explain Hi, I'm Ajit Pai. I'm the chairman of the FCC I really enjoyed the public debate about the future of the Internet No, no No you fucking don't Shut the--shut the fuck up. You're already lying Now, Ajit Pai has been on a media campaign to twist the public's uh, idea of Net neutrality to sort of switch it around and it's not It's not going great for Ajit I always tell the truth Basing on any video with him in and the dislike bar so the F(CC)--so basically For those of you who don't know back in 2015 this whole discussion Had already happened. I don't know if you guys remember Remember Kony 2012? well, then it was Net Neutrality 2015 and here we are again, Net Neutrality 2017 --system is working Yet Mr. Chairman you are proposing to undo the open internet border Uh, what is the problem Mr. Chairman? That you are trying to fix? Yes! Thank you, finally. I want the answer of this Thank you for the question senator Uh, I think one of the concerns that we have raised is that these regulations might be dampening infrastructure investment They might be, but there's no evidence of it Well there has been evidence raised and that's part of the reason why we are testing this proposition in the context of the newest proposed rulemaking some had suggested the FCC should Simply issue a declaratory ruling Saying that the facts in the law are so and that's the way it's going to be But we wanted to test this proposition in an open and public process wha--? what--what the--what the--what the-- what are you--what are-- What are you saying? at this rate, I'm convinced that Ajit just wants to remove net neutrality so he can delete all the mean comments about him on the Internet Uh, he's been on Fox News where they try to twist Repealing net neutrality as a left and right issue the mainstream media Maybe we should just call it call them what they are the leftist media They're the Washington Post anyway writes this today, sir so they're basically trying to angle it like oh it's the left media the-- ah those stupid leftists when really according to Uh, polling everyone is against net neutrality Is not a political left and right sort of question a lot of celebrities have been tweeting about the FCC, Cher Tweeted "Net Neutrality means Trump can change the internet it will include less Americans not more" I-I-I don't know. I can't read this. This is so incoherent but Uh, Pai replied to this saying "Another concern I've heard is that the plan will harm rural and low-income Americans Cher, for example has tweeted that the internet will include less Americans not more if my proposal is adopted. But the opposite is true The digital divide is all too real too many rural and low-income Americans are still unable to get high-speed Internet so basically a big argument for--uh--to repeal net neutrality is so that more people The government can build out for more people to get access to the Internet so really he's just looking after all of us Why can't the government do that without Repealing net neutrality? I have no idea why is it, if that's what he wants Why does the FCC Want mobile data to count as broadband internet? that idea which is an idea that would further cut off poor and rural areas from decent internet. you're kind of getting--you're saying one thing but you're showing the other Uh, the FCC also made a myth vs. fact to sort of Clear out what the facts are saying that This is the end of the Internet as we know it. They're saying No, that's not true Startups will not be able to compete with Title II regulations They're saying. No, that's not true Internet service providers will block you from visiting the website you want to visit They're saying. No, that's not true and basically anything that people are saying about the-- uhmmm about net neutrality They're saying that's incorrect actually, that's not how it's gonna work But it doesn't say how? or why? or when? and really I haven't seen any convincing argument for Should we ruin something that is already clearly working fine? It's just "Oh more people will have access to the Internet"? sure buddy, sure Since I'm re-recording this bit I might as well add that, since you guys told me, the reason why Ajit thinks that this will bring out more Infrastructure to rural areas is because there will be more competition, with the government interfering less. This is all speculation But I will say, I think it's worth mentioning that Ajit used to work for one of the biggest internet service providers in USA Verizon and it sort of make you question, like what's the motive here? is he just helping out his buddies from his old company? it doesn't really make sense and I'm sure the way net neutrality is presented by a lot of Media campaigns and that it's so bad I'm sure it's not as bad as people are saying, but I'm--but I also haven't seen any argument for why? It's a good idea to repeal net neutrality the whole thing is just absurd no one believes a Ajit Pai and like I said I'm convinced. This is just his personal vendetta with the Internet at this at this-- at this point but there as always, the memes *smacks lips* Is a very tasty From this complain all you want it's never ever, ever, ever, gonna stop come on, how bad can it possibly be? How ba-a-a-ad can I be? I'm just building the economy. How Ba-a-a-ad can I be? Just look at me, petting this puppy How ba-a-a-ad can I be? a portion of proceeds, goes to charity How ba-a-a-ad can I be? How bad could I possibly be? let's see Sounds familiar doesn't it? Yup I'm talking about this... net neutrality We need to speak up just like everyone else says if we don't speak up... bye-bye fandoms bye-bye memes bye-bye fanart bye-bye fanfics God damnit Why net neutrality is important just imagine EA is your internet provider Yeah, no my internet is so good Support net neutrality the Internet should be free if you want to build out rural areas I'm sure you can do it without fucking with the internet. Okay? just leave leave our memes alone. Thank you 
*Footsteps* (hurgh) *claps* It's time for another episode of drinking whiskey. Welcome this fine evening We are doing, ha! you guessed it the last thing on the list: a bourbon Marzia: What is Bourbon whiskey? Oh Bourbon that is well, it's defined by many different things I'm glad you asked Generally the easiest way to tell them apart is by region bourbon is America it has to be just like Scotch Has certain rules bourbon has rules as well defined by law so it has to be at least, Oh no I think it has to be more than 51% by eh, corn distilled by corn so Scotch is more like malted barley and But you get bourbon which is distilled  with corn yeah aged in new charred, charred oak containers Which is what gives it, bourbon, it's very distinct more Goldish tone Gold is not the right word brownish. Yeah, red. Bourbon... Is very nice Very nice, I've tried all of these and they are all Very nice. This is the first time I actually cheated I was supposed to record this video long ago But there was just such immense pressure from you guys to make another one of these episodes When is the next episode Felix? I'm dying here. Here we are Finally with the Bourbon the last of the series this will be my last We're gonna start with a Cyrus Noble, which is the most expensive one, guess how much this one cost? Two hundred and seventy two I think but it's a lot of whiskey you got a lot of whiskey for that price compared to the other ones I'm glad you're asked because that's a mistake me and Jack made in the last video So this is 80 proof which means it's 45% alcohol, there you go Let's try that Cyprus Noble straight bourbon whiskey this is from, Kentucky Fun fact about Kentucky whiskey there are more barrels of whiskey than are people living there Don't know if that's actually true. I need to start fact-checking better accepting things rough Yeah So 95% of all bourbon is pro- produced, Kentucky Kentucky bird - Kentucky whiskey Burnham's the state has more than 5.3 million barrels of bourbon that are aging, a number that exceeds the state population, I was right. Cheers! That sounds like a good we need a move into Kentucky. Can you imagine? That's incredible now. I did realize it for myself one hell of a glass, but let's give it a let's give it a try It's got that very distinct bourbon-y spicy flavor Sniff on it. It smells beautiful. I could smell this no you don't know Now, this is exactly how you want bourbon to taste like. I really enjoyed this bourbon. It's Very nice The meme is so dead. It's a strong flavor It's not unlike Scotch which has a strong, a lot of Scotch has a strong flavor, but they don't but they're very usually a very smoky This is that same strong flavor, but without the smoke smokiness, it's more spicy Yeah, Jefferson's reserved it says very old on the bottle very old, Kentucky straight bourbon But that's the thing with bourbon, nothing is very old, America is not very old. There's a lot of stories about the origin of Bourbon Generally people just agree on that the scotch King, the Scottish people came and they're like "hey we want to drink something What do you got here to make some some fine whiskey" and they're like "hey, we got corn!" I mean, I'm just making this up by the way. This is another Kentucky based Kentucky god bless you, we should go to Kentucky It's a very small batch bourbon aged longer than its deployments for an extra slab of spicy Complexity, very nice. I guess the thing with with drinks is that, maybe I should just drink it I actually think I like that one more than hmm. Do you want to smell it okay? I think the Cypress isn't better overall The flavor in your mouth when you have their reserve. It's beautiful But I'm not sure if I like the kick the spicy kick that it describes. It is significantly cheaper But it's also Very nice Yeah, I Think that's it. Yeah something 76 maybe. None of the Bourbons are very expensive I would say compared to the Scotch the personal prices of the Scotch is pretty outrageous 1964 that's when they declared that bourbon was bourbon by my state of law so Bourbon is pretty young they've been making it for a longer time obviously But has bourbon hasn't been bourbon for more than a hundred years at least even though they've been making bourbon for more than 100 years Garrison brothers everybody, this is a Texas straight bourbon whiskey So it's not from, Kentucky. Hi This is the most cowboy whiskey I've seen and they really try and promote it that way I think they have a bourbon cold Cowboys that's the thing with the That I think I really Enjoy about whisky it sounds a bit pretentious, but it's more than just a drink. It's it's immersing yourself in An experience you drink the Laphroaig and you imagine yourself in Scotland you drink some bourbon From, Texas, and you feel like a cowboy you know what I mean Yeah The flavors are all so different. I don't know how to describe it the spicy flavors man the spicy I keep going and spicy but none of them really feels fantastic to me. They're all very nice, but so far It's not it's not like some of the Irish whiskey that I tried that are just like them. Oh my god This is all I want to drink except. They have the COBOL Single berry whiskey rye distilled in Chicago this one tastes crazy. That's all I remember Yeah, it's very different Very very different they all taste so different from each other, but this one tastes Particularly different, it's so strange Some bourbon is so strange. I don't even know if this is bourbon this tastes less I was just gonna say this one tastes. Not as strong as the other ones, but I guess you would disagree But I do like it obviously I drank quite a lot from it, but I don't I don't know Next one I am Very excited about this is 100% straight corn whiskey so it's not bourbon. Oh, that's the thing I forgot to tell about this one cuz this is Hey, I just noticed that there's a difference between Kentucky Bourbon and Tennessee bourbon, I think the bottle that it couldn't find was the Tennessee bourbon And they really try to make themself their own thing in Tennessee it seems like they're like Oh, we're not bourbon. We're we're Tennessee whiskey alright calm down This one clearly feels like they took moonshine and marketed it kind of they got a freaking wizard I try this one it's one of the cheaper ones. It's actually very nice. It's actually really good I can see since 100% corn. It's a lot Brighter than the other ones it looks so much like Irish whiskey this feels like that kind of stuff you today You drink with some ice maybe you don't have to be like oh Oh, yeah Way less flavors than all of the others, but it still tastes real smooth I Really like it. I don't know. I just bought it because I was like holy crap that bottle looks insane Maker's mark has been put on the map recently becoming very popular in the UK. It's a Kentucky straight bourbon whiskey Handmade they put I don't know what that in place. I think when you get to the really cheaper whiskeys Typically you wouldn't really enjoy it like the rest But this is one of the cheaper ones that I actually would really enjoyed this did get a lot better So much flavor so much spice you feel like cowboy last But not least the Jack Daniels Jack Daniels has set specific flavor And it goes really well with mixing if you want to make yourself a highball It's very nice to do that learning sparkling powder and some Jack Daniels And you got yourself a highball and it's it's a very nice drink I mean doesn't dehydrate you like a lot of other drinks Do like we keep drinking gin and tonics or keep drinking all these fancy drinks? You're not gonna feel good the day after but you drink just whiskey water You know you can't go better the night Jack Daniels everybody that whiskey that probably most of you that are watching have tried its a Tennessee whiskey and they make they go out of their way to say oh, no, we're not a bourbon we're a Tennessee whiskey see That's what I was getting at before apparently what they do is they drink the whiskey through charcoal Charcoal is that possible that's what gives it its really distinct flavor, and it is so it is a nice flavor I understand why it's so popular. I think because it has a brief black label. They did a really good job market again We study actually this Economy how they market it and black really put them on the market. That's a manly you know product You see people all the time like yeah, we could Jack that man right. It's my last It's been fun guys. It's been fun all the memories It's been so many memories so many wonderful times, I want to thank you guys for this opportunity I want to thank the all the community of whiskey drinkers and most of all I want to thank myself Here's to me That was it that was all the whiskey Might do another video if I got enough thumbs up, can we get this to trending a final wish? Are you live for me? You don't think I can get trending challenge accepted everybody um That was that good Goodbye, everybody and remember keep drinking safely Water drink water 
Hey guys, It's PewDieP.... AHH!! *rumbling intensifies as Pewds screams* What is happening? *rumbling continues* It's the internet. It's coming for you! Logan, Run! Ah, it's the internet! They're coming for you, Logan!! RUN AHH! Yesterday..uh... (Retarded) Paul uploaded a video titled, "We found a dead body in the suicide forest..." *Sarcastic Tone* With this very tasteful thumbnail. This must be a great video! *sarcasm intensifies* can't wait to click on this! *sarcastismic peak* He didn't actually, show a dead body in his video. No pfft... I know he's out for that ,"daily grind", for views But.. surely even Logan Paul, has his limits. Now, I always knew, that Logan Paul was a JACKASS. So, I really wasn't surprised, by the fact that once Logan Paul found a dead body, that he acted like a Jackass. It didn't really come as a shock to me. But for those who don't know what happened, Basically, he found a dead body. He went up to the body. Filmed.... FILMED it, literally up close, And sort, sort of, a sudden thing you see on this off-brand web site. It's.. It's not the kind of stuff you'd see on YouTube uhhh very disturbing.... uh Really.. disrespectful, zooming on the body making weird jokes around it. And people always point out that "Oh, Logan? He's like the nice one of the Paul brothers He's the, he's the more mature one." No. He's not. I'VE BEEN TELLING THIS FOR YEARS! Jake at least seems like he's somewhat self-aware But Logan, he's a straight-up sociopath You know when you're doing that, those daily vlog videos There's always "What's the next big thing?" *dangles* You know, just dangling in front of you. Like "What's gonna draw in more people to the channel?" "Me filming a dead body!!" *grabs* Not even hesitating. Logan:  I'm definitely monetizing this video for obvious reasons. I will say before you watch this is normal I think this definitely marks a moment in YouTube history 'Cause I'm pretty sure...this has never hopefully happened to anyone on YouTube, ever. They try and sorta mask the whole thing with the 'sad music'. Logan: This is funny. I like how he points out This is a mo- mark for YouTube history like everything has to be an achievement to this man Logan: cuz I'm pretty sure This has never hopefully happened to anyone on YouTube ever (yeah because people care about the world) I did something that marks the history of YouTube. I'm amazed he thought this was appropriate for Youtube. So, eh, they go to the well-known forest, "Suicide Forest", which is outside Mount Fuji, in Japan Japan has a huge problem with suicide, it's uh- but it's known that you enter the forest to commit suicide, uh, in Japan. That's why it literally has the name "Suicide Forest".... Logan: Also known as...the Anime suicide forest *loud, dramatic sound effect* You know what's gonna happen. You don't have to add that sound effect... like OOHH IT'S SPOOKY. like it's so dumb. I can't hey uh Dear anime body-pillow in this forest, please, please leave us alone *shouts* foreshadowing everybody It's almost like he knew this is gonna happen who would have thought, entering the suicide forest, going off trail, we would find Logan Paul th-b-ph-that's crazy! Who woulda thought?! Never my intention! No! Logan: umm I really love to say this. I think there's someone hanging right there so here they found the dead body and Hey, hey film me. Hey all right film me so I can have this reaction. Logan: um I really love to say this I think there's someone of hanging right there Mmm. I'm not even fucking kidding. D'you see it? This is gonna get so much ad rev. I'm not even--, this isn't a fucking joke guys. That's a fucking person. Dude I fucking told you we would make loads of money. Logan's friend: I think you're fucking right. Logan's friends: "God.",  "YES.", "Dude what the heck." Another friend: Bring the camera let's go get our money. Did he just say "Bring the camera let's go"? There's a dead body there--Let's bring, bring the camera-- Let's go everybody. Let's go have a little closer look over there. Let's not call the cops Let's just bring the camera. Make sure you bring the camera. The thing is I don't want to show the video. It's so stupid. I'll just describe it because I don't want to show it, but he basically zooms in on the corpse. He shows the hands He's right next to it. He films it, it's just... It's so distasteful. It's so disrespectful, and it's so stupid. Logan: What the fuck is going on?! Logan's friend: I don't know dude*Retarded scream* Logan: WHYYY??! ...It's sinking in bro. This wasn't supposed to happen man. Oh, my god stop fucking showing it What's wrong with you? Logan: There's no going back. I've seen things I can't unsee. Logan's friend: We found, a dead. Body. Logan: ...YUP. WHAT THE FUCK...?! *chuckles dryly* Man: You can't enter the restricted area. Logan: What? You can't enter the restricted area. You can't enter. Logan: You told us a little too late, bro. We've seen a little too much, already. Like you didn't fucking know it was restricted to go off trail, like, come on dude. Logan: There's kids running around what if, what if the fucking kids stumbled upon this guy. Oh, there's kids. Just like all the kids watching your vlogs, Logan. Which you showed anyway. What are you saying? That's your audience right there. Now the video got on trending... Uhhh, people, uh, people were very upset different celebrities...Aaron Paul tweeted. Philip Defranco pointed out that, that there was Six hundred thousand likes on the video before it was taken down. His core audience doesn't give *distorted* Unless YouTube does something, this doesn't hurt him. It's true. It's true. Yeah. I was surprised when I saw the video and Not many people seem to give a shit Not until Twitted this morning. I'm like. Oh. Yeah, people are actually pissed off about this. Good, because it's so stupid. I mean, it literally says in YouTube's policy that you can't "include disturbing or disgusting video footage." I think this classifies. I do think so, and seeing it then appear on trending, it makes you go like "W-what is happening?" What is, what is this? Can you imagine the thought process that went into this like "Oh yeah, so let me just make this face." "And then we'll add him here right well" "Make sure you can see him, properly." "and take off your stupid *Christian Channel* hat..." Here's what you do if you find a dead body... in a vlog. You either...don't...don't film the body at all or at least cut it out of the vlog because it's inappropriate and disrespectful to show, even if you blur it, OR you just cut, cut it there You can talk about it afterwards if you want to bring attention to it. That's completely fine. I think it's an important issue to talk about, and we shouldn't shy away from it, but... Just cut it. You don't have to show it. And we definitely don't need to see you zooming in and walking in on the face of the person. It's disgusting. The thing is, I sort of understand the mentality... This would make a great vlog. Logan has made 440 vlogs. He does it every single day, and there's always "What's the next big vlog? What's gonna be the next big thing that draws people in?" Of course if something like this happens. He's gonna want to capitalize on it. He's gonna want to try and draw attention to him. And he knows it's gonna get more attention if he films the body, shows it in the thumbnail, all these things that he did. Now a lot of people in his defense said, "well, he demonetized the video, he added disclaimers" Well, he even point out himself that there's no way the video is gonna get monetized anyway. Logan: I'm sorry for swearing so much I'm already getting flagged for demonetization, bro, fuck-- So it's not really a noble thing to NOT monetize the video, if you know it's not gonna monetize anyway. A lot of people were pissed off at Logan for laughing, or ridiculing the situation. I don't really have a problem with that personally I think a lot of people deal with this sort of thing in their own way. It's obviously a traumatic thing for anyone to find a dead body. For me, the problem is showing it. Uh, showing the body. Filming the body. Acting like a jackass, still, in front of it. There's no way you needed to show that. You could have reviewed it afterwards in the Edit and said "Hey, let's cut this out." Since then, Logan has issued an apology, which is the first apology I've ever seen that has an emoji sign in it. *Pewdiepie chuckles* And the hashtag! He also, uh, mentioned himself... 26 times in this apology. He points out that he didn't do it for the views because he already gets views. Yeah fucking right, dude, shut the fuck up. You might be fooling your kid audience, but you ain't fooling me, alright, You 100% did it for the views. You put a dead man in your thumbnail. Explain that? I'm surrounded by good people "Dude what the heck?" "Get your camera let's go." "There's a thing that is now in our lives" I think what this video really does is it encompasses everything wrong with YouTube, the click bait, the sensationalism, the thing that's got to keep pushing. At the end of the day, he just shines bad on everyone. Now I'm, by no means, a good example of, of talking about this, but no one is perfect. We, we all make mistakes. I-I think. Yeah, I know, but this one. *laughs akwardly* I have a few experiences with this sort of thing, but... actions speak louder than words in my opinion. Which seems to be overlooked every time. Uh, for me at least? I never did anything towards another human being. I just said things that you weren't supposed to say, and uh...to me, it's a big big difference. In my opinion, he did apologize, you know no matter how bad the apology is, he did apologize. People are outraged and they want some sort of like "Oh. His channel should be taken down" or this or that and obviously I don't believe in that, no matter what. I don't believe in that "lose your job" kind of hate mob, he should...that some bigger sort of consequence should come out of this, but he definitely deserved to be criticized, at the very least. Suicide is a serious issue, eh, and shouldn't take...be taken light and...lightly. Can't speak. I'm gonna leave some link in the description where you can look up for help. Get help if you need it. There is help for you. And that's it for me for now! Squad fam out. Yo, I'm about to burn down this house, so you fucking ready. Are you ready? I'm about to spill fucking burns like diarrhea. I'm about to nuke the whole city like North Korea. Are you ready? Dead person in the suicide forest.

Did I just hear someone use a microaggression???????? Microaggression, it's a term. We all came to love, but what does it really mean?   Let's do a quick simple google search to find out. What is a microaggression? Wait... What is a microinsult... A microaggression is the..? What is a microassault? What is a microinvalidation? Macroagression?! Microagression... Macroassault! Microregression... Macro discrimination!! My god, okay, all right we're gonna have to take a step back. Micro aggression is a term coined in 1970, But recently, Got popularized, thanks to this wonderful man. Let's see how he describes it. Good day everyone my name is Derald Wing-Su Why does this feel like a comedy sketch? It feels like I'm watching Adult Swim. To share with you some of the harmful impact that micro aggressions have on... The music is so uplifting! ...authorities in our society Is it a good thing? I can't tell. Well, micro aggressions are the everyday slights, indignities, put downs and insults that people of color, women LGBT populations, or those who are marginalized experience in their day to day interactions with people. In this scene, Jenny has finished a late night at the office and awaits the elevator I can tell it's a very late night based on the darkness. The door opens, She takes one step forward, sees a black male rider, hesitates And immediately clutches her purse and places her hand over her necklace. African-americans are prone to crime will break the law are up to no good and will steal okay I have taken a couple classes in Microaggressions and basically here we go micro aggression it can be divided into three based on if it's a intentional microaggression or an unconscious microaggression if it's an unintentional Microaggression, then it's called a micro invalidation whatever the heck that is and then if it's intentional it's a micro assault and if it's somewhere in between you will find a Micropenis just kidding and Mike it's a micro insult in the middle if you're not okay These jokes are so fucking bad my god now You might think that micro aggression is not that big a deal. Not people don't use it seriously come on Felix so Recent TV went to a campus to do some research Occidental College in California is considering instituting a system for students to report so-called Microaggressions, oh wow I believe the most qualified person should get the job Qualifications aren't really the only the only things you consider when hiring someone how can you say that? how can you even hesitate on their qualifications aren't really the only the only things you consider when hiring someone what else is there if You're running a business you want the most qualified person for the job Right You know I just hear someone use a microaggression. I understand not wanting to hire the same type of people Because then you're just gonna get the same type of opinion But the quote most qualified person Surely if you have if you get a job you should get it knowing I was the most qualified for this job Qualifications are really the only The only things you consider when hiring someone I was so confused if you're saying that the most qualified person is someone who is Not a minority you're not a religion you believe and then yes, I'd be a microaggression But that's not what they were saying saying god bless you after somebody sneezes oh that would be a microaggression because Different religions, yeah, it could be a microaggression to someone who doesn't believe in God I think that the harm. There is relatively minimal So there's still some harm though. Definitely harm. I feel my hope my soul is burning my soul is on fire I truly feel what it's like to be marginalized Could be a microaggression to someone who doesn't believe in God It could be a microaggression to someone who doesn't believe in God it reminds me the other week when? Mr.. Wil Wheaton who has me blocked on Twitter for being toxic? tweeted right after the church shooting in Texas that the murdered victims Would still be alive if prayers did anything that seems like the good time as any to? Criticize prayers after a church shooting thing is I don't believe in religion I am what yeah agnostic atheist But I don't feel the need to criticize other people if people want to say thoughts and prayers to something bad happening I know they have a good intention in mind even though I don't believe in what that good intention is I don't feel the need To go against a and the same thing with God bless you you know someone means something well Why would I personally turn I would be the one responsible for turning it into something negative and that's the thing with microaggression is that it's a game that anyone can play but no one wins I have an accent like a like a Swedish accent oh Did you just assume my accent? never Never have I been so shook. I'm shook. I'm Chuck Swedish accent excuse me just cuz I had this fake blonde hair. Just not me no service like a Swedish accent. Yeah Not everyone in Sweden is blonde. Okay, what? Microaggressions are the everyday slights indignities put downs for those who are marginalized? experienced in their day-to-day Interactions with people I'm not ignoring that these are Could be hurtful for a lot of people. I I fully understand that I'm not trying to take that away from people They have the right to feel whatever the way they want to feel but I found it really interesting In this video when they talk about free speech What are your thoughts on the concept of free speech do you support free speech yes, I do support free speech Everyone should be able to say What they believe in what's on their mind Alexis and microaggression then we need to report it for hate speech I support free speech but It doesn't work like that. We condemn freedom of speech that hurt other people's feelings. Why don't you suck my micropenis? In drawled wing Sue's one of his books he points out that micro aggression produce physical health problems and shorten life expensi and the general consensus from research is that there's no evidence to back up that micro aggressions is actually harmful and What is actually defined who does it actually affect? Some say it could even be more harmful to use the term now Now that we know about micro aggression we're gonna play a little game. It's called Can you spot the micro aggression a McGill student was forced to apologise for? Racial microaggression after emailing joke obama clip this was an unintentional micro aggression, which we now learn It's a micro Invalidation good job class you learned a lot here today. It was posted with the caption Honestly midterms get out of here write down in the comments what the micro aggression was right now It was based on the fact not that Midterms are frustrating, then you need to get that anger out it was Blackman angry am I right micro aggression We also have this clip from the diversity Council of Australia pain project that we're working on is actually looking at how we come on girls, let's get cracking girls the micro aggression here is of course a Little bit more subtle for their untrained eye, but me as an micro aggressing Expert I can easily tell you that this micro aggression is based on the fact that They all look like girls and Could it be the Kraken get crackin come on girls. Let's get cracking like a cracker white stir it now Moving on this is posted on BuzzFeed about micro aggression Examples no. You're white Moving on so what do you guys speak in Japan Asian? Micro aggression Just because I'm Somali doesn't mean I know any pirates. This guy is clearly just taking a piss I mean look at his face come on. Let me just play this micro violin For all these poor people with the science and my god. They must be tough I get it You know actually it's it's smaller than that it's super micro. Yeah, actually. It's so tiny it's it's a nano aggression All right, okay, all right. Okay. Let's get serious now, and this might be completely based on my Swedish cookery And I can't help it, but I always try to be somewhat sensible and around all these ideas I'm not dismissing the fact that this is a problem, but calling it a micro aggression implies that there's violence Involved and that somehow you have the right to strike back against it With violence as well Which is the joke that South Park hold? when hitting anyone in the game for making a microaggression When in reality it's just an insult excuse me. Did you or did you not say that this man seemed tired yes? He's my friend. I said Paulo. You look tired microagressions Persons of Hispanic backgrounds have been stereotyped as being sleepy and saying they look tired as a micro aggression that will not Stern But I am tired And it's not a matter of definition. I think it's a you can call it micro. Whatever That's not really the issue I think the issue is how you're approaching a problem if people want to remove micro aggression from campus I don't really have a problem with that shouldn't that be done through educating instead of trying to police because it isn't Educating what you do at a campus any form of social study and social justice these days just seems to be About policing and haha we got you shame rather than educating and trying to explain Why something is bad now excuse me while I go and cry some micro tears? Thank you for leaving a like on this video every like is a macro compliment. I would really much appreciate it Thank you very much for subscribing. That would be a mega compliment really appreciate it and as always remember to Gladly be nice

*Clapping in sync with color changes* Pewds: Meme Review *More clapping in sync with color changes* Pewds: MEME REVIEW! Pewds: Meme Review! YouTube's favorite show... ever Last week we hit trending, thank you guys so much for all the support OoOooOhHHBOI Do we have a lot of spicy memes for this week's meme. review. Last week we reviewed Petting Dog meme haha I'm petting a dog (yes you are Pewds) and it's many predecessors. You guys posted some as well You joined in on the meme. Hi doggie. Hey look. It's me Zootopia meme or Zootopia pro-life meme OR Zootopia I will survive AnOtHeR wEb CoMiC mEmE Have you watched Zootopia? (no) Me neither, but it was about a bunny and a fox and someone said to themselves,(NO) "Hey, I'm gonna make my own version a comic of that stor- Disney story about the fox and the bunny" (NOOOO) "talking about complex relationship issues such as" (pewds stop) "pregnancy and whether you should have an abortion or not!" ✞✞✞ (why pewds) Now this meme got a lot of attention mainly for the fact of the abzurd abzurb abzerdity abzurbit abzerbity [robotic voice] Absurdity For three different reasons. Number one Zootopia. Number two, a bunny and a fox fucking. (oh god)  Number three, the extremely ✞✞✞✞✞ (&lt;--wth is with the crosses being there?) over-exaggerated panels. The emotions that they've the artist really captured in this fan fiction, is quite something so you can easily just replace the text with pretty much anything and it will just feel off "I cannot live another day without air conditioning!" "It says tomorrow's gonna be hotter." Good meme! "They both weigh the same, Nick!" "They are both a kilogram." "But, steel is heavier than fEaThErS." (ur right) It's actually true. I don't see how people struggle with this mind thought prog thing(?). Steel is heavier than feathers everyone knows that. Because it has this... bigger density. "You know... Traps are gay." Look. I posted this one look at that everybody I am funny and relevant. I post- I post relevant memes Please validate me. Please. :'( We have the One Punch Man We have the "Silly rabbit! Trix are for kids!" Everyone knows that. we have there everything that we know and love is reducible to the observe acts of chemicals We have the "Everything that we know and love is reducible to the observe acts of chemicals "And there is therefore no intrinsic value in this material universe!" "Hypocrite that you are, for you to trust the chemicals in your brain to tell you they are chemicals. All knowledge is "Ultimately based on that which we cannot prove."  (thats a long ass meme pewds) "Will you fight? Or will you perish like a dog?" This of course is based on the Donald Duck meme and Mickey Mouse meme But it begs really the question You know people look at love as some sort of strange substance that we can't understand when really you can just break it down in scientific thing You know what they say, love is blind. "I don't understand" This is - this one is probably my favorite- "I don't understand.. Our family?! Our entire clan?!" "Why did you kill our parents??" "To measure my abilities." Good old.. Naruto meme "It's over Anakin. I have the high ground!" "You underestimate my power!!"(the powa of trending) "Nick.. Subs, not dubs." "No! I can't believe you said that!" "Nick, hear me out." Really the the the numerous amount of of Comic strips that can be adapted in-in-in-in this comic. I think is what really makes it so successful. "Hey, how do you sprint?" "ALT + F4" Player Nick has left the game (disconnected by user.) "You know.. I had to do it to em." *snicker* So dumb. Hey look,✞ It's the loss meme, everybody! That's how you truly know if a meme has been accepted or not. Does it have a Loss meme? Then it's not a true meme. We have, of course, petting dog meme. (yes we are bac) Fans of this comic (suck D) Notice themselves that in the very first image the building is the same building as the Seinfeld building. This begs the question. Was the artist memeing all along? It's a very interesting topic. NOW I will have to rate it... Not too high. It was amusing for a while. But I think-I think the adaptations so far that I've seen doesn't really live up to the potential of this meme. I mean, eeehhhhhhhh look at--look at these facial expressions Subs not dubs. Can we talk about more important issues such as.. "Pewdiepie doesn't make original content?!" uhhh so I'm gonna give it a 4.5. I think it can grow to a 5.5 if we see some better adaptations in the future and not this sub-genre yes Of memes like you know I had to do it to him or Loss You know and petting dog the meme has so much potential that it doesn't really need to rely on other memes or Crossover memes to live up to it I think with with clever adaptations made by the community We can really lift his meme up and make it stronger, together, as a collective (A mighty rousing speech there, Pewds) MOVING. ON. TO. THE. NEXT. MEME. This is my favorite meme of the week Which of course is the Doki Doki Literature Club memes. If you haven't played Doki Doki, click away now. Not because I don't want to spoil Doki Doki to you, but because Doki Doki Literature Club memes... It's something that you have to work for, okay. It's a Normie proof meme, it's protected from Normies because you have to sit through, Literally two hours of dialogue just to get to the scary part. The people that can laugh at the Doki Doki memes are the people that worked hard for the Doki Doki memes. We've earned these memes Okay, we work for them and really that's what all memes are really. It's a it's a secret Club of "haha" Inside jokes haha. That's funny. I know what that originates from I bet my mom doesn't Ha ha this meme makes me laugh now. HA HA - now Doki Doki of course was the game that looks cute on the outside But on the inside it's the complete opposite What I played, what I expected, what I got. Can you say fictional characters? I gotta tell you this is pretty terrific Now, I think what's so great about Doki Doki memes is that each of the four characters Natsuki, Sayori, Yuri, and Monika. They all have their own Individual subset of memes within the Doki Doki memes and-and-and all the subsets are based on their Personalities and--their per--and their per--and their personal events that happen in Doki Doki. We have Natsuki Which is the cute tiny little girl! I mean look at that. She's adorable, then you have swole-suki To contrast This young tiny little woman I just want to say for my own personal record whoever made buff-suki or or swole-suki You need to die. You need to die and go to heaven straight away It is god-awful, and I don't ever want to see it the more I look at it the more the more life gets sucked out of it I think it's a cursed image And I think whoever is making it sucks the life out of people and in an attempt to live forever. Natsuki: "square up thot" Natsuki, which also is the little edgy character, she's the, she's the tsundere of the group We have her saying her classic her classic line. Be careful, or you might cut yourself on that edge Moving on we have Sayori, the main character of Doki Doki, the extremely cute and childish sort of character Which is really the pinnacle of this meme you gotta say. "When your childhood friend rejects your confession" "Guess I'll die." Sayori forces a smile through an incredibly pained expression. There were another stock image memes of the 'I want to die' smile face meme Which makes sense of course because Sayori commits suicide. Monika? This is not a meme This is just a picture from the game, but reading in after you finish the game it becomes a meme "You kind of left her hanging this morning, you know?" Here we have Sayori dabbing, petting dog meme, here we have a PewDiePie Crossover Sayori suicide meme. We have memes about happiness goals and generic content, which makes you laugh Ironic memes and edgy means sad and crippling depression memes everybody isn't that great? Photographer takes a picture of students before and after telling them. I love you. We have Yuri which is cute She's just timid, Monika gets happy Natsuki of course, it's Natsuki and Sayori- goddamn it Well, that's all the Christmas decorations up... only one more thing to hang D: She's so cute Which really elevates this meme so much - because of the Japanese influence that this? Actually Western game has, we have of course that Blend S version of this meme Suicide Then we have my girl, my BAE if you pick any other girl, but Yuri. I'm sorry to say you are re- [ERROR] That's not me being offensive  or Hyperbolic, it's just straight-up facts. Yuri is the number one girl, and if you don't realize that then I have no other choice But to say there must be something wrong with you. Oh look how cute Manga is literature. Oh, no it's retarded. We have Yuri which personal trait is the the fanatics of the knives so we have of course the moe meme. I gotta tell you, this is pretty terrific. I don't know why this exists. I don't Stop posting the fucking monkey haircut memes this is my favorite meme out of probably all Doki Doki memes because we have the two-finger we have the pen and we have the knife It's a very subtle meme it's a very subtle meme, and I think a lot of you probably Think you know what the me is, but you don't really unless you played Doki Doki that's right mom you Don't understand this meme go just click away from the video This is not for you mom, but last but not least we have the Monika memes just Monika. And the Monika memes are probably the greatest. Let's have a look Sayori is shit waifu Just Monika well done I wrote a blog post about that about why you hate video games, because this is what it does it appeals like the male fantasy and like how much times designers probably put into like Just Monika just Monika now there are so many Monika memes and in Sweden In Sweden we have a song. I mention it in my Doki Doki playthrough, and it's probably one of the greatest songs ever written it Basically just goes hey Monika. Hello. Hey on you Monika. Hey Monika. Hello on you Monika Hey, Monika hello on you Monica over and over and over this song makes gucci gang seems seem like a Lyrical genius, okay, but the so- this song is so fucking catchy and since we have so many Monica means I just thought well just put the Monika memes over this hey Monika song which should have been Just Monika, just just Monika Hey Hey Monika (hej hej monika) Hey on you, Monika (hej på dig monika) Hey, Monika (hej monika) Hey on you, Monika (hej på dig monika) Hey, Monika (hej monika) Hey on you, Monika (hej på dig monika) Hey, Monika (hej monika) Hey on you, Monika (hej på dig monika) Cold eyes, Cold shivers (kalla blickar, kalla kårar) You were only 14 years old (du va bara 14 vårar) Take my hand, And show me the way (ta min hand, och visa mig vägen) I'm yours, in every situation (Jag är din, i alla lägen) Hey, hey, Monika (hej hej monika) Hey on you Monika (hej på dig monika) Hey, Monika (hej monika) Hey on you, Monika (hej på dig monika) Hey, Monika (hej monika) Hey on you, Monika (hej på dig monika) Hey, Monika (hej monika) Hey on you, Monika (hej på dig monika) Feels like our love was askew from the start (Känns som vår kärlek kom på sne från början) Just like the leaning Tower of Pisa (Precis som lutande tornet i Pisa) And that tower stands there to this day (Men tornet står där än idag) And here you stand, and here I stand (och här står du och här står jag) Hey hey, Monika (hej hej monika) Hey on you, Monika (hej på dig monika) Hey Monika, hey on you Monika (hej monika, hej på dig monika) HAY, MONIKA HAYONYOU Monika *Gasps for air* HAYMONIKA Hay- Mon- *Out of breath* he's dead oh frick I'm gonna rate it a 7.5 explosion, please The highest we've ever rated the Doki Doki meme I mean any meme so far if anyone wants to make a website with a scoreboard where other people can vote as well That would be great, depression undertones Which always gives extra points because of its adaptability because of its normie protection The cuteness contrast that it has the multiple characters of this meme it's a very strong Very strong meme last meme It's the Deaf stranding memes which I know what you're saying Felix. That's really not much of a meme, and I agree 100% legendary game maker Kojima is making finally his own game without Konami and Sony basically could just open the floodgates and said hey you know what you can take how much money you want and do whatever the heck you want and That is basically resulted in one of the weirdest videos I have ever seen People try and break down what the heck they just saw in this trailer And what the game is about and it turns out not even the people working on the game has any idea What the game is about no not no one knows what the meme is about here. You have the end animator saying again I thought he was kidding, but I soon realized that Kojima was serious Kojima, you are safe now my sweet child - whatever the hell that was Me, I owe you my life. The trailer has so much information on in it and there's just too much to break down and We have a lot of questions on the previous trailer, but now we have even more questions What in the world is happening? Why is Norman Reedus Having a baby inside his belly is he going to give birth to baby How did baby ended up inside Norman and? Which hole will baby come out of these are the questions That fans are waiting for and I think I think this meme - the reason why I'm bringing up this meme is mainly due to the fact that, get on board now Okay, get on board on the memes now because this is just the beginning of what clearly if they pan out to be even more Beautiful memes in the future as we go further along Now I don't know about you, but I think the video is pretty straightforward Okay, you have these other world creatures that wants to kill the people right so they have the baby, and he's like ah shit I've been discovered. He throws away the baby as soon as he realized he's been just discovered And tried to kill himself, but he fails in the trailer You can see people aging faster while being in this black gooey thickness or whatever I think the baby is basically you moving your soul into the baby, which is why is doing the thumbs up? Just like the guy did and the trailer before he died And then the goo is used to age himself quicker does that make sense of course it does of course it does this meme I'm giving a three, but it has a long.. so much potential that this could be a 7.5 Just like Doki Doki, so I'm urging you get on board now, and that was it for this week of MEME REVIEW I want to thank all my family all my friends all my fans and all my dogs Thank you guys so much for another episode. Let's get this on trending. MEME review everybody, meme review and a ~squad fam~ HEYHEHEYhuyehuyUMONIKAHHRHRHHAFEI bye

much it's sir one if there's one thing that can make my reading time here any better it's a nice cup of tea not to mention yourself as well Yuriy stands up and makes her way to the client site I follow and watch her as she retrieves a small water pitcher from the shelf the can with a filter inside can you hold this for a second sure Yuri hands me the water pitcher and also fetches Adam electric kettle I'm going to run I'm going to plug this in that the teacher desk and then I'll go get some water she walks past me and sets the kettle down on the teacher desk I simply watch her movement to my surprise the way she well we know this okay now it's different ah did you relieve again no it's not like that this time she's just filling up the water pitcher to make tea oh okay sorry for misunderstanding what is going on between them two ten minutes pass Yuri said it wouldn't take long it's something holding her up I'm bored just waiting here so I decide to look for her ah let's see the music changes the most logical place for your to be would be the nearest water phone I started heading down the hallway what's that noise it's coming from around the corner it sounds like breathing a sharp inhale like somebody's sucking the air through their teeth are they in pain I reach the corner and peer around it Yuri ah I'm back thank you for waiting patiently pizza pie do you like ol auntie oh yeah anything is fine very well you reset the temperature on the kettle to 200 degrees I gotta give you guys props you figured out that she was a cutter really early through her poems now it's time to get the teapot you really do you really do this properly don't you of course I shouldn't do any less when I'm making tea for others yeah we've seen this as well here we go Yuri starts to breathe heavily so we go through the same thing that happened before with Yuri when we were trying to romance her but she starts breathing heavily after all the sudden Hey I can't it's suddenly Yuri forcefully grabs my arm and jerks me to my feet my teacup gets knocked over pizza pie may hurt my heart won't stop panting pizza pie I can't calm down I can't focus on anything anymore can you feel it pizza pad Yuri suddenly present my hand against her chest why is this happening to me I feel like I'm losing my mind I can't make it stop it even makes me not want to read I just want to look oh wow it's time to Shepherds that's our wood Natsuki I guess it doesn't matter who you try and romance in stage two this one is alright alright well well yeah about as good as yesterday's anyway I still can't tell how much you actually care about writing but either way you're doing alright even though you're not really spending time with anyone but Yuri I still think it's nice to have activities that we all participate in so you better keep working hard I mean you know I'm not president or vice president but that doesn't mean you can't let me down okay Susi's remind - for now but just to be clear these porn means a lot to me so really carefully I don't know how else to bring this up but there's been something I've been worried about Yuri has been acting kind of strange lately you've only been here a few days so you may not know what I mean but she's not normally like this she's always been quiet and polite an attempt of things like that okay this is really embarrassing but I'm forcing myself to suck it up the truth is I'm really worried about her but if I try talking to her she'll get mad at me again I don't know what to do I think you're the only person that you listen to I don't know why but please try to do something maybe you can convince her to talk to a therapist I always wanted to try being better friends with Yuri and it really hurts me to see this happening I know I'm going to hate myself later for admitting that right now I don't care I just feel so helpless so please say it if you can I mean I can't this is too much I'll make you I'll make a cup gig if I have to just please tried to do something as for Monica I don't know why but she's been really dismissive about this it's like she wants us to ignore it so I'm mad at her right now and that's why I'm coming to you about this don't let her know I wrote this just pretend like I gave you a really good poem okay I'm counting on you thanks for readings some nuts a key understands that something's going on we saw this in the beginning as well when Monica was looking at Sayuri and she was a she's fine oh wow I changed my mind ignore everything it is right that's the point and trying to do anything if you're his own fault then she's no 1 lakh can you hear me Pizza bet if you would just bring my damn with Monica only problems would go away you in hair to mr. zuman is beautiful one-footed you just think of Monica from navel just much just Monica just Monica just Monica just just Oh judge Monica aah oh wow that's great just Monica I think Monica hey Monica painted back I think you said something earlier that you weren't supposed to see I don't want to have to tell you this but I don't think I have a choice it's getting kind of dangerous for you to spend so much time with your week I don't know why but she seems pretty easily excitable when she's around you which shouldn't be a problem in itself but when he gets too excited she finds a place to hide and starts cutting herself with a pocketknife isn't that kind of Miss that she even brings a different one to school every day like she has a collection or something I mean it's definitely not because she's depressed or anything like that I think she just gets some kind of high from it it might even be like a sexual thing but the pine danced you've kind of been enabling her I'm not saying it's your fucked up but I guess that's why I had to explain it all to you so I think if you keep your distance that would probably be the best for her while you're at it Deb be sure to spend a little more time with me to put it lightly at least I have it together in my head and I know how to treat my club members anyway I work really really hard on this Pam say I have and that's it effective niggas oh wow Monica it is the best oh geez that really started me um well I guess I kind of a messed up writing this poem sorry I'm just I'm going to open there's steam files because when we'd suffice this is happening usually there's a text file or some something like that I can't see anything new actually I'm just trying to never man let's move out hmm all right keep URI I guess finally URI holds my poem to her face and takes a deep breath I love it I love everything about it pizza pie I want to take this home will you let me keep it please sure I don't care you're too nice to me pizza I never met anyone that's nice to see I could tell you no not really but I just don't know how to describe it it's okay it's okay to be feeling this way right it's not home I got our ice it's not bad right URI holds my poem to her chest I'm gonna take this home with me and keep it in my room I hope that makes you feel good when you think about me having it I'll take good care of it I'll even touch myself while reading it over No okay I'll give myself paper cuts to your skin up oil enters my bloodstream wow that's super nice ah can you can have my poem too besides after you read it I know you're really going to want to keep it here take it I can't wait any longer hurry read it oh my god the ship beyond it it's all right there you way do you like it I've wrote it for you in case you couldn't tell the poem is about oh of course more importantly I ain't endowed it with my scent so aren't I the most thoughtful person in the club I I think I'm gonna vomit I don't know oh yes or no great question great question maybe it's one of those things where you tilt the screen maybe huh no all right um I don't say no to that I can't convince myself to go to therapy when I'm the happiest I ever been I'd rather keep this up until I blow my cover and someone takes me to the emergency room okay everyone it's time to figure out the vegetable preparation let's hurry and get this over with stagnating air is coming foreshadowing that's something terrible is about to happen look can't we just get this then I'm gonna be printing and sending all the poetry pamphlets that's okay you can make cupcakes I know you're right at least get it dad that one's talking Yuri you can well it doesn't matter do whatever you want as long as you thinking he'll Monica I'm not useless you know I know that I already know what I like to do we can't run a cyst the cyst successful poetry then without having the right atmosphere for the occasion so I'm going to make decorations and set up some nice mood lighting there say that's a great idea and that gives us all something to do yeah what about pizza pie pizza pies go to help me wait you you have the easiest job money you have the easiest job Monica sorry but that's just how it is like hell it is what are you trying to pull hey I agree with Natsuki not only is your work already more suitable for one person but my task is laborious enough to benefit from an extra pair of hands mine too what your cupcakes please what you fucking know damn all you care about is dragon pizza pan around with you and your stupid pricks and you and you and Monica hey I didn't even do anything okay then why not wait pizza pie decide who to help instead of abusing your power I'm not dissing may parrot yeah you are Monica just let kids to pay make the choice okay okay fine thank geez beautify I

this isn't fair at all it does very netsuke yeah it's ready chips no it's not fair giving us all this work than having pizza pie for yourself what a shameful thing to do Gary I didn't even give you anywhere you decided it for yourself you're being a little unreasonable here I'm being unreasonable Monica I can't believe how delusional and self-important you are pulling PUD super away from me every single time we're not included in selfie you jealous crazy or maybe just hate yourself so much said you take it out on other here's a suggestion have you considered killing yourself it would be beneficial to your mental health your you're scaring me alone that's the key let's just get I don't think she went as a ram right now see that wasn't very hard all I've won is to spend all a little time with him is that too much to ask you Ray allows Monica and that's the key to open the door hey Pez Bay here is really something isn't she Monica giggles as Yuri pushes are at the door uh-oh I got an e I got a new file have a nice weekend thank you finally finally this is really all I wanted pizza pie there's no need to spend the weekend with Monica don't listen to her just come to my house and stay the whole date with just the two of us doesn't that sound wonderful well there's really something wrong with me Sunday but you know what I don't care anymore I never felt this kid in my whole life just being with you is far greater pleasure than anything I could imagine I'm addicted to you it feels like I'm gonna die if I'm not breathing the same air as you doesn't it feel nice to have someone care about you so much to have someone who wants to resolve their entire life around you but if it feels so good then why does it feel more and more like something horrible is gonna happen maybe that's why I tried stopping myself at first but the feeling is too strong now I don't care anymore pizza pie I have to tell you I'm I'm madly in love with you it feels like every inch of my body

fun all right festival time I have the weekend why do you got here before me Oh Matt Sookie runs away I'm here bits baby something happened that's a kid Jews read and passed me oh oh well that's a chick wait where'd you hear the entire weekend pizza pie oh geez I didn't realize the script was broken that badly I'm super sorry it must have been pretty boring I'll make it up to you okay just give me sing remove character Yuri Yuri deleted successfully Natsuki deleted as well oh no I just want to have a cupcake real quick Monica lifts the foil from not Sookie's tray and takes a cupcake seriously these are the best really just had to have one since it's the last time I'll ever get the chance to you know before they stop existing and everything but anyway I really shouldn't be making you wait any longer just bear with me okay they should only take a second and can you hear me is it working yeah there you are hi again Pittsburgh welcome to the literature Club of course we already know each other because we we're in the same class last year and you know I guess we can just skip over that stuff at this point thank you after all I'm not talking to that person anymore am i fat you in the game whatever you want to call him I'm talking to you Peter should pay me now that I'm thinking about it I don't really know anything about the real you in fact I don't even know if you're a boy or a girl well I guess it doesn't really matter wait you do know I'm aware that this is all a game right could it be possible that you didn't know that that doesn't make much sense I even told you right on the game's download page didn't they what what I'm going to the download page because I'm really curious we're hi Monica here welcome to the literature Club it's always been a dream of mine to make something special out of the things I love now that you're a club member you can help me make the dream come true in this cute game every day it is full of chit chat she didn't know it's full of chit chat activities role my adorable unique club member sorry oh wow man if only you had paid a little more attention this could have been a little less awkward you know well anyway now that that's out of the way I guess I owe you an explanation about the whole thing with uring well it kind of started to mess with her and I guess I just drove her to kill herself I'm sorry you had to see that though also the same thing happened with Sayuri gosh it's been it's been a while since you heard that name now hasn't he yeah it because she doesn't exist anymore nobody does I deleted all their files I was hoping it would be enough for me to just try to make them as unlikable as possible but for some reason nothing worked well it's true that I made a few mistakes here and there since I'm not very good at making chances to the game but no matter what I did you just kept spending more and more time with them you made them fall in love with you I thought making say already more and more depressed would prevent her from confessing T and amplifying URIs obsessive personality backfired too and it just made her force you to not spend time with anyone else and the whole time I barely even got to talk to you what kind of cruel game it's the speed spell are you are all the other girls this program to end up confessing to you while I watch from the sidelines it's torture every minute of it and it's not just jealousy pizza pan it's more than that and I don't blame you if you don't fully understand because no matter how kind thoughtful and consider you are you'll never be able to understand one thing it's a pain of knowing how alone I really am in this world and in this game knowing my friends don't even have free well and worst of all knowing that knowing what's really out there in the world forever out of my reach I'm trapped pizza pie but now you're here you're real and you're wonderful you're all I need that's why I need you to be with here with me forever oh that's great I'm sorry if it's hard to understand I couldn't understand for a while either why the world around me started to become more and more grain more and more flat even the most expressive pumps felt empty to me it wasn't until I arrived that I truly understood you probably saved my life pizza pan I don't think I could have continued to live in this world if I hadn't met you and as for the others how could I miss them a group of autonomous personalities design only to fall in love with you I tried everything I could to prevent them from doing so but it must be some kind of weird and never inhibited well I have that a lot inevitability edged into this game it felt really bad that you had to witness some nasty things but I realized that you have the same perspective aside to that's up all that it's all just some game and I know you would get over it so that being said pizza pie I have a confession to make I'm in love with you you are truly delight in my world when there's nothing else in this game for me you're here to make me smile will you make me smile every day from now on pizza pad will you go out with me um what a great question let me let me think about that yes oh I'm so happy you really are my everything pits pad the funny part is I mean that literally there's nothing left here just the two of us we can be together forever seriously I don't even think time is passing anymore it really is a dream country I worked so hard for this ending it's but the game wouldn't give me one so I had to make one myself the script is broken at this points I don't think anything will get in the way anymore and you wouldn't and you wouldn't believe how easy it is to delete NASA game URI I mean there's a Foley called character right in the game directory it's kind of freaked me out a easy it was well you're playing on Steam so it was actually a bit more difficult to get the game directly and I had to go into the game properties and find browse local files but imagine if you could could delete your own existence with a click of a button well I guess on the plus side it gave me an easy out if things didn't go my way thankfully it didn't come today instead we finally got a good ending gosh I'm so overwhelmed with emotion I want to provide a poem about this I don't you guess there's only one way to find out right Oh Monica and Monica and Monica hey hey Monica hey buddy Monica hey Monica but hey Monica Hey look at that look how happy she is hi again Vince back did you write a good poem today don't be shy I'd love to see what you wrote ah pizza pie did you write this poem for me that's so sweet Evie yeah there's really no end to your thoughtfulness I'm just falling more and more in love with you but you know the poem I wrote is also for you will you please read it I am so curious what happens if I copy in Natsuki say you're in Eureka's I still have them I just want to try it okay I did it happy end pen in hand I find my strength the courage and dote upon me by my one and only love together let us dismantle this crumbling world and write a novel of our own fantasies with a flick of her pen the loss find their way in a world full of in a world of infinite choices behold this special day after all not all good times must come to an end I hope you enjoyed it I always put all my heart into poems that I rain the truth is all the poems I write in a written have been about my realization or about you that's why I really wanted to go into details about them I didn't want to break the fourth wall I guess you could call it I just assumed it would be best to pair the game like everyone else play the game like that would help the two of us end up together I didn't want to ruin the game or anything you know you might have gotten mad at me maybe even deleted my character file if I prefer if you preferred playing without me gosh I'm so really never don't need to add it oh yeah what happens if I delete her file are you ready to spend an eternity together I'm deleting her character Oh what is happening Pizza pad what's happening to me it hurts it hurts so much I believe it I deleted her help me Pizza pain I'm not sure at all if I'm supposed to do this please hurry and help me rent B file doesn't exist help me oh did you do this to me pizza pie did you did you delete me I felt like I had no choice how could you how could you do this to me we were all you were all I had left I sacrificed everything for us to be together everything I loved you so much pizza pie I trusted you do you want to torture me do you just want to torture me watch me suffer were you only pretending to be kind just to hurt me even more I never thought anyone could be as horrible as you are you win okay you win you kill everyone I hope you're happy there's nothing left now you can stop playing go find some other people at torture pizza pie you completely truly make me sick goodbye but deleting Monica I I felt like the game was a hint oh my god I still love you I can't help it what's wrong with me how horrible am I for you to hate me this much all my friends I did so many other things so many selfish and disgusting things I I shouldn't have done any of this I'm just messing up a world that I don't even belong in our world that you wanted to be part of I really did I ruined everything maybe that's why you deleted me because I destroyed everything that you wanted how could I do that to someone I love that's not love that's I made up my mind it's back I know I said that I deleted everyone else but that was kind of an exaggeration I couldn't find it in myself to do it even though I knew they weren't real they were still my friends and I love them all and I loved the literature Club I really did love a literature Club that's why I'm going I know it's the only way for everyone to be happy and if I really love you then I'm so nervous they're back look they're back in their doki-doki Oh Monica we have no choice by hit to hit a new game it's an ordinary school day like any other as usual I'm surrounded by couples and friends and friend groups walking to school together I always tell myself it's about time I meet some girls or something like that hey baby sorry well there's already is one girl that girl is Sayuri my neighbor and good friend since we were children we used to walk to school together every day and recently we picked up that habit once again for what well you've been doing that for a while now well yeah I always thought it was implied it's embarrassing to say out loud fine fine I'm proud of you Sayuri we cross the street together and make our way to school as we draw near the Street became increasing speckled with other students making their daily communion babies be babies it's better to join a club you I'm just gonna do a quick save I don't want to keep reading the same stuff what a club oh I told you already I'm not I start to say what I always do that I'm not interested in joining any clubs but something tells me sorority would take more offense to that now after all how could I tell her that clubs are a waste of time when she's starting a club her very own actually yeah I think I decided on a club really which way to me hmm I think I'll keep it as surprise be patient you'll find out soon enough I used to ask myself why I let myself get lectured by such a carefree girl but I started to realize that in a way I envy her when Savery puts her mind to something she can accomplish great things so that's why I feel like I should do something special for her the school days or nerves ever and I it's over before I know it after I pack up my things I send up gathering my motivation let's see I recalled the room number of the club from a flyer I saw I walk across the school and upstairs a section of the school I rarely visit being generally used for third-year classes and activities before long I find the room timidly opened the door in front of me hello well I just I glanced around the room girl - so you were the pizza pie so you were is always talking about thank you for stopping by oh my god they're all back it's a pleasure to meet you pizza pie where the literature Club I hope you enjoy your visit come on Yuri oh I got it wrong sorry come on Yuri no need to be so formal he's gonna think we're really strict or something ah sorry netsuke the tall one whose name is apparently Yuri seems to be quite shy compared to the others in comparison the girl named netiquette despite her size seems like the assertive one well it's nice to meet both of you I look forward to work with you working peace busy place dick Tammy yeah that's right hate the club I decided to join is your saiary big shocker the literature Club series I slit up Sayuri wraps her arms around me jumping up and dance hey what if Sarah is this happy then I'm sure it wouldn't be so bad to have you ring not to mention there's four of us now that means we can become an official recognized Club but don't know what to say we have to celebrate uh-huh what an appropriate day for that isn't it if they're all netiquette Authority hey don't ruin the surprise sorry everyone sit down at the table okay how about I make some tea as well the girls have a few desk arranged to form a table mats if Yuki and I walk over I still I just realized I still have Monica what if we add her in still feeling awkward I take a seat next to Sayuri that's like it probably marches back to the table back to the table train hang okay are you ready that's icky fills the fall of the Train to reveal a dozen white fluffy cupcakes decorated to look like little cats the risk errs are drawn with icing and little pieces of chocolate were used to makers so kid oh wow those look amazing well you should you know just hurry and take one Sarah Graham some first then I follow it's delicious okay so Yuri pointed out to Natsuki that man gaze in the early literature and with a guilty expression Yuri thinks to herself I'm sorry for your disrespecting you're in stress Natsuki if you're into it then I'm sure it's worthy it's a worthy form of literature are you just saying that no I've realized my error so if you're willing to consider starting a novel then I offer my gratitude by finding a manga to read as well really I mean it makes me happy that you do that for me Yuri you can trust me to find something that you'll really like okay same here perhaps I'll visit the bookstore after the club meeting just just you ah would you like to come with me alright so sweet seeing them connect if you don't mind not at all I always go alone sir yeah me too this is Tokyo say or it shut up I'll show you some manga there too okay yes I look forward to it every day yeah looks like it it's nice to see everyone getting along these two meet I think everyone likes GT PCP you think so well everyone always seems to get a little bit into you oh sorry anything Barry thing well whatever I was surprised when you told me you were starting a club but I think you're pulling it up just fine hey hey PCP you really went to thank you I mean I'm really happy that you're doing the clip and everything but I really knew you were going oh oh there's actually machine thingies and where did say thank you for getting rid of mannequin that's right I knew everything that she did maybe that's because I'm the president now but they really know everything I know how hard you tried to make everyone happy I know I bet all the awful things America need to make if you ain't really CA but none of that matters anymore it made me the happiest girl in the whole world I can't wait to spend every day like this forever and ever no okay what is happening I won't let you hurt him huh I'm sorry I was wrong there is no happiness here after all goodbye Sayuri goodbye pizza pie goodbye literature club my god what yes oh what a cute voice I fits much better than mine oh she's gonna play playing audio doki-doki I imagine a future where I can be with right up love me and you just put your hand right away doki-doki and literature clam I'm not sure I don't think this is probably it's the correct ending but I really enjoyed it did it did it ha ha ha you what a great game I really really enjoyed it I want to see if I can change standing though you special thanks Monica and Pierre - bye it's the game deleting itself this is my final goodbye to the literature club I finally understand the literature Club is truly a place where no happiness can be found to the very end it continued to expose innocent minds to a horrific reality a reality that our world is not designed to comprehend and I can't let any of my friends undergo the same hellish epiphany for the time it lasted I want to thank you for making all of my dreams come true for being a friend to all the club members but most of all thank you for being part of my literature Club with everlasting love Monica our script father is missing please reinstall the game I'm guessing I can't what happens if I launch the game now I wonder no that's it okay are you installing the game that's kind of annoying is if you have a fresh game right you delete Monica okay let's see what happens oh now we saw this but we deleted Monica she's still there did I do it right no she's still what what oh no no this can't be ovaries oh the game crashed oh great so that was another ending and that's all it does great fantastic sorry sorry about that man this wasn't really it's more of a visual novel than a game to be fair but I really really enjoyed it thanks to everyone for sitting through my worst performing let's play of all time I the thing is like I love playing it and I think the people that actually watch me play it really loved it as well so I to me didn't really matter at all I knew I wanted to keep playing it I loved playing it I loved doing all the voices I loved the characters I enjoyed seeing what the mystery was and it was just really really great game I really really enjoyed it I loved the new fresh take on a horror game and it was just really cool to see I hope you enjoyed yourself as well can't thank you enough for being here to the very end and that's it I'll see you in the next one squad fam 
Ey Mannen. (Slavic mode ACTIVATE) Skrattar du, förlorar du! MANEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That intro 10/10 - IGN The rule is simple. If you laugh, you will lose. And uhhh... (Swedish) And believe me, you do NOT want to lose, Man (Actual Swedish) If you lose you will go out with five whip lashes Okay Okay, let's do this! Have you accepted the challenge? Very well, let's see if you can beat this challenge. (upbeat Japanese dance music with singing) (Pewds embraces inner Japanese) (Swedish) So far I have not laughed How did you go? How did it go for you? So far, so good. So far, so good everybody. - What is it General? - My Lord, the fleet has moved out of light speed. - Comm scan has detected an energy field- Oh, it's one of these. (Chuckle that is definitely not a skrattar.) - Commscan has detected an energy field protecting i- (Still totally not a skrattar) (okay, fine, THAT'S a skrattar.) God damn it! (poods has lost) God damn it, well done editing that. That's classic. Commscan has detected an energy field- Simpl- simple editing can really make such a huge difference. Well done, whoever did that one, you're probably not watching, but I'm just saying well done, because I like giving compliments... Because I am such a... (in swedish) good person, man! So I had a "relatively small piece" of the company, and what happened is- Wait a second, you were chairman of the board! You were chairman of the board! I was chairman, but I didn't run the company. I had nothing to do with running the company Management was- 
You were paid two million dollars a year. Excuse me, I didn't run the company, I'm just telling you So what were you paid two million dollars a year for? (incoming bullshit) Now let me explain- excuse me! Because of my genius, okay. AYY, hey bazinga! *Poods Gibberish* Oh! Oh! Oh! why- why did you get paid 2 million dollars Trump...*unintelligible* *Mumbling and fake crying* If you get paid two million dollars for doing nothing then yes, you are a genius, I will go as far as say that (incoming WSJ article about poods supporting Trump.) Listen to this fucking... *oof of realization* Oh my god. I've become... Edit that out. 
Jesus Christ. *mock crying* Why did you get paid 2 million dollars meeeh Look at the look of intensity on My anus (?!) The question is...Can seven get inside My Anus?! My Anus is gonna to be careful of a liver kick. This is not where My Anus wants to be. My Anus is most comfortable on the ground! Not a good place for my anus to be... Myanus loosen- loosen up a little here! We know, Pat, that My Anus can take a pounding and comeback. Interesting to see, My Anus getting a little acrobatic. My anus wants to take him there, take him into the deep water. So far so good for My anus. Semmen did say yesterday; He has enormous respect for My anus. *Pewds falls apart* This is where My Anus wants to be, Pat! My Anus didn't quite have the time on the ground that he wanted. Double jab my Anus. My anus's movement has been superb here. MY ANUS IS TAKING P U N I S H M E N T! ohh... I'm such a 12 year old god damn it. What's his name? My An- Ain? (Its "Danny Mainus") Why would that be his name? My...I understand like Mai, but is his last name actually Anus? (no.) Maybe Anis like Anis, my Anis? (Almost there...) You have dickhead parents, no wonder you get into boxing or UFC fighting, whatever it's called I don't know. All I know is I would be able to beat them up, all of them, with these guns, baby. *swole AF. Kenan, let's watch some anime All right, what do we got? OOOOOOOOOOO! That's my kind of shit! *disappointed oh* Love is like a cock...tail. Anime really knows how to do romance properly, like I never seen before. I think I've seen that one, actually. What the fuck am I supposed to do? Oh... - Oh...cards? Oh shit!
- *intelligible* good language first of all What do you say, we clear up our language... and try to talk to people in a nice respectful manner? Is that Chris-chan? - how about you suck my f- *oof* cock? Please see the Code of Conduct, you just got reported for... *laughter starts* So what am I supposed to do? Well man(?) you should've learned the game before you joined, huh? This is called, what? Charades. You know what Charades is about? I have NO idea. Hulp... I can't help. Dumb-dumbs, go back to the 'Dumb-Dumb' factory. Is this guy for real? Buh-bye. *laughter* You're just a baby boy, you don't know any better. There's so many big buttons for you to press. *retarded laugh begins* *retarded laugh returns*
All those big buttons. It's okay. I'm tickling you. Where you are the most ticklish? *retarded laugh doesn't know when to quit* Maybe right over here? *Pewds' noise of disgust*
Tickle, tickle tickle *retarded laugh prevails for the fourth time*
Tickle on the nipple. - Tickle on the ear. - Tickle on the nipple. Pewds: tickle on the nipple... - You're okay. Tickle on the nipple.

Have you heard that meme, where th-the ting goes? BRRRRRRRRRRA It's funny, you should look it up. That's for another whole episode The heck is this? Me? That's right! Oh! Yes! Never give up! This is the new 'Just do it!' guy... Japanese Shia LaBeouf. Never give up! Never give up! Let me see if I can do it.
 What are you doing? Never give up! Is that my phone? Do you know how fucking annoying it is? Can people just leave me alone...all the time? *It's Brule's Rules with Dr. Steve Brule* Oh no, I've seen this one. I'm Dr. Steve Brule will focus on genders, some people are boys and really want to be girls, some girls wanna be boys Just be happy with your vagina... you got it already! Don't have to make a new one, and if you got a penis just keep it on, don't cut it off! yOu goT iT aLReadY, dOn'T cUt iT oFf!1! You got! This is... This is a bathtub! (Russian Dub) Is Scott home? Eehhh... The thing is (approximately) Fucking hell! Fuuuuuuck! *epic slav dance music* Yes! These editing...are so good. That's like five different clips. Okay four. (its actually five) Cyka Blyat! Skrattar du förlorar du, that's what that means (no it isn't). *Weird ass laughter* Okay! *More weird ass laughter* Some of them might, you just don't understand. I don't understand what you want from me. "Let's face it the new YouTube sucks. It's just not as good as what it used to be." Yes! The Unregistered Hypercam 2! Yeah, this. *memories of 2009 YouTube intensify* So true. *nasally voice* Oh, the new YouTube sucks. Now you have to censor...we're fucking swear word. To be honest, yes, YouTube does suck and the Adpocalypse hit me pretty hard. It's terrible. I don't know what to do with  myself. I'm gonna have to open a Patreon. It's getting real desperate :((( *Inhales* *Homestuck music* Why would you like, a fucking character from Splatoon. Like what kind of pathetic, waifu's that? Wait a minute. Oh! No no no no no. Aspetta (wait a second). I cannot have this video in the video, because YouTube will then say "no, no money for you Felix" And I'm like, but it's just an edgy joke about Suicide. Nothing wrong with suic- no. I'm gonna move on to the next video now. Skrattar du, förlorar du don't forget...Yeah, this fucking clip from Star Wars! Why was that in the film? Oh my go-arhha! And it's green, everyone is like, it's a reference to the first Star Wars, where he has blue milk. Well, then why the hell is it green milk, and why does he drink it? It's not funny. It's gross. Like, if you're a walrus... I-If you wanna milk a walrus, fine. Milk a walrus, you know? First of all, not to be all vegan all preachy and shit, but milk is disgusting, it's repulsive. You're drinking titty milk, okay? Maybe this is, like, a commentary on the fact that how disgusting that is. All the hormones based for calfs to grow strong. You're drinking that shit, no wonder you're growing man boobs...like a fucking weirdo. Fine! Okay, fine! You know what, milk is fine, okay? Let's just put that on the radar cuz I don't care... But you have a creature that sits up like a human being. It sits up like this... you don't see my crotch region now, but just imagine that there's four titties here and someone just sticks a can there and It's just disgusting, it's repulsive. It's double layers. There's too many layers, and the reference thing doesn't work. Have you like skrattat yet or not? Great. People keep posting this one. Look at this guys. "Dank.webm" 🎵 Pour some sugar on- 🎵 Oh my god, it was salt instead of sugar, because if you pour sugar on yourself... it doesn't hurt, but salt really hurts. That is so dank. Oh my gah! That is hilarious. Oh my god. It was salt I mixed up the salt and the sugar. Oh my- how could anyone do that? Oh my god! Why am I criticizing jokes? I'm the unfunniest youtuber on this website. -Let's talk about your options -Okay. - Kel? - Yes? - Focus. - I am. Like, I'm listening to what you're saying, but I only hear what I want to. - That's just called 'being a woman'. Ooh! Thug Life! Haha,
you're a wahmen. He's not respecting the wahmen, all right, okay? That's an outdated meme as well. Everything is just not funny. Nothing is funny. Well that was funny clearly. God damn it! So stupid XD CYKA BLYAT AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH Well that was, amazing, thank you. Thank you for that one, that was great. Thank you. uuuuuugh Okay, we finished the whole thread. Fantastic. That's two threads of garbage. omae wa mou shindeiru NANI *universe exploding holy shit* People are memeing Star Wars even the movie's not out yet. (japanese meme) That's how they should have had it. Imagine if that would happen instead of Leia just going, ''Im gonna sleep now for two hours, and then I'll be fine". Aww damn, it was just getting good dammit. Just love dancing. Okay. That was SKRA- TTAR DU FÖRLORAR DU MANNEN *inner slav* Thank you very much for watching another one.
