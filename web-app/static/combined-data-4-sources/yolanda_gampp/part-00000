subscribe this channel and make sure to hit that notification bell so you know when I've made a new crappy cake this is your freezing this I am or good yeah it makes poop from the upcoming emoji movie chocolate is going to go on a while my two 8-inch round and two seven inch round chocolate cakes are out of the pen I'm going to level them and then as an and layers and peach into two layers next up I call into squeeze he's relaxing I feel calm chillin if you're wondering if we bought a pool floatie sisters please of course didn't we taken everyone to fill this poop cake I am using both chocolate ganache and chocolate buttercream and I'm also going to add some mini chocolate chips to the chocolate it's what's on the inside that counts I am redefining to that's what I'm doing I'm taking the words back we're going to make it ours we're going to make it positive this poop cake is like rich and chocolatey and delicious I'm going to make poop number one oh yeah now I have eight layers of cake stacked up and filled with alternating layers of ganache and chocolate buttercream in chocolate chip rich Jeremy how did it it smell it only will say like oh he thinks his poop doesn't stink his food doesn't I think who doesn't think he smells like chocolate on chocolate on chocolate you may have noticed something new about me I did it I got tattoos if you guys want your own tattoo temporary of course we have limited quantities of watermelon birthday cupcake and then we also have my giant chocolate chip mint ice cream called and my pasty being had a cake a temporary tattoo have already been sent out to keep the club members and their also in the summertime bunnies you can get your own at how to take it calm join wrestling now that my cupcake is chilled and the buttercream is set it's time to carve him into a piece of well you took a big drop right I use my serrated knife and I carved poop I did made myself a template it was just flat but I sort of used it to hold up against the cake and make sure my peak was high enough he was sort of rounded enough has like some girth at the bottom even with simple shapes is important to carve away little by little because it's easier to just keep carving than it is to try and put it back you don't want to have to build cake back up because it could end up looking like the very thing I'm carving right now I'm really happy with this piece of so I am going to crumb coat him in you know if you want to see more emoji cakes and other character cake there's a playlist right here [Music] time to I try poop cake once again in chocolate ganache and chill him a final time I don't know if you've seen the trailers of his upcoming movie but who obviously thinks he's hot so I'm going to put them in the fridge to chill out I need to make some of poops facial features now because they are going on underneath the fondant so first I want to make his eyeballs I've rolled out some white gum paste I need to cut an oval and as I roll I kind of create a little hump because I wanted us to be like two dimensional that's helping you Bryn I roll out more white gum paste and use my template for the shape he's definitely laughing about thank you to me probably the fact would be cold food probably for his eyebrows I rolled out some modeling chocolate cut out the shape of his eyebrows using my templates and then I gave him some texture with a veining tool this one's got some thick eyebrows I just want to put it up there for his pupils I'm rolling out some black fondant really really thin using a small oval cutter to cut them out and then I'm going to create a little bit of shine in his eye I just use my template to mark out where that triangle is and what I do to accentuate it is paint the entire pupil with a little bit of black food coloring and not paint best inner triangle that little triangle is less matte black and the recipes people is a shiny alert block oh yes I'll look it up fit your hands like a meaning that's somewhere ridiculous here's something I love about poop he is so different you know how a lot of my character cakes have catch lights and if you don't check out that play I mentioned earlier poops catch light r-square that's what makes poop so fabulous he has black Ashworth this print white bow tie I'm rolling out some white gum paste nice and thin get this full time looks like a minute that's hawlucha here like if you were pooped would you choose a white botas is risky it's just good I was thinking about how to create the linen texture and the best thing I thought of on the slide was I had some canvas plain canvas I laid it on top and then rolled my fondant pin over it and that created that linen texture in my gum pain then I cut out two equal sized bands and pinched both ends of each band together now I need to fold the two pinched ends up onto each other creating a loop and to keep that loop open I just took a little bit of cleaver towel rolled it up and put it inside so just something a soft cushion to allow it to drive out with finally I need to make the center part of the bone so I cut out a little band from my linen gum paste and wrap it around those two bows where they meet in the center before I cover poop I need to add his eyeballs and history I add them directly onto the ganache surface I use my template to help guide where they should be and now that they're secure it's time to cover poop in chocolate fondant what if somebody tunes in like right there it's time to cover poop in chocolate fondant I roll out my chocolate fondant large enough to cover this whole piece of poop and then I pick it up with my French rolling pin and drape it over I'm going to smooth this cake with my hands because while he's like give me soft using my fingertips to really smooth around the eyeballs and the grin I tell as much fun as they can underneath and trim away the excess [Music] now it's time to cut open till I focus on golf also what if you tuned in right here basically his eyeballs are completely covered and I need to help poopsie the light of day so I'm going to use a sharp paring knife and I'm going to cut the fondant that is on the bottom half of his eyes and then around the eyeball this way the fondant that remains looks like eyelid I also need to unleash his grin on the world because what a grim I use a sharp paring knife once again to cut away the excess and reveal his to perfect teeth it's the thing I love most about this emoji movie is that it's about self love and being your best self no matter what anyone else thinks of you you're going to take it as a team we really try to encourage each other to do that and we all play a different school you guys obviously know Jocelyn maybe you've heard cheer me a couple of times her dementia caught on and is terrible sleeping but you don't get to hear a lot about Connie who is an integral part of how to keep it she does a whole lot of things that you guys don't get to hear about including finding all of the things that we fell on how to Kiki calm dreaming them up working with different artists to create things like it's berries of celery watermelon festive first we would not be able to lounge in a pool without Connie July 26 which is tomorrow is Connie's birthday silicon is a low vision plenty of happy birthday or head over to Connie's Instagram and leave her a clink emoji funny lucky Connie you love you so much we hope you know it now we've told the world let's get Marvin gave a thing for Connie or huh [Music] that was the Marvin Gaye Connie birthday remix oh yes I need to do poops hair for his very crossed ways I take some chocolate fondant and just create so it was like a big long teardrop actually at one point it was dangerously close to poop not gonna lie - poop is a bit of a hipster look at me error hipster right with a linen bowtie yes linen go time he's bringing back the wave yeah I think I saw one I think they won't get that Torontonians you you know exactly where possible so I've created this sort of long teardrop with a point at the end and then I actually used some more chocolate fondant underneath his bangs at the back just to prop up that way OOP needs his pupils his eyebrows i glue them onto his face is a little bit of clear piping gel and now he should people charming you know he's the traveling piece of poop I think now I need to make his arms and leg and to get a sense of how long I want them to be I'm going to place poop on the cakes and I roll out two chords with chocolate fondant and I'm going to place a wire inside each tube to help prop up this way you know stick legs good yep move that stick legs stick legs on like long thin feet and then I also shape his foot at the end so bending that tube and then just shaping his foot enemy to it while I make the arms I just need to leave these legs in the position they're going to new place so I hold them up against the cheeks and and bend his knees and I'm just gonna leave them to the side of poop for now while I move onto the arms for his arms I want them to be like fixing and adjusting his bow time so I make them similar to the way that I made its legs and feet and actually the bottom or the top like this I roll this on it a little flatter and then use a knife to cut out fingers and then I gently use my fingertips to sort of round out so sharp edges that I cut so they look like it's three three fingers in the fun [Music] now it's time to place his hands and legs onto the cake so unfortunately I have to lift him off the stand so I can secure his legs and arms on the stand and then I place the arms on on either side keeping in mind that I want this position and against just his full time now I need to move poop back on the stand with the help of Jeremy Thank You Jeremy right now poop is number two but when I have this women bow tie he will be number one [Music] clear out pee I'm flushing the toilet is the new number one in town oh my god and it's this time and then I just want to take your pants and rest them on each one of the boulders so it looks like you just enjoy whatever they call me number two but I'm not they fix my linen boat on yo time to cut it - yep I've never had someone tell me why but you know what something odd happened i completely ran out of napkins and paper holds nothing what idea water kolinsky well poop that's

welcome back to how to kick it I'm Yolanda and this week I'm making a cake inspired by rarity from My Little Pony I think I should have just said welcome it to how to cake it I'm Yolanda and cake rarity you get it to make this cake I baked eight pounds of my ultimate vanilla cake dried teal pink and purple I removed the case from their pans leveled them and remove the carmelization from the bottom and the sides looking at my three layers before simple Sierra thing I realized I wanted another layer so thank goodness there was a funfetti layer of cake available in my fridge sir squeeze is next well since his makeover sir squeeze got a girlfriend she is hot hot pink she's collapsible you know what that means don't you no I don't either just sir squeeze and his girlfriend funnel I've been told that's her name are available in a deluxe bundle right now and had a cake accom I'm going to fill these layers with guess what Italian meringue buttercream and once i'm happy i give the outside a good crumb coat and chill even though rarity is white on the outside i think she's full of color on the inside that's why i made this cake so colorful so if you agree that cake is magic please share this video with everyone else that agrees with you there's a button below do you think my name is rarity because she was rare i'm not i'm actually not gonna get into it with the my little pony fence because last time Jeremy you were in here but I got slaughtered because I called Rainbow Dash's cutie mark a butt tattoo so slaughtered with comments now it's time to ice this cake one more time and chill it I am going to use a combination of a bench scraper and a spatula because I want it to be nice and straight even though uncovering it with fondant or on please insert dancing My Little Ponies [Music] don't forget guys for every cake I make here on how to cake it I make a blog post at how to kick it calm and there are all the recipes included that you will need if you want to make this cake I'll put a link in the description below and while you're there you can check out the cake is magic sale that were happy you get a unicorn bundling you get a unicorn bundle and you get a unicorn bundle yes I know you have lots of bundles that involve unicorns while my cake is chilling I'm gonna take this opportunity I said an opportunity already you're taking a lot about I am taking a lot of opportunities I'm gonna take this opportunity to make my rarity horn and yours I am using some white fondant then I'm just gonna strengthen with a little bit of CMC so I just need that in and then for the whore and what I want to do is roll a long sort of cord of fondant and I want it to taper off at one end so to be thinner at one end and a bit thicker at the other and then I'm gonna brush a lollipop stick with a little bit of clear piping gel now I need to wrap that corner fondant around the lollipop stick and I want the thinnest part to be the tip of the horn at the top of the stick and then I need to pick up that cord and literally wrap it around the stick Jeremy's daughter was kind enough to lend me part of her collection of My Little Ponies rarities horn is not quite unicorn like it's very unique I think that's why she's all rarity it doesn't have as many you know coil I should know that word I feel is this the episode where we were eating seaweed crackers Jeremy and there was one attached to the back of my head yeah there was a seaweed yeah it's so light I feel like I I don't I have no idea mice where my hair has hands it's like so I wanted to make sure to have the same number of coils on my cake as there is on rarity or at least on a rarity doll I should say so I didn't want to dry the horn laying down because that means part of it would have flattened so what I did is I took the exposed portion of the lollipop stick and inserted it down into a cake dummy so that the horn could dry up right now I need to move on to making her ears which are quite she's always listening that's for sure to make her ears I rolled out some more of that white fondant that I had with CMC mixed into it and then I cut out like an eye shape you know oh yeah no no no really yeah those are very pointy ears yeah yeah and then what I did is I trimmed off one of the pointy ends of the eye and just pinch that together with a lollipop stick down the centre so I want that stick for support but I need the ears to look like they curved in a little if you know what I mean and then I set them into the same cake dummy that was holding up the horn to allow them to dry upright as well now it's time to cover the hole for this I'm using white fondant once my fondant is rolled out I pick it up with a French rolling pin and drape it over the cake I don't actually flick it but it should be a quick sort of motion there is footage what do you think Jeremy is doing here now I need to smooth the fondant onto the cake this can be quite tricky when you're working with cakes that are on the tall side and that's because the top edge is sort of really volatile there's a lot of weight and the fun in this pulling itself down so what you want to do as fast as possible is really work on that top edge smooth your fondant along the top and then really work on making sure the fondant is secure along that top edge before anything has a chance to rip off and I basically just work the fondant well this is hard to do yeah work the without a cake I was like what did I kind of like the Pat your head can you do the pat your head rub your stomach oh that's hard if you do have a little bit of tearing at the top edge of your cake don't worry this is really easy to take care of especially when your cake is white because you can use royal icing you don't have to make a phone and paste use a little bit of royal icing to touch up the small tears at the top edge of my cake I can't have a crack in rarity know I will be slaughtered haven't met rarity in real I think I've been ousted because of my cutie mark remark my tattoo yeah my people called her people they're like no I need to make rarities little face okay I made a template how did you know I used to template are you making assumptions just guess what I didn't use on this cake Justin ivory wait till next week though ivory will be back rolled out all the appropriate colors in fondant and then cut up my template and use those pieces to cut all of the parts of her eye out of my fondant as well as her [Music] then I glued all of those pieces together to make the eye and her little inside of her mouth and her little tongue [Music] she's very wide-eyed but she's much cuter than what I just did [Music] to outline her eyes and her mouth I used my clay extruder I made a few gray cords and a few black chords and then sued them around the eye and created her lashes actually used my template again for her lashes Johnson his templates are helpful so I formed her lashes on top of the template and cut them the right way and then added them to the cake and her mouth was outlined with grey fondant [Music] [Music] I am now done with rarities face Yolanda keV was that you quoting yourself yes so I think the point of the poet is that it's sort of helpful and wise and insightful well I think that's helpful annoys don't forget I'm running a whole yo holds contest on my Instagram we'll put the handle here right Jocelyn uh-huh just put it on there right now it's happening right now and you can play along and win a copy of my upcoming cake book and my cake book is now available for pre-order internationally or honking you have a bunch of international flags just coming out of my mouth internationally put the turkey flag in there do it or I'll put the Grenada flag in there too my mother will ask me it is time to make Rarity's hair I was really nervous about this because I wanted it to be really animated and cartoony and her hair was purple I love purple so what I did is I took some purple fondant and rolled it out long enough and then I used a bone tool to mark some lines in it because she is an animation so you do see sort of Lions in her hair you don't see a ton of strands how many pictures of rarity did we look at you I talk a lot Jeremy's computer history is now rarity maraschino cherries strawberries over YZ yeah it's interesting history now I need to pick up this hair piece of hair it's a hair piece this hair piece I created and put it on one side of her face and it comes down into her face like this but it's quite a heavy piece of fondant so once I get it into place which I magically do in one shot I need to use some little lollipop sticks to help it stay in place until it sets once I kill it I'll be able to let that fondant set and remove those sticks afterward if you were making this cake for someone else I wouldn't remove them till the last minute now I need to do the other side of her hair which took me two tries because I used the same technique I rolled it out I made the lines but it was a little too long the first time so by the time I got it out of the cake I played with it a little too much and I could see some cracking in my fondant that I wasn't happy with so I just decided to rip it off and try again so this side of Bernie's hair is a bit longer it comes down to the top of the pedestal that she's on but I did once again use lollipop sticks to help support the hair [Music] [Applause] now I would like to add rarities horn and her ears so I added her horn at the top center of the case making sure it was centered between her eyes and then I added her ears now this was a bit trickier because on one side of her head her hair comes to the front so when I put her ear in it looked like one ear was taller than the other hair right so what I had to do was trim that here and place it in through the hair so that when I looked at the Cape the ears were the same height now I want to add a few more strands of hair just in front and behind that year that rests on the hair so I rolled out my remaining purple fondant into two smaller bands and placed one in front of the ear and one behind it and it also came down and a little curled at the bottom rarity is my VIP my little pony today I chose rarity to cake I know some of you watching our how to cake it VIPs but how did Kate get VIPs get an exclusive video sent to them every Monday night with a first look at that week's cake plus some behind-the-scenes footage we set up a whole secret YouTube channel just for you VIP so you can watch these videos if you want to be a hatake get VIP sign up at hata kick it calm it's time for the cutie mark cuz I know what it's called now I couldn't even make that mistake this time because this game doesn't have a but I used a mold in the shape of a diamond and some fondant with CMC that I had dyed to the bright color and then I just press it into the cavity of the mold and pop it out to add a little more detail to my diamonds I just took the tip of my paring knife and made some because rarities diamonds and her cutie mark have indents that go along the Sun and once that has dried just a little bit I then brushed it with a little bit of luster dust just to give it a little bit of OOP I made quite a few of them cuz at first I wasn't sure if I was gonna do like a band of cutie lights around the bottom like a pattern but after she was done she was just so beautiful I didn't think she needed all that so I decided on a cheap tattoo I mean a cutie mark on her cheek I decided to do something I used to do to wedding cakes all the time I could have like piped a border but I felt that would be too heavy so I happen to have a really nice grosgrain ribbon in the appropriate color and I just wrapped that around little babies that's what I used to do to my My Little Ponies I used to tie their hair with ribbons once again if you are a My Little Pony fan and you agree the cake is magic please share this video we really appreciate it if you want to see more character cakes including my original My Little Pony cake rainbow dash there's a playlist right here and don't forget guys please subscribe please

protect the gift from the buttercream the first thing I want to do is measure this fully wrapped gift and make sure I have the dimensions right the next thing I do is measure my cakes and decide how to build them around my gift box I'm gonna start by placing strips of cake around the sides of the gift box the thing that surprises most people about this channel is that every cake you see I'm making for the first time this means that as I go along making the cake I have to take notes and make sketches so that when I'm sitting in this chair I can remember how to tell you guys how I did it I'm super old-school and I usually stick to pen and paper when I'm making my notes but the Chromebook has this stylus allowing me to jot down everything I need to remember right on the screen using a cool sketching out I loved it and now everything is in one place right here and I can access it from anywhere you know how people say throw caution to the wind I'm gonna throw this notebook to the wind sorry throw the notebook to the wall that was on my list John now that I have my first layer of my cake box I need to measure so that I can cut the other two cakes accordingly to fit on top so when I let me just check when it was all said and done was twelve and a half by 16 inches now that my cakes are the right size I'm going to carefully lift the first one place it on top of my gift box cake as well as the extra pieces in the longest side cover up the gift I decided to make a second cake box now that's how you impress people I'm first going to crumb coat and chill this giant cake box get it in the fridge and then I'll my second I'm just gonna cut this third layer of cake in half sandwich it with Italian meringue buttercream stack it on top of itself and crumb coat and I feel like a request in a confidential song a long time ago and it has a loose angle your micron road is chilled I'm going to ice both of these gift box cakes again and chill them not only do I make cake boxes I make cake books and my cake book has a cake gift box in it it also has all the recipes you need to make this cake ultimate vanilla cake Italian meringue buttercream and simple syrup plus bunch of great novelty cake ideas and Walter now it's time to cover these two cake boxes in fondant a lot of fondant ten pounds actually no way yes way I really like your like responses today I need to roll this fondant into a big enough slab that I can pick it up on my French rolling pin and drape it over my first cake box I'm going to do the big one first because it's scarier so the hardest thing about rolling up this much fondant is getting it to be the same thickness throughout this took some grunt work this was my workout everyone's into kettlebells I'm into rolling pins while I'm lucky I have a table like a butcher block that I can walk around it's very heavy I need to roll it up in my French rolling pin pick it up and drape it over this giant cake and the trickiest thing is it will immediately want to tear up the corners just because of the way to look so I've got to drape it on as fast as I can the Keyser's gonna cover the whole cake and then get to those corners straight away there was shirring there was there was I'm gonna overlook this tearing for now I'm gonna concentrate on smoothing upon it as much as I can and cutting away the excess from the bottom because I still have to cover my second I roll out the pink on it once again large enough to cover my second cake quickly drape it on work at the corners this one is a little bit less scary because it's smaller smooth it and cut away the excess now I need both of these cakes in the fridge so the fondant can just harden up a bit and then I can patch I need to patch I wrote a note about it lots of tearing and fondant patch with fogger base that's my note to make my vomit paste I simply take some of my pink fondant and then blend it with some clear food great alcohol until it resembles a royal icing consistence now I use this paste to fill in the giant tears and small cracks along the sides of both cakes I feel better but I would have felt better without you the next thing I need to do is mark two sides of each of my cake boxes with some indents to make it look like this is wrapping paper fold eight around a box I'm very intensive ever I focus to make the indents I made myself a template that's just sort of like a triangle so that I can hold it against the cake and use a knife and a veining tool to press those indents into two sides of each cake make sure there are two opposite sides yeah because if you're wrapping a gift I don't know what you're doing it should be two opposite sighs well I'm not just gonna give him a plain pink I just told you I love gift wrapping plain pink boxes this needs color so for this I'm using white yellow blue hold on to shades of pink and green I've made some fondant colors to make patterns on top of this wrapping paper now from each color I'm going to cut out dots I'm doing random dots I'm going to use a few circle cutters and piping tips as well as I want to recreate a sprinkle pattern and for this I'm using a letter I cutter I know it sounds weird that's gonna be sprinkled we are having and all I want for Christmas contest it's super easy here's how you can win your how to kick it wish list head over to hata kinga calm find items

part in our all I want for Christmas contest Jocelyn do you want to sing anything no there's a perfect Mariah song for this contest once I've cut out all of my shapes I'm going to glue them to my cake boxes for the larger cake box I'm using the different size dots to create like a random gadot pattern in my cake book I make a polka dot gift box which I love and I do it really properly with measurements and calculations so that the polka dots are evenly spaced but I also mentioned an easier way to do it is just throw the polka dots on if that's too stressful for you you can always do a random pattern moving on to the smaller cake box I'm going to use my letter cutouts and glue them on as sprinkles yes like the sprinkles were just shaking and are sprinkling now that both my cakes are decorated it is time to dowel the bottom cake and stack the smaller cake on top at this point I completely forgot there was a gift inside the bigger cake because when I went to put my downs it it only went like I was like but the cake yeah I completely forgot when I sketched out this cake before getting started I envisioned piles of curling ribbon as bows I don't know what made me think of that from the same sheets of fondant that I rolled up for my patterns I now I'm gonna cut out equal strips I then taped each strip and wrap it around a dowel I did this with my hair on the like me moji I made yep so wrap it around a dowel let it sit for a moment and then pull it off the devil and now my fondant is curled like curling ribbon once they're firm enough all I have to do is glue all of this bonnet curling ribbon onto the tops of my cakes I use a little bit of piping gel here and there to do it to the surface as well as to each other and it's so much fun I've made other gift bows on the channel but this is the easiest in my opinion because it can't really look wrong Yona me curling ribbon is just everywhere like other things that you can't control I've never wrapped up a gift in cake

welcome back to how to take it I'm Yolanda and this week I am making a giant carrot cake no like an actual carrot so not just like carrot now a carrot carrot cake got a carrot cake that's carrot cake inside I make new cakes every week so please subscribe to this channel and help me hit three million subscribers it would be a lovely birthday gift oh and here's a notification bell so you know when my new cakes are ready you can make this cake I baked 9 carrot cakes remove them all from their pans level them and then cut the caramelize a ssin away from the bottom if you would like my carrot cake recipe which is delicious you can find it on a playlist called yelled recipe box book put it in a pond now all of my cakes are ready for simple syrup but are they ready for sir squeeze now my carrot cake is really really moist so I simple served a little more lightly than I usually do I don't know if you've noticed but the squeeze is now in pin form they say you haven't made it until you've been pin now I need to ice the top of each cake with a nice layer of Italian meringue buttercream I'm going to ice all of them except one of the tiniest layer my Italian meringue buttercream recipe is in the same yost recipe box playlist up here I need to flip each of these case onto their side and start sandwich in them together but first I just want to trim a little bit off the side of each cake because this will actually be the saw them and I don't want these cakes rolling away from me I don't ever really know but I have nightmares little things like that it's not funny so you want to be really careful but essentially you just want to line them all up from biggest to smallest and you can already see like a giant carrot forming you're making a carrot out of carrot the carrot case is made out of carrots and the giant carrot is made out of carrot cake it's a lot guys this strap is I don't mean to interrupt but the strap is really bothering Jeremy we're distracting he is not fascinated enough by the fact that I made a giant carrot so just give me a minute yes Jeremy Jeremy no this is the strap but not a hair of the person I'll be like this Jeremy's like you're good you're good that apron strap my buttercream is nice and set within the layer so it's time to carve [Music] this is a good one because it's really easy to find our model not like watermelons carrithers good models I've seen quite a few carrots in my life so I did it by eye and the good thing is you don't want this case to be perfectly symmetrical I really hate saying that hurts me but you don't you want to see like a realistic natural organic carrot Jocelin right you could even carve like a bump on your carrot I have seen some strange carrots I won't like a Siamese twin carrot it looks like a set of legs wow it was really cool but eventually I have easy this is a great starter tape because even though it's big you could make it at any size and the carving is really easy you don't need to be intimidated by this type of carving this carrot doesn't come - enough of a point at the end for me so what I'm going to do is utilize some of my cake humps and I'm just going to sandwich them to the bottom of the cake so that I can make more of a point I actually trimmed my hump with some circle cutters just to get like all that you know nothing no so that I could create smaller circles at the end of the cake and the carrot would come to a point you [Music] if you want ideas for other Easter cakes you can make that very from really easy to super hard there's and peacefully lives right over here giant carrots to that playlist I'm going to count it from cake Cisco I'm going to crank out this cake with my Italian meringue buttercream and my small offset spatula and then I'm going to put it in the fridge to chill I actually like to have a variety of spatulas around when I'd crumb coating and icing because I always seem to change my mind throughout the process because of this we've put together a crumb coat and chill deluxe bundle at how to cake it calm it includes a variety of spatulas this apron so you know what you're doing so squeeze a lot and this pin may be sir squeeze wants to wear his own well he's like that you know what I mean my crumb coat is chill time to Isis cake one more time with my Italian meringue buttercream and chill it again kaki [Music] the hardest thing about this cake is that you have to cover it and orange fondant and you have to roll out quite a big piece of fondant to cover your whole cake I colored my fondant myself with some orange food coloring and I did add a bit of ivory food coloring just to make the orange a little more natural the one is neon carrot don't trust the neon carrot it's not organic if it's neon you know that means yeah first sign these are these are carrot alternative facts dynalift now that I've rolled on my large sheet of natural orange fondant I pick it up on my French rolling pin by tracing it backwards meaning the icing sugar coated side this piece up and then I pick that up and drape it over the hole [Music] I use my organic hand the to slow's of Stefan jostle it smooths the fondant around the carrot tucking the excess down underneath could you really want to keep that rounded sort of cone shape that I care it has I flew this on it as best I can but I end up cutting away the excess and I left with a very small team on the bottom don't worry it will be covered by the organic greenery that comes out of the carrot I need to make all of the little indents the Lions on carrots that run horizontally across the carrot so I used a sculpting tool actually known as a veining tool and I created all of these lines if your carrot cake is a little soft you want to puncture your cake so feel free to chill it for a bit before you move on a community event this is an organic carrot so I wanted it to appear like fresh from the dirt not too dirty but I just needed to enhance those indents with a little bit of light cocoa powder brush inside let's make up for a carrot in down [Music] you know this is contouring right carrot carrot contouring what - I mean all tourists are doing I know this carrot needs greenery Oh actually it doesn't know so it's already done Jocelyn before I get to be organic greenery on this carrot I need to let you guys know about replication that's the best time ever I am working on a super-secret project and I'm looking for amazing Baker's this is what I want you to do go to the replicate playlist right here choose the cake that you love and make it take it oh yeah help to chop that just works that is so good take a photo and post it on facebook or instagram using the hashtag replicate there's more instructions in the description below replicate or the greenery I made some green fondant just sort of a nice pale natural green and then I rolled it into two of various links they were about a half inch thick and before I was done rolling the tubes I inserted a floral wire down the middle of the tube and then I continued to roll the tube securing the wire inside I created about seven of these tubes with the wire inside I need to join these two together at their base where they grow out of the carrot because if you look at a carrot it's kind of like they're twisted together and then their frame they sprouted from the carrot I use a wooden cake dowel and what I did is I took the exposed wire that is extending from each one of the steps and wrapped it around the dowel because later we'll insert this whole thing into the cake leaving the greenery exposed once your bouquet of green stems is ready we're going to create the leaves before attaching it to the cake for the leaves I rolled out more of my green fondant this time I use the fondant rolling pin and a nonstick mat because I wanted to roll it nice and thin and then I used a just a regular pointed daisy cutter so it's actually a cutter used to make daisies but I'm going to use it in this case to make believe to add them to my stems first I use my sharp paring knife just to make little cuts on the ends of my stem you don't want these stems to be big enough that they'll break off it's just sort of a small detail you can add to add the leaves I brushed on a little bit of clear piping gel and add them to the end of every single stem remember they're at different heights so some of the stems are shorter some are longer all of this will just make it look more natural we're organic as a final touch I just want to paint this greenery with a little bit of green color Duff give it some variation so color dust is just like luster dust without the luster less fancy and I mix it the same way I do luster dust with a little bit of clear food grade alcohol and then I brushed it on all of the stems and all of the leaves and let it dry another good way to tell if a carrot is not organic is if it has sparkly metallic green rings that is a sad one so no neon carrots and no sparkly metallic greenery I don't really do dirt but in this case I surrounded my big giant carrot with a ton of 4000 pounds the greenery is dry it looks great it's ready to go and all we have to do is insert it into the different so we're going to slowly push the dowel and those wires into the carrot until it hits the place of the goonies if you can't get it up tight enough you can just do some or you'll crumble so this is dirt right there right is this organic there would be dirt do not our Medicare is not grow in the ground they do but they don't grow in organic dirt okay right and the other great thing about this big carrot is it is so versatile I mean think about it if you just make some pale yellow fondant you can make a giant parsnip okay everyone wants Maki who doesn't want a giant parsnip and you can make it at a parsnip cake thanks for watching how to cake it don't forget to subscribe and help me hit 3 million and hit that notification bell so that you don't miss the parsnip cake next week we're not doing a participation you're not doing a punishment case to do next week oh yeah yeah yeah and don't forget to replicate it check out the replicate playlist and I can't wait to see your cake I can't wait to see how you take it another one I can't wait I can't I can't over time I just I'm out pond

subscribe this channel and make sure to hit that notification bell so you know when I've made a new crappy cake this is your freezing this I am or good yeah it makes poop from the upcoming emoji movie chocolate is going to go on a while my two 8-inch round and two seven inch round chocolate cakes are out of the pen I'm going to level them and then as an and layers and peach into two layers next up I call into squeeze he's relaxing I feel calm chillin if you're wondering if we bought a pool floatie sisters please of course didn't we taken everyone to fill this poop cake I am using both chocolate ganache and chocolate buttercream and I'm also going to add some mini chocolate chips to the chocolate it's what's on the inside that counts I am redefining to that's what I'm doing I'm taking the words back we're going to make it ours we're going to make it positive this poop cake is like rich and chocolatey and delicious I'm going to make poop number one oh yeah now I have eight layers of cake stacked up and filled with alternating layers of ganache and chocolate buttercream in chocolate chip rich Jeremy how did it it smell it only will say like oh he thinks his poop doesn't stink his food doesn't I think who doesn't think he smells like chocolate on chocolate on chocolate you may have noticed something new about me I did it I got tattoos if you guys want your own tattoo temporary of course we have limited quantities of watermelon birthday cupcake and then we also have my giant chocolate chip mint ice cream called and my pasty being had a cake a temporary tattoo have already been sent out to keep the club members and their also in the summertime bunnies you can get your own at how to take it calm join wrestling now that my cupcake is chilled and the buttercream is set it's time to carve him into a piece of well you took a big drop right I use my serrated knife and I carved poop I did made myself a template it was just flat but I sort of used it to hold up against the cake and make sure my peak was high enough he was sort of rounded enough has like some girth at the bottom even with simple shapes is important to carve away little by little because it's easier to just keep carving than it is to try and put it back you don't want to have to build cake back up because it could end up looking like the very thing I'm carving right now I'm really happy with this piece of so I am going to crumb coat him in you know if you want to see more emoji cakes and other character cake there's a playlist right here [Music] time to I try poop cake once again in chocolate ganache and chill him a final time I don't know if you've seen the trailers of his upcoming movie but who obviously thinks he's hot so I'm going to put them in the fridge to chill out I need to make some of poops facial features now because they are going on underneath the fondant so first I want to make his eyeballs I've rolled out some white gum paste I need to cut an oval and as I roll I kind of create a little hump because I wanted us to be like two dimensional that's helping you Bryn I roll out more white gum paste and use my template for the shape he's definitely laughing about thank you to me probably the fact would be cold food probably for his eyebrows I rolled out some modeling chocolate cut out the shape of his eyebrows using my templates and then I gave him some texture with a veining tool this one's got some thick eyebrows I just want to put it up there for his pupils I'm rolling out some black fondant really really thin using a small oval cutter to cut them out and then I'm going to create a little bit of shine in his eye I just use my template to mark out where that triangle is and what I do to accentuate it is paint the entire pupil with a little bit of black food coloring and not paint best inner triangle that little triangle is less matte black and the recipes people is a shiny alert block oh yes I'll look it up fit your hands like a meaning that's somewhere ridiculous here's something I love about poop he is so different you know how a lot of my character cakes have catch lights and if you don't check out that play I mentioned earlier poops catch light r-square that's what makes poop so fabulous he has black Ashworth this print white bow tie I'm rolling out some white gum paste nice and thin get this full time looks like a minute that's hawlucha here like if you were pooped would you choose a white botas is risky it's just good I was thinking about how to create the linen texture and the best thing I thought of on the slide was I had some canvas plain canvas I laid it on top and then rolled my fondant pin over it and that created that linen texture in my gum pain then I cut out two equal sized bands and pinched both ends of each band together now I need to fold the two pinched ends up onto each other creating a loop and to keep that loop open I just took a little bit of cleaver towel rolled it up and put it inside so just something a soft cushion to allow it to drive out with finally I need to make the center part of the bone so I cut out a little band from my linen gum paste and wrap it around those two bows where they meet in the center before I cover poop I need to add his eyeballs and history I add them directly onto the ganache surface I use my template to help guide where they should be and now that they're secure it's time to cover poop in chocolate fondant what if somebody tunes in like right there it's time to cover poop in chocolate fondant I roll out my chocolate fondant large enough to cover this whole piece of poop and then I pick it up with my French rolling pin and drape it over I'm going to smooth this cake with my hands because while he's like give me soft using my fingertips to really smooth around the eyeballs and the grin I tell as much fun as they can underneath and trim away the excess [Music] now it's time to cut open till I focus on golf also what if you tuned in right here basically his eyeballs are completely covered and I need to help poopsie the light of day so I'm going to use a sharp paring knife and I'm going to cut the fondant that is on the bottom half of his eyes and then around the eyeball this way the fondant that remains looks like eyelid I also need to unleash his grin on the world because what a grim I use a sharp paring knife once again to cut away the excess and reveal his to perfect teeth it's the thing I love most about this emoji movie is that it's about self love and being your best self no matter what anyone else thinks of you you're going to take it as a team we really try to encourage each other to do that and we all play a different school you guys obviously know Jocelyn maybe you've heard cheer me a couple of times her dementia caught on and is terrible sleeping but you don't get to hear a lot about Connie who is an integral part of how to keep it she does a whole lot of things that you guys don't get to hear about including finding all of the things that we fell on how to Kiki calm dreaming them up working with different artists to create things like it's berries of celery watermelon festive first we would not be able to lounge in a pool without Connie July 26 which is tomorrow is Connie's birthday silicon is a low vision plenty of happy birthday or head over to Connie's Instagram and leave her a clink emoji funny lucky Connie you love you so much we hope you know it now we've told the world let's get Marvin gave a thing for Connie or huh [Music] that was the Marvin Gaye Connie birthday remix oh yes I need to do poops hair for his very crossed ways I take some chocolate fondant and just create so it was like a big long teardrop actually at one point it was dangerously close to poop not gonna lie - poop is a bit of a hipster look at me error hipster right with a linen bowtie yes linen go time he's bringing back the wave yeah I think I saw one I think they won't get that Torontonians you you know exactly where possible so I've created this sort of long teardrop with a point at the end and then I actually used some more chocolate fondant underneath his bangs at the back just to prop up that way OOP needs his pupils his eyebrows i glue them onto his face is a little bit of clear piping gel and now he should people charming you know he's the traveling piece of poop I think now I need to make his arms and leg and to get a sense of how long I want them to be I'm going to place poop on the cakes and I roll out two chords with chocolate fondant and I'm going to place a wire inside each tube to help prop up this way you know stick legs good yep move that stick legs stick legs on like long thin feet and then I also shape his foot at the end so bending that tube and then just shaping his foot enemy to it while I make the arms I just need to leave these legs in the position they're going to new place so I hold them up against the cheeks and and bend his knees and I'm just gonna leave them to the side of poop for now while I move onto the arms for his arms I want them to be like fixing and adjusting his bow time so I make them similar to the way that I made its legs and feet and actually the bottom or the top like this I roll this on it a little flatter and then use a knife to cut out fingers and then I gently use my fingertips to sort of round out so sharp edges that I cut so they look like it's three three fingers in the fun [Music] now it's time to place his hands and legs onto the cake so unfortunately I have to lift him off the stand so I can secure his legs and arms on the stand and then I place the arms on on either side keeping in mind that I want this position and against just his full time now I need to move poop back on the stand with the help of Jeremy Thank You Jeremy right now poop is number two but when I have this women bow tie he will be number one [Music] clear out pee I'm flushing the toilet is the new number one in town oh my god and it's this time and then I just want to take your pants and rest them on each one of the boulders so it looks like you just enjoy whatever they call me number two but I'm not they fix my linen boat

Patrick's Day playlist right over here oh that is perfect really yeah my crumb coat is set it's time to ice my cake once again with Italian meringue buttercream getting it as smooth as possible now I'm going to chill my cake again and prepare it for fondant I need to roll out a piece of black fondant large enough to drape over this cake so I use my fabric measuring tape to measure from the bottom of one side of the pot over top to the bottom of the other side and then I roll out my black form into an eighth of an interestin pick it up on a French rolling pin and drape it over the pot as soon as I get it onto the cake I start to smooth immediately using my hands you really want to make sure to press the fondant in on the top sides of the cake because if you leave it for too long the weight of the draped fondant will actually pull and tear the fondant and you're kind of trying to push the air out from underneath as you smooth the fondant onto the cake then I trim the excess fondant away from the bottom but not flush up against the cake just really close because now I'm gonna move like a leprechaun flip so let us pretend my little friend is my pot of gold case do you mind okay and this is what I did vielen be fun I feel smiling it's hard to tell if he's upside down no he's good so while making it flips over I take the opportunity to trim away the excess platform it first i smooth it tight up against the cake and then I use a sharp paring knife to cut away the excess thank you for your flippin assistance he's a little busy it's time to make handle so that this little guy can lift up a pot of gold cake to make the handle for this pot I roll two equal portions of black fondant into six tubes and then I formed them around a circle cutter just to help me get the shape I trimmed the excess off the end and join them together and then I pinched it together because I wanted more of an oval shape rather than circular shape and I set them aside to dry I don't know how he's going to lift it he's going with a light weight you can actually make these ahead of time and let them set and another great tip if your black fondant happens to be on the soft side you can add a bit of CMC to it and stiffen it up a bit before making your hands on head low okay now it's time to make the rim of the pot the rim on the lip you're going to do that in the same method that you made your handles except you're going to roll a longer thicker tube and then what I like to do is sort of taper the tube down this is a bit tricky because what I did was I rolled out a tube I use a fondant rolling pin to sort of roll over the children so it's how do I show them I have no sign language for tapering a sudden didn't we see you yeah oh footage what I want to do is spin out one long ends of the tube and then trim it perfectly and then that way that thinner end will be the outward facing side of the tube as you add it to your cake I use clear piping gel to glue the tube on because on Heaviside so I was afraid that water just wouldn't cut it well I am feeling like this pot of gold doesn't look dark cauldre me enough culturally you're trying to just conjure up the cauldron effect so what I'm going to do is use a little bit of black food coloring diluted it was clear food grade alcohol and I'm going to paint the entire pot I used a large paintbrush and I painted all the way around the cake turning my lazy susan to really help me now that the paint is dry I am attaching the handles to the top I need to roll out a bit more of my last fondant to create some bands that will hold the handle to the cake I basically just okay I roll through okay I cut to Lucia once my fondant is rolled nice and thin I cut out two bands that were the exact same size and then I fed the band through my handles where the scene was then I glue the two ends of the band together it was a bit of clear piping gel and in order to adhere these handles to my cake I once again used clear piping gel and I used a toothpick to help keep the handles in place because they're heavy and the pot is rounded and it handle breaks off how is he supposed to get the gold home to all his other friends you're always thinking about Patrick a little leaf I know he didn't even give me any goals not even a tip once my handle is secured I'm going to use a small round piping tip to just make two indents on each of the handles that look like I don't know what it would be called where the pot was welded together the cauldrons riveting the track if the pot looks called your knee but the handle not so much so when you use the leftover paint that I need before and paint the whole pot including the handle one more time in addition to celebrating st. Patrick's Day with this cauldron each case we're also having Saint Patrick's Day get lucky sale at Habakkuk accomp know this happens not for sale this is an original / Patrick thank you is there anything this pot is missing gold so what I did is I need punished toffee I don't know why I'm so happy because it burnt the first batch and the fire alarm went off yep once your son's coffee is ready you want to break it up I started to use like meat tenderizing mallet that didn't quite seem in DFS I wanted so I just took the son Shafi out of the pan instead of breaking off chunks I want these nuggets of gold looks big and nuggety then I placed all of my son's coffee and Nuggets into a big bowl and I sprinkled on some edible gold luster dust and tossed it in the holes so century essentially you're tricking him into thinking your son's hockey goal time to place my counterfeit gold nuggets onto the cake here's a suggestion I actually taught my nuggets to a sieve and I even knew that Jeremy what's that camera duster thing called Lord a blower I used a blower just to blow away any excess luster dust because this stuff gets everywhere it was in the air and make sure that no dust will fall on during a beautiful Black Cauldron and now to the counterfeit gold coins he's not even mad because you want to know something they're not gold but they are chocolate nothing to be mad please help me get to 3 million subscribers by subscribing to this channel and pressing that notification valve so that you know wouldn't have got to Mexico outfit on because I mean that's why we're really here isn't it where do my glasses go well I know oh you Jeremy you try this on ah oh yeah that looks great that looks good do I look better it is like looking through grain blind bass is good it is I'm telling you the window blinds 
welcome back to Attica KITT I'm Yolanda and since we're gearing up for the summer edition of Camp cake I've decided to make a giant more pink you need some more floor please dispose of this channel and don't forget to hit the notifications l so you'll know when I faked a mutate if you want to know more about Camp cake and how you can bake with me live there are more details in the description below there are three elements to making a s'more which I feel you should know Ram crackers marshmallow and chocolate and I have to recreate them all out of cake and submit cookies let's start with my graham crackers I recreate those by making a really sturdy cookie dough I start by mixing some whole wheat flour and gram crumbs in a bowl and then in a pot i melted together butter brown sugar corn syrup and thyme it smells amazing right here add it to the how the cake is sense once that mixture was fully melted and warm I then carefully poured it into the center of my flour mixture mixing it all up with a spoon till I consider any more and then I poured it out and kneaded the dough together so once my dough is kneaded together I divided it into and wrapped it and let it sit for about half an hour a lot of meeting you know reps like after massage right you almost need to rest yeah I rolled out my dough on a nonstick silicone mat and place a piece of parchment paper on top while I'm rolling when I'm happy with the size I cut out a giant square and then I do this with the other half of the dough as well I used a ruler and a set square to help me get my squares perfect you know I love delivers graham crackers usually have some sort of pricked holes and some perforation lines that you can break them apart easily I need to recreate this look on my giant graham crackers for the holes I'm using a piping tip and I did use a ruler to measure and perfectly spaced them and for the perforation line I'm using a ruler I just used one end of a really straight ler pressed in to create that dotted line I enjoyed doing that oh I feel a lot because this dough is so sturdy and it has no leavening agents it doesn't expand while baking I bake them at 350 for about 25 minutes when they're done place them on a cooling rack to cool completely looks like this very official the first element of a s'more are two graham crackers the second element of a s'more is chocolate I wanted my chocolate cake to end up looking like a piece of a chocolate bar with a section of a chocolate bar I recreate this by making a square chocolate cake and to create the grooves I use a ruler and a serrated knife and I divide my cake into six sections just carving out to the little V values once I was happy with the shape of my face or the indents in my cake I then simple Philip dick that's right they're squeezed I'd be nothing without you can we recreate the scene in misery and like good this was first squeeze in a bed and me I think people will watch this oh why is my chocolate cake it's simple syrup and the syrup is soaked in I been crumb coated in chocolate ganache [Music] it feels very controversial when I leave this channel and become the crown point on my chocolate bar cake is set from an ice it in one more time in ganache now it's a really simple shape but it can be really annoying to ice in all the greens and get the food as well as the science thank you if you want any of the spatulas I've used or my red stabilizer you can get them at had a cake accom I pre made myself a batch of dark chocolate modeling chocolate and let it set up I roll out my modeling chocolate nice and thin and then drape it over my chocolate cake and the first thing I want to do is really smooth it into the groove as well as along the top edge modeling chocolate is great to cover a cake and I actually love the way it tastes kind of set up faster than fondant so you need to work lightly especially if your cake underneath is cold just press down the dowel into the groove and really expense you and I did it a bit along the sides of the booth as well that was a lot of shock if you'd like to see a video where I make modeling chocolate from scratch or you'd like to see me make my chocolate cake for ganache is a playlist right here oh it's a chocolaty let's move on to the marshmallow I feel like the marshmallow is Beyonce the chocolate is Kelly and the crackers are Michelle no I'm going to break the poor girl once and she must be y'all may have fallen but she when she falls she asks you in full no but she like her hair was got caught in a fan he didn't even break like that with me she was like this is like and then and meanwhile her hair was being pulled into I'm just saying that Michelle wasn't tested fine gotta have the yin and the yang and the young currently to create my Beyonce like marshmallow I have baked to 8 inch round vanilla cake and then I leveled them and cut the carmelization away from the bottom I also cut the carmelization off the size and then I layered each cake into two layers now it's have to fill oh no oh my god I was proud about this princess I left him on that chain to that bed and are you trying to leave about once the syrup was fully absorbed I filled my cake with Italian meringue buttercream and are you ready for this this marshmallow exception I broiled a few mini marshmallows now that they're cool I'm going to layers in between my cake on top of my sputters spread them on top of my buttercream and then add another layer of cake more buttercream more marshmallows now you may have noticed I'm not stacking this cake perfect on purpose which is really difficult for me I'm just throwing the layers on because marshmallows melt and they ease and they kind of get all like that's exactly to do can you actually want it to be imperfect you want to get what is imperfect you wanted to be perfectly imperfect and then once I'm done I'm going to crumb coat the entire outside with more buttercream let's pause for a second I want to get back to camp cake if you want to make two inside my baking project you can use live then head to Chanukah comp and register for tab cake we are making my taco cake which are in my upcoming cake book and Sunday company Jocelyn will be on camera and I think I'm going to make her do something and Jeremy will be here too and you'll hear some grunt sign the camera as usual so don't forget to sign up for camp cake and hat akika calm and if you have participated before leave a comment below with the hashtag camp cake squad see how this yar does not cooperate open it well perfectly good yeah good I'm not talking to it so where was I I've crumb coated it I need to ice my imperfect marshmallow cake once again with Italian meringue buttercream and chill it Jeremy did not think that I ended up with an imperfect cake it wasn't perfect and then he tried to imply that it wasn't nothing enough because I was making a marshmallow kink I decided to make marshmallow fondant and what you need to do is melt some mini marshmallows in the microwave and as they melt you can add a little bit of water and I also like to add glycerin this just keeps it a little bit shiny a little bit softer once it's melted you basically want to stir it into an entire heap of icing sugar icing sugar is the same thing as confectioner sugar is the same thing as powdered sugar so whichever one of those you call it it's fine the ones you can't stir anymore you can turn it out onto your work surface with some icing sugar on the table and then eat it until it comes together you want to make marshmallow fondant fairly close to when you want to use it so you don't want to make it days and days ahead because it will hard for my recipe of marshmallow fondant you can head to my blog at how to take it calm and I'll also put a link below I want to do a marshmallow photo shoot what I can just lie in like a whole bunch of marshmallows they're really soft should be amazing I roll the fondant out it's about a little less than a quarter of an inch thick it is stickier than regulus on it so I just put down a lot of icing sugar and then I picked it up and draped it over my cake now I don't want to cover this cake perfectly smooth so what I did is I used my fingertips to sort of fold under the fondant and I just want it to look musii that's probably love right-click one main melt they're like bling as I discussed before this is real marshmallow exception marshmallows inside a cake that looks like a marshmallow covered in fondant made of marshmallow a lot my marshmallow cake is all covered I want to place it in the fridge for about 20 minutes to set up and then I called in my friend Bernie before ruling my marshmallow fondant I want to remove my cake from the cake board which will burn and now I'm going to burn my entire marshmallow cake no need to burn the surface because I kind of want it to remain sticky so I can stick the graham cracker to it later but all of the sides are going to be plated and it's good if you burn it in different colors so Buster in some areas lighter in some areas who we all know even though you try to roast a marshmallow specifically has anyone ever done it if you've done it leave a comment below and I would like some sort of proof time to assemble this the first thing I do is take one of my giant graham crackers and place it upside down so I put the chocolate just a little off it's not perfectly centered and I'm okay with that are you no I am okay I've made peace of huh I just gotta figure a way to pick it out and fight it so hard to cut through work I wish I had a saw if you want more food case there's a playlist right here and don't forget to subscribe right there thank you for watching and I'll be back next Tuesday for my birthday a facility I'm going to make my own birthday cake yay because nobody on the team feels like they should maybe step up and make a cake for me 
you are watching how to kick it I'm Yolanda under here somewhere and this week I made myself a birthday cake that's not bad oh I'm taking myself a giant ice cream a lot of going on this week I'm having a camp cake flash sale on instead of flash a good one for more information on that sale click the link in the description below we're leaving in every single thing I said this week because it's my perfect we have to make games with 40 minutes on TV you guys don't TV for my giant ice cream sundae birthday cake I baked 10 pounds of cake total let's start off by building the foal it wasn't just Andale this is a big birthday and I want to pink Sunday I cut my round cake into two layers and I cut my bull cake into three later first squeeze better do his job right today because this cake is for me so I haven't simple syrup all of the way I decided to have a Neapolitan ice cream sundae and what I'm going to do is enhance some of my enhanced yeah because I'm more mature now so I'm going to enhance my buttercream so that I can fill my bowl seat while I listen to the lovely zoo tank I'm only going to talk like this from now I'm an adult we'll have to raise the audio you quiet is it quieter it's like a calm journey it's just quiet okay I enhanced my buttercream with a plethora of flavors I've labored half of it with a vanilla bean which is so lovely and smooth so that Jeremy had a lot of questions about the meliboeus a lot I answered them then I chopped some strawberries mainly the red part but I wanted to remove sort of that white part inside and nothing against it but it's not colorful and it's not as flavorful folded them into my Italian meringue buttercream along with a little bit of pink food coloring for my chocolate buttercream I added mini chocolate chip time to fill my bowl cake alternating the buttercream I'm going to start building my super bowl upside down I add the board then I add the bowl cake which is now kind of three layers later when I flip it I'll have support and you guys any shirt up a little board in it that doesn't work it's more like if you wanted to stand that finishes red of the Lord and I wanted to get my bowl a little bit of detail so I added some indents to the side I used a circle cutter to help me mark it and a small serrated knife to cut out eight indents evenly around the bowl now I need to crumb coat miss cakes I feel like it's my birthday and I want other people to dance for me I want to show girls I want like Rockettes I want 40 Rockettes with cakes on their heads kicking thank you or hi luck or ha there's a lot of times oh my god Susan look just focus on this case needs some dowels to support it before I flip it over I'm going to insert a few delves into the cake in a circle formation that way when we flip it they'll be support because I'm going to be adding a lot of ice - we have dancing dolls or hot it's my birthday I'm going to ask for everything I want I want some dancing dolls they're my support group get it and now I'm going to ice the cake again with my vanilla buttercream I knew this cake is more difficult than it looks because I've gotta get buttercream into all the little indents that I carved earlier if you have a cake enthusiast in your life who also has a birthday coming up like me we have some great sprinkle themed wrapping paper cards mini cards at how to keep it calm so you can wrap up their cake gifts in cake paper and it will be a kick-ass dispersed and enthusiast did you hear that yes I've used in hence plethora and enthusiasts this is the new me I need some ice cream to put in this interval so I also baked vanilla cake that I'm going to turn into ice cream I use some half-sphere silicone mold to bake a bunch of half-sphere cakes in different colors I quickly leveled off the hump with and the silicone molds and now they're all out of the mold now it's time to glue two fins together to create a scoop of ice cream I'm actually going to glue them together with chocolate because I really want to make sure they stay together as an ice cream scoop I don't like the management role of the party so for the vanilla ice cream scoops I've used is it a white chocolate for the strawberry I use a bit of pink chocolate and for the chocolate I use chocolate chocolate you know that chocolate chocolate right chocolate that's chocolate and I have to once again call on sister sis please this princess Queen needs you now it is time to crumb coat all 12 ice cream scoop woo footage I have to chill all these ice cream scoops now so rock [Music] dimension is the best birthday ever I have to ice my ice cream scoops one more time and I used my adventure I iced them I use a small spatula and then I use a little piece of acetate to smooth them because I wanted them to look cute not by you you know what I mean yeah I wanted them to I need to ice all 12 ice cream soup soup ice cream too I can't stand when my ice cream oh I have a thing about it I get so mad if I'm using ice cream and heat I eat it so quickly but don't turn okay Ivan I don't want a milkshake I want ice cream I get really upset that I could do that really upset like it's one of my biggest pet peeves melted ice cream it's my birthday so I decided to make a pink Bowl I roll out my pink fondant to be 1/8 of an inch thick and then I use a French rolling pin to pick it up and drape it now i spose up on it all over my cake using my hands and my fondant smoother however air will get trapped in the indents naturally so you want to have a straight pin handy to help release it just gently press your pin into the fondant and then guide the air is fingertip now this giant sundae cake is too much for you to handle we are making sundae cupcakes at camp cake and taco cakes camping is a live stream making event where I bigger mr.chen make at home and yours we do everything together step by step I am rolling back the price of Camp cake to $19.99 but for 48 hours oh my goal is now fully covered and smooth and I need to trim it just a little bit higher than the cake so when I flip it over there's a bit of a lip do you know what it's time for whoo it's better since you spells nonsense you have been practicing yes not better so now my Super Bowl is right-side up and ready for ice cream before adding my scoops I want to make sure this bowl can really handle them so I am going to hammer in a sharpened dowel right down the center of the bowl into the cake or added base and this will help it stop wobbling because it would be a lot of a chain and I don't like my natural number four I'm going to arrange the scoop first in a circle at the top of the bowl and to make them fit perfectly I'm just having a set of circle cutters on hand so if I need to trim away any cases that they can all fit in there nicely I will do it as I see fit well I will do that as I see fit you really are my mentor I know something happened there you go in other news you're not now that my first six scoops are laid around the perimeter of the bowl I need to fill in the space that's in the center I don't want any fallen ice cream of any time I use a circle cutter to trim the scoop down so that will fit right in the center and support to the next layer of ice like an ice cream puzzle you're like fitting them together like this yes I like that analogy but wait I need to add the little edges at the end of my scoop what I'm doing is taking extra butter cream in all three flavors and using a small spatula to just how did I even do it again tapped it on the edge I just added a ring of buttercream that just looks sort of ruffled and natural along the edge of each soup in the bowl doing one flavor at a time now I need to add three more scoops on top one of each chocolate vanilla and strawberry and finally the crowning glory is the final conclusion now Kate rules everything around me cream get the layers spread it's ready round job we're really good guys sorry we've gone off track a lot in this episode but it's my birthday so if you two love wrapping and Katie's this is the official t-shirt this month to the cake pink lips let's sing for them Jocelyn and if we just get it so what do you like on a Sunday chocolate yes I mean a really simple chocolate sauce in the microwave with chocolate butter and a little bit of corn syrup which gives it a bit of shine just melt it all together until it's completely smooth and then I don't want it to be too hot because it's buttercream it melts I don't like melted butter cream either once the chocolate sauce was smooth and melted but not hot I poured it onto my slab and you want to know supreme I even let the soft grip onto the outside of my fool what because I Jocelyn I'm so mature I understand that all things can't be controlled oh wow understand life how to kick it up asone chocolate song you have to just go with it you know what else run Sunday well what I like on a Sunday I like chocolate shaving so I'm gonna make some with a vegetable peeler haven't seen that on that oh no you have carrot cake vegetable peelers were originally called chocolate pieces and then people started using them on like carrots and potatoes and somewhere along the way the name was changed I have my chocolate shavings they're ready they're peeled I'm going to sprinkle them on to my chocolate sauce before that this fun day is almost ready and I'm getting really excited but it needs two more thing can you guess what they are justice definitely sherry good fries no sprinkle No the shaving for the sometimes okay listen what would you rest the cherry oh oh every thank you so for my whipped cream I'm using Italian meringue buttercream absolutely plain no vanilla bean in it I wanted this is whipped cream I put it in a piping bag that I fitted with a star tip and piped a real tight and then finally every Sunday music cherry on top I made my cherry out of red fondant that I stiffened with a fit of CMC and I'm actually making it bright red because I want it to be like a maraschino cherry which I don't actually like but that's what I think of when I think of a scented then it led Jeremy and I down the path of how maraschino cherries are made and I wish I could run back off up do not Google how maraschino cherries are made just buy fresh cherries that came off the tree once the cherry was assembled I brushed on a little bit of piping gel with some red food coloring mist in to make it really you know really maraschino and I placed it on top of Manhattan you know I'm calling this time if this is like a never before heard of thing you ready because the ball is so big it's mine why do I look at the broken one okay ready it's my this will always be something I look back on economy so when I'm an 80 year old woman who's even more mature and sophisticated I'll look back if it's 40 year old first and thing if you want more ice cream themed cakes we have a whole playlist right here we don't right here I was a green metallic bug it was just a confetti you know what else I don't like I don't like melted ice cream and I don't like fun joke do this that's important if you want more giant food cake and finally if you want to subscribe which I'm sure you do is firstly after this episode I just sure 
welcome back to how to take it I'm Yolanda and today I am making something that I've only heard about in folklore and fairy tales breakfast in bed to the drift is somebody else put the magazine thanks to Google for supporting and collaborating with me on this video I have my very own Google assistant to help me with distance episodes or should I say tape assistant okay Google what's my name your name is the queen of cakes thank you you can call me know before we get started I have to say a big thank you to all of you I asked for something on subscribers and we got it thanks to you thank you so much of support in the world to us please keep watching tell all your friends have them subscribe and don't forget to hit the notifications l so you will know when I do a video just to make this breakfast tray I have baked for cake I've remove them all of their pans and now I'm going to level the three smallest cakes by cutting them in half horizontally to create two layers Perkins the larger cake is going to be turned into to put on so I'm going to cut it in half down the middle and begin to shape them okay Google can you please show me the picture of a perfect passant here are some matching pictures how do you mom well you look at a lot of pictures of suits on which makes you really hungry and then use a small serrated knife I'm actually making one chocolate in front and one traditional so the traditional passant is shaped kind of like a crescent and the Java croissant is more like well a rectangle for now with a soft rounded rectangle [Music] my next case is going to be transformed into you fruitful so that's why I chose to leave the hump on this cake and I'm just going to trip away and even out the hump so it has a bowl that's upside down [Music] the two solid cakes are becoming a mug so I have stacked all four layers on top of each other and now I'm also rounding out the top so it looks like an upside-down love as does another hamburger before filling all of these cakes of course I need to enlist the help of their sweet side the simple syrup will keep them nice and moist while I decorate and transform them into my favorite breakfast food I've chosen to fill my mug cake with coffee buttercream because it's actually in mugs section it's in coffee ception coffee buttercream inside a cake that will look like a coffee mug coffee better change my favorite I feel the layers it was coffee buttercream and I also crumb coated it in coffee buttercream [Music] so the proof ole cake I'm filling this cake was playing a town during buttercream and crumb coating it in the same for my tutu sock cake I'm crumb coating them with shop personal responsibly what do we do after crumb coating we chill written right there crumb coat my cakes are crumb coated and they're chilling can you please set a timer for me for 16 minutes all right 15 minutes started and now we're going to ice them all one more time using the same thing that I composition with all of the recipes I've used to make these cakes I have made in videos before so we'll put a playlist right here you can check them if all my cakes are ready to be decorated I'm going to start by making microsoft cakes first I'm going to cover my traditional croissant I have colored some fondant a sort of 10 pastry color and I'm going to roll it out as thin as possible then I founded strict fair I'm sorry it's just breakfast first thing I'm going to do is cover the entire crescent shaped cake and I just want to make sure that the theme of the bonnet is underneath the croissant so the thin layer of fondant is draped over the cake and then I cut away any excess underneath okay Google what is fondant fondant a thick paste made of sugar and water and often flavored or colored used in the making of candy and the icing and decoration of cakes I need this cake to appear like it is layers and layers of rolled up pastry just like the sauce so I continue rolling out my tan fondant as soon as I can and covering the cake each time making the piece a little bit shorter the other way I'd respond to this kind of comes into that nice little triangle in the middle I like to rip that off [Music] I'm going to set this one aside and move on to my chocolate croissants transform this cake I begin by covering the two sides with a thin small piece of Teflon now I need to roll out some more of that fence on it into a nice thin long bit I place my cake on the band and begin to roll the fondant over and as I turn the cake and roll it up with each turn I trim the sides of the band of fondant to make it just a little bit thick because at the end of the day I want to look like once again pastry layers that is included up inside to help both of these croissants was more like pastry I'm going to use the sharp tip of my paring knife to pour the fondant I want to create the look of more layers of pastry in the way that it crackles in the oven and I want to square the fondant in one direction I felt right besides looked a little bit flat on the chapel croissant so what I did is rolled out my remaining tan fondant and cut strips and then I folded those strips up on one another the same length as the side of Microsoft I just want to again create those layers of sort of spiraling layers and before adding it I used a knife and cut a very thin slice of a spiral I just want to end leather sticking out and then I glued it to either side of my case using a bit of water [Music] time to add a little more color to these Kisan they look like they need baking so I've mixed a little bit of ivory food coloring with some clear food grade alcohol and now I'm going to paint both of these croissants to get them a darker golden color [Music] once I've allowed the paint to dry I fear that they might be a little dark before my next step so I'm going to use a bit of water and a bigger paintbrush to actually brush away some of the painting I have done and I really just want the paint to remain in the sport I want to create a minimal scoring and I want the overall service to be enlightened I actually have another assistant in the kitchen I have three suggests to just need Google tip and burning you might have noticed we've got a greater than others this is Bernie 2.0 I've placed my croissant cake onto metal tape and I'm no expert but I don't think you should hold fire next to cardboard cake board Bernie is going to help me lay these clocks which is going to give me such a nice golden texture it's going to make the font a little bit crunchy too which is really cool when you do it later on these croissants look perfectly baked I can't wait to begin but for now I'm going to put them aside let them cool off and drive some pretty and I'm going to move on to new people let me introduce you to the fruit bowl it is the balance on this breakfast ring because after to put on maybe you chefs and food I start by placing my cake which now looks like an upside-down Bowl on to the very same cake pan that I've baked in it I'm doing this because I need to create a lip on this bowl once it's covered to hold the fruit I'm covering this ripple in a beautiful lavender fondant I roll out my lavender fun and drape it over the bowl and then I smooth it around the bowl using the palms of my hands and the fondant smoother you want to turn this on in about a quarter of an inch away from the bottom of the cake so calculate where that is for you and then of course I used 8 a self-made ruler I cut a piece of cardboard mat the height that I needed it held it up against the cake and first I scored all the way around with my paring knife and then I cut into that score right down to the cake then I'm going to take the opportunity to score a second line in the fondant this time I'm not cutting right through I'm just using the tip of my paring knife to make a little score because I'm going to add a paintable detail at the top of my bowl I have mixed a little bit of gold luster with clear food grade alcohol and I'm just going to paint the top of the bowl above where I scored and the very top rim it lets us paint dry and while it does you can prepare some fruit to add to the top of the fruit bowl cake try to use your favorite fruits I used raspberries blueberries golden berries blackberries and then a few green grapes for just a different color if you do plan on making this breakfast in bed cake why not take part in our replicate contest I am looking for amazing bakers because I want to feature your work in it here's how to get involved take a look at our replicate playlist choose a cake you love replicate it and then post it to facebook or instagram using the hashtag replicate that we can find you and remember you can enter as many times as you like try as many takes as you would like and give them your own tool it's moving on to my favorite part is breakfast a frosty cup of cappuccino I'm going to apply finance this month cake exactly the same way I did to my fruit bowl cake once again I score it so that I can make a quarter inch slip one type the mug back right side up time to add a handle to this mug of course I made my handle in advance so that it could dry and I did it simply by rolling a tube of white gum paste out and inserting a floral wire down the middle then I bent the wire with the gum paste keep on it and then I set that handle aside to dry it's time to insert my now dried mug handles so remember we have the excess wire hanging up from the handle and I also added just half of toothpick to the ends of the handle as well to really help support it and before adding it to the cake I typed a little bit of royal icing onto the ends of the handle and then I included a mystery do you need to sort of hold it there for a bit and you can brush away the excess royal icing from the scheme's with a damp brush I have to personalize this mother for Mother's Day so I rolled up some black fondant really really thin and a little bit of pink fondant really really thin and then I used some tappets to cut out I heart mom I brush a little bit of water on the back of my letters and my heart and place them centered on the front of the month what mom wouldn't want that love tell me this can you show me the picture of a perfect cappuccino to recreate these troughs for my cappuccino I made a small best of my seven-minute frosting that recipe is also in the playlist that we mentioned earlier with all the other recipes I used to click [Music] I reserved just a little bit of my seven-minute frosting and I added my coffee concentrate which is what I use paste the content expired this must just to turn it a little bit Brown or first coffee colored and then I use the tip of a spatula to swirl that into this Devvarman I know barista our teeth it wasn't one of those ones that I made it look like jaws face or anything like that I just wanted you know like when you scare your cappuccino and the coffee comes up and it was at home and you're like I cannot wait to take a sip that that kind of a look before I put everything together on this breakfast tray I need to top my croissants so the chocolate croissant I have melted a few dark candy melts put them in a parchment piping bag and then created a chocolate drizzle diagonally across the croissants it was so satisfying I also piped a little bit of chocolate at either end of the facade to look like where the chocolate sort of fakes out of the chocolate sauce there was a lot of work chocolate I feel like you can't do the word chocolate too much so just leave that in the side so for the crescent-shaped facade I brushed on a thin thin layer of piping gel on the surface and added some sliced almonds I didn't want just a plain traditional clothes on I want and all this because that's my favorite I need to just tap a light sprinkling of icing sugar on top of the cloth now I know some of you are going to be upset that I'm endorsing cake for breakfast but I really just

I run it one month but this time when the size crops your face you have to change of a surface that's an excellent idea Connie you are watching how to take it I'm Yolanda and Canada is turning 150 so what better way to celebrate them making two giant Nanaimo bar cakes they're like what are Nanaimo bars I'm going to show you I started by making the crust on the bottom I am thinking brown it's just because I like any excuse to bake brownies and I love brownies and in addition I folded in some toasted coconut chips and some slivered almonds because normally in an enamel bar crust there is almonds and coconut along with graham crumbs and cocoa and butter and it all just compressed so I needed my brownies to look like the crust of a nanami bar once my brownies are baked and cooled I removed them from their pen the brownies are already a square but I want to cut off the ends of the brownies on all four sides so that I can reveal this beautiful coconut and almond inside then I decided to slightly level my brownies they're pretty much level they're more level than cakes and they don't even have a hump they have more of a slight valley okay so you've leveled up the ready the base of my Nanaimo bars are ready I'm going to move on or undo one of the things we're going to move on to the stilling I baked one large rectangular vanilla cake and then I removed it from its pan leveled it and cut it into two squares and then I will bars have like a sweet creamy filling and there's normally a bit of English custard powder inside which gives it a slight yellow tone but my Nanaimo bars are going to have vanilla cake as the filling ice on the outside and the top with Italian meringue buttercream that I'm going to die the right color once I have my two even squares Isis Beach one over and remove the carmelization from the bottom now it's time to you guessed it the square is simple and get hot on oh my gosh I simple serve dry banana cakes making sure that they wouldn't dry out while we decorate I just want to let you know how devoted how to cake it is to Canada miss Jocelyn over here tried to get Justin Trudeau on the show and for those of you don't know that is our prime minister which is like the president so the leader of Canada Canada's turning a hundred and fifty this year this is a big deal which also is like hey I think you should learn to prop code I'm going to be excellent exposure for him right Cassini's exposure I'm going to die some of my Italian meringue buttercream with a little bit of yellow food coloring to turn it into that creamy custard e color I find it easier when I'm trying to achieve a lighter color to just take a bit of buttercream out put it in a smaller bowl dye it and then add it back as I need to because once you go beyond you can't go back unless you have more about it there's no return from colored butter or on some kind of like scary treatment now that my buttercream is the perfect color I am going to crown coat and chill these two vanilla tea your friends a favor to you just passing my green juice yes miss Jocelyn owl and goose sounds exactly like what you would drink organic curly kale Organic dinosaur kale organic apple yeah I think that's mighty organic the owl is drinking a green juice I've seen enough good I'm going to now I sees cakes with a thicker layer of my Italian meringue butter Spain and I want the edges to be as straight as possible as well as adding a thicker layer on I find it really helpful because we seek is loading a small straight spatula on the side and then a larger offset spatula to drag in the excess see [Music] cap cake is on sale today early bird pricing is only for one week so register now while the pricing is low I have a question is the early bird an owl that drinks is you know I think it's just a burden eat cake you're right kam cake is a one day live stream baking camp hosted by me on Facebook this year kam cake is on July 29th and August 1st you get to spend a full day with me while I'm in this kitchen and you're in yours we will do everything together we will be making my taco cake which I have never made on this channel but they are in my upcoming book as well as Sunday cupcakes so pick the date that works for you because we'll be doing the same project on both days head-to-head Katy calm and register now I can't wait to bake with you and you get to see another hunk oh good I'm going to be watching this next Nanaimo bars our cover the final layer is melted chocolate with butter for my cake Nanaimo bars I'm going to make modeling chocolate modeling chocolate is really easy to make no matter what type of chocolate you use you just put your chocolate into a bowl along with corn syrup and then you place a bowl over a pot of simmering water you let the ingredients melt on their own and then you stir it together until all the chocolates is melted and pour it into a bowl to set our support into a plastic bowl because it does get sort of sticky and you will need you know a plastic scraper to scrape it out of the bowl when it's said it should be quite firm but your people can model with it for all the details on my modeling chocolate recipe we will put that in the description below I'm going to roll this modeling chocolate out to a big enough square to cover the top of each Nanaimo bar and I wanted some texture because often when you pour a glaze on a dessert bar then you would use a spatula to spread it and so you might see a little bit of texture even after it settles so I use a smaller rolling pin and basically created like full ways wave in my modeling chocolate I did this twice because I'm making two Nanaimo bars and then I put the modeling chocolate in the fridge to chill so it to be nice and set when I cut it into a perfect square to assemble these bars the first thing I'm going to do is spread just bump up your path of my custard colored buttercream onto the top of my brownie now I'm going to save my iced vanilla cake on time at this time if you find that your sizing is off if your brownie is a little too big on one side don't worry just trim it where necessary and feed it I didn't even have like a scrap pool beside me at this point because you're looking at the scrap Bowl here's a great way to prospect the icing I cut a cake board to the exact size of my brownie and then I laid that cake board on top and I lined it up I actually use the fondant with her not for fondant I just held it up against each side making sure that the board was lined up with the brownie and then I use a small straight spatula to fill in the icing along the sides of the cake does this one look a touch up and then carefully remove the cake board and again dragging in the excess buttercream to the center top of this cake can this just be the hostess finally it's time to add our chocolate glaze or in this case our modeling chocolate what I'm going to do is take that same cake board and I'm going to lay it on top of my wavy modeling chocolate now I'm going to use a sharp paring knife to cut all four sides into a perfect square this is why it's imperative imperative it's imperative that your modeling chocolate is cold because if it won't warm at this point your glaze would be like you understand that yes and you don't want that I use a straight spatula to help me lift up my chilled modeling chocolate square and then I place it carefully on top topping off - now on the first one that I did my squared modeling-chocolate was so a touch too long so quickly took it off trimmed off like an eighth of an inch and put it back this is another reason why it's great to work with cold modeling chocolate so your hands are very awesome because it is imperative and it's tenant 150 yes that's very fine yes only Justin Trudeau was here he would have been like what am i doing on this show so about it no that is not it chocolate Canada is turning a hundred and fifty so of course I had to make a gum paste Maple Leafs whoo yes cut it out let it dry and then once it was dry I attached a bamboo skewer to the back with some oil I think and then I can stand it up like a topper but the key is you need to make this ahead of time so it's really really dry you can even do this weeks before I mean I knew the birthday was coming Jocelyn I feel like you'd failed me I could have been sitting here with JP and drink imagine a second sold it would have been amazing it would have been me like this [Applause] four more giant food cakes I have a playlist right here and I also have a great summer cake playlist the fun ideas of

have to call in the help of sir please you really help me shower all my cakes were simple syrup leaving the one simple syrup is simply a mixture of one part sugar and one part water boiled together and cool and then with the help of a spoon I sprinkle it onto my case to help keep them moist during decorating I wanted to fill this cake with colored buttercream during Mother's Day I feel so I colored some buttercream a nice yellow and some a really nice pink and then I built my take as two separate cakes for now both cakes are made up of three layers of cake each filled with a lovely layer of pink buttercream and a lovely layer of yellow if you're looking for videos of my simple syrup buttercream leveling technique or my cakes there is a rose rescue dog penis right here just click on the high nuts aside time [Music] okay sir stop back and kill me okay ready I didn't you said it and we're good no that was a undercover I'm use that one oh how could you do better pigs do it better go now that my two tapers fat it's time to show them you have to fashion all at once that sounds like I know exactly what I'm talking about great asking you I'd like to carve my Bey's in two halves before putting it together I begin with the cake that will be the bottom of my beans and I place a six inch round cake pan on top then I trace around that cake pan with a small serrated knife and remove the excess cakes on the side now I need to flip it I lay a four and a half inch round cake board on top of the cake which will become the ball and then I use my serrated knife to carve the cake tapering it from that four and a half inch circle down to this six inch all the way around okay okay I need I need a motion for like lazy susans asterixis is weird it's carved the top half of my base I repeat this process is my second cake and set I use a three inch circle cutter placed on top to measure jeremy is the footage of all of it I never made a Vaz I made a business is this base or Vaz leave a comment below if you know the feeling it's not the same so how can we work of it we are good leave why pervades possess Luanda says and leaves e3j Oh Eva Jade for vol because that's a job she only uses crystals Azam for her expensive flowers in order to assemble this beige I need to add a six inch round board to the middle and some dowels to support the top I think it was a cake that would be the bottom half of the day and I slip you want the cake to rest on a bore so that the 6-inch diameter is on the top now I need to insert some dowels and mark them flush with the top of the cake so that I can cut them and insert them in a circle formation okay dowels now let's get information probably never belong with that oh I know I spread a very thin layer of buttercream on top of the cake and then I place a six inch round cake board on top of those Devils once again I spread a very thin layer of buttercream on top of the cake board and then I place the second half the top half of my baby right on top it is time to crumb coat and I take advantage of my crumpet and chill moments by washing all my dishes and not the bad music stuff far and for me that's like my my fists right I'm not it bothers me the whole time if you ever see my eyes looking off in the distance when I'm taking on the show because I'm looking and make dirty dishes and it just wanna wash once my take is chilled I iced it one more time with a thicker layer of Italian meringue buttercream and place it in the fridge if you want more cakes that are perfect for spring no matter what you're celebrating then check out this playlist just click on I'm washing my dishes I've decided to go with his days in marbled fondant I'm going to do this but in this print the other pale pink purple pencil and what I like to do when I marble fondant is actually take those colors and roll out too and then I made traced out of those two oh yes I'm braiding or SS change my expanded and then once it's braided I sort of spiral up the braid don't forget yogurt I think you need to like to physically sign my hand to the chick so it spirals up my braid and then for the flattened life on to get it ready to be rolled up so this is both of my braids but one on top of the other and it looks so pretty looks pretty weird and pretty but don't worry it's gonna work out I begin to roll out my vomit and I realize I kind of just like to pattern and some of these tubes weren't sticking together as well as a nice first stop to the Midway and I decide to brush up all the exercises and fold my phone it over one more time pieces will now keep in mind with Marvel's fondant there's only so much you can play with it before you do it to commend the color so the more that you need it together or fold it over the more blended the colors will be before I cover this cake in fondant I want to announce rest look good I don't like that one I knew such okay I am working on a super secret project and if you're an amazing Baker I want to feature your work go to our replicate playlist find the cake you want to make and get baking replica good make sure to take a high-res photo and posted on Instagram or Facebook making sure to use the hashtag deficit secret project up the fondant I use my French rolling pin but instead of draping it the way I normally do I actually roll it up backwards over my rolling pin then I hold my friend's rolling pin upright and unravel the fondant around working quickly I use a fondant smoother and the palms of my hands to smooth the fondant all over the cake and then where the ends of fondant meet I need to cut a clue I also use my sharp paring knife to trim away any excess fondant from the bottom first I tuck that fondant in as best I can and then I trim very close to the fog noticing if you're looking for gifts for your mom please check out how to keep calm we have prints we have all of the tools I use and this you take the cake pin at the top of the vase I use my fondant smoother to really smooth out that fondant it's kind of tricky cuz it's so narrow I did have a couple of creases but I really wanted to flatten it on the top and then I placed the cake fridge to chill once I bond it is chilled I'm going to use the same circle cutter 2/3 and circle cutter that is to measure the top of the base to cut off the excess spawn at the top so that none of it is dropping in [Music] Canaan are awesome therefore something for tuna right Jeremy perhaps marinated eggplant chocolate anyway never it is okay tried to add my plastic cylinder down into the secret chamber I know it fit because i measured exactly for that i love this cake because you can cover it in any font that you want use any flowers that you want and really customize it for your life here's the important tips i would not use a glass cylinder although glass is food safe and you can wash it if the glass is really thin you're in danger of having it or chipping it I don't like glass and cake I don't know about you it's not my thing happy Mother's Day to the North American month happy belated Mother's Day to the UK and Australian mom and any other moms around the world that I might have forgot

hit the notification belt so you know when a new video is ready and please subscribe to my channel and help you hit 3 million damn Jeremy no Jeremy are you part of this team are you funded ki-woo there you go I have chosen to make the tiger monkey and panda emoji all of the emotion cakes are banana that is my favorite flavor of cake and I rarely made it on how to kick it but there is a video in your recipe box please make this banana cake is amazing I baked all my banana cakes remove them from their pens space fascinating and I can't wait to listen yes you know what I want this gone look at me look at me guys I want this to be left in the video because all they here are my snarky remarks towards you guys but they never hear it being reciprocated now do they they have been misled the people my cakes are ready for simple syrup and much like carrot cake banana is very moist because of all the bananas to give them a light showering think about like a April spring shower that kind of show not a downpour these cakes need to be filled and staffed into three separate cake I chose them to fill them with chocolate buttercream YUM because what is better than chocolate and banana what's better nothing effect exactly I need to spread a layer of chocolate buttercream onto the top of three of my banana cakes and then I'm going to stack a engine annotate on top of each one of those and you'd like to see how I make my chocolate buttercream there is a video in your recipe boxes check it out and now thank you just leave some footage of distance in order to help me make these emojis of course I created ten flakes you're using pathways yeah you're really good hold on I know I'm excellent Macaulay lookout when I cut out my templates I made a plain piece of paper underneath each one essentially I was cutting out a copy of the emoji that I'm cutting out and the reason I wanted to do this is I can use that plain piece of paper that's in the correct shape on my cake and dirty it and not worry about it when I cut out these templates I cut one ear off each animal because we're going to have the ears later you think keypress I lay the clean paper template on top of one of my cakes and just carve out the pandas space shape nests I'm going to cut out the monkeys face shape and then finally I'm going to cut out the tigers to make the ears I use some cake scraps leftover from cutting the shapes of the faces and then I sandwich them together with more chocolate buttercream and use the ear templates that I cut off to make two ears for each animal here's another nature fact birthday soft panda monkeys and tiger all have two ears Wow this is better than BBC and it didn't take seven years to make took seven hours using my template to help me submission the ears I had two ears to each one of the animals and then I crumb close them all and chill them all I need to do a Content children I feel like it should be thank you don't forget about our crumb coat and chill bundle which we have at Hanukkah calm it has everything you need to practice now that the crumb coat is chilled it's time to ice these cakes one more time and show them again I used to play McHale meringue buttercream to crumb coat my cakes and I'm going to use it again to ice them these cakes need fondant of course I'm covering my panda cake in white fondant my monkey cake in a light brown fondant and my Tiger cake in the yellow fondant I roll out each color of fondant making sure it's large enough to drape over the cake then I pick it up with my French rolling pin drape it over and smooth it with my hand we really want to make sure to get between the crease of the ears like where the gears is the face and around the ears I think these are good starter cakes this is what I need for more of my character cakes some of which are easy some of which are really hard I have a whole character playlist right here before moving on to decorating each one of these animals I took the time to cut out their facial features from each one of its essence now for each emoji cake I have a stencil as well as all their little facial feature templates that I need to cut out of fondant so the first animal I met was panda using my fondant rolling pin in a nonstick board I roll out all of the colors I need for all of the Pens of facial features [Music] he's just go striking now I can start to cut out all the shapes I need for the pandas face so there's his deep dark eyes and then his beautiful white people I needed to cut out the gray that's in size this year he's such a good listener I think it's because of where his ears are talking about a panda what are you trying to say you can't choose who you love jump I need to build out my panda snout and nose so I'm leaving some white fondant and my template just to mold and sculpt that prop sort of triangular shape and then I sculpted his cute little nose with a ball of black fondant that I formed into like a soft little triangle and used appointed sculpting tool to indent his nostrils to cover the pandas years in black fondant I rolled it out nice and thin then I brushed a light layer of water onto his ears and laid the fondant on smoothing it in the same way I did before and then I just trimmed the ears to fit specific [Music] I add the rest of his facial features using just a little bit of water and stencil to help me with placement now for the month emoji once again I roll out all the colors I need to seduce monkeys face and then I want to build out his face in not too but mostly shapes the monkey shaped monkey face shapes yes but to create that I actually use that bit of my leftover light brown that I covered monkey with and mix with in with some white fun to get a nice pen color I rolled it out all the fixed side about a quarter of an inch thick and then I used that part of this template to cut out dare I say this bulky thing another bulky monkey negocios once I spread out my monkeys bulky face I added to the top of the cake again using my stencil to help me position it and I just rest on a little bit of water underneath to hold it in place I can now cut the other details out that I need for the monkey so I cut out all the parts of his eyes and his nostrils and his release I use my stencil and a brush use a little bit of water to add all of these facial features in the right place around his nose I accentuated the indent using a consultant you know monkey is that guy that just makes you laugh all the time the problems our relationship is we have a lot of disagreements without bananas like what you like monkey just wants to eat all bananas and I want to save them all till they're overripe and perfect for making banana cake and it's just you know we can never resolve it I just feel like neither one of us wants to come to a compromise I don't know what's so funny because my shirt does say all I do is take cake cake no matter what this is the fact I've printed on myself it's also the third t-shirt exclusive to Katy club's members so if you are a member I cannot wait to see you rocked it and if you're not find out more at how to keep calm I'm going to roll out all the colors I need to make Tiger nice and thin with my fondant rolling pin and my nonstick boards and then I'm going to use my template to help cut them out ah I love a part of it I also have to build up to beard Tiger is a bit of a hipster so like he's really focused on swapping his beard so I really had to get it right you know he's that kind of guy so what I did is I rolled up some ivory colored fondant and cut out and feared and added it to the bottom of the page and I made sure really nicely print she just has the cutest little dream man so again I created his nose and then I use a point of sculpting tools in Jena and nostrils and I added that right above his fears why am i pointing to my favorite will have appeared [Music] Tiger is just you know who's that guy he's the guy no he's bad for you you know he's rough around the edges I know but he's soft inside you know what I need Jocelyn okay I know that he's soft inside that he's always like I'm sure good many husbands like tattoos and it's just right for this I like it but I know I shouldn't like him don't forget to subscribe and help me hit three million and hit that notification valve so you know when a new video is ready thanks for

for me because they were taken off the endangered list already else at that time you have to cut one of you be men out of your life I have to cut one emoji animal I feel like I really owe it to Tiger to give him another chance I just I know that I can change this time something about pandas eyes I just I felt such a connection and just I feel so safe with him so I think it's Panda like actually listen I can't have a man in my life he's going to tell me to stop making banana cake sorry monkey [Music] [Music] 
you're watching how to cake it I'm Yolanda and this week I made a rocky road ice cream sandwich if you love cake Angelov ice cream and you have ice cream cake please share this video we would really appreciate it just click the button below share it wherever you like it's not ice cream love it don't deprive them give them your ice cream so I just live special I make eight pounds of my Yas ultimate chocolate cake I folded in marshmallows one and chocolate chips mom I bake the cake in baking trays like trays that I normally make cookies on I have never done that on panicky it's monumental it is orhan insert monumental needed ice cream festival and icy cold yes a golden one now from these two rocky road case I want to get three layers of cake to build up my ice cream sandwich so from each cake I cut one whole strips of the appropriate size and then one half strip so now I have two full strips and two half shifts that will make up pelea first ways was up to the challenge and help me simple syrup all of my rocky road cake layer it's not just chocolate cake right it has more attitude kind of like me with an ice cream tattoo you all right now you better like it don't ya ten of the pony tells you they don't let my hat to do I throw anything like mr. t I pity the fool tells me they don't like my tattoos these temporary tattoos are actually a set of four and they come in our summer time bundle which is available at how to keep it calm now that the simple syrup has soaked in I want to stack and fill these cakes with my Italian meringue buttercream like ice cream in an Ice Cream Sandwich vanilla iced at a full layer on the bottom buttercream then I use my two half layers to make one full layer butter cream and then the final four layer time to crumb coat giant cake and get it in the fridge to chill I always point over there as if that's what rich kid yeah we just don't put her in the interview she's a little you know she's very stainless steel II now I need to make the giant rectangular cookies that will sandwich this delicious cake and some buttercream later on for this I'm making some chocolate sugar cookies it's simply made by creaming together butter sugar brown sugar vanilla are you with me salt you know that pinch then when that's nice and light and fluffy I add in some eggs and finally I add my dark cocoa flour cornstarch to this in water mix the dough till it's fully incorporated but often some dry ingredients get caught at the bottom of usual so turn it out knead it on the table so it's fully incorporated and then chill your dough for about 30 minutes wrap it up tight and fast once my dough is chilled I'm going to roll it out onto some silicone baking mat roll down to a big rectangle cut all four sides straight and then I sort of round into the coins just a texture like an I treat them [Music] finally I'm going to use a piping tip to cut all the perforated schools that are in the city of a new suspect so I did this the same way I did it to my giant graham cracker cookie and my morphing not you better check yourself before you wreck yourself okay I did I just mix mr. t and ice cube I'm cold after I've cut out two cookies that are the exact same size with the rounded corners and all the perforated holes I'm going to chose my cookie dough because it's warm and it goes into a really hot oven and it just has such a crisp you want it to be nice and chilled and then place it in a hot oven apple doesn't kill that cookies before baking them because they're not spread that wasn't that wasn't I lost my sister to you I baked my cookies I'm taking them out of the oven to cool completely we are going to put this ice-cream sandwich together my cookies were completely cooled and I need to begin by picking one of them off the pen and flipping it upside that wasn't scary [Music] time to take out my case which is the inside of this ice-cream sandwich this wasn't scary either I had to lift up the cake and place it on top of the upside-down cookie Center and it went well I was afraid of the Christmas break and went well didn't break finally I need to spread a little bit of buttercream on top of my cake so that the top cookie will stick and then I carefully remove that cookies and place it on top of the cakes right-side up it's time to recreate the ice cream part of this ice cream sandwich and speaking of ice cream if you love ice cream cake we have a whole playlist right here it's popsicle in the toilet he is a frozen dessert yes I think you've got to be right we would like frozen yogurt in yes we would let so they answer this list well not me personally but you don't do survey kind of turn to this light dessert some on a light dessert I'd have some strawberries that's where I stand now that the cake is assembled there should be sort of a border around the case of buttercream lifts cookie I suppose a piping bag with a big round tip and pipes the buttercream in onto the sides of the cake [Music] then I use my spatula to spread it all around and a bench scraper to get it flush with the sides of the ice-cream sandwich she's my old dancer so what this is very easy which goes with - you're teasing and this really amazes but I'm taking this a step further you know how mr. t wears like a ton of change yeah I need to put some change on this edge big damage of I change I mean like chocolate walnut marshmallows and chocolate chips and sprinkles I need to chill this cake so that the buttercream is nice and firm before I add my topping the first thing I did was melt some compound chocolate so that I could pipe it onto the surface of my Ice Cream Sandwich cake and let it drift down the side I want to create a really clean diagonal line but actually laid a piece of cardstock paper which is just like sturdy paper on top so that I wouldn't get like a wavy line and wanted a nice line so it looked like it had been dipped I really want a fixed ice cream so yes lunch that's what we're going to happen looks good you know I could pour chocolate on the cake I'm making next it's another fruit that people often different chocolate the bit of a CD case like Walter it is it is so to create my uh what do I call it and yeah but it's not all over like their life remember this picture yeah there's a band of it so okay so what your thing is with your topic you organize them and strip yes I did organize a line of chopping to be fair it was randomly placed topping in a line give it some marshmallows I'm talking about chocolate chips of walnuts don't forget my sprinkle did is a fool who doesn't get a sprinkle returnees Bock these are the same sprinkles I'm using on Kent cake right now I'm here with you but I am also live on face a cat if you miss carrot cake this summer don't worry we'll be doing another one soon I have to tell you something dropping insult everyone let me tell you something that has made me very obsessed oh no everyone likes to ask what I do with the cake and

welcome back to how to cake it I'm Yolanda it's 2018 it's a new year and I'm sure everyone is thinking about health and wellness everyone has their resolutions and so to do my part I am now making small kids see Baby Cakes how to cake it is supporting New Year's resolutions one cake at a time to make my five baby cakes I baked a rectangular chocolate cake removed it from his pen and leveled it then I used my circle cutter sent I cut out five three inch circles five two and a quarter inch circles and five and one and a half inch circles now it's time for Sur squeezed to help me simple syrup all of my baby cakes I told him to be very gentle after I was done my simple syrup thing I decided to layer all of my cakes just because I thought well let me show you not just a layer of buttercream between this looks so cute so I cut all 15 of my circles into two equal layers I'm not gonna simple serve these extra layers they'll be fine you're really just slashing calories left right and center I'd like to put some beautifully colored buttercream into some of these mini cakes so in three separate bowls I am creating pink yellow and teal butter I love that these cakes are so small because I can set up an assembly line to fill them I never get to do that I'm filling five baby cakes with three tiers each two of the cakes will have plain vanilla buttercream one will have pink one will have yellow and black will have two you may be one of your new year's resolutions isn't about cutting calories maybe it's about taking your baking game to the next level I have a cake book that can help you do that my cake book is actually divided into three sections which are taking your first steps take it up a notch and take it to the limit each section has cakes that suit that level so there's beginner intermediate and advanced so please check it out at how to kick it calm I prank on it all the cakes in the same buttercream that I feel oh they weren't wobbly but cakes this small are really liked and so they move around [Music] I've always said the crown girl should have pachinko we're not going through another year without is happening cries oh and cheer that's good now that my crumb coat is chilled it's time to ice all of my cake layers again with the same matching buttercream the icing was still kind of difficult they moved around but it was a bit better than the crumb coating I say no it's time to cover my baby cakes in fondant and you want to roll the fondant as thin as you can see how thin it is Jocelyn I think this fondant is like 1/16 of an inch I pick up my rolled fondant and drape it over the tiers and then I smooth it I use a fondant smoother and then like usual I trim the excess fondant away from the bottom I'm going to cover all three tiers of cake that are pink and three tiers of cake that are yellow in white fondant for my three tiers of teal cake I would like to achieve a marbled fondant what I'm doing is mixing together some white fondant with a little bit of black fondant and a little bit of yellow fondant and how I achieve the marbling is by rolling the fondant out into chords and then braiding them together I want the white cord to be sicker than the black and the yellow this just means they'll be more white because as you will open our goal fondant it does sort of mix together so you want to have enough white in there that it stays present so for each marble tear start again with new fondant and make a new braid of white and black yellow and cover the tiers as we go when these cakes are done I want four of my baby cakes to be covered in fondant and the fifth one to be a buttercream yo handbag designers like often name their handbags after women I have named these baby cakes after people on the how to cake a team I'm gonna start bringing these baby cakes to life and the first baby cake I'm gonna work on is the Connie yes Connie I named it after I simply use a small offset spatula to pick up the smaller tiers carefully and tear them one on top of the other the next thing I want to do is make some little sugar flowers and petals to put on this cake for this I roll out some pink gum paste really really thin and then I'm using flower plunger cutters to cut out the flowers I make three different size flowers and after I make them I lay them onto a floral sponge and I use a ball tool to just sort of accentuate the petal [Music] and as a little topper I took a small ball of gum paste and then added flowers all around it it's like a little bouquet to make my petals I used a round little piping tip and cut out circles and again place them all on a sponge and used a ball tool to curve them once they've dried enough I very gently painted these flowers with some luster dust sometimes I like to hold flowers in my hand but these are so small that I felt that if I held them in my hand I might break them so I laid them on a paper towel and use soft bristle brush with luster dust and just brush that luster all over the flowers and the tiny little petals now it's time to add the petals to the cake I just sort of placed the larger flowers first than some smaller ones the petals I kind of tried to sprinkle on I need this cake pukani not only because of her fondness of buttercream but just because I think this cake is like a classic it's like everyone likes this cake this cake always looks pretty the design you know what I'm saying it's a long-lasting design yeah right and back to me is Kona exactly onto my next baby cake the safe you can guess who this one's named after hmm parts and a unicorn horn Jeremy any guesses enough yeah yeah just stabbing the dark yeah meet the Jocelyn do we put your head on the horn it's weird good luck for this Kate I'm gonna decorate each tier before stacking I rolled out some pink yellow and like a Tiffany blue fondant really thin and then I used heart-shaped plunger cutters to cut out three different sizes of hearts from each color the next thing I want to do is add the hearts in a bend at the center of each tier to create the love all around and the love of this center of it all I'm not the only person in this room rolling math you guys don't see Jeremy's it's not really fair to create the topper for this cake which is the unicorn horn I'm gonna roll my three colors of fondant into three chords and then I'm going to brush a toothpick with a little bit of piping gel and wrap the three colored courts around the toothpick like spiral it around the top and then trim away any excess fondant in the product to allow my horn to set I place the toothpick into a cake dummy and set it aside just like the last cake I tear this cake by using an offset spatula to pick up each tier and place it on top of the last in this case I am gonna spread just a tiny bit of royal icing and I extrude it a pink poured a yellow cord and a tickly blue cord and then with a little bit of piping gel rushed on to the base of each cake I just wrapped that cord around I cut away the excess with a fondant net it sucks now I can place the unicorn horn on top at least I can make like a horn that is beer heaven he's gonna do it you can't it's gonna like throw the next cake on my list is the Jeremy yes this is the Jeremy and do you want to know why cuz Jeremy thinks he's like you know aloof he tries to act like I don't really care but when you just splatter all that stuff together it looks beautiful see what I mean are you next oh yeah how I did it I just I almost overlooked Jeremy I was like okay now to create the Jeremy cake I teared my three white fondant tiers one on top of the other with a little royal icing gluing them together then to cover up the seams I pipe some royal icing between the tiers and used a wet paint brush to just brush it on and smooth it I just want to see any cracks Jeremy I hit your scenes now comes the fun part and the part where I stained my turntable no it's still stained to create the paint I'm going to splatter with I am mixing some black food coloring with a little clear secret alcohol and some pink food coloring with clear food grade alcohol and just a touch of white food coloring and then for the metallic silver it is a luster dust that I mix again with clear food grade oh so the theme is clear food great alcohol and now I have fun battery I splatter one color at a time and experiment with different sized paintbrushes because depending on how tight the bristles are or the shape of the brush you'll get a different splatter you will also get an extremely stained fingertip you should have seen this nail [Music] I wanted to create kind of an abstract topper on this case so I took some black fondant and some pink fondant and I just pinched little pieces and rolled perfect balls between my two palms why don't I just say between my pounces if I have more than two I didn't use all four of my palms I just used two of them to add these pink and black decorative balls to my cake I just brush on a dot of clear piping gel and add them here in there come on top some at the edge some at the bottom wherever you like Jeremy has no rules I'm gonna go back sure let's make it yes Jeremy is a rebel [Music] [Music] I'll rescue you orhan okay the orhan is okay because we call Orhan our Turkish prince I decided to make a very regal cake a cake fit for a prince because Orhan is the how to kick it hottie there's a lit candle on this cake just try and blow it out still hot to make Orhan is very regal cake I'm going to decorate each tier first before stocking I use a fabric measuring tape and a knife to measure the circumference of each tier and then I divide it evenly and make a mark at those division points now what I want to do is create like a piped effect on the cake but I'm going to use a clay extruder yeah exactly i softened some white fondant and put it in my face treat her and then I extrude a nice thin cord I then use a circle cutter that I lay between the marks so I can mark sort of a half circle that's where like the draping like once I have my fin white cords of fondant I use a knife to cut several lengths and then I glue it onto the cake onto that sort of draped formation it was a little clear piping job if you enjoy seeing more than one cake in an episode just like this we actually do cake compilations over on our new channel how to kick it step by step and you can check those out right here once I've done all three tiers I add a second draped line over the first one IRA [Music] the next thing I need to do is trim the fondant cords where they need at the top of the cake just so there isn't that much excess now I can tear this cake one on top of the other with a little royal icing to secure it [Music] the next thing I do is pipe a very fine royal icing even border along the bottoms of each tier I'll type the bottom border on this cake when I move it later on to a cake sale now a hottie needs its candle doesn't it to create the candle I rolled a little bit of white gum paste over a floral wire and then just cut it to the right to make the little flame I roll just a tiny bit of deep yellow fondant into a ball and then sort of pinch the end of the ball to make it perfectly the finished candle can be inserted right down into the hood now I can add a pearl in a candy bead to the tops of each cake where the ends of the draping would secure the bead with a little bit of royal icing [Music] meet that Yolanda there I am Jocelyn you tell everyone why this is me okay this is you because your favorite color is yellow the color of butter yes you topped it with a star in your a shining star I wasn't thinking that and you do love gold I do and I love that it looks modern because you love modern art she did so well she's correct it's not because I ran out of other cakes those are the reasons that this cake is the Atlanta to decorate the Atlanta cake accentuated the marble design by painting along its natural lines with gold luster paint I used a thin paint brush to just paint right along those division lines so anywhere you want to do it you want a little gold you want a lot of gold however you want to do it while the bold is drying I am going to make some storms for this cake I used some star cutters and I cut the stars out of some yellow gum paste I love my gum paste ours to dry and then painted them with the same gold luster paint once everything is dry that's all three tiers of cake and my stars I tear the cake using royal icing to secure it and then I just put the biggest star on top actually glue to my biggest stars together to make it more secure and two ends of the star just sort of pricked into the top of the cake and then I glued some of these smaller stars here and there around the cake with royal icing and

you're watching how to cake it I'm Yolanda and it's chocolate eclair day this week so of course I have to keep a giant Eclair a couple my hair is having yeah mind me about my shorter hair I'm very upset about it let's treat you to make this giant Eclair I baked one vanilla cake and one chocolate cake for the vanilla cake I removed it from its pen and then I just slightly leveled the top so it would be more flat when I flipped it over now I'm going to cut this big rectangle in half lengthwise so that I have two long vanilla rectangles I need to flip both halves over and remove the carmelization from the bottom times the carve these two long rectangles into two halves of an eclipse for the top half and the bottom is a six inch round pan helps upside-down at each end to round them out the norm of a classier pot of elegant cotta and then I take my serrated knife and round the cake down all the way down a fan actually came up with the pun on this team and it's available only for a limited time at how to keep it up [Music] for the chocolate cake I removed it from its pan leveled it and then this time I cut it in half width wise cut the two halves of my chocolate cake to the desired width and then I sort of bust them up against each other lengthwise so now they're as long as my hot dog this cake will become the center sort of the chocolate cream in my Eclair I also need to round out the ends of this long chocolate rectangle this coming is a five inch round pen held at the end at a small serrated knife to round them off you with me are you watching me wick are you watching me cake cake I have cake cake yeah yes yeah a cake of cake yeah we struck Drake on the cake of cakes on our Instagram in the hopes that I could make history Priscilla and a lot of my wonderful viewers tagged him students Ralph John we've got 40 million followers I think it's hard to see your thoughts now that I'm happy with all my cakes Chris your squeeze is here to help me simple seriously once the simple syrup are soaked in it is time to plumb coat these cakes and get them in the fridge to check yeah I did it for all three cakes let's I see takes one more time nice and smooth and children in the French again for my Eclair top and bottom I have died from fondant to look well kind of a beige choux pastry color you see it's not shoe like the shoe on your foot if you like CH golden your face is this pastry that you make in a pot and flour and eggs and you cook it and then you type it I have to like again add this to our food coloring collection turkey skin steak steak base I feel like we're going to have the most disgusting line of food coloring but no one will go we're just going to call it ill I roll out my pastry colored fondant and then I drape it over the cake some of them with a fondant smoother and trim away the excess at the base with a sharp paring knife I do this to both halves of my éclairs and once I'm happy I start to mix some paint to paint them a little bit I want to paint a layer onto my pastry colored fondant just to give it a little more life so I'm what potion oh yes tiger I mixed oh I wish I could see drop in space because she wasn't like I breathe it she's like ivory again like all you ever talk about is high but you have a drawer full of like suturing and it's all the time right I've replayed right that was how she's better that was how it was I read oh it was ivory in connection with a little bit of brown and a little bit of white so Oh more opaque mix once the paint was dry I actually flipped what will be the bottom half of my betrayal over and I made sure to lay it on just a little piece of parchment paper because even though the paint is dry and we want to risk it have a six month course now it's time to play oh wait a minute I pressed mention while you of the chocolate cake trilling ahhh I slanted it a bit because I wanted to be a clay Claire usually like the silliness to the fuss maalai it's not just like great in order to place my chocolate cakes filling on top of the bottom of my Eclair the first thing I need to do is spread a crumb coat of Italian meringue buttercream now I carefully lift my chocolate cake using a really long spatula because remember we built this to change have you wanted to solve it first I carefully lift it up and place it on the center of my bottom clear just like in a clearance this is really satisfying actually so I use a whole lot of time meringue buttercream as I said in a piping bag with an open star tip and then what I did is I type the series of buttercream shells around the whole Eclair now on the back where the chocolate cake the strength is lower I only got one layer apply shells but on the front I doubled up into the second layer on top a good idea would be to chill your cake in between your layers just in case it's warm as it was for me and that way you won't risk ruining your first types players especially [Music] before I finish this with Claire take I want to let you guys know the camp cake is back I don't think give me a moment there we go Camp cake is a full-day live-streamed baking campuses me where I bake in this kitchen and you make in the

using the hashtag Camp cake squad it's time to finish the giant declare I need to clean I am using modeling chocolate as my glaze now I know I'm yours modeling chocolate on the channel before but it has always been made of white chocolate this time I mean it was dark chocolate I roll out the modeling chocolate the same way I would farm it and I pick up my modeling chocolate on a French rolling pin i draped the modeling chocolate over the top of my Eclair I begin to smooth it with my hands then I trim away the excess and I want it to look well like Glade so I don't want to cut a perfectly straight line first I use this tip of my knife to make a slight indent or mark it all the way around and instead of wavy line and once I'm happy with the way it looks I cut slices [Music] the thought of how good it felt to assemble the Eclair made me really excited maybe big excited it was so satisfying to talk to you Claire so all I had to do was pick up this final cake with its chocolate glaze on top and it was amazing I was so happy because I got it bang on the first time there's nothing worse than missing a little and then trying to shift things around it can be done but it's scary I'm so excited to decorate this Eclair I decided to first drizzle this chocolate glance with some pink and lavender candy now one thing that's hard about cakes is you can get so far and be happy but there's always a moment where you can wreck them it's just the truth so be confident and drizzle I further decorated the top of the Eclair using a variety of candies and decorations such as candy beads I used some really brightly yellow colored Jordan almonds what else did I use I basically wanted it to look like this is a like a real size declare I have sprinkles these decorations on but instead I placed each one with a little pat of caddy Mouse to glue it to the surface you guys always want to know what I'd use my case this week I'm saving this one for my mom because it's her birthday this week so

Jocelin hi I don't think my favorite smiles Oh welcome back to how to kick it I'm Yolanda and this week I am celebrating Star Wars 40th anniversary by taking a stormtrooper helmet well this clearly proves one thing to me everything amazing was born in 1977 full of grace anyone watching born in 1977 like me please leave a comment below I will find the comments and I will comment back you guys always know way more about Star Wars than I do all editions but one thing I know is that stormtrooper helmets are actually made out of 20 pounds of my ultimate soccer game black 20 I removed all of my cakes from their pens leveled them and then slice each cake into two players for a total of 10 the player okay the squeeze a lot is honored to discharge in its 40th Drover's anniversary and see simple syrup all of my cake layers in for the stormtrooper he was like a pure Cooper yeah go with it now that my simple syrup are soaked in I'm going to stack all of my cake layers filling them of my Italian meringue buttercream and I'm just going to reserve one final piece here [Music] so I chilled my cake until the buttercream was set to make it easier to sleep then I procrastinated for 40 minutes because I wasn't ready to school I really procrastinated honestly it was so hard I began by carving like the upper part of the helmet which is like me she's got a big forehead and then he has like part of the helmet like comes out over here [Music] and then I use my last layer of cake which I reserved to bulk up the front for his face ventilation I basically took that layer cut it in half and then I layered them on to the front of why am I doing this Jeremy what is he doing here exactly a lot of moaning I say I want to cry a lot I look at my phone a lot to look at pictures of stormtroopers the bender district insisting Jeremy found plans for a stormtrooper helmet plans like like a blueprint and then I collected props so this is a stormtrooper this is a dirty stormtrooper I really want to wash this map but it's paper Chewbacca and I are the two hairiest 40 year olds of all time once I was finished with the carving I crumb coated and chilled this baby prepare yourself Kronk oh yeah you end up this one [Music] after the film dealt with chills i iced my cake one more time trying to get my butter to this hospital and chilled it again if you enjoy watching the character cakes that i have bribed over and moaned over well making there's an entire playlist to them right here this is like the best job I've ever had and I'm so glad I don't have to wear it on my head before covering my stormtrooper helmet cake in fondant I'm going to build out parts of the cake with fondant underneath to help me reach the shapes done starting with I don't even lose the birth really the moaning blur the first thing I did actually was I rolled a big black bandhasana and I covered the bottom of the helmet he's really you would pick up with something and put it on so I wanted to give the illusion of like face underneath and then I began to fill out areas of the Kapus white I [Music] built out there like now ventilation [Music] and then I built out so like pools that's the fun of this place with this sequence goes are they speakers [Music] [Music] I built up this big forehead I put a layer of fondant over this forehead hey yo sis don't you brother bulky be the stormtroopers totally has a bulky space if you are a true fan and you know what I'm talking about hashtag bulky face solo I feel like stormtroopers jumped out of a desktop video even though they are older than Daft Punk I know this but can't you see Linda thing that was amazing so now it kind of covers the whole thing yes and I'm not procrastinating because this is going to be really easy there's nothing easier in fact been rolling out seven pounds with white fondant then trying to lift it up on different rolling pin and trying to drape it over a giant cake and then I had the pleasure of trying to smooth it all before it started to crack off that's the size that's what I do there's a lot of that [Music] you [Music] but now y-you know more procrastinating so now I looked at my phone 40,000 times and was just studying all the details and what I did is I use my small fondant rolling pin to roll out some grey fondant there's black fondant and we fondant to make all of these details thinking of characters the incredible Gustav who is a fan of how to take it and a visual artist has drawn me once again in character form and I look completely dope and I want you guys to see this video which makes this illustration from just finished please check it out Orhan can we do a split screen of me on this metal chair and the Gustav version of me on occasion go I'm not winning I already know it's now time for me to make all the details of this stormtrooper I basically just kept looking at a reference picture and then tackling the details one by one with all of my rolled up colors of fondant my best advice when tackling cakes like this are to be patient take your time you want to ensure that all the details on your helmet whether they lay on the right side or the left side are the same size and shape to make them pick up and if you want to mind to yourself is fine if you want to let the tears flow but at least nobody's filming you Jeremy click listen you can't let fear stop you that's the thing I was scared to make this I don't know anything about stormtroopers clearly but I wanted to do it you know the further I got the more I wanted to actually present it for those of you who belong to the cake tea Club this month's tea is the new happiness - you had me a cake and this month cake teen club members also get this drawstring bag for free it's perfect for all your t-shirts so they're like the filters that filter all the sastras are out in them they're always looking stuff out area in school I want now I want more much but I think they're filters filters they're like built-ins air to air - of course just enough air and just like it's so that they can breathe pure air yes or going again I painted the inside of this goggle so when the helmet was complete I mix a little bit of hair finding gel with water and then I threw the Stormtrooper a party because he's 40 like me but I hope someone will throw me a party not just throw confetti in my face for the third year in a row thank you for watching how to take it I want to wish a very happy 40th anniversary to Star Wars don't forget to hashtag 1977 if you're with me I see you 
welcome back to how to kick it I'm Yolanda and today I am making a chocolate peppermint mega cake it's been a while since I've made a mega cake and chocolate mint happens to be one of my favorite flavor combinations I'm just gonna take it to begin I baked 3/8 inch ultimate chocolate cakes and I'm going to remove them from their pens you can find my ultimate chocolate cake recipe in my cake book you can also find 21 novelty cakes 20 of them never seen before on this channel 220 first one is gone now it's time to level all three of my cakes and cut two of them into two layers as you can see my third cake is much shorter than my other two and this is because I baked half the batter in my third pack I just want to get one layer of cake from this cake of course they're squeezes here to help me simple syrup all 5 layers of my chocolate cake you better be up for this job as you guys know simple syrup is just one part water one part sugar boiled together and cooled and then I pour that into Sur squeeze and he helps me shower it over my cakes to keep them moist during the decorating process if you want your own Sur squeeze and his girlfriend for now they're both available at how to cake it calm while the simple syrup is soaking into my five chocolate cakes I'm gonna color some buttercream and flavor it a nice minty green and I'm going to color it with some kelly green a touch of blue and flavor it with some peppermint oil I kept a mint Oreo nearby so I could compare my buttercream color to the inside cream of the and now that I'm happy with my color it's time to flavor this buttercream and make it nice [Music] no more mint because I'm using peppermint oil it is a highly concentrated flavor so again just like color you want to add it little by little mix it in and then really capture this close up pull deep it's not really minty is it this oh well see what I mean I would have taken it too far I would have taken it too far it's time to assemble this chocolate peppermint mega cake and for this I'm using chocolate cake mint buttercream chocolate ganache peppermint patties and some mint oreos yum yum yum to begin filling this cake I'm going to spread chocolate ganache on my bottom layer of cake I'm really trying to figure out if I should start with mint oreos or if I should start with peppermint why am I asking them when there are three guys gift how would I take a vote Jeremy cookies in the middle no no no that's not the question Oh Jeremy you're some attention I'm gonna line up some Oreos to cover the whole surface spread some of my mint buttercream on top and then top with the next layer of while spreading your buttercream you want to press down so that it fills in all the gaps between the Oreos and it's okay if you go over the edge of your cake because we're gonna save that buttercream for the crumble but this next layer I'm gonna spread on a thin layer of my new buttercream then top the entire cake peppermint patties spread on some more butter cream and add the next layer of pink if you know somebody who's planning their first cheat day of 2018 please share this video with them this is gonna be my first cheat day so I'm going to recreate each one of these layers one more time starting with the ganache mint Oreo buttercream have some chocolate cake and then buttercream peppermint patties more buttercream and add the fifth chocolate cake we call it a mega cake for a reason I've got to take it over the top did I cut one in the last one no this is so weird sitting like it did in the first one okay okay this mega cake is all filled with chocolate peppermint goodness and now it's time to give it a good crumb coat using this crummy buttercream that we saved guys don't forget I have a new channel how to take it step by step and we have cake compilations on that channel as well as step by step videos that show you how some of my most popular cakes come together if you want to check it out click the eye my crumb coat is now chilled so it's time to ice this cake I like to ice the top of my cake with a large offset spatula and for the sides I'm going to ice with a straight spatula oh we edit that out more huh you didn't see anything I like to use a bench scraper when I'm trying to get my sides nice and smooth once you're happy with the way your cake is iced you can use your offset spatula to pull in the excess buttercream on top pull it straight into the center of the cake just want to wipe off the excess every time okay boys I'm going to the fridge bye don't worry none of you have to get the door for me why would you do that and now that my cake is chilling I'm gonna take this opportunity to make some chocolate bark to go on to make this bark I'm using two types of chocolate I'm using white chocolate and dark chocolate and the first thing I need to do is chop them nice and fine so that I can start about them yes I am struggling I think you just want to get closer to the chocolate all right I'm gonna melt my chocolate in 20 second increments stirring in between well until it's melted I don't want to overheat it so while I wait guys who likes my t-shirt guys I'm asking thank you thank you because it's this month's cake tea club tea if you're a member of the cake tea Club you get a new t-shirt sweater or apron every month it's like a gift you can head over to how to kick it calm and sign up I'll get it to you sign up to be a member of the cake teeth club now back to chocolate both of my chocolates are melted this is my dark chocolate melted perfectly my white chocolate is also melted perfectly but I kind of wish it was a bit of writer so I melted some bright white compound chocolate and I'm just gonna stir my white chocolate into the compound chocolate till I get the perfect white chocolate color that I'm looking for and I'm ready to start making my chocolate bar I have a couple of mint Aero bars and the first thing I'm going to do is chop them to reveal the minty inside now I need to spread my dark chocolate onto a tray you'll want to use parchment paper or a nonstick nap then right on top I'm gonna spread my white chocolate I didn't want that okay so this one's marbled you gotta go with it once both chocolates are spread I'm gonna use the tip of a knife to swirl the chocolate and make interesting patterns and then I'm gonna throw on my chopped arrow and I also have some chocolate sprinkles and some green brushings see this is when I wish Josslyn was here cuz I would sing with her it's rainin chocolate suit I mean none of you even tried to sing me not one of you also earlier my mascara was have smudged no one told me no one told me now all I have to do is wait for this bark to set I'm just gonna set it aside at room temperature my cake is chilled this is my favorite part of cake decorating which is cake decorating and I have everything ready to go then I'm gonna top this cake with so my chocolate bark that I made is now set as well as some chocolate sprinkles green draw jays and my favorite chocolate of all time after eight the first thing I want to do is pipe a border of ganache around the top edge thinking part of me wants to measure the other part of me is like that's crazy oh maybe I know what I'm gonna do sorry I'm gonna get toothpicks and measure yeah I am using toothpicks to make all my spaces even this makes me very happy if Jocelyn saw me doing this you guys and then once that ganache is set in between the spaces I'm gonna lay a row of after eight it's kind of like an after eight fence it's cold enough to have a chocolate fence in Toronto right now it would not know perfectly fine yeah I think I need a little more support so as I put each after eat in the cake I'm gonna add another dot of dinesh to the first stop okay it's time to put my bark on the cake and I just want to try and have fun with this you can't really go wrong if you want to break it break it if you want to cut it cut it I'm picturing like a peppermint melt so I want to create like big shards like stick up at varying Heights and I want them to look kind of rough and rugged I feel inspired today surrounded by three guys I feel like I have to go rough in the rugged okay so I'm gonna keep having fun I think this cake is pretty dramatic as it is right guys guys whoa respond to me okay so I think it's pretty dramatic yeah yeah good so I just want to add some like spikes coming out the bottom with after eights I just really want to use up all the after it so that I don't eat them that's my plan I'm gonna get really wild now because it's a new year I'm gonna throw sprinkles and dragos at this cake I'm gonna try and keep it sort of in the bottom half of the sides anything can happen if your sprinkles and draw J's aren't sticking you just want to leave your cake alone for a bit and let the buttercream soften and come to the temperature every time I hear them bounce onto my floor it really it really does hey guys have you

welcome back to how to cake it I'm Yolanda and because Valentine's Day is coming up i caked a chocolate it's the perfect Valentine's Day gift and now you can have your dare and I'm going to make the head the body and the legs of my chocolate teddy bear cake out of a vanilla cake died a beautiful light pink then I'm gonna make his ears his arms and his nose out of sculpting Rice Krispies I baked my batter in ten different round cake pans and now that they are baked and cooled I'm removing them leveling them and removing the carmelization from the bottom for the cakes I'm gonna make up the body I am layering them into two layers each when making complicated novelty cakes I always bake more cake than I think I need so if you want to learn more about how I baked this cake you can click right here on the I which will lead you to my blog the i' is for information and once all of my cakes are prepared it's time for simple syrup this week was kind of an ordeal because it is sir squeeze and finesse first Valentine's Day together and so stir squeeze over here was flying Finnell around the world on his jet and we had to interrupt their vacay so that he could help me in the kitchen I'm going to begin by building the body of my chocolate teddy bear and the first thing I need to do is fill and stack my six seven inch round layers with chocolate ganache cuz this bear is not only child him on the outside he's chocolate on the inside Cody uh why am i filling this cake with ganache I would imagine you're probably using good - because you wanted a more sturdy well somebody has been reading the cake book I see Cody I'm impressed that's all these cakes are filled with ganache I place them in the fridge to chill before I start carving my body for the head of this teddy bear I am using two five inch round cake in two six inch round cakes and I begin by cutting a side off each one of the five inch cake so I have a straight edge and I'm going to but those two straight edges up against each other I spread a little bit of ganache on the side of one of my five inch rounds and butt them together this is just to glue them together and make sure they stay in place now I need to build up the head so I spread more chocolate ganache at a 6-inch round layer on top in the middle and then I spread another layer of ganache and add another six inch layer at this point I realized that the head is a little too short so remember how I said bake more cake than you need I grab an extra five inch cake layer that I have leveled it and removed the carmelization from the bottom and then again I spread more ganache and add that five inch layer on top now I can chill this cake so it's ready to be carved and I'm going to start carving the body of this teddy bear cake I find that having a circle cutter or even just a round template on top helps me to carve evenly because as you cut away and turn your lazy susan you might be making it uneven without even noticing you don't want a crooked bear especially for Valentine's Day a man I flipped my cake over and I carved the bottom so again I used a circle cutter just to help me carving in the same fashion but this time it's only 1/3 of the way down to meet the part I've already carved it's been three years since how to kick it launched our first video was a Valentine's Day video and we just want to say a huge thank you for your support thank you for watching and if you're laughing with us and he's for subscribing thank you for sharing our videos and telling your momma now I put my cake back right-side up and I decided it was a little bit short so here's another cake decorating tip whenever I level my cakes I always save the humps to this side because you never know when you need a cake hump so I took a couple of my cake humps leveled them and then used a circle cutter that's the same size as the top of my cake and cut out two rounds of cake then sir squeeze thank goodness he hung around simple syrup them for me and I added more ganache and added a cake craft I actually decided on only using one but I'm glad I saved all of my house now that I'm happy with the shape of the body I'm just gonna put it aside and carve the head it's a carve the head I want to create a fairly round head so again you just want to use your serrated knife from the top down and carve all the way around until you're happy with the teddy bear head shape the one thing to keep in mind is you want the bottom of the head to be the same size as the top of your body you don't want his head to look like too big okay guys I want to know have you subscribed to my new channel how to keep it step by step we have an amazing Valentine's Day compilation up there right now and in this Thursday's upcoming video we're gonna be announcing a new contest only available on that channel so go there and subscribe it's an awesome giveaway you won't believe what it is it's so much fun I want to win now it's time to crank up Joseph says she wants to sing it sing crunch OH I can't my neck hurts it's gonna be an awkward deaths guys it has like a pinched nerve I can only dance on this side okay Drago ng how ridiculous okay enough ridiculous now before I send it to chill I am keeping the body close by so that I can carve my tooth I'm cutting three straight sides out of each cake and leaving one part of it and round it the round side will be the front of the foot so like this Paul I guess now using a small serrated knife to round out the whole foot as well as remove all of the kernelization so I you can see right here I firstly carved round down like that yep exactly like that and then you want to carve the front to make it rounded for the pot exactly exactly like that exactly like that okay well done you done exactly what I wanted once I'm happy with the shape of both feet I have sir squeezed shower than let Synthesia and wants the syrup soaked in I crumb coat them and then I chill all the parts of my [Music] as I mentioned before I am making the arms the ears and the nose for this teddy bear out of rice krispies so I mixed together my sculpting rice krispies recipe and then I get sculpted I make my arms simply by taking two equal portions of the sculpting rice krispies and creating the shape that I want for the left and right mark once again just like when I carved the feet you want to do this simultaneous then I move on to sculpting his little ears just sculpt the ears no keep little round loose again carving them and sculpting them simultaneously it's time to make the nose for this bear I basically want to make a two dimensional own goal that will sit on his face so I just create this oval I actually used a really round Bowl that I have in the kitchen and pressed the rice krispies inside to achieve the shape I want once you're happy with all your rice krispies parts you can go and chill oh I know it hurts it really hurts now that my crumb coat is chilled it's time to ice these body parts with more Italian meringue butter knife now speaking of buttercream maybe you've noticed this T was a part of the knopf competition that we did it was actually an impromptu competition that we had during our last Camp cake because we asked people to just write down our puns and everybody was just brainstorming puns live all the new baking and Sarah green congratulations you won this was warm kind and we will contact you about your gift very soon once I've iced all the parts as smoothly as I can I place them back in the fridge to chill okay it's time for fondant I am covering this teddy bear in chocolate fondant because it's Valentine's Day I roll my chocolate crumb in a little larger than the size of my cake and then I pick it up on a French rolling pin drape it over and quickly smooth it on to anyone who's shooting I always give them warning like this is the one thing I can't slow down for you it's just like drop and smooth it's very serious it's almost as serious as a slip next I cover the head of my body in the very same way of course measure the head roll out your fondant a little bit bigger drape it over and see it's the old drape and smooth to cover the feet I do this a little bit different yeah so I'm just covering around and down the back down that skateboard way and then I flip the foot over onto a sponge I don't want to put it on a flat surface because this will flatten the fondant and I don't want to hold it because then you'll have a handprint levator is flipped which is weird right it's rigged so at the front of the foot just smooth a little bit of fondant over and you're still going to have a round opening which would dress I selected an oval cutter I tried a circle cutter first but it ended up being oval that's the same size as the opening cut out two ovals and then place them into the opening at the front of the feet and smooth and in place don't worry about that seam because I'm I love this thing hi door opening or huh thank you so much I covered the arms of the bear in the same fashion that I covered his legs for the ears I also wrapped my chocolate fondant around them first covering the front flipping it over onto a sponge and then draping it around the back and trimming as needed I decided to cover his nose in a tan colored fondant so I rolled it out draped it over and negative I want to leave extra fondant around the nose it will help me to secure it to the cake later let's start putting this teddy bear together I measure my dowels cut them all the same size and insert them in a circular formation into the body then I need one dowel that will go through the center of the body and also be through the head holding it in place I spread a little royal icing on top of the body as glue and then I lower the teddy bears head down to the dowels in the center pressing it gently in place let's add the feet to this bear I'm just going to hold them up against the front of the bear figure out the position I want them in and I actually use a sharp paring knife to trim away some of the fondant on the skateboard ramp part of the foot so then it fits right up close to the back now at this moment I am NOT going to glue the feet to the bear because I might want to readjust them with some of the decorations later how DK kid is turning 3 this year on February 10th so in honor of that we're having a huge sale at had a cake accom everything is on sale until February 11th so head-to-head a cake it calm and check it out we're getting to my favorite part it's time to start creating the details to decorate this bit I roll out some light pink fondant and a sheet of red fondant I created a template for myself just from a piece of paper to make the oval belly on my teddy bear now lay your oval piece of paper onto your light pink fondant and use the tip of a sharp paring knife to cut around it I'm using some piping gel to glue the belly to the cake you see this is why I didn't want to do the feet to the cake right away because now I can just move the feet out of my way and glue the belly makes life so easy removable feet you know how how easy would life be if your people who ever maybe not not easy cuz you'd fall over yeah but in this case it was a good idea remember how I told you that we would address the seams on the ends of our arms well we're going to use the same oval and circle cutters that we used when covering the arms empty and cut out circles and ovals of pink fondant then with some piping gel we can glue it directly over that area smoothing it down with our fingertip and by seams so in order to make these new pink parts look like they are patches sewn on they need some stitching I fold these pieces of paper into eight equal parts kind of like a pie and then I make a mark on each line now I can hold the template up against the cake and I use a pin to puncture through the marks the actual stitches I'm using my plants shooter to create some red cords but I'm going to cut into equal lengths I'm going to use a little bit of piping gel to glue these short pieces of cord right onto the marks I made on the pink parts and connecting them to the ground part of the dog so it's like a stitch that connected the patch I use a sculpting tool to press the stitches into the cake on either end making them look like they've actually been sewn to add the arms I'm using some eighth inch thick wooden dowels and some real icing I cut my wooden dowels to the right length and then I inserted them into the cake you want to leave about a half inch of Dell exposed outside of your cake and that's what your arms will stick to like any good Valentine's Day teddy bear should have I want to create a red ribbon around his neck so from the red fondant that I rolled out I use a ruler and a sharp knife to cut even strips of fondant then I used my over stitch tool to embellish the strips and make it look like a nice ribbon I then used a bit of piping gel place around the neck picked up one of the ribbons and wrapped it around the neck of the bear I needed to fold the fondant where the arms were to make it fit and make it look more natural than we met a ribbon would I cut the excess away at the front of the bear so there is a seam but it will be hidden by a bow later on tail well bears yeah teddy bears have like a have a tail but it's a very little tail so I take a little bit of chocolate fondant roll a ball fit it up against the back of the cake and then once I'm happy with its shape I use a little bit of piping gel on the back and glue it in place they have like little I don't want to say cotton tails because they're not bunnies but they have little stubby little tails I need to add my nose to the front of this teddy bear and I pick it up and hold it up against the front of my cake and then I trim the fondant around it leaving about a quarter-inch excess because if you remember I didn't trim it before I flipped the oval dome over onto a sponge then I sharpened one of my dowels and pressed it into the middle you don't want the devil to come all the way through I cut my dowel to the appropriate size and insert it into the face I pressed my dome up against the teddy bears face and once it's in place I use my fingertips to smooth that excess fondant around and meet the teddy bear's face to finish the nose I'm using some more on my tan fondant softened with shortening and creating a cord with my planks treated then was a little piping gel i glue the cord around the mouth nose snow thing this way I'm covering the seam and everything and I move on to adding the bowl I cut to even lengths from my prepared red bands of fondant and then I loop them over and glue them together to create the bow loops you need to cut another little piece for the middle of your bowl i glue piping gel to the back of each bow loop and insert them inside I wanted to create a heart-shaped notes because this is a Valentine bitter so I take a little bit of red fondant and just mold a little 3-dimensional heart using my fingers then I glue the heart shaped nose on to the bear and for his mouth I again extrude some red fondant creating that like that teddy bear mouth you what I'm talking about it's like the line down [Music] for his eyes I'm using black fondant pressed into these scoop shaped spoons that I have I just want to make little dome eyes chill it for a bit I'm gonna whack it out of the spoon and then I make another eye in the same fashion then I added the eyes just above the smell on either side of the nose with a little bit of paper now I add the ears to my cake using the toothpicks as support as well as a little bit of royal icing spread on the bottom once I added my ears I decided I didn't like his eyes why not I don't know I think is the the teddy bears like chocolate dark chocolate brown and then his eyes were black he seemed little sad to me hates to be more bright-eyed so I wanted to add a base of 10 fondant behind his eyes I used a heart-shaped cutter and a circle cutter to beat the perfect shape I wanted and then I glued it over the snout and place the eyes back in place because I wanted this to look like a beloved old bear I decided to add some more patches not just any patches heart-shaped patches and then once again made templates of the heart cutters that I used so I can mark holes for the stitching the only thing different this time is I'm going to create the cords for my red stitches cut the links and I'm going to add it to the patches while they're not on the cake then I carefully pick up each patch brush on some piping gel and place them on the cake wherever I wanted to I added one on his butt one on the back of his neck I actually need a patch on the back of my neck and I added one on his arm because he's the kind of bear that wears his heart on did you like that but it's Valentine's Day we're supposed to get cheesy once the patches are in place I again use my sculpting tool at the end of each stitch to make it look like it was sewn on this bear is so loving he's not just wearing his heart on his sleeve he's also holding a heart that you can eat he brought you a chocolate heart filled with cinnamon hearts that's how much he loves to create my chocolate heart I'm using a heart-shaped mold that has a top and bottom and I melted some pink compound chocolate and then filled the mold once your chocolate has set you can carefully turn your mold over and pop both pieces now we're gonna fill one half of the heart with cinnamon harvey's and then we're going to pipe some more of our melted pink chocolate around the border of the heart and carefully place our top heart on top [Music] I mean this is a Valentine there so I decided to add a fondant ribbon around the heart so I had an extra band from the bands I made around his neck and then wrapped it around the heart because the hardest chocolate you have to glue your vomit in place with some melted chocolate it's time to put this chocolate heart in our Bears head so carefully pick it up and hold it against your cake and in order to secure your chocolate heart to the cake you will need to use melted chocolate chocolate is the glue for chocolate oh my gosh and look at that pink chocolate hearts open cinnamon heart so cute now let's smash it you know what Valentine's Day is a sad time for some people we got to give them

welcome back to how to take it I'm Yolanda and today I am making something that I've only heard about in folklore and fairy tales breakfast in bed to the drift is somebody else put the magazine thanks to Google for supporting and collaborating with me on this video I have my very own Google assistant to help me with distance episodes or should I say tape assistant okay Google what's my name your name is the queen of cakes thank you you can call me know before we get started I have to say a big thank you to all of you I asked for something on subscribers and we got it thanks to you thank you so much of support in the world to us please keep watching tell all your friends have them subscribe and don't forget to hit the notifications l so you will know when I do a video just to make this breakfast tray I have baked for cake I've remove them all of their pans and now I'm going to level the three smallest cakes by cutting them in half horizontally to create two layers Perkins the larger cake is going to be turned into to put on so I'm going to cut it in half down the middle and begin to shape them okay Google can you please show me the picture of a perfect passant here are some matching pictures how do you mom well you look at a lot of pictures of suits on which makes you really hungry and then use a small serrated knife I'm actually making one chocolate in front and one traditional so the traditional passant is shaped kind of like a crescent and the Java croissant is more like well a rectangle for now with a soft rounded rectangle [Music] my next case is going to be transformed into you fruitful so that's why I chose to leave the hump on this cake and I'm just going to trip away and even out the hump so it has a bowl that's upside down [Music] the two solid cakes are becoming a mug so I have stacked all four layers on top of each other and now I'm also rounding out the top so it looks like an upside-down love as does another hamburger before filling all of these cakes of course I need to enlist the help of their sweet side the simple syrup will keep them nice and moist while I decorate and transform them into my favorite breakfast food I've chosen to fill my mug cake with coffee buttercream because it's actually in mugs section it's in coffee ception coffee buttercream inside a cake that will look like a coffee mug coffee better change my favorite I feel the layers it was coffee buttercream and I also crumb coated it in coffee buttercream [Music] so the proof ole cake I'm filling this cake was playing a town during buttercream and crumb coating it in the same for my tutu sock cake I'm crumb coating them with shop personal responsibly what do we do after crumb coating we chill written right there crumb coat my cakes are crumb coated and they're chilling can you please set a timer for me for 16 minutes all right 15 minutes started and now we're going to ice them all one more time using the same thing that I composition with all of the recipes I've used to make these cakes I have made in videos before so we'll put a playlist right here you can check them if all my cakes are ready to be decorated I'm going to start by making microsoft cakes first I'm going to cover my traditional croissant I have colored some fondant a sort of 10 pastry color and I'm going to roll it out as thin as possible then I founded strict fair I'm sorry it's just breakfast first thing I'm going to do is cover the entire crescent shaped cake and I just want to make sure that the theme of the bonnet is underneath the croissant so the thin layer of fondant is draped over the cake and then I cut away any excess underneath okay Google what is fondant fondant a thick paste made of sugar and water and often flavored or colored used in the making of candy and the icing and decoration of cakes I need this cake to appear like it is layers and layers of rolled up pastry just like the sauce so I continue rolling out my tan fondant as soon as I can and covering the cake each time making the piece a little bit shorter the other way I'd respond to this kind of comes into that nice little triangle in the middle I like to rip that off [Music] I'm going to set this one aside and move on to my chocolate croissants transform this cake I begin by covering the two sides with a thin small piece of Teflon now I need to roll out some more of that fence on it into a nice thin long bit I place my cake on the band and begin to roll the fondant over and as I turn the cake and roll it up with each turn I trim the sides of the band of fondant to make it just a little bit thick because at the end of the day I want to look like once again pastry layers that is included up inside to help both of these croissants was more like pastry I'm going to use the sharp tip of my paring knife to pour the fondant I want to create the look of more layers of pastry in the way that it crackles in the oven and I want to square the fondant in one direction I felt right besides looked a little bit flat on the chapel croissant so what I did is rolled out my remaining tan fondant and cut strips and then I folded those strips up on one another the same length as the side of Microsoft I just want to again create those layers of sort of spiraling layers and before adding it I used a knife and cut a very thin slice of a spiral I just want to end leather sticking out and then I glued it to either side of my case using a bit of water [Music] time to add a little more color to these Kisan they look like they need baking so I've mixed a little bit of ivory food coloring with some clear food grade alcohol and now I'm going to paint both of these croissants to get them a darker golden color [Music] once I've allowed the paint to dry I fear that they might be a little dark before my next step so I'm going to use a bit of water and a bigger paintbrush to actually brush away some of the painting I have done and I really just want the paint to remain in the sport I want to create a minimal scoring and I want the overall service to be enlightened I actually have another assistant in the kitchen I have three suggests to just need Google tip and burning you might have noticed we've got a greater than others this is Bernie 2.0 I've placed my croissant cake onto metal tape and I'm no expert but I don't think you should hold fire next to cardboard cake board Bernie is going to help me lay these clocks which is going to give me such a nice golden texture it's going to make the font a little bit crunchy too which is really cool when you do it later on these croissants look perfectly baked I can't wait to begin but for now I'm going to put them aside let them cool off and drive some pretty and I'm going to move on to new people let me introduce you to the fruit bowl it is the balance on this breakfast ring because after to put on maybe you chefs and food I start by placing my cake which now looks like an upside-down Bowl on to the very same cake pan that I've baked in it I'm doing this because I need to create a lip on this bowl once it's covered to hold the fruit I'm covering this ripple in a beautiful lavender fondant I roll out my lavender fun and drape it over the bowl and then I smooth it around the bowl using the palms of my hands and the fondant smoother you want to turn this on in about a quarter of an inch away from the bottom of the cake so calculate where that is for you and then of course I used 8 a self-made ruler I cut a piece of cardboard mat the height that I needed it held it up against the cake and first I scored all the way around with my paring knife and then I cut into that score right down to the cake then I'm going to take the opportunity to score a second line in the fondant this time I'm not cutting right through I'm just using the tip of my paring knife to make a little score because I'm going to add a paintable detail at the top of my bowl I have mixed a little bit of gold luster with clear food grade alcohol and I'm just going to paint the top of the bowl above where I scored and the very top rim it lets us paint dry and while it does you can prepare some fruit to add to the top of the fruit bowl cake try to use your favorite fruits I used raspberries blueberries golden berries blackberries and then a few green grapes for just a different color if you do plan on making this breakfast in bed cake why not take part in our replicate contest I am looking for amazing bakers because I want to feature your work in it here's how to get involved take a look at our replicate playlist choose a cake you love replicate it and then post it to facebook or instagram using the hashtag replicate that we can find you and remember you can enter as many times as you like try as many takes as you would like and give them your own tool it's moving on to my favorite part is breakfast a frosty cup of cappuccino I'm going to apply finance this month cake exactly the same way I did to my fruit bowl cake once again I score it so that I can make a quarter inch slip one type the mug back right side up time to add a handle to this mug of course I made my handle in advance so that it could dry and I did it simply by rolling a tube of white gum paste out and inserting a floral wire down the middle then I bent the wire with the gum paste keep on it and then I set that handle aside to dry it's time to insert my now dried mug handles so remember we have the excess wire hanging up from the handle and I also added just half of toothpick to the ends of the handle as well to really help support it and before adding it to the cake I typed a little bit of royal icing onto the ends of the handle and then I included a mystery do you need to sort of hold it there for a bit and you can brush away the excess royal icing from the scheme's with a damp brush I have to personalize this mother for Mother's Day so I rolled up some black fondant really really thin and a little bit of pink fondant really really thin and then I used some tappets to cut out I heart mom I brush a little bit of water on the back of my letters and my heart and place them centered on the front of the month what mom wouldn't want that love tell me this can you show me the picture of a perfect cappuccino to recreate these troughs for my cappuccino I made a small best of my seven-minute frosting that recipe is also in the playlist that we mentioned earlier with all the other recipes I used to click [Music] I reserved just a little bit of my seven-minute frosting and I added my coffee concentrate which is what I use paste the content expired this must just to turn it a little bit Brown or first coffee colored and then I use the tip of a spatula to swirl that into this Devvarman I know barista our teeth it wasn't one of those ones that I made it look like jaws face or anything like that I just wanted you know like when you scare your cappuccino and the coffee comes up and it was at home and you're like I cannot wait to take a sip that that kind of a look before I put everything together on this breakfast tray I need to top my croissants so the chocolate croissant I have melted a few dark candy melts put them in a parchment piping bag and then created a chocolate drizzle diagonally across the croissants it was so satisfying I also piped a little bit of chocolate at either end of the facade to look like where the chocolate sort of fakes out of the chocolate sauce there was a lot of work chocolate I feel like you can't do the word chocolate too much so just leave that in the side so for the crescent-shaped facade I brushed on a thin thin layer of piping gel on the surface and added some sliced almonds I didn't want just a plain traditional clothes on I want and all this because that's my favorite I need to just tap a light sprinkling of icing sugar on top of the cloth now I know some of you are going to be upset that I'm endorsing cake for breakfast but I really just

welcome back to how to kick it I'm Yolanda and this week I'm wishing my American neighbors a Happy Thanksgiving by giving roasted ham a cake over that's right I said cake over not cake with ham in it don't worry I'm not gonna go there to make this roast ham cake I am dying nine pounds of my ultimate vanilla batter well a hammy kind of pink once my pink cakes were baked I removed them from their pans leveled them and cut the carmelization away from the bottom so yeah I was really I could have used a model but I didn't have the time to bake a whole ham just to look at it now it's time to simple syrup these cakes with the help of sir squeeze he too was confused by the color of these games he did like a double tape he was like oh wow while the simple syrup is soaking into my cakes I am going to die some Italian meringue buttercream ham color so I use the same colors that I used in my cake batter which were a soft pink and a dusty pink and just mixed those into my buttercream until I felt it matched the cakes as best as possible next it's time to fill on my cakes my ham colored case with my ham colored buttercream and I'm going to begin by stacking them up right don't worry it will turn into a hem eventually for now I want to fill them and chill them to get ready for carving please share this video because who makes a cake that looks like a roast hand up next I need to carve this into a ham now the good thing about this is you don't really have to stress about carving because well hems come in different shapes I carve for a bit while it's upright and when I'm ready I flip it onto that flat side and I continue to carve you want all the criminalisation gone and you're kind of looking for just like a rounded hem it's Oregon pictures of roast ham just fan them around I'm surprised I didn't I didn't I couldn't find one online believe it or not it's probably a good kick to start with because the carving isn't that hard it's very free shipping once I'm happy with the shape of my roast ham I just need to carve the face of the hem a little bit so what I want to do is on the flat sort of front I'm gonna use a small serrated knife to cut in some lines into the hand cuz a ham wouldn't just be like flesh you know what I mean the front of the house like the cross I'm sorry Jocelyn for the cross-section of the inner hem now it is time to crumb coat and chill this ham still using my hand coloured Italian meringue buttercream my ultimate vanilla cake Italian meringue buttercream and simple syrup recipes are all in my cake book which is available at had a cake accom we also have crumb coat and chill bundles and pretty much everything you need for holiday baking Black Friday through to Cyber Monday is the best time to do holiday shopping at had a cake accom because prices will be the lowest ever and you'll get everything in time for the holidays now that my crumb coat is chilled I'm going to ice this cake one more time in ham colored buttercream and chill it again it's just getting hamaare and heavier we've been getting a bit of flack because we forgot to wish her fellow Canadians Happy Thanksgiving like a month ago so Canadians I'm really sorry it was my turkey brain I apologize we didn't even make a Canadian Thanksgiving cake Jocelyn we made a pencil it's time to move on to fondant and the first thing I'm going to do is cover the cross-section of the hem with some pink fondant I roll out my hand colored fondant apply it to the cross section of the hem and then trim away the excess all the way around the hip yep hem pink fondant a hot pink not soft pink not baby pink hand paint now I need to use a veining tool to create texture in this cross-section of a ham and make it look like well the face of a roasted hem there will be a bone sort of in the center of this head so I make some impressions of lines that run from where that bone will be to the outside of the hem and then after that I used a thinner smaller veining tool to create texture all over the hem because it's meat I needed it to look media yeah is this the solution vegetarian hands ok just bake a hand it looks like a cake oh yeah you're right the other the other way around would be really difficult I just try that on the channel I covered the rest of the ham in my roasted ham skin colored fondant rolling it out draping it over the ham and then trimming the excess where it meets the cross section or the front of the ham as well as the excess away from the bottom of the whole roast mmm roasted ham skin color yeah you can't or hunt a girl he took the whole thing he even took the accompaniments well I don't want to ruin it yes there's gonna be a side dish he took it too he took the whole thing it's time to create a crisscross pattern on the ham skin you're not gonna believe what I did Johnson actually you are so the first thing I did was I used a fabric measuring tapes you score the hem in one direction right will that be straight so then I had to turn the fabric measuring tape the other way that I could get like a crisscross and you know what I did I made it too straight so I literally lined it up perpendicular to the first set of lines and then I scored two lines in the opposite direction and realized it looked more like a grid like a graph than a crisscross so at this point I talked it over with Jeremy and I was like I can't do this I I started to make the lines again because what you want is more of like a triangular shape rather than squares and don't worry about the two mistake lines they will be covered up later that's what you get for always trying to be straight I would like to make the bone for my hem at this point and I'm going to make it out of modeling chocolate I cut in a slice of really cold modeling chocolate and then I used some circle cutters to cut out two circles one within the other so that I could have a round bone to place in my hat then I want to take just a little bit of my leftover pink ham fondant and soften it and place it inside the bone now I'm going to peel off my modeling chocolate bones so that I can add texture to this pink fondant for this I'm using a small grass piping tip in order to make the face of the hand look more realistic I'm going to paint it with some it looks a little flat right now I want it to look juicy I had to experiment a little with this I've never painted a rooster and cake before so I used the same two colors that I used in my batter and my buttercream and then I tried to mix in a little bit of white a little bit of ivory and I just played with it a few times I painted it about two or three times letting it dry in between until I was happy I need to move on to painting the roasted ham skin I have a really quick announcement that I'm very excited about I'm going back out on the road we're going back out of the road I'm going to be signing books in LA on November 20 I will be at the Barnes &amp; Noble in Huntington Beach at 7 p.m. I've never been to Huntington Beach heaven if you're a headache a cake VIP you saw some awesome footage from our Toronto book signing in your VIP video last night it's gonna be even more fun are we gonna be is the bookstore like right on the beach I doubt it right I feel like wet books aren't good you know what I mean it's time to add the bone to the face of this hand that's the same way I made the bone in my turkey cake that's what my roast cakes have in common remember the turkey was like the ham is more like yeah it's probably gone I also want to add some fat onto the surface of it because I want it to look a juicy so for this I'm using just a pinch of my modeling chocolate and I have worked in some vegetable shortening this is actually gonna make the Molly chocolate kind of fall apart but this is a good thing in this case now I'm going to work it into some of those larger veins on the front of the ham using a paintbrush to just brush it into the grooves and make it look natural I want this ham to look like it's hot out of the oven so I'm going to brush some clear piping gel over the whole surface of the front of the head not the bone just the meat now that the paint on the surface of the skin of our ham is dry I'm going to brush the entire surface with maple syrup see Canadians I still love you I brought a Canadian element to this American Thanksgiving once I've done brushing the maple goodness all over I'm going to take some dried cloves and press them into the center of every triangle on the ham skin just like a real roasted ham remember the perfect squares I'm gonna cover them with pineapple I chose to use dehydrated pineapple rings they also have candied pineapple rings boy did we research this but they're thicker and they look more yellow so they don't look like they've been baked so I chose dehydrated pineapple rings which Jeremy drove to the other end of the city for Thank You Jeremy yes he really did please subscribe to this channel and hit the application bill because I just covered my mistake with dehydrated pineapple that was driven to me by Jeremy couldn't cover your why do you keep bringing that up I feel like you get a lot of enjoyment from that Jocelyn I'm going to brush a little bit of plain apricot jam onto the pineapple because I want it to look like the whole roast was believed at once you're now inside of the pineapple I'm going to add a maraschino cherry yeah Jeremy and I went there again well that's how these hams are made so the cherry goes in the middle of the pineapple rings and a toothpick holds them in place and as I said in a past episode whatever you do do not Google how to make maraschino cherries I told Jeremy I wanted to do something to this roasted ham then I completely forgot and did all the other steps he was like so yeah when are you gonna and I was like oh so I pulled out some clothes in some areas and used Bernie to just brulee some parts of the skin of the hand because I wanted it to look like a real Russ don't forget there's only a few days left to register for Camp cake at its sale price of $19.99 we will not be making the roasted hen but we will be spending the whole day baking together and giving Santa's milk and cookies a total cake over can we have like bursting milk and cookies like forget that the whole how to cake your team will be there so please come and join the family register at how to cake it calm I'm about to give mashed sweet potatoes a total cake over it's just to make the turn more like abrupt for my mashed sweet potatoes I'm simply taking some Italian meringue buttercream and dyeing it sweet potato color and then what I'm going to do is use some cake scraps some vanilla cake scraps not die pink just vanilla into the buttercream and you just want to keep stirring them in until it becomes like a mashed potato consistency I actually used a hand mixer at one point is the bowl got so full and some of its splattered [Music] I'm hoping you're not gonna leave that footage eh I just picture you in orhan like yes leave that ahead yes I carved this cake just like you would carve ahem so first i used the like that pitchfork Ethan and then I served myself a slice with a scoop of mashed potato happy Thanksgiving happy Thanksgiving to everyone in the US and happy believe it Thanksgiving Canada quick here to watch my Thanksgiving food cakes compilation over on my new channel how to cake it step by step well that was sad leave that out celebratory 
this is how to cake it I'm Yolanda and this week I am taking a giant candy cane and using amazing flavors inspired by Dunkin Donuts peppermint mocha hot locked theory mmm because you know these cakes take me a long time big thanks to Dunkin Donuts for supporting and collaborating with me on this video leave the hashtag Duncan holiday below if you have tried their amazing holiday coffee flavors there's even brown sugar cinnamon I feel like they mean that after me did that they totally dead Thank You Duncan thank you I baked 24 4-inch round peppermint chocolate cakes to be clear that's 12 pounds of my ultimate chocolate cake batter with crushed candy cane inside yeah this is the crushed candy cane shimmy I leveled all 24 of my chocolate peppermint cakes now because the candy cane basically dissolves in the batter as it bakes these cakes are bit stickier it was messy I have an issue with this now I need sirs please to help me shower all 24 cakes with simple syrup don't forget sir squeeze is available at had a cake it calm for the Baker or cake lover in your life [Music] you know what it is I'm I'm very alert I'm sultry and I'm very alert could you show us what it looks like this ready you're not ready but I'll show you who's the opposite of sultry you know what it's time for now it's time to cut secret chambers into half of these things for this I use a circle cutter I don't want the chamber to be too big because I don't need this cake to collapse candy canes on collapsible funell who comes with sir squeeze on our website she is collapsible candy canes not so much I'm about to make one of my favorite things on earth which is coffee buttercream to turn my Italian meringue buttercream into coffee buttercream I simply make some concentrated coffee and then I pour that mixture into my buttercream until I'm satisfied with the flavor now when we pair this coffee buttercream with my chocolate peppermint cake BAM peppermint mocha another reason I needed to you know have this hot latte while working is it's really hard work to have to taste coffee buttercream with chocolate peppermint cake over and over until you get it right it's very hard work if you love this flavor combo as much as I do please share this video even if you don't have 12 hours to make a giant candy cane cake you can just bake chocolate peppermint cakes and make the coffee buttercream and BAM peppermint mocha what why oh I'm going to begin making my candy cane cake by making several stacks of cake every stack feeds a solid layer of chocolate peppermint cake on the bottom and then secret chamber layers on top and they're all gonna be sandwiched together with coffee butter peppermint mocha genjou the right way yeah my ultimate chocolate cake recipe which you can put crush candy cane in or chopped candied ginger which is perfect for this time of year and my Italian buttercream as well as my chocolate Swiss meringue buttercream are all in my cake book you can grab a copy of the how to cake a cake book I've had a cake it calm and make sure to check the description below for an insider's tip on where you can get a signed copy of blankie oh I sign something now that my stacks are ready I need to crumb coat them so I can get them in the fridge to chill they're a bit wobbly right now I mean they're tall there's a secret chamber inside so just from coat as carefully as you can and get those cakes in the fridge to chill it's now time to fill these secret chambers with colorful candy I love the classic Dunkin Donuts hot pink and orange I feel that it's very hot I can't get its punchy but I'm also gonna mix in some peppermint candies because this cake is peppermint mocha sure and then I scoop them down into the chambers where no one will see them again until they cut open a cake before I ice these cakes again I need to close off the secret universe so what I'm going to do is remember the little rounds I cut out when creating the secret chamber I'm gonna cut a little slice of those rounds place it on the top to seal it's like sealing a crypt secrets of the can decrypt so except everybody knows there's candy in the secret chamber so it's not really a secret and then what I'm gonna do is just ice the tops with ganache I like using an hour sometimes because it sets up really quickly and my ganache recipe is also in my cake book the next thing I need to do is ice these cakes one more time with my coffee butter I'm using a larger spatula as well as a bench scraper because I really want to keep these like cylinders going to start to form my giant candy cane cake by laying the cakes down on their side and glue them together in between with chocolate ganache my chocolate gotta go I said it's in my book already guess what I've never told you in the past five minutes it's not a cane without a curve it's a candy stick they should make canes that look like candy canes they told me should like if I ever broke my foot I would want a candy cane cane and so what i'm doing here is i'm using the rest of my unsecret chambered chocolate peppermint cake layers I take these layers I cut them in half on the diagonal and then I sandwich them together so that both of the high sides are together does that make sense and as I did that because one side is higher and the other side is lower they formed up what it was like a cake rainbow without any color a brown rainbow mmm you know what's that so the brown I'm going to use my small palette knives with some more coffee buttercream so I can get this curve all together and put it in the fridge to chill once my ground goat is chilled I take the curved cake out again and ice it another time guess what I used Chaplin as well as my small spatulas my invention that I didn't invent but it's amazing for those of you who haven't seen my invention it is just a clear piece of acetate and why it's amazing is because I can curve it in my hand and smooth the buttercream once my ground coat is firm I take the cake back out and ice it again with my small spatulas both my small offset and straight spatulas come in some of my camp cake bundles and you guys have a chance to win it if you sign up for Camp cake between November 28th and December 3rd you will automatically be entered into a draw where you can win a free camp cake bundle the rest of the details are listed in the description below I can't wait to see you guys at Camp cake on December 9th now that my curved cake is smoothly iced with the help of my invention I can finally add it to the rest of the cake towers and complete the giant candy cake [Music] I need to cover this giant candy cane with white fondant I'm not even gonna attempt to roll out one China because I know better don't roll fondant bigger than your body you will not be able to pick it up I've decided to attempt to cover it in four parts as well as covering the two ends of the candy cane so I start there I use a circle cutter that is the same size as my cake to cut out two white fondant circles and I add those circles to the two ends of the candy cane and use my fondant smoother to just smooth them out and make sure they fully cover those two flat surfaces now I'm going to start to roll out some more white fondant and begin to cover the body of the candy cane the tricky thing here is I'll have to roll out all four pieces to the same thickness so that the candy cane looks hmm the other tricky thing is I need to keep in mind that the stripes on this candy cane will run diagonally so I want to cut each piece upon it once it's on the candy cane with a diagonal line so that I'll have diagonal seams I don't know if you know this but I'm going to have a television show called this seam hider it's a very serious show we have plenty of footage we can make it right now or on [Applause] now I need to repeat this process with three more portions of white fondant to completely cover my candy cane if you were into this okay but first cake hoodie click the eye right here to get your own to make my all-white candy cane look nice and smooth you know who we need what did I just call myself to myself the seam hider what's that just their seams and your white fondant good thing I brought royal icing I'll make that the seam hider does it all when it's fine that's one of these tag lines now I have a giant plain white candy cane we're done we need to get some stripes on this cake cane and turn it into a giant candy cane from my hot pink fondant I'm cutting some thick stripes which will be like the main stripes on the candy cane and from my orange fondant I'm gonna cut two different sized thinner stripes I love the combo of this white orange and pink like the classic Dunkin Donuts coffee it is time to apply these stripes to my candy cane and keep in mind I really want to attempt to cover the seams even though the same height or did an excellent job so I started by laying a thick pink stripe over one of the scenes that was my starting so then I laid on to other thick stripes I left the curve alone cause I'm scared and then I laid a fixed strike between the thick stripes so there wasn't like too much [Music] because candy canes are twisted I had to keep in mind how that fix track would go around the curve that was the hardest part because every time I attempted to wrap it around the curve it's diagonal would become like warpage in comparison to the other diagonal stripes that I had laid so I decided to sort of leave a lot of the curve untouched and go for the straighter end and continue with my thick pink stripes once my pink stripes were down it was easy because then I used a fabric measuring tape as a spacer and laid my orange stripe on top of each pink stripe before you head into Dunkin Donuts for some extra joy this holiday make sure to download the DD pack there's a link in the description below it allows you to order ahead pay with your phone and speed past the line I feel like the seam hider would do that plus with just a click you can send somebody a virtual Dunkin Donuts with gift card to text or any man anyone you want to send to Dunkin Donuts gift card to Jocelyn and then I used a piece of ribbon as a spacer to lay a thinner orange stripe below each pink string so now the candy cane is very straight and I found that at both ends it was still a lot of white space so I simply repeated the pattern I've decided to brush this entire candy cane cake with piping gel cos panda cancer shiny I need to address the sort of weird space on the curve of attention so what I'm going to do is put a bow on let me nip that in the bud please subscribe to this channel and hit that notification girl just nip that in the bud you'll know when I've made a new cake thank you

welcome to Gigot I'm Yolanda now as most of you know I'm not exactly a nature buff but I do know that the Easter Bunny leaves Cadbury cream eggs thanks to Cadbury for supporting and collaborating with me on this video this is a Maitre seen on insert like tweeting birds Teresa's Easter Bunny cake I have baked six a vanilla cake that I dyed pink I'm pretty sure the Easter Bunny is pink on the inside I've removed them from their parents levels them and cut the carmelization at the bottom of all of the cakes now third squeeze a lot is here while he was here so I pulled him I will come up I was a drawer and asked him to simple clear up all the cakes with me here is a fun nature fact the Easter Bunny now lays four flavors of crematoria Chips Ahoy caramel and of course the original cream eight I'm going to chop up all four flavors of cream egg to take this cake to melt-in-your-mouth status [Music] I'm staffing this cake by layering it with Italian meringue buttercream and my chopped cream eggs if you are in the mood to bake this spring like I am Who am I kidding i'ma make every season I have more Easter videos and more spring themed videos in this playlist right here orhan maybe like the addition of a light rain fall once I'm done layering and filling my cake I place it in the fridge to chill until the buttercream is nice and firm I've got to get this cake looking like the Easter Bunny so I use a sharp serrated knife to start to form the body of Easter Bunny nature fact the Easter Bunny's body actually has the shape of an egg are you taking notes jocelyn use your laptop there will be a quiz I'm actually adding all this Wikipedia Oh perfect once I'm happy with the shape of the Easter Bunny's body I take my reserved cake layer cut it in half and carve two [Music] it's time to crumb coat and chill Krakow and you know you know what I feel like at the end of 2016 I made a promise to not sing 2017 and I just broke my promise I'm going to stop now I love using my smaller spatulas both straight and offset when icing or crumb coating novelty cakes these spatulas feature wooden handles and would come from nature Wow another fascinating fastest now that the crumb coat has chilled I'm going to ice my cakes one more time keeping the body and the feet separate at this point now for all the recipes you need to make this cake there's a playlist with some great videos right here this Easter Bunny is missing some vital parts so I make two recipes of my sculpting rice cereal mixture to create his head his two arms his tail and his two sides when I make my rice cereal mixture for sculpting I choose to leave out the butter completely I really just want the cereal and the marshmallow and be able to sculpt it and condense it into any shape that I like i sculpt the rest of the Easter Bunny's features by hand making sure that his two arms and two thighs yes I've hurt an equal size no and I don't mean that his farm the simple life I mean he's two arms with big sized you guys are the same son here's a nature fast arms and thighs don't look alike make sure when sculpting with rice cereal mixture you want to put some shortening on your hands a so that it doesn't stick and it makes it easier to handle and you really want to compress the mixture as you so nature fact number I'm going to say eight the Easter Bunny has some very fit size topping is the new squatting you should see his leg I'm jealous I'm going to start hopping once all of the Easter Bunny parts that you've sculpted have firmed up you need to ice them to get the buttercream in all the nooks and crannies and give them a smoother surface it's time to cover everything in white fondant before I assemble all these parts to make an Easter lemon I start by covering the body and the seat I roll out my fondant to about a quarter of an inch thick drape it over the body and then smooth it all around it can be kind of tricky because about is quite tall you want to make sure to smooth all the way down pushing out any air I truly the excess fondant from the base of the body wrapping it underneath when covering the arms size and tail I need to get the fondants all the way around each part so I roll my fondant and drape it over as I usually do but then I pick up each part I hold a soft sponge in my hand so that I won't dent them and then I just gather my excess fondant on the top pinching it together and then cutting away the excess with a sharp knife before covering the head I need to place it on a small round board this will help when assembling the Easter Bunny now I roll out more white fondant drape it over smooth it all around and then yeah I flip these two bunnies head gather this on it towards the board and cut off the excess around the board I'm going to turn all these parts into an Easter Bunny it's like your mother nature yes so I placed the feet you know an equal distance from each other so she looks like she has good posture and then I take the thighs and place them on top gluing them with some royal icing you want to hold them in place for a bit just to make sure they have started to set first I make a pilot hole in the bunny's head sorry bunny then I placed my sharpened dowel into the cake body and place the head on top right to the devil there he is he's got a head it's got no face yet before I move on to the arms I want to sort of clean up the seams between the seats eyes and body so I take some royal icing connection pipe it into the scene then I use a damp paintbrush and just sort of smooth that royal I think so that everything looks like one so another nature fascist you see bunny so happy no Easter bunnies have seen other bunnies don't wear things you tell them oh I get it [Laughter] arms I am adding arms I just on put arms across the screen in bold and you know something subtle I'm adding the arms to the bunny on either side of his head using royal icing to attach them and I did use a couple of lollipop sticks at the base of the arm to help secure them to the cake now are they on either side of his father cause they're on his body on either side of his head to be clear the Easter Bunny's have tails with a little Cottontail I add it to the back again with a lollipop stick and some royal icing and I do there's no seam the truth of sale and the body so I use my royal icing technique once again [Music] it makes is funny features I'm rolling out some white black gray and pink fondant nice and thin and I'm using piping tips a variety of cutters and a template for his belly nature fact Easter Bunny's has pink feminists for his eyes I used oval cutters for the main shape and then I eat piping tips to make his pupils and a little catch light [Music] so his mouth I used a large heart cutter and then I sort of cut off rounded off the tips that had this little you know I formed his little pink nose by hand it's kind of like a little triangle an upside-down triangle softens little eat little you just want to him [Music] I lay my template onto pink fondant cut out the shape of his belly and glue it onto the surface of the cake with a little bit of water during a scintilla water one of the two I know I've been giving you facts throughout this whole video but this one's mind boggling the Easter Bunny wears a bow his bow is actually quite similar to the color of my t-shirt I wore it in honor of the Easter Bunny the one and only is she funny you should make the flow in advance because it needs to set up but all you have to do is roll out some the Tiffany's use gum paste nice and plain and then cut two equal bands then working quickly use a sharp paring knife to slay 84 the bands at either end working one band at the time gather each and together pinching the gum piece together and then loop the two pinched end over to meet each other and secure them together with a little bit of piping gel once your bow is dry we can add it to the Easter Bunny add 1 bowl loop at a time piping on a little bit of royal icing to the back of the loop place it onto the bunny on one side and if you feel you want a little bit of extra support you can actually take a toothpick and Pierce it underneath the bow it's like surgery it is funny Serge I'm also the Easter running back been using the Saints Tiffany blue gum paste roll out a little band that you can use to cover the middle part of the bow making it look like it was tired right around his neck [Music] the other gumpaste feature you need to make ahead of time is years I actually was joking that he looks a bit like a white seal for a tizzy is she really fair he says he just look so sweet and yeah he did to make my gum paste years I start by rolling out a rectangle of white gum paste then I cut that rectangle in half and I lay a floral wire down the middle of one of those bands of gum paste then I played the other band of gum paste right on top I smelled up a dumb peach by using my fondant rolling pin to just roll over it and sandwich those two pieces together now using a bunny ear template that I cut out myself I place it on top of the gum paste making sure that the wire is down the center and cut out the ear so what I do is take the exposed wire and insert it down into a styrofoam cake gently allowing your to drive through the snapping appropriately upside down besides the cake coming once my ears are dry I want to add a little pink detail like mine to the inside of his ears I simply took the same template I used to cut out the ears and cut it a bit smaller and then I laid it onto some thinly rolled out pink fondant with jane fonda - fretted belly cut out the inner ear shapes and glued it onto each year with a little bit of clear piping gel [Music] remember to Easter bunnies head was made out of rice cereal treats so through a little bit hard-headed if you know what I mean I use a toothpick to make the holes into his head where I will place the wire because if you use the wire it might Bend or not make it all the way through now this is planning has ears I use my royal icing techniques just to clean up the scene the final detail this bunny needs Whitsun I made myself a little template where's my last template because I felt that the bunny whisker hold either cheek should be equal so I took a little round piece of parchment paper and drew a pattern of dots and then I laid back over my bunny on each cheek and you depend to mark out those dots and finally I'm not going to lie making these whiskers was not fun we twister is a floral wire wrapped in gray fondant and then rolled out to get it thin and smooth as you can that was not tiring at all [Music] [Music] to make the scene true to nature I wanted to display the Easter Bunny in his natural habitat so I added some paper grass and some cream eggs I going left it up to add some glam to some of these cream eggs wait a minute I haven't told him his name his name is Bartholomew did he tell you that in private yes he whispered it to me when I was meddling him when we were nose nuzzling if you want to learn more about nature you have come to the wrong place but if you want to learn more about taste please subscribe to this channel I

five-minute warning Oh five-minute warning I don't know what to do with these bears can actually mine [Applause] there we go okay it's not a Halloween house right yeah it might be I think it might be that was not my fault the helping you just happened to reach for a candy cane now that I reached for I can you see because I was being a gentleman and waiting for you to grab the first one oh okay and I notice your workspace is a little dirtier than his which is really surprising to me what are you trying to say Jeremy very unlike we did the ratios up it's two to one now it's a whole different game the guys are finally dominating no one's voting yet but guys you can type in who you'd prefer in terms of cake side cakes gingerbread houses speak up and let us know who's who's who's in the lead right now if you prefer something that's a little more rustic or the fixer-upper or something that's got curb appeal and sort of I guess more gentrified this is like do you want the move-in ready house that you're gonna brag about or do you want the fixer-upper that you basically have to you know tear down and just start again no the house you want it's fine it's like or honey yeah look is not good man reconnecting hey connecting okay hopefully we're back guys yo you're just Oren you got to do something dramatic in these last four minutes [Music] I'm just my cobblestone walkway is being laid in the front okay it's not working my bag is very dirty I don't like this what's wrong Jeremy I think you're in the clear I think you can't even stop and you're again why well let's just do comparison to this to this what are you trying to say I mean done no you got three minutes scramble so you got to make that you're getting smoked and Jimmy's counts it's like I don't even think people know how to use your name clearly she's got symmetry she's got negative space there you go one vote for hon thank you Oh someone's telling you to just please do something we should have made a stipulation that you have to use everything should have is it too late to say that no you can you got two minutes down to two minutes two minutes yeah we want to see one of everything I wish I could

you are watching how to kick it I'm Yolanda under here somewhere and this week I made myself a birthday cake that's not bad oh I'm taking myself a giant ice cream a lot of going on this week I'm having a camp cake flash sale on instead of flash a good one for more information on that sale click the link in the description below we're leaving in every single thing I said this week because it's my perfect we have to make games with 40 minutes on TV you guys don't TV for my giant ice cream sundae birthday cake I baked 10 pounds of cake total let's start off by building the foal it wasn't just Andale this is a big birthday and I want to pink Sunday I cut my round cake into two layers and I cut my bull cake into three later first squeeze better do his job right today because this cake is for me so I haven't simple syrup all of the way I decided to have a Neapolitan ice cream sundae and what I'm going to do is enhance some of my enhanced yeah because I'm more mature now so I'm going to enhance my buttercream so that I can fill my bowl seat while I listen to the lovely zoo tank I'm only going to talk like this from now I'm an adult we'll have to raise the audio you quiet is it quieter it's like a calm journey it's just quiet okay I enhanced my buttercream with a plethora of flavors I've labored half of it with a vanilla bean which is so lovely and smooth so that Jeremy had a lot of questions about the meliboeus a lot I answered them then I chopped some strawberries mainly the red part but I wanted to remove sort of that white part inside and nothing against it but it's not colorful and it's not as flavorful folded them into my Italian meringue buttercream along with a little bit of pink food coloring for my chocolate buttercream I added mini chocolate chip time to fill my bowl cake alternating the buttercream I'm going to start building my super bowl upside down I add the board then I add the bowl cake which is now kind of three layers later when I flip it I'll have support and you guys any shirt up a little board in it that doesn't work it's more like if you wanted to stand that finishes red of the Lord and I wanted to get my bowl a little bit of detail so I added some indents to the side I used a circle cutter to help me mark it and a small serrated knife to cut out eight indents evenly around the bowl now I need to crumb coat miss cakes I feel like it's my birthday and I want other people to dance for me I want to show girls I want like Rockettes I want 40 Rockettes with cakes on their heads kicking thank you or hi luck or ha there's a lot of times oh my god Susan look just focus on this case needs some dowels to support it before I flip it over I'm going to insert a few delves into the cake in a circle formation that way when we flip it they'll be support because I'm going to be adding a lot of ice - we have dancing dolls or hot it's my birthday I'm going to ask for everything I want I want some dancing dolls they're my support group get it and now I'm going to ice the cake again with my vanilla buttercream I knew this cake is more difficult than it looks because I've gotta get buttercream into all the little indents that I carved earlier if you have a cake enthusiast in your life who also has a birthday coming up like me we have some great sprinkle themed wrapping paper cards mini cards at how to keep it calm so you can wrap up their cake gifts in cake paper and it will be a kick-ass dispersed and enthusiast did you hear that yes I've used in hence plethora and enthusiasts this is the new me I need some ice cream to put in this interval so I also baked vanilla cake that I'm going to turn into ice cream I use some half-sphere silicone mold to bake a bunch of half-sphere cakes in different colors I quickly leveled off the hump with and the silicone molds and now they're all out of the mold now it's time to glue two fins together to create a scoop of ice cream I'm actually going to glue them together with chocolate because I really want to make sure they stay together as an ice cream scoop I don't like the management role of the party so for the vanilla ice cream scoops I've used is it a white chocolate for the strawberry I use a bit of pink chocolate and for the chocolate I use chocolate chocolate you know that chocolate chocolate right chocolate that's chocolate and I have to once again call on sister sis please this princess Queen needs you now it is time to crumb coat all 12 ice cream scoop woo footage I have to chill all these ice cream scoops now so rock [Music] dimension is the best birthday ever I have to ice my ice cream scoops one more time and I used my adventure I iced them I use a small spatula and then I use a little piece of acetate to smooth them because I wanted them to look cute not by you you know what I mean yeah I wanted them to I need to ice all 12 ice cream soup soup ice cream too I can't stand when my ice cream oh I have a thing about it I get so mad if I'm using ice cream and heat I eat it so quickly but don't turn okay Ivan I don't want a milkshake I want ice cream I get really upset that I could do that really upset like it's one of my biggest pet peeves melted ice cream it's my birthday so I decided to make a pink Bowl I roll out my pink fondant to be 1/8 of an inch thick and then I use a French rolling pin to pick it up and drape it now i spose up on it all over my cake using my hands and my fondant smoother however air will get trapped in the indents naturally so you want to have a straight pin handy to help release it just gently press your pin into the fondant and then guide the air is fingertip now this giant sundae cake is too much for you to handle we are making sundae cupcakes at camp cake and taco cakes camping is a live stream making event where I bigger mr.chen make at home and yours we do everything together step by step I am rolling back the price of Camp cake to $19.99 but for 48 hours oh my goal is now fully covered and smooth and I need to trim it just a little bit higher than the cake so when I flip it over there's a bit of a lip do you know what it's time for whoo it's better since you spells nonsense you have been practicing yes not better so now my Super Bowl is right-side up and ready for ice cream before adding my scoops I want to make sure this bowl can really handle them so I am going to hammer in a sharpened dowel right down the center of the bowl into the cake or added base and this will help it stop wobbling because it would be a lot of a chain and I don't like my natural number four I'm going to arrange the scoop first in a circle at the top of the bowl and to make them fit perfectly I'm just having a set of circle cutters on hand so if I need to trim away any cases that they can all fit in there nicely I will do it as I see fit well I will do that as I see fit you really are my mentor I know something happened there you go in other news you're not now that my first six scoops are laid around the perimeter of the bowl I need to fill in the space that's in the center I don't want any fallen ice cream of any time I use a circle cutter to trim the scoop down so that will fit right in the center and support to the next layer of ice like an ice cream puzzle you're like fitting them together like this yes I like that analogy but wait I need to add the little edges at the end of my scoop what I'm doing is taking extra butter cream in all three flavors and using a small spatula to just how did I even do it again tapped it on the edge I just added a ring of buttercream that just looks sort of ruffled and natural along the edge of each soup in the bowl doing one flavor at a time now I need to add three more scoops on top one of each chocolate vanilla and strawberry and finally the crowning glory is the final conclusion now Kate rules everything around me cream get the layers spread it's ready round job we're really good guys sorry we've gone off track a lot in this episode but it's my birthday so if you two love wrapping and Katie's this is the official t-shirt this month to the cake pink lips let's sing for them Jocelyn and if we just get it so what do you like on a Sunday chocolate yes I mean a really simple chocolate sauce in the microwave with chocolate butter and a little bit of corn syrup which gives it a bit of shine just melt it all together until it's completely smooth and then I don't want it to be too hot because it's buttercream it melts I don't like melted butter cream either once the chocolate sauce was smooth and melted but not hot I poured it onto my slab and you want to know supreme I even let the soft grip onto the outside of my fool what because I Jocelyn I'm so mature I understand that all things can't be controlled oh wow understand life how to kick it up asone chocolate song you have to just go with it you know what else run Sunday well what I like on a Sunday I like chocolate shaving so I'm gonna make some with a vegetable peeler haven't seen that on that oh no you have carrot cake vegetable peelers were originally called chocolate pieces and then people started using them on like carrots and potatoes and somewhere along the way the name was changed I have my chocolate shavings they're ready they're peeled I'm going to sprinkle them on to my chocolate sauce before that this fun day is almost ready and I'm getting really excited but it needs two more thing can you guess what they are justice definitely sherry good fries no sprinkle No the shaving for the sometimes okay listen what would you rest the cherry oh oh every thank you so for my whipped cream I'm using Italian meringue buttercream absolutely plain no vanilla bean in it I wanted this is whipped cream I put it in a piping bag that I fitted with a star tip and piped a real tight and then finally every Sunday music cherry on top I made my cherry out of red fondant that I stiffened with a fit of CMC and I'm actually making it bright red because I want it to be like a maraschino cherry which I don't actually like but that's what I think of when I think of a scented then it led Jeremy and I down the path of how maraschino cherries are made and I wish I could run back off up do not Google how maraschino cherries are made just buy fresh cherries that came off the tree once the cherry was assembled I brushed on a little bit of piping gel with some red food coloring mist in to make it really you know really maraschino and I placed it on top of Manhattan you know I'm calling this time if this is like a never before heard of thing you ready because the ball is so big it's mine why do I look at the broken one okay ready it's my this will always be something I look back on economy so when I'm an 80 year old woman who's even more mature and sophisticated I'll look back if it's 40 year old first and thing if you want more ice cream themed cakes we have a whole playlist right here we don't right here I was a green metallic bug it was just a confetti you know what else I don't like I don't like melted ice cream and I don't like fun joke do this that's important if you want more giant food cake and finally if you want to subscribe which I'm sure you do is firstly after this episode I just sure 
welcome back to how to cake it I'm Yolanda and this week on making a giant peanut butter and jelly sandwich cake that's my jam the bells ringing let's get to it glenda to make this cake I baked 8 pounds of my ultimate vanilla cake in two square pens that's gonna be the bread now I need to shape these two square cakes into bread slices so you know like that sort of rounded top and square at the bottom oh you're doing like like a loaf yeah the dip I love bread I left bread and I really love cake that looks like [Music] once I'm happy with my slices I then simple syrup like giant bread slices to squeeze a lot was confused he thought he was surfing bread and I had to reassure him it is cake it is time to crumb coat and chill these cakes but I only need to crumb coat and chill the sides of each giant bread slice and the top of one of them [Music] once my prom code is chilled I ice the cakes again for all the tools I use to get a great crumb coat and chill and a great ice on my cakes there are details in the description below crumb coat I'm being very serious about the fact that we make theme songs it's time for me to cover the top of one slice of bread cake this will be the top of my sandwich when I'm done so it's a very light off-white ivory red color spread color once it's nice and thin I'm talking thinner than an eighth of an inch i drape it onto the top of my slice of bread smooth it on once all the excess fondant is trimmed I want to add some texture the inside of a slice of bread is quite textured it's like dim holy and holy and you know Freddie and I kind of tried to create the pattern round and round because if you look at a slice of bread often the dough has been rolled up and if you really pay attention it's kind of spiral so I tried to get my texture a little bit of direction if you love drying food cakes like peanut butter and jelly sandwiches please share this video there is a button below to help you do that and actually we have a whole playlist of giant food cakes where I can different types of food and your favorite snacks and you can find them all right here now we're gonna decorate the crust parts of our bread both slices I measure the circumference of my but it's still a circumference if it's not round Oh No perimeter perimeter yes I've never used perimeter we a bore in the film Orhan please deny or confirm I roll out my fondant nice and thin and to its desired length and then I cut it in half lengthwise when I have two long bends that I can now wrap around my bread slice cakes I use a French rolling pin and I just roll up all that fondant onto the rolling pin and then I pick it up line it up at the side of my cake and unravel it it was so much fun and it's on those falls off the pin is you can keep it together and get it around fast enough but it doesn't rip or tear as you guys know I have a pink book coming out and this is your chance to win a copy before it even hits the shelves oh my gosh the book is being printed as well inspirational quotes are a huge thing now every time I scroll my Instagram I'm sucked into a quote and I too have my own way of inspiring I'll be sharing some of my favorite hashtag yo quotes from my videos and it's your job to guess what video it's about head over to my Instagram my handle is right here if you want to participate all the details are there hashtag yo clothes now that my dress is on my case I'm not going to trim it just yet I'm gonna chill it first and this will prevent even more tearing so I popped my cake slices or bread slick bread cake slices into the fridge now that my fondant is firm I'm gonna pull my cakes back out of the fridge and I'm going to use a sharp paring knife to cut the crusts flush with the top of the cake so I really want to hold the blade flat and run it along the top of the cake all around the perimeter removing the excess fondant see how I threw it in there again it great good obviously I will have a scene and bread has no seams I'm pretty sure unless it's like monkey bread the kind you pull of her oh my god I really want bread and butter oh why did you say that so I need to address my scene by making a little bit of a fondant paste I filled in the seam now I'd like to add texture to the crust I'm going to use a sculpting tool and I'm just sort of indenting the sides of the crust because you know how when you have a slice of bread from like a loaf it's kind of rippled along the side it's right and along the bottom side of the bread I once again and poking some holes and I'm using a ball tool and a bone tool to create some texture along the bottom which looks very different than the sides and the top of the bread were you a cut off press filled jostle Jeremy nope me neither I like crusts this is why we found each other which side are you on which team are you on we're gonna arrange a worldwide meeting it's time to paint my bread you've never heard that before hate my bread that could be a reality show hit my ride where did that go exhibit will get exhibit to host paint my bread yeah I need to paint the top surface of my top slice of bread I'm going to use a bit of ivory and again a touch of black the same colors I used to make the fondant and what I want to do is just subtly enhance the bread and now that it's dimpled and has texture hopefully the colour will sort of fall in and I will really help make it look more realistic now it's time to paint the crust I also painted my crust with the same shades a food coloring that I dyed the fondant with so that was ivory buttercup yellow and brown so I want to paint the bottom of the bread slice just a touch darker besides I really want to paint in the same direction as the texture I created along the top I painted horizontally creating brushstrokes and has the paint starts to evaporate and dry you can see those brushstrokes a little bit more and it creates a texture I wanted to look like the golden top of a slice of bread well now I have two slices of bread but this bread told me it felt empty what's better than PB and J for the filling I'm going to make my peanut butter frosting the same one I used in the chocolate and peanut butter cake YUM but I wanted it to be even peanut butter ear and not only did I add extra peanut butter I took some salted roasted peanut just rough chop them so not fine and then fold them into my cross I'll link to my chocolate peanut butter mega cake video where I make this peanut butter frosting is in the description that cake was so good the first thing I do is lay the first slice of bread cake now I'm going to spread my peanut butter a nice thick layer like a quarter of an inch the real controversy in this video is that you can't even take a peanut butter sandwiches forever are you kidding oh yeah that's right you can't in our day it was like I would have eaten nothing what would what would I have eaten here's your bread you laughing I don't want it to overflow too much because when the weight of the other cake hits it it will naturally lose out now that my frosting is set up I'm going to spread my jam on top for a minute I was worried that I got the wrong jam because I think peanut butter and jam is supposed to have strawberry jam for a moment I just I was gonna get raspberry cuz I really like raspberry jam yes do you think it's suppose to be strawberry again let's have a vote hashtag strawberry hashtag raspberry we have so many debate yes we have serious debate going on in the comments of this video YUM Oh remember my strawberry cake or whether it's just jam was made of this family do you think there were no googly eyes in the jam for the record so I don't think it was them I spread my jam all over the top of my peanut butter frosting and now it's time to top this open-faced sandwich for the final slice of pumpkin bread I didn't use a ruler or try to line it up perfectly I did however use a ruler to cut it into two triangles [Applause] how can I bite this Jocelyn can you hold it without the board let's find out everyone stand by I can't bite this look or not it is there dramatic music look I'm measuring you split screen with hamburger our hunt right here right here oh that's pretty actually put up me with the peanut butter chocolate slice let's just go up my roll please subscribe to this channel please share this video it's the least I can do oh yeah once my crown code is chilled I ice the cakes again both I ask the cakes once the cakes are chilled I know once my crown code is chilled I ice the cakes again I don't want to

hey cupcake welcome back to how to cake it it's still winter so I am making a toque cake if you don't know what that is it is a knitted cap or hat but us Canadians call it a tooth to form my toque cake I'm baking some pink vanilla cake and some chocolate cake hmm it's winter you need something good forget the calorie roll back it's cold once my cakes are baked I remove them from their pans level them remove the carmelization from the bottom of the pink cakes and then I cut all of my cakes into two layers because I'm unsure of how much cake I'm gonna use to build this - I am saving my humps as well I'm just leveling the humps and cutting the middle out with a circle cutter now it's time to simple syrup all of these cakes and speaking of new year new me so squeeze has decided that he loves jo-ann the scammer I mean what is this sirplease and his girlfriend Finnell OOP are on sale at had a Kiki calm the furs not included it's time to fill and stack these cakes with my Italian meringue buttercream and I'm going to alternate the layers so chocolate pink vanilla chocolate pink Anila you get it by the time my hat was about eight inches high I decided it was actually tall enough so I didn't use one of my pink layers or my humps [Music] don't worry they were fine they just didn't make it into the to the other my buttercream is firm it is time to carve this into a tube shape I've marked the top of my cake with an X just to mark the center and then I used my serrated knife to carve downward from that X down to that two inch line above the bottom I've made a mark all around the cake about two inches up from the bottom because I want my tube to have a band that's folded over so I want that to stay fairly straight now this is a great cake for beginners I think you don't really have to worry too much about the carving it is a knitted hat so it's really forgiving essentially you want it to be more narrow up at the top and then sort of curve and dome down to the bottom the way it would fit on your head the next thing I do is crumb coat edge here this is so much better than dancing to the crumb coat now I'm singing the crumb coat I've moved up so I was a backup dancer and now I'm the lead singer crab go and cheer okay this is me like pointing to the fact after the crumb coat I iced my cake one more time and chill if you're up for hibernating in this cold weather please share this video and if you're lucky enough to live in a part of the world that is currently warm share it on my behalf please was my brother come he's nice and chilled I want to measure the circumference of this cake so I leave my fabric measuring tape around and then I measure out 20 sections and then want to take those marks and mark them all the way up to the top of the cake so I use my fabric measuring tape just as a guide and lay it from the mark at the bottom to the top center and run my knife along the buttercream so that I can see the Division lines clearly it's time to create the first of our knitted textures on this to cake after this I'm using the classic shooter and boy am I using it I feed the coral fondant into my clay extruder and I use the face plate that is made for making grass now my clay extruder has a couple of these I'm using that sort of the thickest one so it has seven holes in one a face plate to make chords of fondant it takes a long time that's very tedious but you don't want to extrude all the cores you need for this hat cake because we do dry out so I'm gonna work on this hat in one section at a time I then take all my cords and line them up in pairs so two by two ladies vision and then what I do is twist the cords onto each other [Music] now it's time to line up these sort of knitted cords on my tube cake so I'm going to work on one section and the first thing I'm going to do is apply one of the twists to the center of a section then I need to keep adding these twisted chords to my cake right up against each other until one whole section is covered because each section is wider at the base of the Hat and comes to a point at the top of the hat as you lay on your twisted chords you might need to overlap them slightly at the top of that but the most important thing is to press them firmly to the cake and then up against each other because we don't want to say screw the chords I'm going to fill every other section on the cake with this twisted cord method this tube cake is going to be made up of a few different patterns in between there'll be some more texture knitting techniques that I am using for this week only on habakkuk accom we are having a bundle up sale which includes this got cake hoodie and all of our other hoodies and sweatshirts now it's time to move on to my braided mitten words for this mold I simply dust the surface with just a little bit of cornstarch and then brush it away because I don't want my fondant to stick to the inside then I roll out some thick chords of my coral fondant press it into the mold and I use a small fondant rolling pin to roll my fondant in to the mold as I roll the excess sort of gets pushed out of the mold and I can cut it away and peel it away and I carefully turn out the braid to reveal this gorgeous knitted now I need to add these Braves in between the already decorated sections of flanking remember that I mentioned there's gonna be a 2-inch band sort of folded up I like it so I use my ruler to make sure I'm leaving a 2-inch clearance and then I just use it to sort of press up the braid and tuck it at the top I'm going to pinch it together I just simply lay it on top and try to place it and then I realize I want to trim sort of the sides of the braid so I use the sharp tip of my paring knife to just sort of trim away the sigh it's just some of that excess water because as my hat comes to a point obviously it would be as if it was knitted you know into a more narrow [Music] now I need to address the space underneath the braids because under there there's just buttercream and because of this are not ready to attach the band at the bottom because I want that band to be smooth I don't want it to dip in and out so I roll out some of my choral fondant to the same thickness as the chords that are laying on my cake and then I just cut bands that fit in between and are the correct height of two inches and lay them inside to fill in the gaps [Music] it's time to move on to my second knitted mold which is like a ribbed border I used this mold in the same way that I used my braided knit molt I make a few of these and then I attach them to my cakes but first I want to make it look as if this band has sort of folded up under that so before I place it on the cake I use my finger tip and sort of just round down one of the long ends of this ribbed border then I brush on some clear piping gel to the back of the border and attach it at the bottom of the cake I need to add several pieces side by side to get all the way around the cake so make sure you're always using your piece right side up just so that the pattern matches up as I add all the pieces of this rib border where the seams mean I just use a fine sculpting tool to sort of press the edges together very gently just in case you can see any sort of lines that make a definite scene [Music] now I'm gonna make this two extra fancy and I want to add sort of like a decorative knit to the top of the rim tortor yes is a fancy fancy too for this I'm using my braided mold once again but this time I'm only gonna feel half of it I make a few of these pieces and then I use a sharp knife to trim it nice and clean so I'm only seeing sort of the curves of half of a braid then I brush the back of this braid with clear piping gel and add it to the top of the rib border all the way around the cake and again if you filled the hole too much and you feel like the edges are sort of too thick then you can use your knife to trim that away sort of on a diagonal trim away some of that excess fondant so more like it's been admitted into the cake now Jocelyn this is gonna be your favorite part of this hat do you know what it is I make my sculpted rice krispies and make a really small batch in a small bowl which was nice it was easier to handle and then I take it out of the bowl and just finish you know meeting it all together and compressing it into a nice ball the next thing I do is make a little pilot hole at the bottom of my rice krispies Bowl because I will use a dowel to help me keep this pom-pom in place now I need to brush this entire race krispies ball with some clear piping gel and then roll out my gray fondant on a nonstick board with a small fondant rolling pin and cover the ball and I need it gray and I just want to say it has nothing to do with the beautiful pair of designer shoes that you found in LA and we left behind did I just remind you of thing she she did an Instagram post dedicated to the shoe she was the vine and she wished the lucky woman well we will buy them I'm sorry it was hurtful to me I'm really sorry there are a few faceplates that come with my clay extruder that make grass so I use the thickest one to make the knitted texture on my hat and now I'm gonna use the thinnest one for the pom pom so I extrude a little bit of gray fondant and then I just use my sharp knife to chop it into little lengths and then I bunch all these little sort of threads together and glue them on to my pop-pop I just want to see how it looks and if I picked the right size I did so I'm very happy and now I'm going to attach this rice krispies ball to the top of my cake the first thing I do is decide to trim away some of the excess fondant at the top of my - I want to make sure it's a nice flat surface then I insert the lollipop stick down into the center of my cake leaving some exposed and now I'm going to spread a little bit of royal icing on the bottom of my rice krispies Bowl and then attach it where I already made now I brush around the bottom of my rice krispies bowl with some clear piping gel and then I extrude every day I'm extruded every day I met Rudy every day I'm extrude and I it was really like that that was my life I was just extruding and extruding and extruding and gluing it onto the pom-pom all around for the piping gel is keep doing that until you get up to the top I make a pompom on my party hat cake in my cake book and I make it in a completely different way I don't use a clay extruder I don't use a rice krispies ball and it's so cute make sure to check out my cake book at had a cake accom I feel the need to expose a secret about myself I don't wear tunics no you don't already have you seen this here I'm a hood girl I wear a hood you know I'm so hood got cake that's

welcome back to how to cake it I'm Yolanda this week is Valentine's Day and I'm going to make a cake that looks like lips join us I'm more sophisticated now that I'm in this channel and when I see lips I mean giant lips so to start I baked 12 pounds of my ultimate chocolate cake in two rectangular pan for one of my rectangle cakes i partially level them meaning i leave a bit of the hump and for the second cake i leave time but I do cut both of my cakes horizontally into two layers now it's time for Sur squeeze a lot to help me shower these cakes with simple syrup he is wearing a tube top but let me let me tell you something sometimes he pulls it up and he wears it like a crop top you can see a little bit of us how it's like hold so now he's jay-z in a crop don't picture it now it's time to begin to carve lips I did make a template I found a picture of myself and I blew up my lips and no I didn't I found it if you think why didn't you I should have yeah my staff my cakes back on top of each other at the bottom I put the two completely leveled layers I lay my lip template on top of the cake and first cut around the outside just to get the general shape of lips I just googled lips and there is a ton of pictures of lips I had to decide whose lips were the nicest if you think these are your lips let me know this cake was my sister's idea you have to understand I kind of grew into these lips so when I was a child they looked even bigger they look like the cake I'm making pretty much I need to add sort of the curviness of lips so I use a serrated knife and I just round out the top edges and I cut a little more cake off the sides just so the cake again is plumper in the center my cake is a bit smaller than my template so what I did is when I cut out the initial shape of the lips I saved the corners of the cake that I cut off so that I could but them up on the end of the lips and continue carving now if cake is your BAE as it is mine please share this video with those you love that's the perfect video to share cause it's like you're sending everyone a big kiss I also need to work on carving the space between the top and bottom lip so what I did is I cut that out of my template and then I laid it back on top and use a small serrated knife up against that line to cut a bit of cake almost like a crevice down into the cake there's the crevice know so you can the cake won't open but we want to believe that it could open I'm pretty happy with the shape of my lips but I decided that I want them to be plumper on top I feel like the plump lips are really in I'm using the hump that I saved for my second cake and I'm just gonna cut it in half place a piece on the top lip and the bottom lip and just add some plumpness right in the center of the lips like these lips are puckering up even though I'm happy with the shape of my lips I think from the sides they look weird because the sides are just straight so I'm gonna use my knife and go all around the cake and taper it in like around the lips down underneath cutting away cake now I'm completely happy with the shape of my lips so I'm going to unstack all my cakes yes it is stressful that's why I said carefully and I can move on to coloring some but agree I've decided to color it pink so I add a bit of pink food coloring to a bit of my Italian meringue buttercream I stir until I'm happy and then I color the rest according so I build up my cakes spreading a nice even layer of my pink buttercream carefully placing the next chocolate cake layer on top as I stack and fill this cake I do want to spread a little bit of chocolate ganache on the corners of the lips this way it doesn't all move around when I'm filling it with my paint butter and repeat until I get to the top this T is this

faster bottom lip Branko fondant okay I want to make these lips nice and wet so I am going to roll out some red fondant I'm gonna cover it live by lip lip lip blue baby they're not one watch top bottom they're not one thing right so I'm gonna cover the bottom lip first then I used a sharp paring knife to cut away the excess fondant from the bottom and down into the crest I will note that if when you remove your extra fondant from the top it sort of peels away the butter cream from the top lip you want to patch that up before you continue you'll want to repeat this process to cover your top lip and the only difference here is when you cut away the fondant at the sides where we're going to have a scene you want to cut that scene as neat as possible so it just looks like the line of

crevasse and use a paintbrush once again to smooth it up along the top lip and along the bottom lip okay so it is time to create the texture of lips looking at a lot of up-close pictures of lips in it

double-oh-seven i'm double o6y because they're fixing all right now I need to cut my secret chambers out of one of the chocolate layers and the vanilla layer I'm going to lay the template on top of

then I just take one more time nice that was like I'm the Beyonce of Devon my take is chilling and now I'm going to knead and roll up all of this fondant to decorate this cake and make it look like the wheel of misfortune that it really is you know this is a great time to make our big announcement okay this is this if you huge a lot of you write to me and ask me why we don't have a second

of all six of these colors and each one will cover one section of the top of my cake now I need to cut bands of fondant that I'm going to add to the sides of this cake I need to place the triangles of fondant on top of this cake but I need to make sure that they match up with the lines that I marked out on the lazy susan I'm just going to line it up on the line and make a mark on the side of my cake so that I can see it from the top just love one things line up justice that you love is limited you can use a flat spatula to help pick up your fondant carefully [Music] now I'm going to place the matching color on the sides of this cake trimming it clean at the must a sharp knife a good ruler and a fondant smoother are great tools to use for applying fondant in sections like this you may need to trim your fondant sometimes if it's a little too big again using your ruler and your sharp knife this cake is already starting to look a lot like a wheel of misfortune but I want to use my Finlay roll black fondant to create strips and cover all my seams between the colors then I'm going to cut out numbers and number them off and applying my flat fondant strips and numbers with a little bit of piping gel brushed on the back [Music] [Music] the final detail I'm adding to this cake is a black outline around the outside of the circle I'm going to use my place oh no you were like I'm gonna let it clean I just need to stop in my black fondant with a bit of vegetable shortening us just put is going on how to knead it or maybe maybe we should create how to soften it but you have the size right I think we should just be explicit I'm using a small round faceplate the plan is jokes turd one long piece that makes it all the way around I need to brush a bit of piping gel just at the edge of the top of my case I'm going to pick this up from one end and begin to add it to the edge of the cake I'm just going to go around the cake and smooth the tube of fondant right to the edge

you're watching how to take it I'm Yolanda and they're all the rage so I decided to take a how to cake it digit spinner out of cake to make this business better cake I baked 10 pounds of my ultimate chocolate cake in four round pins the first thing I need to do is remove all four of my chocolate cakes from their pans and level them make sure to save your cake hump we're going to use them later Oh save the hump now I'm going to cut each cake into two layers if your whole tom is crave and you agree that fidgets spinner should be edible please share this video with all your fidget spinning friends I don't think I have anything consistent oh my son my son that count right yes sir squeeze is in the house as usual people don't stay in the house enough anymore time you got to be like so squeezes into half I feel like you should cheer when I say it like we're at a house party kitten play is over there or put in a house where you drop it okay there's okay I can't wait to see where Hans house party graphic excellent don't forget there is please it's part of our consult and show bundles and the herbs back and stuff that how to keep that like you know how to save your booze in the house of his crew anywhere without in bundles have you met offset spatula I need to give a proper shout out because someone else is in the house today it's the half man who made my fidget spinner turntable for me it's essentially like a lazy susan or a turntable but in the shape of digits minute so I just want to thank the hacks with so much because this morning is impossible without now I need to use my fidget spinners turntable just the top part not the turning part and I'm going to lay it upside down onto my largest round cake and now I need to trim away the parts that are sticking out the board that will become the center of my statistic I now say it's one of the 10 inch layers that I've carved away into the center of the fidgets spinner board I'm going to carve each of my seven inch cakes to butt up against the center cake completely covering my digits spinner shapes board that's a really easy thing to say now I have one layer of chocolate cake on the fidgets spinner shaped for the next thing I need to do is fill this cake and for that I've decided to dye some buttercream a nice shade of pink like a nice punchy how to cake it because this is a how-to cake it fidgets spinner so now I'm going to take this beautiful punchy pink buttercream and ice the top of this digits ability or what's the center of the picture okay once I have a nice layer of buttercream on I'm going to top the fidgets center with the other four layers of cake so they all need to be carved just like the first layers and fit in place completing the shape now guess what my DJ presidential from code and chill I've decided to come focus in Klingon Italian Ori buttercream and I use the small spatula just really gluing all the comments to the phidget spinner and then actually I chose a conical children to be spinning oh no no no no no no I wanted to let go wow this is my new participant it's time to ice my fidget Center cake one more time in a car alluring buttercream and chill it remember now chumps I told you to say we're going to use them now to recreate the center part of the fidget spinner which probably has me leave it in the comments below if you know what a skull and what I'm going to do is take one of my house level it a bit and create that little circular disks that sort of rest on top and bottom of the kitchen where you spent I used a small cake pan and a circle cutter to achieve the spinner shape I was looking for since this is a how-to cake it fidgets spinner I'm going to put sweets on each end I'm going to use my phidget spinner to help me decide what kind of dessert to have that's a great use right so I'm planning to make a tiny pie a tiny cake and a tiny doughnut well they're not really tiny the doughnut was real size I'm going to create my small cake for this I've again leveled one of my cake house and use a small pan to cut out a circle now I want to layer this tiny little piece taken two layers just like a cake for my small pie once again using a cake pan to cut out a circle but I also need to bevel this circle the way that a piping tip so I'm doing this upside down diffusing a small serrated knife to cut an a-line cut and create small pie finally I need to create my zone for this I cut out the same sized circle of cake from a cake hump and then I use a small serrated knife to essentially carve a doughnut and then using a circle cutter cutting out the center and rounding out that little Valley as well I really felt like eating a doughnut while making this that's just some personal information for others but I want to make sure that all three of my desserts are the same size on the ends of my fidgets spinner so I'm using the same size cake pans to carpet.this we admit the house we have such a good time as the last party we invited him again did you bring a bundle I just want to be clear sir squeezes bundle is not the only bundle in industry there is the summertime bundle that's - there's nothing like a summertime party right make sure to get yours at how to kick it calm once the simple things were soaked in Ivan crumb coated all of these cake parts the center of the fidgets Center the dullness of pie images oh and I also remember how I cut the cake into layers I filled it first and rounded chill time now I need to ice all four of these little cakes one more time in Italian meringue buttercream with the help of Sur squeezes bundle I'd be nothing about four squeezes and fumble are you interested in cocoa are you fair enough of those no back to the main digit spinner cake that sounds millions husband means finches so I decided to roll out my Till's on it into one huge sheets and then carefully pick it up onto a french rolling pin and drape it over working quickly I use my hands to smooth it down the fidget spinner really working on all of the edges first the corner first because that's where fundable to tear there was some mild cracking which I'll address later but for the most part of very happy and then I used a sharp paring knife to cut it I had to hold my knife parallel to the stingy spinner board that was made and run it along the base cutting away the excess I want places take images to chill so that the fondant can stiffen up a bit and I can address these small tears and cracking in the meantime I'm going to cover the top of the pivot Center the little top that I created in the same teal fondant I decided to cover the center of the fidgets spinner in two parts because I had I stood upside down so first i draped my teal fondant over one side and trimmed it and then i flip the cake over spread on a thin layer of buttercream and covered that side as my fields line we need to stop all this spinning for a minute and talk about the replicate contest remember a while back I asked you guys to replicate some of my cakes in your very own way and we have chosen the winners whose cakes will appear in my upcoming face book it's so exciting I've actually seen it myself your work printed in my book and they looked incredible we will be announcing the name of each winner over on my Instagram so head over to my account the handle is right here or you can always just search the hashtag replicate if you'd like to preorder my book the link is in the description below you can order it right now before it even hits the shelves I'm going to use some of my leftover teal fondant to create a fondant piece to fill in the cracks on my main digits inner cake I create a bit of fondant paste with some left over to your fondant and some water and what I like to do is just work the water in with a small spatula just sort of blending it until it reaches the consistency of royal icing now that my pace is a perfect consistency I'm going to apply it to the top edges of my citrus cake I like to use a small spatula and I just sort of iced it into the crap crap ourselves Center is made now we got to get to the little cakes on top first I'm going to work on my tiny little pie first thing I did was create the foil container that pies are often baked in for this I rolled out some grey fondant and covered my pie which is now upside down then I took some tin foil and crumpled it up and use this to texture the fondant and make it look like well crumpled up foil so I used crumbled up foil to create consoled up foil once I'm happy with my foil texture on my pie I then place it in the fridge to chill so that I can paint it now that the fondant is a little bit more sturdy I'm going to paint the gray fondant silver to look like foil so I just mix a little bit of silver luster dust with clear food grade alcohol and brush it all over my pie shell you don't have to brush the top because this cake will be turned over and nobody will see the bus once my paint is dry I can create the pie on top so what I did is roll out some red fondant a circle of red fondant and then I just sort of poked it sorry I don't have a more technical term for that I want to you know hope eyes don't look perfectly yes right so just wanted it to look like the top of a pot and then I laid it on top of my chocolate cake now I need to recreate the lattice pastry on the pie it's so much fun so what you do is dry your fondant to look like pastry so I used ivory chocolate and once you're happy with the color you're going to roll it out and then cut strips and I cut my strip without a ruler the pie it has to look rustic right right improve it it don't use that perfectly rustic don't use that word rustic and organic and then I'm going to create the lattice on top of the pie so you lay down three strips in the same direction then you bend them halfway back then you lay a strip down then you put it over that I'm not going to describe the full process but you want it to look these are intertwined so each strip should go over and they're over and under over and under and the next thing I want to do is paint these strips to look like a big-time library yes chocolate surprise I mixed my ivory with clear food grade alcohol and I painted each strip with my paint and as a final touch I will know it's not quite final almost final touch I sprinkled some sugar on to the pastry - I love that on a pie I love that like crispy sugary crust to recreate the look of a cooked pie I put some jam into a parchment paper bag and then I just typed it over my red fondant and all the exposed parts between my lattice mark engineering cake engineer yeah you'll and again I wear a tinfoil ring to prove it I'm gonna put one on and go to like an engineering convention and when I get there I'm going to be like this engineer is in the house I'm guessing I get kicked out right there I'm going to move on and save my doughnut my favorite kind of doughnut is chocolate bits of chocolate leaves because YUM I roll out my chocolates on it and then I touch a band and use that band to cover the inside interfere with the job I just the rest of my chocolate on it over the donut moving it around trim away the excess underneath the bottom and then I trim away the center hole as for my plays I'm using modeling chocolate I rolled out my modeling chocolate and drape it over the top of the donut and then I use the sharp paring knife to just sort of cut it in a you know a wavy circle around the donut is if it displays that was poured on I really wanted to do that I'm not going to like it every donut needs sprinkles I feel the first thing I'm going to do is brush on a little bit clear piping gel onto my modeling chocolate and then sprinkle the donut I actually use real sprinkles I didn't create some up on it because this donut in the light side strawberry seeds took me over the edge I just I need a minute finally I guess make the tiny shape so I covered my cake first with yellow fondant and trimmed away the excess and then I covered the top with some punchy pink fondant and I want to treat like a scalloped edge around the side as if that had been poured also like a glaze over the case but this time I wanted my scallop to be seasoned unlike my donut because that was enough random actions my cake is almost done but I feel it really needs some rosettes as any bakery pieces have so for that I'm softening a little bit of white fondant with vegetable shortening and placing it into my clay extruder and I'm using the face plate of the place to do that creates a rope it's actually you know what it's actually kind of this shape it's this shape the face plate and once you've extruded the cord you then just twist it slightly to get that rope effect and wind them up on each other creating the look of like a pipe tool set but it's fondant wanted to create the type of bakery cake that has you know the marks of where you're supposed to cut it already and slice it I cut out a parchment paper circle I then folded it into twelve equal sections now I'm going to use that as a template on top of my tiny cake and then I use a ruler and my sharp paring knife to join the lines create the slice marks you don't want to cut deep you just want to see the line now that my tiny cake is divided into 12 slices I'm going to glue the rosettes on to the candidature slices a little bit of clear piping I'm going to top each one of my rosettes with a cherry and in this case I'm using a small red candy B because of surface size it's time to assemble this digit spinner but before that I want to label it as a headache it's kitchen spinner I've rolled out some black fondant nice and thin and then I use some letter cutters to cut out HP I then place the center of my fidget spinner you guessed it in the center of my fidget Center gluing it on with a little bit of royal icing bit this this stopped really stressful because the spinner the fidgets that are kept spinning Oh Derrick how dare it do what it said it was going to do finally I drew on all three of my mini cakes my mini cherries hi my mini notes my regular size chocolate glazed doughnut pen my mini cake please

you are watching how to kick it I'm Yolanda and this week in honor of Father's Day I am taking a giant t-bone steak out of red velvet cake it's a red velvet sink please subscribe to the channel and hit that notification bell to you know when I have a freshly baked cake for 6 to make this cake I baked two 12-inch square pans of red velvet cake cooled them and remove them from their pants then I level the top but I left the carmelization on the back Oh Jeremy you're not shocked you sound more like okay like just like take state ground floor on the outside of the pocket so I want to leave the carmelization and Jeremy sunshine is just bad at acting that's why is behind the camera now I'm going to stash my cakes together placing one with the carmelization tanks down and the other tipped over on top - Lissa carmelization it's time to carve this cake into a steak just assuming I drew myself a template is really easy there's a ton of big pictures online I'm not joking endless endless supply so what I did is I leave my template on top and carved out the main portion of the page I vented the exercise of cakes that I've cut off because the state gets narrow as it skips to the bottom far far part is also card something else it hasn't actually it's a serrated knife that I use a small one to carve cakes is really a statement see ya Jeremy Lee I want to call Danny mr. positivity from now Kenny some of the balance of the universe that section this is a lot over here a lot of like rainbows like sprinkles just fall from the sky over Joe's head I'm not even joking once I'm happy with the shape of my steak I'm going to simple syrup all of this thing you don't want to over your dad's sake you want to give them a juicy tender steak that's perfectly cooked with the help of this week it's time to guys some Italian meringue buttercream a deeper shade of red velvet cake I use the same food guys I used to color my cake batter and I just adjust them as I go comparing my buttercream to my cake until I'm happy I'm going to fill this cake and restock it but unlike most cakes I don't want to just spread an even layer of buttercream in between I kind of want to gel mitt a little in the center because the thickest part of the state could be the least cooked now I flip my second cake on top completing my state cake and before I crumb coat I just want to darken the buttercream a bit more since it's on the outside I want it to look more like a clip and then I cramp out and chill my steak once my gram coat is chilled I'm going to ice this giant steak cake again and chill it one up my baking tools are kind of like my barbecue tool to barbecue peculiar barbecue that is so far beyond who I only barbecue how does the barbecue like that's so 2006 week to cover this cake I colored some fondant in like a reddish brown color i measured the width and the length of the cake rolled out my fondant picked it up on a French rolling pin and draped it over the cake then I smoothed it with a fondant smoother and my hands and trimmed away the excess recipe if your dad is not a state guy we have a ton of other great Father's Day ideas for cakes in a playlist right over here and in fact if you guys make one of these cakes for your dad you could win how to keep get prize pack here's how make one of the cakes from the playlist take a photo of the cake with you and your dad's and post it on instagram using the hashtag HTC I love step three finalists will win a fun product prai's max I'll deliver bye Jeremy you won the prize the next thing I want to do is create the grill marks and the steak very important very important you want to mess up the grill max right you want to prove that you know how to cook this thing so I just use a wooden dowel to press in my grill marks I did use a ruler shocker to space them because I know if are because grill would be even with fence oh yeah I think it was warranted yes okay so just use a wooden dowel press it into the fondant and you can leave indentation stay healthy it's barbecue Larissa I am making the t-bone on the giant steak cake with some modeling chocolate so I like to roll it out in a bit of cornstarch you can use a nonstick mat if you feel that you need to and I rolled it out big enough to cut out a bone I cut out the t-bone that I then laid on top of my face the next thing I did was roll out more of my modeling chocolate because truthfully the phone will be right through the state so we need to add a band of white chocolate along the top side that comes up to meet the bone to give the illusion that that phone is going fully to distance [Music] the next thing I want to do is create the layer of like fat or gristle I believe it's actually called crystal along the side of the meat so what I did now is dyed the rest of my modeling chocolate with a bit of brown food coloring to get it a darker color then I rolled out my modeling chocolate making sure it was the thickness of my steak or the height of my steak and I added a bent all along the one side gluing it on with a bit of clear piping top with my remaining Brown modeling chocolate I created the end of the bones would be sort of a sharp piece at the bottom of the T and I attached that to the side of the cake coming up to meet the goal for all my basic recipes red velvet cake simple syrup Italian meringue buttercream and modeling chocolate I have videos in this playlist right here it is time to score this week because the surface of meat has a texture so to start off I'm going to use the tip of my sharp paring knife and I'm just going to continuously score the meat with natural sort of curvy lines all over the surface of the cake to texture the centre of my bone where it usually looks sort of dark and porous I use a small piping tip that's used to make grass or hair so it's a piping tip that has several little round holes I just put it on my fingertip almost like a symbol and then I pressed into the modeling chocolate ball and chocolate is great that's why they call it modeling chocolate because basically depending on its temperature you can always go back and remodel it it doesn't develop a skin on the top the way that fondant or gum please do it's time to paint this fake cake I began by using ivory food coloring with a bit of clear food grade alcohol and I painted my first layer on the victim then I darkened that paint was brown with some black and I basically mix different combinations of the panes watering it down more sometimes and a whole different selection of brushes to paint layers and layers and layers Thomas Piketty I also enjoyed using I enjoyed using a dry brush the great thing I love about painting is I find it more forgiving than a lot of key techniques because you even have the ability to erase if at any point you feel like your steak is too dark or you don't like a technique you could always brush over it with more clear food grade alcohol I can get into a soft cake and wash your pain away and start again [Music] I found that as I was painting I was kind of losing the texture that I scored into the meat of my knife so I deep in those three using a gaming tool and I also made more of them along the side without the fact to enhance like grill marks I painted in a mixture of black and brown these colors now unfortunately we don't have any eat more cake teeth for Dad but if you remember this is Key Club this is this once t-shirt and it comes with a free little yo-yo not a mini version of me an actual like the toy graduated job oh yes I branded the state oh yes yes I did I use some metal alphabet cookie cutters that I had I actually gave them to my friends they never use them anymore so I have to go sleep in bath and his mini kit shadows Azores and what I did is very carefully I helped each letter with a tweezer and then I use Bernie to heat up the letter and then I branded my stake with the letters C a ke big cake and so basically the cutters just sort of melted into the fondant and when they left that little frayed line I painted in the group with a very fine paintbrush black C to make it was charred I'm very happy if you want to present this state cake in a way that looks the most real you can even put a little bowl of coarse sugar beside it in your dad sugar hood stay tuned sugar it now that is how you make a steak add a cake for your dad I wish dad wanted me to that wasn't dr.

welcome back to honey cake it I'm Yolanda and happy Halloween to celebrate I am gonna make a giant candy corn on the cob my eyes pitcher can you see it this Halloween I'm dressing up as Yolanda camp author of how to cake it a cake book I just tied my hair up because she does that in her videos to make this candy corn on the cob I baked eight four inch round vanilla cakes my cakes are leveled with the carmelization removed from the bottom and now I'm going to remove the carmelization to the sides [Music] it's time to simple's here all eight cakes with the help of sir squeeze now I only have four pens so I have to make two batches and you'll notice there's quite a difference in the color of my cakes four of them look a little more yellow and that's because in my second batter I used farm-fresh eggs and those yolks just took it up a notch that's very harvesty of me I feel fall Halloween harvest I don't think what about egging people's houses don't that don't do it and if you do don't use farm-fresh eggs eat those ones once all the simple syrup has soaked in it's time to stack these cakes with my Italian meringue buttercream I began by stacking two at a time together with buttercream in between and what I did was I alternated the vanilla with farm-fresh vanilla and then I began to line them up on their sides cuz I need to build them calm I'm building a cup without the corn correct a corn Lascar all the recipes I used to make this cake are in my cake book vanilla cake is on page 24 Italian meringue buttercream is on page 30 and sir squeeze and his syrup are on page 34 yes he's on the book cover I did try to like nudge him I feel bad because I'm here you can't even see him well it's it's his fault for being clear okay i chilled my cake until the buttercream is firm and now it's time to carve this cake into this is a great cake to start with because you don't have to be afraid of the Cartman it's kind of simple the cakes are already round on their side and what you need to do is just sort of taper out and fin out either end one end of the corn can be a bit thicker so you can taper it and then round out future if some of you want to try making this cake or you know of a friend who would want to try making this cake share this video with them hit the button share the corn it's harvest share the corn yes it's time for the good old CCAC crumb coat and chill I'm going to be using candies to recreate the corn kernels on this table so I've decided to crumb coat an isotope in yellow white chocolate ganache this will help them stick better see see and see that supposed to be chronic and Hardy and Charlie Charlie is funny star I think they just hit a photo - it's probably the sweet as I help for the kernels on his giant corn on the cob I'm using gummy candy corn I'm just gonna take a sharp pair of scissors and cut off the white tips to help them stick I've decided to melt some yellow compound chocolate put it in parchment piping bags and I'm gonna stick the kernels on one by one piping a little dot of chocolate adding so we're gonna be here for a while or I'm just like speed up the footage of it you know now while I'm busy adding all of the corn kernels to my cake I need to tell you something else cam cake is back and goes on sale tomorrow November 1st cap cake in the live stream making event taking place on December 9th and we are gonna bake a bunch of holiday treats together I'll be doing it here in my kitchen and you will be in yours and I'll do everything with you step-by-step sign up and had a cake accom early bird registration begins tomorrow and it's the cheapest price that can't take will ever be and we have so many camping bundles to help get you ready for an amazing day of baking together hey yo are you done with all those kernels on the cob okay so we're done no excuse me can I ask you a question the corn oh really now I need to make the top of the corn cob which i think is some kind of nub or stuff it's part of a stub I'm sure it has a name please if you know the name let us know below I colored some gum paste a very light natural shade of green and rolled it out then I used a grass piping tip but you imprint the top and use a circle cutter to cut out the appropriate size circle for the top of my corncob then I roll the rest of that green gum paste nice and thin with a non stick board and my non-stick small rolling pin and I use a textured map that I have think about like a blade of grass how it has texture running in one direction and I pressed that onto these thin sheets of gum paste now I'm going to use a sharp paring knife to cut this gum paste into sections that are kind of like jagged and a little bit bigger than the circle I cut out what I want it to look like is this is the remains of leaves I tore off of the corner once I've created a few of these little jagged pieces I glue it all together with some piping gel stacking a few of these torn off leaves and then finally my circle on top and then I add this piece to the top of the corner of the cob again using yellow compound chocolate to glue it on I didn't want to leave out the corn holders for the people who believe in them I don't I think they're necessary I know surprised I'm surprised you should be surprised my favorite rolling pin the one I always used to roll up on him I purposely broke her apart and then placed cake dowels in either side of my rolling pin handle and put them into the corner now she has new life there's no longer a rolling pin she's a giant candy corn on the cob holder leave a hashtag below if you believe in the corn holders corn holders hashtag corn holder down below I know you're ready to dig in and take a bite but hello just butter it to butter my corn on the cob I'm going to create some butter colored butter cream oh I know it's intense just using a combination of two yellows really sparingly a little at a time and once I have the right color I press all of that butter into a bowl and chill it so it's firm they call me mellow yellow just I think I need to do another tape turn the mic up more reverb little 808 okay there's something wrong with my mic again backup I need backup jostle they call me mellow yellow' just once it's firm I then take that bowl and dip it in a little bit of hot water to release my butter cream and then I use a nice sharp knife to cut two squares of butter with the remaining butter like the butter scraps never waste butter I melt the butter cream a little bit in the microwave and then I add my squares of butter on top of the cob as well as some dripping butter because you know as soon as you put butter on corn it melts and it gets into the nooks and crannies I have not used nooks and crannies on this show in a long time you have it and I enjoy nooks and crannies what could be better than butter and in nook and cranny if you liked this video please let me know by hitting that share button and don't forget to subscribe I'll be back on Thursday at 5 p.m. est for a live stream episode of how to keep it why don't we put this over here maybe not you do mean Jeremy or cinnamon bun Oh super princess Alex left this wonderful comment that made us all laugh and then another fan drew up a visual of cinnamon bun Jeremy hashtag cinnamon bun Jeremy 
I made a mistake on camera I know but it's okay yo we all make mistakes you're human welcome back to how to cake it I'm Yolanda and this week I'm making a giant cake pun pencil once I make this giant cake pumpkin so I can write giant lists what's so funny I had two ten inch square chocolate cakes that once leveled I cut into three strips for a total of six strips of chocolate sir squeeze helped me sear up all of my chocolate cake strips and once the syrup soaked in I was ready to move on and fill this cake I'm using pink Italian meringue buttercream to fill this cake I want the pick I'm using pink Italian um I'm using pink Italian meringue buttercream to fill this cake fill my six strips of cake as three different cakes so basically I'm going to put one layer of pink buttercream between two chocolate cake strips and I'm gonna heat this two more times caking rules everything around me cream get the layers oh yeah spread I spread it around y'all gonna add that to my list of challenges laughing I don't remember ice cream challenge the cakes are chilled the buttercream is nice and firm and I'm gonna carve each one of these cakes into a hexagon oh yeah cuz you see how like our cake phone pencils are hexagonal hexagonal so in order to carve my hexagons I'm taking each of these sort of rectangular strip cakes that I have and I need to cut off four corners all along the length because if you cut off off words I thought maybe it's so tricky no it's correct oh I think I did it wrong yeah oh my god it did it wrong I did oh really I did it wrong oh wow okay too bad I'm so mad I can't continue no I don't think I can go on I'm gonna only conduct the interview like this from now on what I'm closed I'm closed when's lunch so now that I have carved my cake incorrectly I'm gonna line all three cakes up together to make one long pencil once I've lined them up I needed to trim and just make sure all the sides were in line with each other and then when I was really happy I pulled them apart and just glued the three cakes together and for a little bit of chocolate ganache now I need to crumb coat this entire cake I am using chocolate ganache just because it has so many angles it has more angles than it needed no because I make youtube videos and this will be online forever so no but it looks so great I know but it's a lie the cake is a lie that you will need eight and then there will be cake I made the chocolate ganache correctly yes I deserve a point check there that's a pro incorrect carving cause the next thing I did was ice the cake again making sure that all eight sides were sharp there should have been six of us I can't look them in the eye or ha is there any way we could just pretend that I'm someone else or so I could just talk about this and anonymously something can you do something there's got to be technology now that my cake is chilling I am going to make the eraser that's the best part of the pencil see I wish I had a cake eraser this eraser will be a whole separate cake a tiny little pink cake that I built from chocolate vanilla and pink vanilla cake it's like a little Neapolitan cake filled them with Italian meringue buttercream and then I crumb coated the outside and chilled the eraser you know what I can't stand when the eraser gets down to the middle okay and you go to image strips of paper that that is annoying once the crumb coat is chill on my eraser cake I'm going to ice it one more time and I'm going to use a bench paper to help me keep the sides nice and straight even though I built an ice this cake upright it will eventually go on inside but I still want it to be nice and round the tip of my pencil I am going to use Rice Krispies but I can mold that or sculpt that into anything that I want and so here I'm doing it like the tip of the pencil it's like an upside down poem I formed my Rice Krispies cone with a dowel in the middle once it's done I'm gonna need to insert that devil into the pencil and make it look like it's you one thing I'm not ready to be shocked by another mistake I don't know who knows now once my rice krispies cone has set and cooled I then crumb coat it with Italian meringue buttercream and chill it and once the crumb coat is chilled I ice it again and chill it no this is my crumb coat and chill dance I want to put the hood on that's how I feel I feel dark inside well all three parts of my cake are chilling being the body of the pencil the eraser and the tip of the pencil I'm going to make the lead for the pencil and I'm gonna make the letters for the pun on my cake pencil to make my lead I used some black fondant I worked in a little bit of CMC just to help stiffen it and then I simply rolled out a quart of fondant around a little Molly pop stick because I want that led to be able to stick out of the pencil are not true you know what I really can't stand when you've dropped your pencil too many times and every time you sharpen it the LED breaks that is so annoying to make my letters I once again worked some CMC into some yellow fondant and then I rolled it nice and thin and I use some quick sticks to cut out go ahead and once I had all my letters and my comma I just set them aside to dry later on now it's time to cover all three parts of my cake for the body of the pencil I colored some fun and pink to match this beautiful pencil and I just need to roll it out and make sure it covers the key I had to roll my fondant on my butcher block but then I had to leave the cake on another table and carry it over because I couldn't think you carry the fondant over and cover it there yes I picked it up on a French rolling pin and quickly draped it over my cake and then I used fondant smoother x' to really smooth the fondant to all eight sides of my cake well you're right there's still too many throw you a bone Yolanda I'm not catching it one two I just started I used a ruler to just press that fun and under and really tuck it under and then I cut away the excess at the top and the bottom or the eraser and the tip of the pencil will go your beautiful beautifully six-sided up I'm sorry I didn't know this year if you like making lists and not making mistakes please share this video with all the other list making friends you have put this on your list share you on this video I love that word it's hot Wow what's happening than a list nothing now that the body of my pencil is covered I'm gonna move on and cover the eraser I darkened my pink fondant that I used on the body of the pencil a little bit so that it matched the eraser even though the eraser cake is small it's quite tall so I knew it would be hard to cover in treats the phone's in over so what I did is I rolled out that fun in a bent and wrapped it around the eraser cake I cut a clean seam at the back and then the fondant that's up over the cake I just sort of smooth dip down and pinched it into the center yes there's like seams and creases but we're gonna do once I chose ah Connie uh we're gonna have to order new cake plan pencils that are octagonal not hexagonal so they'll match my cake and then everything will be right in the world now that the gig is chilled I'm going to make a fondant paste out of my eraser fondant and I'm just gonna fill in those little gaps at the top and use it to really soon the top of the theory's now I need to cover the tip of my pencil and I really tried to think about how I would do this so I have to think about how to recreate this wavy line between the colored portion of the pencil and the roseola wood so what I thought was I would stand my coal rice krispies on top of a glass and this is because I need extra fondant to hang down from it that I can cut into the shape later and then I rolled out my tan colored fondant and much like I covered the eraser I wrapped it around the coat making sure it was longer than the cone and hanging down over the glass I cut a clean seam at the back and I smooth the top leaving a hole where the LED will go now I need to chill this cone really well before I assemble before adding the final details to my pencil I need to assemble all three parts before I assemble the tip of my pencil to the body of my pencil I kind of have to shape the body of the pencil down a bit at the top so I just take a small serrated knife and carve sort of triangles out of it making it a little bit pointy er so that when I add that cone that excess fondant can slip over the cake now I add the cake that will be the tip of my pencil to the body of the pencil and I need to carve this excess tan fondant into this sort of zigzag line I figure out where the cake should we'll sort of up and down in this zigzag line and I carefully cut that out I actually carry like a pad of paper in my purse what a cake punch pencil we have a pencil with this cake punch nine and eye problems put a cake ain't one and neither a list lists aren't one of them now I use my fondant smoother to help smooth down the tip and help my cake look like it's one even though it isn't one I need to add the eraser to the other side of the pencil and because my pencil has a flat side my eraser needs one two with a sharp knife I cut off the end and then I laid it down at the end of my pencil and I just put a little bit of chocolate ganache between a touch help glue it together to make the tip of my pencil look more like wood guess what color I use ivory ivory I mixed some ivory food coloring with clear food grain alcohol and brushed it all over the tan fondant and I made sure to brush in one direction so from the body to where the graphite will go this is me brushing it on each side now I need to make this part of the pencil it's the sort of metal band that folds together with a pencil and the eraser it's very important this piece here I don't know what it's called but it's very important for that I rolled out the same yellow fondant I used to make the letters for the pun on my cake pencil and then I mimicked the pattern that is on this piece which is basically like a whole bunch of lines in the center they go vertically like I said like a pencil to make the land of lines in the center this is great I was really proud of just I lined up two rulers and then I used this rolling pin I have to mark those lines [Music] and then for the other lines I just measured and made sure they were equal distance apart and I used a ruler and a bone tool to create those lines the next thing I need to do is paint that entire band gold before adding it to my cake I mixed gold luster dust with clear food grade alcohol and I painted it as well as my letters I set the letters aside to dry and then I picked up my band and wrapped it around the pencil covering the seam between the eraser and the body of the vessel so we're gonna take a quick second to play a game it's my cake book quiz now I can't tell you guys what any of the cakes are my upcoming cake book because it's a big secret but maybe you can guess baran throw up the picture can you guess leave a comment below and let me know if you can guess what this case is and don't write cake all the cakes will be revealed on October 24th when my cake book comes out but for now you can pre-order my cake book and how to keep it calm you can order it internationally you know what this is just a pencil right now it's not a cake pun pencil it's time to add the letters to my pencil I flip them all over I brush a little bit of clear piping gel to the back of each letter and the comma and then I line them up on top of my pencil oh there you are go ahead so as a final touch to this pencil you know what it needs graphite the ability to write right now it's just a wooden stick I just insert it inside and now you can make a giant list if you like lists as much as I do why are you laughing Jeremy leave a hashtag below lists are fun and be the first to ever use that hashtag please subscribe to this channel share this video and to all my VIPs I hope you enjoy it please lose the video that I sent you straight to tears if you need actual take one pencils to write all your lists they are available at how to keep calm along with this hoodie it's a fan favorite and it's back in stock for a limited time I want to see them all go ahead don't do a pencil just take it take it to the limit well oh I do have eyeballs that I'd like to keep Justin thank you 99 problems but a cake King now how I should actually do this because I write music wow I read lists all the time out and maybe this I feel like this has gone in the style this is very helpful when was that in style 
welcome to Gigot I'm Yolanda now as most of you know I'm not exactly a nature buff but I do know that the Easter Bunny leaves Cadbury cream eggs thanks to Cadbury for supporting and collaborating with me on this video this is a Maitre seen on insert like tweeting birds Teresa's Easter Bunny cake I have baked six a vanilla cake that I dyed pink I'm pretty sure the Easter Bunny is pink on the inside I've removed them from their parents levels them and cut the carmelization at the bottom of all of the cakes now third squeeze a lot is here while he was here so I pulled him I will come up I was a drawer and asked him to simple clear up all the cakes with me here is a fun nature fact the Easter Bunny now lays four flavors of crematoria Chips Ahoy caramel and of course the original cream eight I'm going to chop up all four flavors of cream egg to take this cake to melt-in-your-mouth status [Music] I'm staffing this cake by layering it with Italian meringue buttercream and my chopped cream eggs if you are in the mood to bake this spring like I am Who am I kidding i'ma make every season I have more Easter videos and more spring themed videos in this playlist right here orhan maybe like the addition of a light rain fall once I'm done layering and filling my cake I place it in the fridge to chill until the buttercream is nice and firm I've got to get this cake looking like the Easter Bunny so I use a sharp serrated knife to start to form the body of Easter Bunny nature fact the Easter Bunny's body actually has the shape of an egg are you taking notes jocelyn use your laptop there will be a quiz I'm actually adding all this Wikipedia Oh perfect once I'm happy with the shape of the Easter Bunny's body I take my reserved cake layer cut it in half and carve two [Music] it's time to crumb coat and chill Krakow and you know you know what I feel like at the end of 2016 I made a promise to not sing 2017 and I just broke my promise I'm going to stop now I love using my smaller spatulas both straight and offset when icing or crumb coating novelty cakes these spatulas feature wooden handles and would come from nature Wow another fascinating fastest now that the crumb coat has chilled I'm going to ice my cakes one more time keeping the body and the feet separate at this point now for all the recipes you need to make this cake there's a playlist with some great videos right here this Easter Bunny is missing some vital parts so I make two recipes of my sculpting rice cereal mixture to create his head his two arms his tail and his two sides when I make my rice cereal mixture for sculpting I choose to leave out the butter completely I really just want the cereal and the marshmallow and be able to sculpt it and condense it into any shape that I like i sculpt the rest of the Easter Bunny's features by hand making sure that his two arms and two thighs yes I've hurt an equal size no and I don't mean that his farm the simple life I mean he's two arms with big sized you guys are the same son here's a nature fast arms and thighs don't look alike make sure when sculpting with rice cereal mixture you want to put some shortening on your hands a so that it doesn't stick and it makes it easier to handle and you really want to compress the mixture as you so nature fact number I'm going to say eight the Easter Bunny has some very fit size topping is the new squatting you should see his leg I'm jealous I'm going to start hopping once all of the Easter Bunny parts that you've sculpted have firmed up you need to ice them to get the buttercream in all the nooks and crannies and give them a smoother surface it's time to cover everything in white fondant before I assemble all these parts to make an Easter lemon I start by covering the body and the seat I roll out my fondant to about a quarter of an inch thick drape it over the body and then smooth it all around it can be kind of tricky because about is quite tall you want to make sure to smooth all the way down pushing out any air I truly the excess fondant from the base of the body wrapping it underneath when covering the arms size and tail I need to get the fondants all the way around each part so I roll my fondant and drape it over as I usually do but then I pick up each part I hold a soft sponge in my hand so that I won't dent them and then I just gather my excess fondant on the top pinching it together and then cutting away the excess with a sharp knife before covering the head I need to place it on a small round board this will help when assembling the Easter Bunny now I roll out more white fondant drape it over smooth it all around and then yeah I flip these two bunnies head gather this on it towards the board and cut off the excess around the board I'm going to turn all these parts into an Easter Bunny it's like your mother nature yes so I placed the feet you know an equal distance from each other so she looks like she has good posture and then I take the thighs and place them on top gluing them with some royal icing you want to hold them in place for a bit just to make sure they have started to set first I make a pilot hole in the bunny's head sorry bunny then I placed my sharpened dowel into the cake body and place the head on top right to the devil there he is he's got a head it's got no face yet before I move on to the arms I want to sort of clean up the seams between the seats eyes and body so I take some royal icing connection pipe it into the scene then I use a damp paintbrush and just sort of smooth that royal I think so that everything looks like one so another nature fascist you see bunny so happy no Easter bunnies have seen other bunnies don't wear things you tell them oh I get it [Laughter] arms I am adding arms I just on put arms across the screen in bold and you know something subtle I'm adding the arms to the bunny on either side of his head using royal icing to attach them and I did use a couple of lollipop sticks at the base of the arm to help secure them to the cake now are they on either side of his father cause they're on his body on either side of his head to be clear the Easter Bunny's have tails with a little Cottontail I add it to the back again with a lollipop stick and some royal icing and I do there's no seam the truth of sale and the body so I use my royal icing technique once again [Music] it makes is funny features I'm rolling out some white black gray and pink fondant nice and thin and I'm using piping tips a variety of cutters and a template for his belly nature fact Easter Bunny's has pink feminists for his eyes I used oval cutters for the main shape and then I eat piping tips to make his pupils and a little catch light [Music] so his mouth I used a large heart cutter and then I sort of cut off rounded off the tips that had this little you know I formed his little pink nose by hand it's kind of like a little triangle an upside-down triangle softens little eat little you just want to him [Music] I lay my template onto pink fondant cut out the shape of his belly and glue it onto the surface of the cake with a little bit of water during a scintilla water one of the two I know I've been giving you facts throughout this whole video but this one's mind boggling the Easter Bunny wears a bow his bow is actually quite similar to the color of my t-shirt I wore it in honor of the Easter Bunny the one and only is she funny you should make the flow in advance because it needs to set up but all you have to do is roll out some the Tiffany's use gum paste nice and plain and then cut two equal bands then working quickly use a sharp paring knife to slay 84 the bands at either end working one band at the time gather each and together pinching the gum piece together and then loop the two pinched end over to meet each other and secure them together with a little bit of piping gel once your bow is dry we can add it to the Easter Bunny add 1 bowl loop at a time piping on a little bit of royal icing to the back of the loop place it onto the bunny on one side and if you feel you want a little bit of extra support you can actually take a toothpick and Pierce it underneath the bow it's like surgery it is funny Serge I'm also the Easter running back been using the Saints Tiffany blue gum paste roll out a little band that you can use to cover the middle part of the bow making it look like it was tired right around his neck [Music] the other gumpaste feature you need to make ahead of time is years I actually was joking that he looks a bit like a white seal for a tizzy is she really fair he says he just look so sweet and yeah he did to make my gum paste years I start by rolling out a rectangle of white gum paste then I cut that rectangle in half and I lay a floral wire down the middle of one of those bands of gum paste then I played the other band of gum paste right on top I smelled up a dumb peach by using my fondant rolling pin to just roll over it and sandwich those two pieces together now using a bunny ear template that I cut out myself I place it on top of the gum paste making sure that the wire is down the center and cut out the ear so what I do is take the exposed wire and insert it down into a styrofoam cake gently allowing your to drive through the snapping appropriately upside down besides the cake coming once my ears are dry I want to add a little pink detail like mine to the inside of his ears I simply took the same template I used to cut out the ears and cut it a bit smaller and then I laid it onto some thinly rolled out pink fondant with jane fonda - fretted belly cut out the inner ear shapes and glued it onto each year with a little bit of clear piping gel [Music] remember to Easter bunnies head was made out of rice cereal treats so through a little bit hard-headed if you know what I mean I use a toothpick to make the holes into his head where I will place the wire because if you use the wire it might Bend or not make it all the way through now this is planning has ears I use my royal icing techniques just to clean up the scene the final detail this bunny needs Whitsun I made myself a little template where's my last template because I felt that the bunny whisker hold either cheek should be equal so I took a little round piece of parchment paper and drew a pattern of dots and then I laid back over my bunny on each cheek and you depend to mark out those dots and finally I'm not going to lie making these whiskers was not fun we twister is a floral wire wrapped in gray fondant and then rolled out to get it thin and smooth as you can that was not tiring at all [Music] [Music] to make the scene true to nature I wanted to display the Easter Bunny in his natural habitat so I added some paper grass and some cream eggs I going left it up to add some glam to some of these cream eggs wait a minute I haven't told him his name his name is Bartholomew did he tell you that in private yes he whispered it to me when I was meddling him when we were nose nuzzling if you want to learn more about nature you have come to the wrong place but if you want to learn more about taste please subscribe to this channel I am trying to reach three million and hit the notification though that you know when I have a freshly baked dish thanks again to Cadbury for supporting and collaborating with me on this video follow me

[Laughter] 
welcome back to how to kick it happy yo-yo day in honor of this day I am making a yo-yo case for my yo-yo yo-yo makes a yo-yo for her yo-yo but before we get started on the cake I need you to listen up really quickly because I have a giveaway alert we've dropped around the world are taking part in yo-yo day just the list of sweet shops in the description below and if you go into one of them today and say happy yo-yo day you look at something sweet happy day ignore Jeremy sighs Jeremy how do you say it oh that sounds like really happy day to make this yo-yo cake for my yo-yos I began by making 16 pounds of my vanilla cake batter that I died a lovely marbled yellow and pink and in one of the cakes I died teal and now I need to begin to build the three parts of the yo-yo we turn the bottom part of the yo-yo the middle part where the string goes and then the top part of the yo-yo for the top and bottom I use my marble pink and yellow vanilla cake two of the layers i level completely slapped and removed all the carmelization on the sides there my remaining two pink and yellow marbles cakes I simply skin off a little bit of the top so it's flat then I flip them over and remove the carmelization to the bottom and then I remove the carmelization from this size slip them back over and began to trim and carve my dome shape it's kind of similar to what I did last week with my version metal if these cakes that still have a hump and are now a nice rounded little dome will be the top and bottom of my yo-yo for one of the domes that's going to be the top of my yo-yo cake I'm going to create a little indent where these logo will go to do this I use a six inch circle cutter and I press it down lightly in the center at the top of my cake then I use my serrated knife to cut right through the cake and remove that circle later on I will attach that little edge bit of butter I used to squeeze a lot to shower all five of my cakes with simple syrup and let it soak in keep in mind any other tools I'm using on this cake that we sell at Habakkuk is calm will be on sale this week in honor of my beautiful yo-yos and that includes thirsty he wants his own channel called to have a simple syrup it and I said I don't think that's sustainable doesn't a bit upset very insightful you it is time to fill and stack my marbled vanilla cakes so I'm going to begin by filling one of the completely leveled layers and putting a domed one on top and then I'm going to repeat this one more time on the second marble cake staff remember I have that edge that's not attached so I'm going to gently gently lift it up and then I'm just going to sort of crumb coat a thin layer of buttercream on top and add the edge back and now it's sister now I crumb coat all three of these cakes and chip for the crumb coat and chill dance this week I yo-yo will attempt to kill ya free yes keep watching because I have a big announcement this is these of a big announcement and you believe never even seen me do these hands see that everyone's in on it Jeremy alright my crumbs are a child it is time to ice [Music] it can be tricky to ice a dome because once you set rounded it so Isis screwed as you can and we will work out the riches I use a combination of a small offset and fall straight spatulas to Isis I need to address the flat underside of both my donkey because we will see inside the yo-yo unlike the methanol so what I do is I flip both of these cakes very carefully because they are ice and then I give them a light spreading of Italian meringue buttercream with a small offset spatula I decided to make my yo-yo teal so I roll out some of that fondant nice and thin making sure it's a little bigger than the diameter of the flat side of each of my cakes i draped the fondant on top smooth it quickly and then quickly flip the cake back Oh what am i doing and then quickly now I use the tip of my sharp paring knife to trim it all that excess fondant that is sticking out some cake so the recipes you'll need to make this cake my simple syrup my vanilla cake and my Italian meringue buttercream don't forget there's a Yoos recipe box playlist right here I wish I did like right here I'm not going on America's Got Talent now that I put my case back I need to touch up the icing because we did flip them so might have been a little bumped in three but don't worry just touch it oh yeah I think we got it a nap there big thing here or on pause the cake footage press pause on whatever machine you do to edit it's time for the big announcement there's going to be a how to take it I even thought I would be on YouTube I always wanted to Facebook and I wanted to color the casebook if without a cookbook I don't think you've written I think you taste a casebook well I have cake the cake book yeah I have caked a cake book do you know why it's because of all of you fabulous yo-yo well that's why that's why the publishers were ringing our doorbell that's true well they called us yeah they didn't come over and this is the same secret project that some of the replicate winners work will be featured that's right some of your cakes will be in my case book it is our way of saying thank you for helping to make this happen this is my dream come true back to cake time to cover the domed size in the same teal fondant I measure my case as usual from the bottom of one side up over the top then I roll out my teal fondant to a diameter that's a little bigger than the measurement drape it over the cake with a French rolling pin and use my hands and a fondant rulers to fuse it all around this thing for the domed cake that has a little indent we're going to do exactly the same thing but realize that a lot of air will be cost underneath that indent so you want to keep a straight pin handy you can make some small incisions or pokes to release that air and you want to do that first before you start smoothing so drape the fondant over release some air at the edges or where you know it will be covered by your sticker later and just smooth the inside of that with the inside of your finger or the rounded part of your service now it's time to cover the teal cake that is the center of our yo-yo which is called select string holder from my middle teal cake I am going to roll out a band of white fondant a little bit bigger than the circumference of that cake and wrap it around the cake cut a clean seam with my paring knife I'm going to trim the top edge flush to the cake by holding my paring knife flat against the cake and going all the way around if you like novelty cakes I have other playlists with food cakes and character cakes make sure to check them out right over here I'm going to attempt the union I need to create the string for the yo-yo because without a string what is it oh yo that's a deep thought for today it's like I'm nothing without my yo-yos like it just makes it know to create my string I used a clay extruder I just softened some white fondant with vegetable shortening set it into my claims shooter and I used the largest circle face plate and then I bun out a few bands of string quite a bit I think I use my key to bend the string I began to wrap them around the cake attaching the strings with some clear piping gel and it took me three layers of string wrapped around the cake and then I did another two kind of in between I might need more string once I assemble the cake so I'm just going to keep this fondant in my place shooter handy finally I wanted to create a logo that would look like a sticker on the top using myself on a rolling pin I rolled out a little bit of white fondant a little bit of pink fondant and black fondant and then I created a circle I just placed a bowl upside down on top because I checked that it was the same circumference as we invent and then I cut out the words I heart five million because I do and I placed the letters on the circle and added that circle team since [Music] it's time to assemble this yo-yo the first thing I do is clip the domed teal tape of out the indent because that's the bottom of the yo-yo now here is where I see that you can see the scenes  wanna see the you want to see this meeting about to see a scene time to remove my teal cake with a string wrapped around and place is gently in the very center of that yoga oh no that's a very simple - yes but why is woman so string layer on top of the upside down dome okay now I want to address the seam that you can see on the bottom of the yo-yo where you about that seen Yolanda I'm going to cover it with strength and what I did is I just continued with that wrap around and instead wrapped it right around covering the scene because yo-yos unravel this string needs to end in a loop because that's for you well try to loosen a yo-yo onto your finger and yoyo so I just use again another cord of fondant and I wrap it over in a loop and then I cut a small piece and wrap it over the scene so it looks like I'm not I'm adding the final cake don't side up yay now I'm going to add the loop so we can yo yo this yo yo so I add a loop attaching it again with clear piping gel and I wanted it to sort of fall down from the looks from below is an easy question but it was easy is to talking about it that's another easy serving yo-yos this one's for you well they're all for you but this one especially is dedicated to you don't forget to go and get your free sweet treat today check the description below for all the shops participating or I'm throwing that cake book's cover again I look better on the cover than I do right now just put in from marketing somebody was there to do my hair blue Anika thank you for watching please subscribe and hit that notification bell I will be here again okay have not been a good prop 
you're watching how to kick it I'm Yolanda and this week I am making a highly requested cake which is a strong thank you for your help guys your strawberries can also know what Walter I said it if you really love fruits with eyeballs or cakes that look like fruit please share this video you know Walter I gotta give him credit he's one of the most shared videos that we have this is a jumbo prize-winning strawberry because I baked 16 pounds of vanilla cake hide and yes I know strawberries are red inside but I wanted it to pop I level them and cut the caramelize ation off the bottom I also cut each one of my four cakes into two players so now I have eight layers of pink cake mmm this is your job I'm just trying to show you what you should be doing something like that now so squeeze has to help me simple syrup all of these layers of cake they're squeezed a lot is available at how to kake.com along with my summertime bundle which includes a summertime sketch book for all of your cake goals a unicorn ten to sketch them out with and a set of four temporary but yes there is a tattoo with you and I'm not wearing it what are you looking at while my simple syrup is soaking in I'm going to take this opportunity to make strawberry buttercream to make my strawberry buttercream I simply washed a bunch of strawberries cut off the green top and then I put them in a food processor and pureed them and once I had a nice puree I ran it through a sieve just to try and get out some of the pulp and a few of the seeds it's actually impossible to get rid of all because of CD your more CD than he is now that I'm having with my puree and it's been strained it's time to add it to some Italian meringue buttercream I did also add a little bit of pink food coloring just to brighten up the color well since so now sense of cell these eight layers of pink cake with my pink strawberry butter thing I used an offset spatula to fill my cake layers with strawberry buttercream and then stack the next layer on top and repeat I then use the straight spatula just to clean up any better scene that has oozed out the side [Music] and now it's ten children once my buttercream is nice and chilled I remove my cake from the fridge and then I'm going to cut one side of the cake off because I want to create a flat side that will then become the bottom now time to carve a strawberry a giant strawberry so I had a model your friend is Romanian she was incredible she was also delicious yo sorry she was gonna go bad for the body of the strawberry the first thing I did to my cake was carve a diagonal line I wish I had carved it a bit steeper but it all worked out for the top of the cake I wanted to round out all around where the stem would grow and I even use a small serrated knife to cut inside creating like an indent sort of like a little valley shallow valley where the stem grows in the leaves grow then I took that slice of cake that I cut off and I place it on the end of the strawberry to elongate it no strawberry is the same you can't really go wrong you know what I mean why would you don't cut it into a square it's still going to look like a strawberry what is that Walter Walters telling me they do make square watermelons yes I know Walter where does this go in Japan when it's young they put like a glass box then as it grows yes since in law I'm happy with my strawberry so I'm going to crumble it I made a little more buttercream that was just died I want all pink inside this strawberry but I don't want the seeds on the outside and one of my buttercream for the crumb coat to be smooth but I still wanted it to be pink so I died a little more buttercream pink with the same food coloring I used in the strawberry buttercream and Crown coated and chilled my strawberry once my grandpa was chilled I iced the strawberry one more time with that same pink buttercream I want it just to have a nice smooth surface allophones consistently all of this Walter's just staring at you very angrily hear what you say watermelons have like an extreme level of anger I might have to take a watermelon out of this kitchen don't be the first time I'm going to take the opportunity to make my giant strawberry seeds while my cake is chilling I took my gum paste I rolled tubes of gum paste accords with gum paste and then I used a ruler to cut even measurement so that I'd have the same amount and then I basically just rolled a little ball with my finger on my palm and then pinched the end to make it more of like a strawberry seed shape and then I made 430 here was that so respect oh my god I have to tell Jeremy though there's the laughing calm down he was more [Music] for everything I made I lost ten brain cells my palm was chased gymnast Oh Natalya now that I'm done making a whole bunch of seeds I'm going to cover this cake I rolled out red fondant large enough and then I picked it up with a French rolling pin draped it over my jumbo strawberry and began to smooth it with my all-around tucking underneath just making it look like a gorgeous jumbo strawberry when I'm swimming fondant on a cake that has a very natural shape like this one I do tend to prefer this image a smoother is great when there's any sort of straight edge but using a smoother here I'd run the risk of putting like lines into my fondant because it is so flat so using my hands is really helpful it also helps me tuck with on and underneath the strawberry as best I can my strawberry looks great already but it's a little bit matte I don't find many matte fruits do you I used red food coloring and some clear food grade alcohol and I painted the entire outside of my strawberry with this red paint just to ripen it up the next thing I need to do is make all the little indents that hold the seat know I can't just press the seat on you literally may be a bad word Jocelyn Racine is embedded Jeremy and I every time I make a cake we find ourselves going down the Google hole so Jeremy Google's about strawberries are you ready for this what are you into this the seeds on a strawberry are actually a bunch of ovaries on the outside oh my gosh wish I never what does that mean exactly no I use the ball to land a veining tool to create things in them the ball to make the rounder top part of the indent and then the veining tool to make it come to a point at the bottom and I did is I made myself a little knot a template but I cut out a little square of paper because they seem to be in a diamond formation but like seed seed seed seeds so I cut out a little square of paper to help me sort of space so I would never put them too close or too far from each other and if that didn't take any time at all right Jeremy just whip through it it was like I want to paint the surface of this cake once again for two reasons I want to enhance the color one more time and if the surface is wet it'll be easier to add my feet so I just reconstitute the same things I used before I don't even know if reconstituted like I Jeremy it's be constant hold on restore something dried especially food to its original state by adding water to it because the pain has dried up a bit I mean is that more liquid and reconstituted give her the dirty water remember he's always looking at me you look at Joslin there yes so looking at you once I'm happy with my coat of paint I'm going to add the seeds to every single indent yep we do all go in one direction which I admire so that's what I would do like if I wore you know four hundred and fifty five cents on the outside of the body I would make sure they were in one direction [Music] oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh do you know what this part of the strawberries called please see how the leaves are all one yeah so it remind you of anything perched on a test something we reference on the channel a lot because Queen Paragon all around yes cool it's a crown to make the crown I'm using green gum paste and then I made myself a template the kind of looks like HP now I need to roll out my green gum paste and lay my paper template on top and then I use a sharp paring knife to cut out that shape I don't I don't get it like older things are one way but then early aren't the same time I don't think nature mother nature is your zero I really like her but I don't think she does the next thing I need to do is insert some wire into each so I cut lengths of wire and I inserted them from the tip of the leaf just down the body avoids I don't want the wire to reach all the way to the center of the Daisy I just want something that will help me manipulate the sort of the way the leaf lays on the strawberries once it's off the next thing I'm going to do is use an impression map that I have and just create some texture on Lotus's I just don't want them to look flat and cartoon the next thing I need to do is paint please leave so I'm using some dry color dust in green and yellow to give my green gum paste a more realistic natural color and some texture really adds to the texture then I swipe my entire green gum paste Daisy over and make that same texture impression on the others so I paint one side of it with the DVLA then I flip it over and do the other side with some of my Dutch process cocoa and the reason I did this is sorry guys but often your leaves look like a little bit dirty or bruised as if people have just been picking you up by me you know the next thing I need to do is pick this entire gum peas Daisy up and a fix this in my cake so first brush the little valley on the top of your strawberry cake which - jack then pick up the Daisy as quickly as you can and place it in the center as I went along I use dabs of piping gel and then I dent each leaf and place it however I wanted it to look on the strawberry cake I'm glad it worked out I was convinced that great one if that wasn't scary enough I'm going to repeat that whole process one more time making another big Daisy and place it on my cake this time trying to aim these eight leaves between the ones I've already chosen so now the strawberry has a nice full crown the average strawberry I counted the leaves I've had 13 a warning we were shocked like if somebody's dog here in the street and says hey how many leaves in strawberry have you would have not guessed their type a 5 yeah no it's a lot more than fun I never really noticed them so I just want to eat orange for not noticing and on the ovary now I find when I buy strawberries they always like cut the stem right down to nothing but I like when you get those strawberries with the stem or have you ever got strawberry picking anyway yes I have yeah so I wanted to make a stem on my strawberry cake so what I did is I just used a little more of my green gum paste rolled it into a cord and then I took another floral wire folded it in half and twisted it just for a bit more strength inserted it into my stem very carefully I added a bit of texture using my mat once again and then I inserted that stem into the top center of the crown and don't forget if you like giant fruit cakes please make sure to share this video there's a button below guys I really wanted to make a strawberry cake for my new cake book that's coming out that you can pre-order now but you guys have requested it so much on YouTube that I really felt this amount here besides Walter wouldn't have it yep Walters in the book but there are also 20 new cakes that you have never seen in the book along with Walter if you want to preorder my cake book I would really appreciate that there are links below so that you can pre-order in Canada and the US and we will be updating everyone on how to get it internationally very soon Walter we're going to see you right around the world 
I guess I don't even need to intro this case guess what I'm thinking big banks - Wow wait for collaborating with me on this video and thank you Mia you have been an amazing model much better than a water non-leap the hashtag fingerlings below is one of these monkeys is on your holiday wishlist which one of these do you want click the link below to meet them all they're very happy about it to make my Mia fingerling cake I baked 10 pounds of my ultimate vanilla batter and I fold it in some purple sprinkles before baking I removed them all from their pens leveled them and cut the carmelization off the bottom I'm making Mia but way bigger I'm making mama Mia now that my cakes are all leveled of course they're squeezes coming in to help me simple syrup them all the next thing I want to do is stack two separate cakes with chocolate ganache spread in between one of my cakes was six inches in diameter and the other one was five inches in diameter I like to use chocolate ganache when I'm really worried about structure it's a lot stronger buttercream it's also delicious once they're stacked and filled I chill the cakes to get ready to carve I first begin carving my 6 inch round cake and I want to recreate the lower half of Mia's body once I'm happy with her shape I then take out my 5 inch round cake place it on top as I was carving the top part of Mia's body I realized it was a little too narrow so thankfully I had an extra 6 inch cake that I worked into the body and I think I'm gonna end up chopping off a bit of the 5 inch cake I just want to make sure that I get her just right yeah when you look at camera there you go you know what though I don't want her to be alone [Music] once I'm happy with the shape of Mia's body I need to spread some ganache on that extra 6-inch layer that I added so that it will stick to the other layers now I need to secure this cake with dowels and boards so it's actually two cakes that make up one body dowels and boards aren't important because when a cake gets too high it can collapse on itself and Mia no offense but you have a large head which means this cake needs extra stability I am going to place one whole dowel down through her body just just oh I'm sorry just to secure her to the board because her body kind of leans forward yeah she's like that Bronco and chill hey Mia crumb coat and chill now that my crumb coat is chilled I need to ice Mia's body once again and chill it you've been asking us for cake compilation videos and we have been doing that over on our new channel how to cake it step-by-step we'll put a link right here and below please head over there and subscribe watch the videos share the videos we really appreciate it now we're moving on to Rice Krispies I'm basically making me as giant head and her two legs and two arms out of sculpting Rice Krispies she's she's just chilling you know yeah I said Rice Krispies I make my sculpting rice krispies mixture which basically leaves out the butter and the vanilla for her head I've decided to press it into some egg pens I have to recreate the oval shape now eggs are not oval so good thing I have four of them and what I did is press my mixture just into the bottom half of four different egg pens once the mixture has firmed up in the pans I use my serrated knife to level them in the pen just like I would do any sphere cake then I tap out the molded rice krispies and I use a serrated knife to cut them all to the same width so I used my fabric measuring tape making sure I was cutting them all at the exact same measurement now I need to glue two quarters together to get two halves of an oval basically the front and the back of Mia's face katia and in order to glue them together I am using some melted white compound chocolate it's just nice and strong I'm just gonna set those aside because I need to make her arms and her legs here's where it gets tricky I have to make her arms first so what I do is I mold and sort of condense the Rice Krispies sculpting mixture into the shape of her arm her arms like a little bit bent I'm going to let this mixture set up for a bit and move on to making Mia's legs see she's always ready to grip see these bent legs that's muscle Mia has some look at her calves look at them [Music] once I'm happy with this oh I'm boring look at that look she's asleep I think he's making fun of your Kate process yeah really you know what you were difficult you were difficult now it's time to perfect the shape of Mia's arms and legs so for this I'm using a small serrated knife and I'm just carving the arms and legs the same way I would you can carve sculpting Rice Krispies it feels different than carving cake but it's really great and the same rule applies carve little by little you don't want to cut away too much all of the recipes I'm using in this cake as well as some great tips for sculpting with rice krispies are in my cake book when you purchase my cake book or a cake but bundle and how to cake it calm you get a free holiday ebook it's happening this week only and it's our gift to you we also have some gift cards which are great because they don't require shipping so head over to had a cake is calm i'm democratic quote all of my rice krispies pieces and chill them is that funny bronco once my crown got his chills i'm going to ice all of my pieces again and chill it's time to move on to fondant and the first part i want to cover is me as I roll my purple fondant into a sheet large enough to cover me his body and then as fast as I can just some action in this episode Joslyn I pick it up by the two top corners and I whip it around her body like that oh it was that fast it was fun it with me yeah welcome to fondant whipping and then I cut away the excess from the bottom I cut a clean seam down the back and I just smooth the fondant over the top which is sort of like her neck and cutaway XS guys are you ready for a bond that whip whip it whip that fondant we're just monkeying around right guys who wants the fondant wet now I'm moving on to covering the two halves of Mia's head so at my two oval Rice Krispies pieces I'm just rolling on my purple fondant draping it on top and then cutting away the excess from the base now on one of the halves I want to leave a little excess fondant so later on when I press them together I have a bit of fondant to smooth over and meet the other it's time to cover the arms and the legs so I just roll out my fondant drape it over each part and then I flip that part over onto a sponge just so I don't flatten it on the table and just sort of press the fun and over cutting away the excess you don't want it to be thick underneath but you want to try and cover the majority of it I need to make means ears which are very like the standout you know it's her standout feature you're welcome I have cut like a template of the shape of her ear out of a piece of cardboard making sure that it's not only the shape of her ears but they sort of come to a point because that cardboard is gonna live between the two halves of her head I used a flesh-colored 50/50 for me as ears colored with what food coloring dress she's learning 50/50 is 50% gum paste and 50% fondant because I wanted it to be sturdier for everything that I'm making out of this color the next thing I did was brushed some clear piping gel on the back part of the cardboard ears and then rolled out some of my 50-50 laid it on top flip those pieces over and trimmed away the excess now I need to cover the top and I roll the 50/50 a little bit thicker to cover the top of the ears and then what I did was I used a small sphere pen to sort of texture that year I wanted it to be is it concave like a little bit and now I trim away the excess 50/50 and just sort of smooth it over the back and then I place the ears aside to dry so in order to create the pour that Nia is gonna sit on I used an old turntable I had and I stacked two cake boards on the top and then I had Jeremy drill a hole through so that I could place the rolling pin down through the board and still leave the handle up so now I need to move Mia's body over to this rolling pin fantastic board I also thought be really weird to recreate like a giant finger I feel like after making a giant a leg I'm like I'm good on body parts for a little while now that Mia's body is in the correct place I'm actually going to remove the rolling pin because I need to add her fleshy belly so I rolled out some more of my flesh colored 50/50 really thin and then I just used an oval template that I made cut it out to brush some clear piping gel on the back and laid her belly on to her belly [Music] now that her belly is in place I'm going to place my rolling pin back on the board I need to figure out how to secure her limbs to her body as well as the rolling pin once I figure out where I want them placed I make a mark on my rolling pin on either side where I need Jeremy to drill and then he trotted off and drill four holes into my rolling pin if you shot off you didn't it really did travel you traveled I also try to sort of curve the ends where it meets her body so it looks more natural to secure the legs to the body and the rolling pin I'm using a 1/8 of an inch thin wooden dowel and I'm gonna cut it to the appropriate links and so there'll be a dowel at the back of the leg that goes through the leg and the body and then a dowel at the front of the leg that goes into the drill rolling pin I know that was on your bucket list you drill into a rolling pin check how to cake it bringing you new opportunities and life experiences it's time to move on to her arms which is a little bit trickier because while they're not resting on a board like her legs are but I use the same technique I figure out where I'm going to place them and then I use the 1/8 of an inch dowels to secure them to her body and the room as you guys know these cakes take a long time so that's why I'm wearing this after this we're getting cake to you because I deserve a slice of cake this is the T for the cake T Club this month and right now we are having a sale on the Cape T Club membership over at acacia calm you get a new t sweatshirt or apron every single month plus a surprise gift and a note from me to make me his hands and feet I again I'm using my flesh colored 50/50 and I just mold them by hand i mold the basic shape of her hands and then I use an knife to cut her fingers and separate them and my fingertips to just sort of round and shape each finger did I did I make the hands in no did I make the hands apply them and then make the feet apply them yes Thank You Cody I attach them to my cake with some toothpicks as dowels so I inserted the toothpicks into the Rice Krispies arms and then piped on a little royal icing and attached the hands to the edge of the arm and the bowling pin so they're like wrapped these are hand molded hands the next thing I do is mold the feet with my feet [Music] that's nasty hmm but that could be a channel so I molded her feet with my hands as well and then the same matter that I molded for hands and then I attached them to her body in the same way it's time to recreate me as cute little face and for this I'm using my flesh coloured 50:50 once again I roll it out and I made a template of the shape of her face which is kind of like a heart you'd like it it's kind of heart shaped I lay that on to my 50/50 and cut out that shape I need to recreate her nose and mouth area and for that area I'm rolling out my 50/50 again and I'm just using my rolling pin to roll down because I'm trying to create an oval that is like a dome yes I use an oval cutter to cut out a perfect oval and I'm not quite happy with the sides they're still too straight so again I adjust it with my rolling pin curving down and using my cutter until I'm happy I use more oval cutters just making an indent of the outline of her nose and her smile and then I used a pointed sculpting tool to create her nostrils hey I feel like I've created a lot of nostrils last week you know I'm old nostrils with my nostrils Mia's eyes are nice and deeply set into her face which makes them perfect for slow links so what I do is use a circle cutter to cut out for socket I was feel weird when I have to use those words like she's so adorable and I'm like I cut out her eye sockets but that's what I did I wanted to mold her eyeballs to also be doing shape now normally I use a spoon for this but it is too deep so what I use are these tiny little sphere pens I have I just greased the inside with a bit of shortening and pressed in some black fondant and then I used the straight end of a rolling pin to press it down so it's still a dome but not super high I then placed those pans into the fridge to let that black fondant chill I need to assemble Mia's head mia has to become one with herself now so the first thing I need to do is lay the back half of her oval head down onto a sponge before I add Mia's ears to her head I lay them down and lay one half of her head on top so I can make sure that I cut away in mouth 50/50 so her ears will fit perfectly alongside her head actually the hadn't cake it Hadi helped me out in this episode not only did he open the fridge for me several times Thank You Orhan he also when I glued one of Mia's ears on her head was like imbalanced so he leant his hand and held her ear in place while I glued on the other ear see that oh yeah Mia I told you I have a posse as well before I glue both halves of this head together I just want to make a pilot hole for the dowel that is extending out of Mia's body so what I want to do is take my dowel and just sort of press out it's like you're kind of Shaving away some of the Rice Krispies that way I'll just be able to slide her head right down you want to make sure to cut away the lip of fondant that's over her ears just so that we can see them clearly once the chocolate has set and the ears are in place it's time to add the top half of Mia's head to her head it's time for Mia's cute face to be added to her head right now she's just a head with ears she has a face I removed her face from the fridge and I brushed the back with some clear piping gel then I place it on her head and just smooth it down because her head is rounded so you want to just gently press that 50/50 down Mia also needs eyelids so I rolled out a piece of my - College fifty-fifty nice and thin and then I glued two bands of it to the tops of each eyeball and then I just used the sharp tip of my knife to cut away the excess and once again I used a circle cutter to perfect the shape [Music] finally I brushed some more piping gel into her empty sockets at the moment and add her eyeballs with her eyelids I want to attach her nose and mouth for this I feel like I need a bit of support so I insert some toothpicks into the rice krispies head and then brush on some piping gel and add the nose and mouth now I can add her head to her body and make her complete so I'm just going to line up that pilot hole in the bottom of her head with the dowel sticking out from her body and slowly bring it down Mia's head does have a seam but I wasn't quite happy with the seam on top of my head so what I did was use my clay extruder to just extrude a little sort of semicircle cord of the purple fondant and laid it over her scene just to clean it up you're welcome do you see how cute Mia's tail is of course I could not leave that out so I used the remaining part of my purple fondant rolled out a thick cord that slightly rounded at the end and then I curled her tail up over one leg and attached the back I'm sorry oh yeah that's what I did and now for her hair for Mia's hair I used white cotton candy all I want to say is thank goodness it's the holidays because I can't find it at any other time of year thank you again to WoW me for

welcome back to Attica KITT I'm Yolanda and since we're gearing up for the summer edition of Camp cake I've decided to make a giant more pink you need some more floor please dispose of this channel and don't forget to hit the notifications l so you'll know when I faked a mutate if you want to know more about Camp cake and how you can bake with me live there are more details in the description below there are three elements to making a s'more which I feel you should know Ram crackers marshmallow and chocolate and I have to recreate them all out of cake and submit cookies let's start with my graham crackers I recreate those by making a really sturdy cookie dough I start by mixing some whole wheat flour and gram crumbs in a bowl and then in a pot i melted together butter brown sugar corn syrup and thyme it smells amazing right here add it to the how the cake is sense once that mixture was fully melted and warm I then carefully poured it into the center of my flour mixture mixing it all up with a spoon till I consider any more and then I poured it out and kneaded the dough together so once my dough is kneaded together I divided it into and wrapped it and let it sit for about half an hour a lot of meeting you know reps like after massage right you almost need to rest yeah I rolled out my dough on a nonstick silicone mat and place a piece of parchment paper on top while I'm rolling when I'm happy with the size I cut out a giant square and then I do this with the other half of the dough as well I used a ruler and a set square to help me get my squares perfect you know I love delivers graham crackers usually have some sort of pricked holes and some perforation lines that you can break them apart easily I need to recreate this look on my giant graham crackers for the holes I'm using a piping tip and I did use a ruler to measure and perfectly spaced them and for the perforation line I'm using a ruler I just used one end of a really straight ler pressed in to create that dotted line I enjoyed doing that oh I feel a lot because this dough is so sturdy and it has no leavening agents it doesn't expand while baking I bake them at 350 for about 25 minutes when they're done place them on a cooling rack to cool completely looks like this very official the first element of a s'more are two graham crackers the second element of a s'more is chocolate I wanted my chocolate cake to end up looking like a piece of a chocolate bar with a section of a chocolate bar I recreate this by making a square chocolate cake and to create the grooves I use a ruler and a serrated knife and I divide my cake into six sections just carving out to the little V values once I was happy with the shape of my face or the indents in my cake I then simple Philip dick that's right they're squeezed I'd be nothing without you can we recreate the scene in misery and like good this was first squeeze in a bed and me I think people will watch this oh why is my chocolate cake it's simple syrup and the syrup is soaked in I been crumb coated in chocolate ganache [Music] it feels very controversial when I leave this channel and become the crown point on my chocolate bar cake is set from an ice it in one more time in ganache now it's a really simple shape but it can be really annoying to ice in all the greens and get the food as well as the science thank you if you want any of the spatulas I've used or my red stabilizer you can get them at had a cake accom I pre made myself a batch of dark chocolate modeling chocolate and let it set up I roll out my modeling chocolate nice and thin and then drape it over my chocolate cake and the first thing I want to do is really smooth it into the groove as well as along the top edge modeling chocolate is great to cover a cake and I actually love the way it tastes kind of set up faster than fondant so you need to work lightly especially if your cake underneath is cold just press down the dowel into the groove and really expense you and I did it a bit along the sides of the booth as well that was a lot of shock if you'd like to see a video where I make modeling chocolate from scratch or you'd like to see me make my chocolate cake for ganache is a playlist right here oh it's a chocolaty let's move on to the marshmallow I feel like the marshmallow is Beyonce the chocolate is Kelly and the crackers are Michelle no I'm going to break the poor girl once and she must be y'all may have fallen but she when she falls she asks you in full no but she like her hair was got caught in a fan he didn't even break like that with me she was like this is like and then and meanwhile her hair was being pulled into I'm just saying that Michelle wasn't tested fine gotta have the yin and the yang and the young currently to create my Beyonce like marshmallow I have baked to 8 inch round vanilla cake and then I leveled them and cut the carmelization away from the bottom I also cut the carmelization off the size and then I layered each cake into two layers now it's have to fill oh no oh my god I was proud about this princess I left him on that chain to that bed and are you trying to leave about once the syrup was fully absorbed I filled my cake with Italian meringue buttercream and are you ready for this this marshmallow exception I broiled a few mini marshmallows now that they're cool I'm going to layers in between my cake on top of my sputters spread them on top of my buttercream and then add another layer of cake more buttercream more marshmallows now you may have noticed I'm not stacking this cake perfect on purpose which is really difficult for me I'm just throwing the layers on because marshmallows melt and they ease and they kind of get all like that's exactly to do can you actually want it to be imperfect you want to get what is imperfect you wanted to be perfectly imperfect and then once I'm done I'm going to crumb coat the entire outside with more buttercream let's pause for a second I want to get back to camp cake if you want to make two inside my baking project you can use live then head to Chanukah comp and register for tab cake we are making my taco cake which are in my upcoming cake book and Sunday company Jocelyn will be on camera and I think I'm going to make her do something and Jeremy will be here too and you'll hear some grunt sign the camera as usual so don't forget to sign up for camp cake and hat akika calm and if you have participated before leave a comment below with the hashtag camp cake squad see how this yar does not cooperate open it well perfectly good yeah good I'm not talking to it so where was I I've crumb coated it I need to ice my imperfect marshmallow cake once again with Italian meringue buttercream and chill it Jeremy did not think that I ended up with an imperfect cake it wasn't perfect and then he tried to imply that it wasn't nothing enough because I was making a marshmallow kink I decided to make marshmallow fondant and what you need to do is melt some mini marshmallows in the microwave and as they melt you can add a little bit of water and I also like to add glycerin this just keeps it a little bit shiny a little bit softer once it's melted you basically want to stir it into an entire heap of icing sugar icing sugar is the same thing as confectioner sugar is the same thing as powdered sugar so whichever one of those you call it it's fine the ones you can't stir anymore you can turn it out onto your work surface with some icing sugar on the table and then eat it until it comes together you want to make marshmallow fondant fairly close to when you want to use it so you don't want to make it days and days ahead because it will hard for my recipe of marshmallow fondant you can head to my blog at how to take it calm and I'll also put a link below I want to do a marshmallow photo shoot what I can just lie in like a whole bunch of marshmallows they're really soft should be amazing I roll the fondant out it's about a little less than a quarter of an inch thick it is stickier than regulus on it so I just put down a lot of icing sugar and then I picked it up and draped it over my cake now I don't want to cover this cake perfectly smooth so what I did is I used my fingertips to sort of fold under the fondant and I just want it to look musii that's probably love right-click one main melt they're like bling as I discussed before this is real marshmallow exception marshmallows inside a cake that looks like a marshmallow covered in fondant made of marshmallow a lot my marshmallow cake is all covered I want to place it in the fridge for about 20 minutes to set up and then I called in my friend Bernie before ruling my marshmallow fondant I want to remove my cake from the cake board which will burn and now I'm going to burn my entire marshmallow cake no need to burn the surface because I kind of want it to remain sticky so I can stick the graham cracker to it later but all of the sides are going to be plated and it's good if you burn it in different colors so Buster in some areas lighter in some areas who we all know even though you try to roast a marshmallow specifically has anyone ever done it if you've done it leave a comment below and I would like some sort of proof time to assemble this the first thing I do is take one of my giant graham crackers and place it upside down so I put the chocolate just a little off it's not perfectly centered and I'm okay with that are you no I am okay I've made peace of huh I just gotta figure a way to pick it out and fight it so hard to cut through work I wish I had a saw if you want more food case there's a playlist right here and don't forget to subscribe right there thank you for watching and I'll be back next Tuesday for my birthday a facility I'm going to make my own birthday cake yay because nobody on the team feels like they should maybe step up and make a cake for me 
welcome back to how to take it I'm Yolanda and today I'm going to show you how to make a vase at a pace that you can cut real flowers in some other things I see these we said Baba's our baby Jeremy oh look at you two want to ride off into the sunset the field of awesome yes don't forget is that notification bell so you know when new tastes are ready can please keep watch to make this phase cake I have baked six funfetti cake which is just vanilla cake with sprinkles inside to make it even more fun I remove them from their pens level them and cut the caramelize a ssin off the bottom now I need to cut a secret chamber out of three of these cakes I use a circle cutter to cut circles out of the center of three cakes large enough some tools a plastic cylinder I'm going to insert two later on I have to call in the help of sir please you really help me shower all my cakes were simple syrup leaving the one simple syrup is simply a mixture of one part sugar and one part water boiled together and cool and then with the help of a spoon I sprinkle it onto my case to help keep them moist during decorating I wanted to fill this cake with colored buttercream during Mother's Day I feel so I colored some buttercream a nice yellow and some a really nice pink and then I built my take as two separate cakes for now both cakes are made up of three layers of cake each filled with a lovely layer of pink buttercream and a lovely layer of yellow if you're looking for videos of my simple syrup buttercream leveling technique or my cakes there is a rose rescue dog penis right here just click on the high nuts aside time [Music] okay sir stop back and kill me okay ready I didn't you said it and we're good no that was a undercover I'm use that one oh how could you do better pigs do it better go now that my two tapers fat it's time to show them you have to fashion all at once that sounds like I know exactly what I'm talking about great asking you I'd like to carve my Bey's in two halves before putting it together I begin with the cake that will be the bottom of my beans and I place a six inch round cake pan on top then I trace around that cake pan with a small serrated knife and remove the excess cakes on the side now I need to flip it I lay a four and a half inch round cake board on top of the cake which will become the ball and then I use my serrated knife to carve the cake tapering it from that four and a half inch circle down to this six inch all the way around okay okay I need I need a motion for like lazy susans asterixis is weird it's carved the top half of my base I repeat this process is my second cake and set I use a three inch circle cutter placed on top to measure jeremy is the footage of all of it I never made a Vaz I made a business is this base or Vaz leave a comment below if you know the feeling it's not the same so how can we work of it we are good leave why pervades possess Luanda says and leaves e3j Oh Eva Jade for vol because that's a job she only uses crystals Azam for her expensive flowers in order to assemble this beige I need to add a six inch round board to the middle and some dowels to support the top I think it was a cake that would be the bottom half of the day and I slip you want the cake to rest on a bore so that the 6-inch diameter is on the top now I need to insert some dowels and mark them flush with the top of the cake so that I can cut them and insert them in a circle formation okay dowels now let's get information probably never belong with that oh I know I spread a very thin layer of buttercream on top of the cake and then I place a six inch round cake board on top of those Devils once again I spread a very thin layer of buttercream on top of the cake board and then I place the second half the top half of my baby right on top it is time to crumb coat and I take advantage of my crumpet and chill moments by washing all my dishes and not the bad music stuff far and for me that's like my my fists right I'm not it bothers me the whole time if you ever see my eyes looking off in the distance when I'm taking on the show because I'm looking and make dirty dishes and it just wanna wash once my take is chilled I iced it one more time with a thicker layer of Italian meringue buttercream and place it in the fridge if you want more cakes that are perfect for spring no matter what you're celebrating then check out this playlist just click on I'm washing my dishes I've decided to go with his days in marbled fondant I'm going to do this but in this print the other pale pink purple pencil and what I like to do when I marble fondant is actually take those colors and roll out too and then I made traced out of those two oh yes I'm braiding or SS change my expanded and then once it's braided I sort of spiral up the braid don't forget yogurt I think you need to like to physically sign my hand to the chick so it spirals up my braid and then for the flattened life on to get it ready to be rolled up so this is both of my braids but one on top of the other and it looks so pretty looks pretty weird and pretty but don't worry it's gonna work out I begin to roll out my vomit and I realize I kind of just like to pattern and some of these tubes weren't sticking together as well as a nice first stop to the Midway and I decide to brush up all the exercises and fold my phone it over one more time pieces will now keep in mind with Marvel's fondant there's only so much you can play with it before you do it to commend the color so the more that you need it together or fold it over the more blended the colors will be before I cover this cake in fondant I want to announce rest look good I don't like that one I knew such okay I am working on a super secret project and if you're an amazing Baker I want to feature your work go to our replicate playlist find the cake you want to make and get baking replica good make sure to take a high-res photo and posted on Instagram or Facebook making sure to use the hashtag deficit secret project up the fondant I use my French rolling pin but instead of draping it the way I normally do I actually roll it up backwards over my rolling pin then I hold my friend's rolling pin upright and unravel the fondant around working quickly I use a fondant smoother and the palms of my hands to smooth the fondant all over the cake and then where the ends of fondant meet I need to cut a clue I also use my sharp paring knife to trim away any excess fondant from the bottom first I tuck that fondant in as best I can and then I trim very close to the fog noticing if you're looking for gifts for your mom please check out how to keep calm we have prints we have all of the tools I use and this you take the cake pin at the top of the vase I use my fondant smoother to really smooth out that fondant it's kind of tricky cuz it's so narrow I did have a couple of creases but I really wanted to flatten it on the top and then I placed the cake fridge to chill once I bond it is chilled I'm going to use the same circle cutter 2/3 and circle cutter that is to measure the top of the base to cut off the excess spawn at the top so that none of it is dropping in [Music] Canaan are awesome therefore something for tuna right Jeremy perhaps marinated eggplant chocolate anyway never it is okay tried to add my plastic cylinder down into the secret chamber I know it fit because i measured exactly for that i love this cake because you can cover it in any font that you want use any flowers that you want and really customize it for your life here's the important tips i would not use a glass cylinder although glass is food safe and you can wash it if the glass is really thin you're in danger of having it or chipping it I don't like glass and cake I don't know about you it's not my thing happy Mother's Day to the North American month happy belated Mother's Day to the UK and Australian mom and any other moms around the world that I might have forgot 
welcome back to how to kick it I'm Yolanda and this week I'm taking Lloyd from Ninjago I just need to get my costume on okay so see it's for a kid what is this this is some weird guy so Kirsten who gets our prop got me a ninja costume except it's a children's version oh it fits like a glove I can't even open this eye okay no I'm not gonna rob a bank I'm okay Quinta Lloyd is made out of nine pounds of my ultimate chocolate cake and rice krispie treats I'm just gonna preface this with the fact that this is one of the hardest hits I've ever made I honestly this is so stressful Geri was just watching and he was stressed I have to build this cake in parts much like you build Lego so I'm gonna start with his body the meat his torso which is made from Kate for this I used a rectangular chocolate cake and I meant to cut it into three parts but I accidentally cut it in half right off the bat but I didn't let that throw me off I just pieced it back together and cut it into three layered each of the three parts into two layers before stacking the torso of course sir squeeze help me simple syrup all of the layers of chocolate cakes baking up sir squeeze because you know this episode can't be all about lloyd we are actually having a flash sale right now at Habakkuk accom and this new sir speed is 10% off from September 14th to 8 is attached you of his own name I'm gonna get a tattoo right here Yolanda I filled them as three separate stacks with Italian meringue buttercream and then I layered the whole cake up [Music] now Lloyd's body is going to have arms on the side of it you know as torsos do keeping his Rice Krispie arms in mind I need to layer his torso with two boards in the middle and these will help support the arms much later on like days from now four days I had to take a weekend off from life I might be a little more ten at the end of this episode let not any more relaxed but more time [Music] once I'm happy with Lloyd's torso I give it a good crumb coat in Italian meringue buttercream and place it in the fridge to chill what is funny I gave in a crumb coat and I put it in the fridge to chill the torso is done really really it says things like that I love the word torso so I think you should get it's not shirt that says torso that's not creepy right now I've gotta move on to Lloyd's head which is comprised Wu coming prized see what happens I go on vacation I come back comprised Lloyd's head is comprised of two five inch round chocolate cakes that I cut into two layers each simple syrup with this guy and filled with the towering buttercream and then stacked them up and then I crumb coated in chilled boards head how come he gets a makeover and I don't I think I should have a makeover you could I think we should straighten my hair I think you should put on that ninja costume no no I could do without that [Music] once the ground coat was set on both the torso and the head i iced both of Lloyd's body parts and chilled them again [Music] Lloyd's legs and feet and upper thighs are all made out of modeling rice crispies so I basically just melt the marshmallows in the microwave till they're puffy stir them into rice krispies until it's all combined and then I begin to sculpt and press and condense that crispy mixture until I can cut it and shape it I begin by molding his lower legs and feet I make sort of one long brick and then I make his thighs in a sort of rounded log I set them aside just to set up for a bit so they're completely cool and once they are I then use a serrated knife to trim them perfectly because Lego mini figures are very boxy very box so I want everything to be nice and square once I'm happy with the shape of my legs all the parts of the legs I have to cut some boards just for support so I'm putting two square boards one under each one of his feet and then another board under his thighs so where I've crumb coated my rice krispie pieces just like a cake and really here we want to fill in all the groups because Rice Krispies are smooth so we want to get that crumb coat into all the groups and then chill our crumb coat and chill bundles are back in stock at how to kick it calm they include the new and improved surf squeeze and a bunch of other fun and helpful tools for crumb coating there's a bunch of options so check it out now that the crumb coat is chilled I want to ice my Rice Krispies parts one more time and get them smooth and ready for fun [Music] I am ready I'm not really ready but I'm going to begin to cover all of Lloyd's parts with black fondant I ran out of black fondant and I had to call Kirsten oh wow there was a 911 it was a fondant 9-1-1 I needed ninjas in my kitchen to help me that's what I needed I should have requested that for all of these parts I cover them in pieces rolling out my blacks on it as I need it covering the sides trimming then covering the top and the other side depending on which part it is but the point is I covered them in pieces because I wanted him to remain nice and blocky and Lego like I was very anxious about making Lloyd for two reasons a and E would be hard and B my son loves Lloyd so it's a lot of pressure ninja go I feel like I'm doing like the sad mom version of that I am so excited about this movie coming out I can't wait to watch it with my son he doesn't even understand that it's not out yet he asked me every day it's not out yet that's why we haven't thought this was the Beyonce of cakes for him this is his Beyonce for sure Lloyd I mean Lloyd Beyonce we found similar similar names I want to start building this Lloyd cake and get the legs up right but first I need a proper board to support this I made myself a big cake board I covered the entire thing with green fondant and then I rolled up some more green fondant a little bit thick so that later on I can cut the circles that are that oh we researched this Jeremy I don't remember what their home what are they called Lego enthusiasts the circles that come up and connect the Lego they have a name I'm gonna add those circles later but right now I'm gonna begin to build Lloyd's legs on this green board the first thing I need to do is place Lloyd's two legs onto the green board and I need to place them as if they are stuck on I use a little bit of ro I seem to glue them down the next thing I need to do is add the upper thighs on top of the legs and make sure everything is lined up and now I need to send some wooden dowels down through voids legs that must have hurt out I nailed them through the thighs and the legs down into the baseboard building Lego is way more fun make them stay pulled apart start again it's amazing Hank so now that Lloyd's legs are upright and secure on the board I can measure and see what his waistline is like Lloyd has a very fine rectangular base I wonder if Lego figures feel like you know what I mean oh why am i square enough and I need to recreate that waist out of a board so what I did is I made a board and then I glued thin pieces of board around the side and this will make it look like his legs come out of that waist and smooth right there very you animate we won't see the top of this waste board once the torso is placed on but we will see the sides that I've created so I roll out some black fondant really thin and cut some bands and glue it to the surface of the side of this board guys there's a website called Wikipedia that's how serious people are about later now I secure this board to the top of his legs with some royal icing just making sure to keep it level and centered and I just want it to dry before I add my torso I'm making his arms out of rice krispies once again and his arms are always a little bit better like this he's grabbing oh you know it it's like a little bit better a little bit better once I was happy with the shape of his arms I crumb coated each one of them and chilled them and then I iced them again and children I covered both arms with black fondant using the textured black fondant what I used for the texture was just the same drawer mat that I used in my football cake what I covered his arms in two parts as well so I covered the bullet call this his wrist his handless wrist at the moment the end of the arm and then I covered the rest of the arm with the textured black fondant and trimmed away the excess [Music] I need to make Boyd's outfit like he's a ninja he's not just wearing black it's not so sad Lego guy he is a ninja I found a picture of Lloyd online and I blew up his torso and printed it so that I could have a template for myself and then I cut out all the necessary parts to make up his new jacket I add it to the torso with some clear piping gel and the help of my template just for placement just for the gold it was yellow fondant and I'm gonna paint it gold I need like I need like Lego cake therapy does that exist I do if you're a cake decorator out there if you've made a Lego minifigure cake leave a comment below I think we need to start a help group we need to talk to each other cuz I'm just talking to Jocelyn and she's laughing and I need someone who understands leave the hashtag Lego cake woes this cake took me four days to make it is the hardest cake I have ever made on how to kink it so please share this video it will make me feel better it will begin my therapy what is that they're coming it's the cake decorators it's the Lego cake decorators they're coming they heard me they've been crying for a while now themselves [Music] and remember those boards that I built into the torso I built two boards into the torso those boards are really gonna help keep the arms up against Lloyd he needs his arms so what I decided to do is use one long dowel pierced all the way through its torso and then the ends of the dowel that are sticking out will support and now that my torso is completely decorated I can add it to Lloyd's waist now I'm going to add the arms to the torso his arms are gonna be rent ninja ready Lloyd's hands kept me up at night before I even started to make lloyd because they're like this you know and they're very thin so I couldn't make them out of cake and I couldn't make them out of those crystals because they would have just been like so I decided to use an empty saran wrap sturdy cardboard right it's the right shape I have to puncture a hole in the middle them so that I use them all awl not a ll and now I need to cover them in black fondant so to do this I'm going to brush them with a thin layer of clear piping joke and then I rolled out my black fondant into pieces and first I covered the inside of the little cup and trim the excess and the night cover outside and trim the excess remember that hole that I pierced through the center of my cutting hands I need to cut a lollipop stick and fit it right into those holes so now there's like his little thin little wrist and before attaching it to the cake I am gonna wrap some bands of black fondant around that thin thin wrist [Music] so now my hands are ready to attack I added the cuppy hands to Lloyd along the side of his body [Music] four days later Oh Lloyd your head Lloyd's head made me lose my head he's pretty much all covered in like black not bandages but like Baghdad so to cover his head I'm covering it in parts first I cover the lower part where his mouth would be in a band of black [Music] and then I cut out the space where his little eyes Pierrot because he's a very serious ninja [Music] then I had to build up his head a little whose head looks bunchy it's like it's a bandana tied right so I added another piece of black fondant to the top of his head and made some marks in it to give it that effect wow this is the hardest cake I have made on the channel I made some pretty hard cakes in my upcoming face book which I can't wait for you to see it's coming out October 24th and you can enter to win your own fuck head over to my Instagram the handles here for all the details of my the old côtes contest and I've rolled out some white sand brown and some green really thin to make his eyes and his brows he has a serious brow job he has these lines here they're very pronounced I did cut them out fondant [Music] okay yeah no I'll never be okay after would never and finally I have to make his green bandana so I roll out some green fondant long enough to go around the circumference of his head and I tuck in the edges a little bit to make it look like a folded bandana and then wrapped it around his head and recreated sort of the look of a knot with the two ends hanging down at the back I think when I take my son to see this movie finally I'm gonna have like nightmares I might have to leave the theater you know I mean I'll be like I need a moment so he's ready he's got his ninja face on you know so with the help of some more dowels I add Roy's head to the top ok guys what is the character envoys bandana I made it next I cut it out of yellow fondant I painted it gold and I added it to his bandana but I don't know what it says so if you know leave a comment below what does Lloyd's been Dennis say I'm gonna guess that it's inhale and once a nice time to seize the day but he just didn't save it if you're excited to see the Ninjago movie as much as I am share this video help ease my pain [Music] ninja go I'm a pathetic ninja I don't have the energy to be a ninja that's what I realized I don't have a lot of enter he does I don't have the energy to make a ninja cake and I don't have the energy to be a ninja 
Jocelin hi I don't think my favorite smiles Oh welcome back to how to kick it I'm Yolanda and this week I am celebrating Star Wars 40th anniversary by taking a stormtrooper helmet well this clearly proves one thing to me everything amazing was born in 1977 full of grace anyone watching born in 1977 like me please leave a comment below I will find the comments and I will comment back you guys always know way more about Star Wars than I do all editions but one thing I know is that stormtrooper helmets are actually made out of 20 pounds of my ultimate soccer game black 20 I removed all of my cakes from their pens leveled them and then slice each cake into two players for a total of 10 the player okay the squeeze a lot is honored to discharge in its 40th Drover's anniversary and see simple syrup all of my cake layers in for the stormtrooper he was like a pure Cooper yeah go with it now that my simple syrup are soaked in I'm going to stack all of my cake layers filling them of my Italian meringue buttercream and I'm just going to reserve one final piece here [Music] so I chilled my cake until the buttercream was set to make it easier to sleep then I procrastinated for 40 minutes because I wasn't ready to school I really procrastinated honestly it was so hard I began by carving like the upper part of the helmet which is like me she's got a big forehead and then he has like part of the helmet like comes out over here [Music] and then I use my last layer of cake which I reserved to bulk up the front for his face ventilation I basically took that layer cut it in half and then I layered them on to the front of why am I doing this Jeremy what is he doing here exactly a lot of moaning I say I want to cry a lot I look at my phone a lot to look at pictures of stormtroopers the bender district insisting Jeremy found plans for a stormtrooper helmet plans like like a blueprint and then I collected props so this is a stormtrooper this is a dirty stormtrooper I really want to wash this map but it's paper Chewbacca and I are the two hairiest 40 year olds of all time once I was finished with the carving I crumb coated and chilled this baby prepare yourself Kronk oh yeah you end up this one [Music] after the film dealt with chills i iced my cake one more time trying to get my butter to this hospital and chilled it again if you enjoy watching the character cakes that i have bribed over and moaned over well making there's an entire playlist to them right here this is like the best job I've ever had and I'm so glad I don't have to wear it on my head before covering my stormtrooper helmet cake in fondant I'm going to build out parts of the cake with fondant underneath to help me reach the shapes done starting with I don't even lose the birth really the moaning blur the first thing I did actually was I rolled a big black bandhasana and I covered the bottom of the helmet he's really you would pick up with something and put it on so I wanted to give the illusion of like face underneath and then I began to fill out areas of the Kapus white I [Music] built out there like now ventilation [Music] and then I built out so like pools that's the fun of this place with this sequence goes are they speakers [Music] [Music] I built up this big forehead I put a layer of fondant over this forehead hey yo sis don't you brother bulky be the stormtroopers totally has a bulky space if you are a true fan and you know what I'm talking about hashtag bulky face solo I feel like stormtroopers jumped out of a desktop video even though they are older than Daft Punk I know this but can't you see Linda thing that was amazing so now it kind of covers the whole thing yes and I'm not procrastinating because this is going to be really easy there's nothing easier in fact been rolling out seven pounds with white fondant then trying to lift it up on different rolling pin and trying to drape it over a giant cake and then I had the pleasure of trying to smooth it all before it started to crack off that's the size that's what I do there's a lot of that [Music] you [Music] but now y-you know more procrastinating so now I looked at my phone 40,000 times and was just studying all the details and what I did is I use my small fondant rolling pin to roll out some grey fondant there's black fondant and we fondant to make all of these details thinking of characters the incredible Gustav who is a fan of how to take it and a visual artist has drawn me once again in character form and I look completely dope and I want you guys to see this video which makes this illustration from just finished please check it out Orhan can we do a split screen of me on this metal chair and the Gustav version of me on occasion go I'm not winning I already know it's now time for me to make all the details of this stormtrooper I basically just kept looking at a reference picture and then tackling the details one by one with all of my rolled up colors of fondant my best advice when tackling cakes like this are to be patient take your time you want to ensure that all the details on your helmet whether they lay on the right side or the left side are the same size and shape to make them pick up and if you want to mind to yourself is fine if you want to let the tears flow but at least nobody's filming you Jeremy click listen you can't let fear stop you that's the thing I was scared to make this I don't know anything about stormtroopers clearly but I wanted to do it you know the further I got the more I wanted to actually present it for those of you who belong to the cake tea Club this month's tea is the new happiness - you had me a cake and this month cake teen club members also get this drawstring bag for free it's perfect for all your t-shirts so they're like the filters that filter all the sastras are out in them they're always looking stuff out area in school I want now I want more much but I think they're filters filters they're like built-ins air to air - of course just enough air and just like it's so that they can breathe pure air yes or going again I painted the inside of this goggle so when the helmet was complete I mix a little bit of hair finding gel with water and then I threw the Stormtrooper a party because he's 40 like me but I hope someone will throw me a party not just throw confetti in my face for the third year in a row thank you for watching how to take it I want to wish a very happy 40th anniversary to Star Wars don't forget to hashtag 1977 if you're with me I see you 
welcome back to how to take it I'm Yolanda and this week we are celebrating Earth Day so I'm going to take three animal emojis I do I whip up fresh videos for you guys every week so don't forget to hit the notification belt so you know when a new video is ready and please subscribe to my channel and help you hit 3 million damn Jeremy no Jeremy are you part of this team are you funded ki-woo there you go I have chosen to make the tiger monkey and panda emoji all of the emotion cakes are banana that is my favorite flavor of cake and I rarely made it on how to kick it but there is a video in your recipe box please make this banana cake is amazing I baked all my banana cakes remove them from their pens space fascinating and I can't wait to listen yes you know what I want this gone look at me look at me guys I want this to be left in the video because all they here are my snarky remarks towards you guys but they never hear it being reciprocated now do they they have been misled the people my cakes are ready for simple syrup and much like carrot cake banana is very moist because of all the bananas to give them a light showering think about like a April spring shower that kind of show not a downpour these cakes need to be filled and staffed into three separate cake I chose them to fill them with chocolate buttercream YUM because what is better than chocolate and banana what's better nothing effect exactly I need to spread a layer of chocolate buttercream onto the top of three of my banana cakes and then I'm going to stack a engine annotate on top of each one of those and you'd like to see how I make my chocolate buttercream there is a video in your recipe boxes check it out and now thank you just leave some footage of distance in order to help me make these emojis of course I created ten flakes you're using pathways yeah you're really good hold on I know I'm excellent Macaulay lookout when I cut out my templates I made a plain piece of paper underneath each one essentially I was cutting out a copy of the emoji that I'm cutting out and the reason I wanted to do this is I can use that plain piece of paper that's in the correct shape on my cake and dirty it and not worry about it when I cut out these templates I cut one ear off each animal because we're going to have the ears later you think keypress I lay the clean paper template on top of one of my cakes and just carve out the pandas space shape nests I'm going to cut out the monkeys face shape and then finally I'm going to cut out the tigers to make the ears I use some cake scraps leftover from cutting the shapes of the faces and then I sandwich them together with more chocolate buttercream and use the ear templates that I cut off to make two ears for each animal here's another nature fact birthday soft panda monkeys and tiger all have two ears Wow this is better than BBC and it didn't take seven years to make took seven hours using my template to help me submission the ears I had two ears to each one of the animals and then I crumb close them all and chill them all I need to do a Content children I feel like it should be thank you don't forget about our crumb coat and chill bundle which we have at Hanukkah calm it has everything you need to practice now that the crumb coat is chilled it's time to ice these cakes one more time and show them again I used to play McHale meringue buttercream to crumb coat my cakes and I'm going to use it again to ice them these cakes need fondant of course I'm covering my panda cake in white fondant my monkey cake in a light brown fondant and my Tiger cake in the yellow fondant I roll out each color of fondant making sure it's large enough to drape over the cake then I pick it up with my French rolling pin drape it over and smooth it with my hand we really want to make sure to get between the crease of the ears like where the gears is the face and around the ears I think these are good starter cakes this is what I need for more of my character cakes some of which are easy some of which are really hard I have a whole character playlist right here before moving on to decorating each one of these animals I took the time to cut out their facial features from each one of its essence now for each emoji cake I have a stencil as well as all their little facial feature templates that I need to cut out of fondant so the first animal I met was panda using my fondant rolling pin in a nonstick board I roll out all of the colors I need for all of the Pens of facial features [Music] he's just go striking now I can start to cut out all the shapes I need for the pandas face so there's his deep dark eyes and then his beautiful white people I needed to cut out the gray that's in size this year he's such a good listener I think it's because of where his ears are talking about a panda what are you trying to say you can't choose who you love jump I need to build out my panda snout and nose so I'm leaving some white fondant and my template just to mold and sculpt that prop sort of triangular shape and then I sculpted his cute little nose with a ball of black fondant that I formed into like a soft little triangle and used appointed sculpting tool to indent his nostrils to cover the pandas years in black fondant I rolled it out nice and thin then I brushed a light layer of water onto his ears and laid the fondant on smoothing it in the same way I did before and then I just trimmed the ears to fit specific [Music] I add the rest of his facial features using just a little bit of water and stencil to help me with placement now for the month emoji once again I roll out all the colors I need to seduce monkeys face and then I want to build out his face in not too but mostly shapes the monkey shaped monkey face shapes yes but to create that I actually use that bit of my leftover light brown that I covered monkey with and mix with in with some white fun to get a nice pen color I rolled it out all the fixed side about a quarter of an inch thick and then I used that part of this template to cut out dare I say this bulky thing another bulky monkey negocios once I spread out my monkeys bulky face I added to the top of the cake again using my stencil to help me position it and I just rest on a little bit of water underneath to hold it in place I can now cut the other details out that I need for the monkey so I cut out all the parts of his eyes and his nostrils and his release I use my stencil and a brush use a little bit of water to add all of these facial features in the right place around his nose I accentuated the indent using a consultant you know monkey is that guy that just makes you laugh all the time the problems our relationship is we have a lot of disagreements without bananas like what you like monkey just wants to eat all bananas and I want to save them all till they're overripe and perfect for making banana cake and it's just you know we can never resolve it I just feel like neither one of us wants to come to a compromise I don't know what's so funny because my shirt does say all I do is take cake cake no matter what this is the fact I've printed on myself it's also the third t-shirt exclusive to Katy club's members so if you are a member I cannot wait to see you rocked it and if you're not find out more at how to keep calm I'm going to roll out all the colors I need to make Tiger nice and thin with my fondant rolling pin and my nonstick boards and then I'm going to use my template to help cut them out ah I love a part of it I also have to build up to beard Tiger is a bit of a hipster so like he's really focused on swapping his beard so I really had to get it right you know he's that kind of guy so what I did is I rolled up some ivory colored fondant and cut out and feared and added it to the bottom of the page and I made sure really nicely print she just has the cutest little dream man so again I created his nose and then I use a point of sculpting tools in Jena and nostrils and I added that right above his fears why am i pointing to my favorite will have appeared [Music] Tiger is just you know who's that guy he's the guy no he's bad for you you know he's rough around the edges I know but he's soft inside you know what I need Jocelyn okay I know that he's soft inside that he's always like I'm sure good many husbands like tattoos and it's just right for this I like it but I know I shouldn't like him don't forget to subscribe and help me hit three million and hit that notification valve so you know when a new video is ready thanks for

to give him another chance I just I know that I can change this time something about pandas eyes I just I felt such a connection and just I feel so safe with him so I think it's Panda like actually listen I can't have a man in my life he's going to tell me to stop making banana cake sorry monkey [Music] [Music] 
welcome back to how to kick it happy yo-yo day in honor of this day I am making a yo-yo case for my yo-yo yo-yo makes a yo-yo for her yo-yo but before we get started on the cake I need you to listen up really quickly because I have a giveaway alert we've dropped around the world are taking part in yo-yo day just the list of sweet shops in the description below and if you go into one of them today and say happy yo-yo day you look at something sweet happy day ignore Jeremy sighs Jeremy how do you say it oh that sounds like really happy day to make this yo-yo cake for my yo-yos I began by making 16 pounds of my vanilla cake batter that I died a lovely marbled yellow and pink and in one of the cakes I died teal and now I need to begin to build the three parts of the yo-yo we turn the bottom part of the yo-yo the middle part where the string goes and then the top part of the yo-yo for the top and bottom I use my marble pink and yellow vanilla cake two of the layers i level completely slapped and removed all the carmelization on the sides there my remaining two pink and yellow marbles cakes I simply skin off a little bit of the top so it's flat then I flip them over and remove the carmelization to the bottom and then I remove the carmelization from this size slip them back over and began to trim and carve my dome shape it's kind of similar to what I did last week with my version metal if these cakes that still have a hump and are now a nice rounded little dome will be the top and bottom of my yo-yo for one of the domes that's going to be the top of my yo-yo cake I'm going to create a little indent where these logo will go to do this I use a six inch circle cutter and I press it down lightly in the center at the top of my cake then I use my serrated knife to cut right through the cake and remove that circle later on I will attach that little edge bit of butter I used to squeeze a lot to shower all five of my cakes with simple syrup and let it soak in keep in mind any other tools I'm using on this cake that we sell at Habakkuk is calm will be on sale this week in honor of my beautiful yo-yos and that includes thirsty he wants his own channel called to have a simple syrup it and I said I don't think that's sustainable doesn't a bit upset very insightful you it is time to fill and stack my marbled vanilla cakes so I'm going to begin by filling one of the completely leveled layers and putting a domed one on top and then I'm going to repeat this one more time on the second marble cake staff remember I have that edge that's not attached so I'm going to gently gently lift it up and then I'm just going to sort of crumb coat a thin layer of buttercream on top and add the edge back and now it's sister now I crumb coat all three of these cakes and chip for the crumb coat and chill dance this week I yo-yo will attempt to kill ya free yes keep watching because I have a big announcement this is these of a big announcement and you believe never even seen me do these hands see that everyone's in on it Jeremy alright my crumbs are a child it is time to ice [Music] it can be tricky to ice a dome because once you set rounded it so Isis screwed as you can and we will work out the riches I use a combination of a small offset and fall straight spatulas to Isis I need to address the flat underside of both my donkey because we will see inside the yo-yo unlike the methanol so what I do is I flip both of these cakes very carefully because they are ice and then I give them a light spreading of Italian meringue buttercream with a small offset spatula I decided to make my yo-yo teal so I roll out some of that fondant nice and thin making sure it's a little bigger than the diameter of the flat side of each of my cakes i draped the fondant on top smooth it quickly and then quickly flip the cake back Oh what am i doing and then quickly now I use the tip of my sharp paring knife to trim it all that excess fondant that is sticking out some cake so the recipes you'll need to make this cake my simple syrup my vanilla cake and my Italian meringue buttercream don't forget there's a Yoos recipe box playlist right here I wish I did like right here I'm not going on America's Got Talent now that I put my case back I need to touch up the icing because we did flip them so might have been a little bumped in three but don't worry just touch it oh yeah I think we got it a nap there big thing here or on pause the cake footage press pause on whatever machine you do to edit it's time for the big announcement there's going to be a how to take it I even thought I would be on YouTube I always wanted to Facebook and I wanted to color the casebook if without a cookbook I don't think you've written I think you taste a casebook well I have cake the cake book yeah I have caked a cake book do you know why it's because of all of you fabulous yo-yo well that's why that's why the publishers were ringing our doorbell that's true well they called us yeah they didn't come over and this is the same secret project that some of the replicate winners work will be featured that's right some of your cakes will be in my case book it is our way of saying thank you for helping to make this happen this is my dream come true back to cake time to cover the domed size in the same teal fondant I measure my case as usual from the bottom of one side up over the top then I roll out my teal fondant to a diameter that's a little bigger than the measurement drape it over the cake with a French rolling pin and use my hands and a fondant rulers to fuse it all around this thing for the domed cake that has a little indent we're going to do exactly the same thing but realize that a lot of air will be cost underneath that indent so you want to keep a straight pin handy you can make some small incisions or pokes to release that air and you want to do that first before you start smoothing so drape the fondant over release some air at the edges or where you know it will be covered by your sticker later and just smooth the inside of that with the inside of your finger or the rounded part of your service now it's time to cover the teal cake that is the center of our yo-yo which is called select string holder from my middle teal cake I am going to roll out a band of white fondant a little bit bigger than the circumference of that cake and wrap it around the cake cut a clean seam with my paring knife I'm going to trim the top edge flush to the cake by holding my paring knife flat against the cake and going all the way around if you like novelty cakes I have other playlists with food cakes and character cakes make sure to check them out right over here I'm going to attempt the union I need to create the string for the yo-yo because without a string what is it oh yo that's a deep thought for today it's like I'm nothing without my yo-yos like it just makes it know to create my string I used a clay extruder I just softened some white fondant with vegetable shortening set it into my claims shooter and I used the largest circle face plate and then I bun out a few bands of string quite a bit I think I use my key to bend the string I began to wrap them around the cake attaching the strings with some clear piping gel and it took me three layers of string wrapped around the cake and then I did another two kind of in between I might need more string once I assemble the cake so I'm just going to keep this fondant in my place shooter handy finally I wanted to create a logo that would look like a sticker on the top using myself on a rolling pin I rolled out a little bit of white fondant a little bit of pink fondant and black fondant and then I created a circle I just placed a bowl upside down on top because I checked that it was the same circumference as we invent and then I cut out the words I heart five million because I do and I placed the letters on the circle and added that circle team since [Music] it's time to assemble this yo-yo the first thing I do is clip the domed teal tape of out the indent because that's the bottom of the yo-yo now here is where I see that you can see the scenes  wanna see the you want to see this meeting about to see a scene time to remove my teal cake with a string wrapped around and place is gently in the very center of that yoga oh no that's a very simple - yes but why is woman so string layer on top of the upside down dome okay now I want to address the seam that you can see on the bottom of the yo-yo where you about that seen Yolanda I'm going to cover it with strength and what I did is I just continued with that wrap around and instead wrapped it right around covering the scene because yo-yos unravel this string needs to end in a loop because that's for you well try to loosen a yo-yo onto your finger and yoyo so I just use again another cord of fondant and I wrap it over in a loop and then I cut a small piece and wrap it over the scene so it looks like I'm not I'm adding the final cake don't side up yay now I'm going to add the loop so we can yo yo this yo yo so I add a loop attaching it again with clear piping gel and I wanted it to sort of fall down from the looks from below is an easy question but it was easy is to talking about it that's another easy serving yo-yos this one's for you well they're all for you but this one especially is dedicated to you don't forget to go and get your free sweet treat today check the description below for all the shops participating or I'm throwing that cake book's cover again I look better on the cover than I do right now

welcome back to Attica KITT I'm Yolanda and since we're gearing up for the summer edition of Camp cake I've decided to make a giant more pink you need some more floor please dispose of this channel and don't forget to hit the notifications l so you'll know when I faked a mutate if you want to know more about Camp cake and how you can bake with me live there are more details in the description below there are three elements to making a s'more which I feel you should know Ram crackers marshmallow and chocolate and I have to recreate them all out of cake and submit cookies let's start with my graham crackers I recreate those by making a really sturdy cookie dough I start by mixing some whole wheat flour and gram crumbs in a bowl and then in a pot i melted together butter brown sugar corn syrup and thyme it smells amazing right here add it to the how the cake is sense once that mixture was fully melted and warm I then carefully poured it into the center of my flour mixture mixing it all up with a spoon till I consider any more and then I poured it out and kneaded the dough together so once my dough is kneaded together I divided it into and wrapped it and let it sit for about half an hour a lot of meeting you know reps like after massage right you almost need to rest yeah I rolled out my dough on a nonstick silicone mat and place a piece of parchment paper on top while I'm rolling when I'm happy with the size I cut out a giant square and then I do this with the other half of the dough as well I used a ruler and a set square to help me get my squares perfect you know I love delivers graham crackers usually have some sort of pricked holes and some perforation lines that you can break them apart easily I need to recreate this look on my giant graham crackers for the holes I'm using a piping tip and I did use a ruler to measure and perfectly spaced them and for the perforation line I'm using a ruler I just used one end of a really straight ler pressed in to create that dotted line I enjoyed doing that oh I feel a lot because this dough is so sturdy and it has no leavening agents it doesn't expand while baking I bake them at 350 for about 25 minutes when they're done place them on a cooling rack to cool completely looks like this very official the first element of a s'more are two graham crackers the second element of a s'more is chocolate I wanted my chocolate cake to end up looking like a piece of a chocolate bar with a section of a chocolate bar I recreate this by making a square chocolate cake and to create the grooves I use a ruler and a serrated knife and I divide my cake into six sections just carving out to the little V values once I was happy with the shape of my face or the indents in my cake I then simple Philip dick that's right they're squeezed I'd be nothing without you can we recreate the scene in misery and like good this was first squeeze in a bed and me I think people will watch this oh why is my chocolate cake it's simple syrup and the syrup is soaked in I been crumb coated in chocolate ganache [Music] it feels very controversial when I leave this channel and become the crown point on my chocolate bar cake is set from an ice it in one more time in ganache now it's a really simple shape but it can be really annoying to ice in all the greens and get the food as well as the science thank you if you want any of the spatulas I've used or my red stabilizer you can get them at had a cake accom I pre made myself a batch of dark chocolate modeling chocolate and let it set up I roll out my modeling chocolate nice and thin and then drape it over my chocolate cake and the first thing I want to do is really smooth it into the groove as well as along the top edge modeling chocolate is great to cover a cake and I actually love the way it tastes kind of set up faster than fondant so you need to work lightly especially if your cake underneath is cold just press down the dowel into the groove and really expense you and I did it a bit along the sides of the booth as well that was a lot of shock if you'd like to see a video where I make modeling chocolate from scratch or you'd like to see me make my chocolate cake for ganache is a playlist right here oh it's a chocolaty let's move on to the marshmallow I feel like the marshmallow is Beyonce the chocolate is Kelly and the crackers are Michelle no I'm going to break the poor girl once and she must be y'all may have fallen but she when she falls she asks you in full no but she like her hair was got caught in a fan he didn't even break like that with me she was like this is like and then and meanwhile her hair was being pulled into I'm just saying that Michelle wasn't tested fine gotta have the yin and the yang and the young currently to create my Beyonce like marshmallow I have baked to 8 inch round vanilla cake and then I leveled them and cut the carmelization away from the bottom I also cut the carmelization off the size and then I layered each cake into two layers now it's have to fill oh no oh my god I was proud about this princess I left him on that chain to that bed and are you trying to leave about once the syrup was fully absorbed I filled my cake with Italian meringue buttercream and are you ready for this this marshmallow exception I broiled a few mini marshmallows now that they're cool I'm going to layers in between my cake on top of my sputters spread them on top of my buttercream and then add another layer of cake more buttercream more marshmallows now you may have noticed I'm not stacking this cake perfect on purpose which is really difficult for me I'm just throwing the layers on because marshmallows melt and they ease and they kind of get all like that's exactly to do can you actually want it to be imperfect you want to get what is imperfect you wanted to be perfectly imperfect and then once I'm done I'm going to crumb coat the entire outside with more buttercream let's pause for a second I want to get back to camp cake if you want to make two inside my baking project you can use live then head to Chanukah comp and register for tab cake we are making my taco cake which are in my upcoming cake book and Sunday company Jocelyn will be on camera and I think I'm going to make her do something and Jeremy will be here too and you'll hear some grunt sign the camera as usual so don't forget to sign up for camp cake and hat akika calm and if you have participated before leave a comment below with the hashtag camp cake squad see how this yar does not cooperate open it well perfectly good yeah good I'm not talking to it so where was I I've crumb coated it I need to ice my imperfect marshmallow cake once again with Italian meringue buttercream and chill it Jeremy did not think that I ended up with an imperfect cake it wasn't perfect and then he tried to imply that it wasn't nothing enough because I was making a marshmallow kink I decided to make marshmallow fondant and what you need to do is melt some mini marshmallows in the microwave and as they melt you can add a little bit of water and I also like to add glycerin this just keeps it a little bit shiny a little bit softer once it's melted you basically want to stir it into an entire heap of icing sugar icing sugar is the same thing as confectioner sugar is the same thing as powdered sugar so whichever one of those you call it it's fine the ones you can't stir anymore you can turn it out onto your work surface with some icing sugar on the table and then eat it until it comes together you want to make marshmallow fondant fairly close to when you want to use it so you don't want to make it days and days ahead because it will hard for my recipe of marshmallow fondant you can head to my blog at how to take it calm and I'll also put a link below I want to do a marshmallow photo shoot what I can just lie in like a whole bunch of marshmallows they're really soft should be amazing I roll the fondant out it's about a little less than a quarter of an inch thick it is stickier than regulus on it so I just put down a lot of icing sugar and then I picked it up and draped it over my cake now I don't want to cover this cake perfectly smooth so what I did is I used my fingertips to sort of fold under the fondant and I just want it to look musii that's probably love right-click one main melt they're like bling as I discussed before this is real marshmallow exception marshmallows inside a cake that looks like a marshmallow covered in fondant made of marshmallow a lot my marshmallow cake is all covered I want to place it in the fridge for about 20 minutes to set up and then I called in my friend Bernie before ruling my marshmallow fondant I want to remove my cake from the cake board which will burn and now I'm going to burn my entire marshmallow cake no need to burn the surface because I kind of want it to remain sticky so I can stick the graham cracker to it later but all of the sides are going to be plated and it's good if you burn it in different colors so Buster in some areas lighter in some areas who we all know even though you try to roast a marshmallow specifically has anyone ever done it if you've done it leave a comment below and I would like some sort of proof time to assemble this the first thing I do is take one of my giant graham crackers and place it upside down so I put the chocolate just a little off it's not perfectly centered and I'm okay with that are you no I am okay I've made peace of huh I just gotta figure a way to pick it out and fight it so hard to cut through work I wish I had a saw if you want more food case there's a playlist right here and don't forget to subscribe right there thank you for watching and I'll be back next Tuesday for my birthday a facility I'm going to make my own birthday cake yay because nobody on the team feels like they should maybe step up and make a cake for me 
welcome back to how to kick it I'm Yolanda and today I'm using mini eggs to create a mega cake that will be the perfect centerpiece for your Easter celebration it's also a cake that is so easy to share with the people you love mini egg it's like Easter wrestling thanks to Cadbury for sponsoring this video let's get started for this cake I decided to bake my coconut cake which is one of my personal favorites and now is codis as well oh the recipe can be found in my cake book on page Cody what page 28 you knew that no it's IRA move the carmelization from the bottom and the sides of all three of my cakes and then I cut them each into two halves lengthwise although I've made many mega cakes I've never made a rectangular one use a ruler I hope sir squeeze is ready for today because I made him some pretty special surfacer it is a honey lavender super sir just like regular simple syrup where I boil water and sugar this one I boiled some honey and some lavender buds once the syrup is fully cooled I strained it to get out the lavender buds and then I poured it into sir squeeze yes funella help time to build this cake and I'm going to alternate the colors of yellow green pink yellow green pink and I'm filling between the layers with my Italian meringue buttercream but I want a spread a layer of buttercream really even now we all know that many eggs come in four colors so leave a comment below if you know which color is missing from this cake do you want one jocelyn sorry Cody I can't reach that far I'll have yours for you okay this one's for Cody now that my cake is beautifully stacked up with all the colors and Italian meringue buttercream I need to crumb coat and chill it so here's a great note there is no need to get rid of all that excess buttercream that was coming out of the sides use that for your crumb coat because it's already crummy if you want to grab my crumb coat and chill bundle they're actually on sale at how to keep it calm and you can click one up right here I haven't done click one up in a long time well I brought it back for you now that my crumb coat is chilled I'm gonna take a moment to just check if my cake is still level and it was I was like this is one of my best shots no really or huh fireworks this deserves fireworks and then I iced and chilled my cake now I have a new tool okay I went to the construction store to buy salt because guess what it's still winter and it's been an icy one this was on a bottom shelf and I don't know why because this is amazing if any of you drywall why didn't you tell me about this let me know so I used this because the bench scraper that I have and I use is shorter than the height of this cake while my cake is chilling I'm going to take this opportunity to mix some lavender of buttercream not lavender and flavor lavender and color I make my lavender buttercream by adding a little bit of purple food coloring mixing until I'm happy and let me just held up the buttercream to a bowl of mini eggs even though that's not one of the colors in mini eggs I wanted to be within the same shape now I'm going to fill a parchment piping bag with my lavender buttercream and I'm also going to fill another parchment piping bag with some white buttercream I'm going to remove my cake from the fridge and I'm going to remove my cake from the fridge and I remove my cake from the fridge I know Cody Cody like enough food this and then I cut a hole in the tips of my piping bags and I type horizontal lines across each side one at a time across the side of my case so I start with the lavender buttercream and I just pick random lines and then I use my straight spatula to smooth that buttercream on to the white so you don't want to do it too many times the more you do it the more it blends try to go in one direction and you just want to send it out and smooth it against your cake and it creates sleep don't forget guys you have a monthly sprinkle service where you can get it you see the gourmet sprinkles delivered to your door every month so this is your last chance to get this one sprinkles take it to the limit one more [Music] once I'm happy I put the cake back in the fridge let that lavender buttercream chill and then I take my cake back out and I repeat this process with the white buttercream and that's just to make it look even more subtle you can do it however you want maybe one a darker means you want more lavender maybe want less lavender maybe you want another color do it your do you I decided to make some cute little cake toppers for this cake and I'm going to make some bunnies in the beautiful rich Cadbury purple cuz you know bunnies come in purple I rolled out some rich purple gum paste and then I placed my bunny egg template on top I use a sharp paring knife to cut around the template and then so that these bunnies can stand up on my cake I am inserting a gold floral wire very carefully from the bottom of the bunny and the reason I'm using a gold wire is just in case we see any why at least it will match and then I just made a set of you know just years and just ahead so they could be like the bunny so you're crouching down in the eggs once I'm happy with all of my cake toppers I set them aside to dry and once they are dry I decided to paint the outside like the outline of the bunny with gold the rare golden back purple butter yeah and it would have like a latin name like funniest golden Bacchus many eggs not only do they grow in a field they grow on a golden field I mix some gold luster dust with clear food grapes alcohol and then I'm going to paint it across the top of my cake it's very important that your cake is well chilled as I paint I'm gonna allow my goal to drip down the sides of the cake you know how people were to further grasses golden make sure to subscribe to how to kick it step by step because we are gonna be releasing and Easter cakes compilation that has some great Easter cakes it's time to lay out the

you're watching how to cake it I'm Yolanda and it's chocolate eclair day this week so of course I have to keep a giant Eclair a couple my hair is having yeah mind me about my shorter hair I'm very upset about it let's treat you to make this giant Eclair I baked one vanilla cake and one chocolate cake for the vanilla cake I removed it from its pen and then I just slightly leveled the top so it would be more flat when I flipped it over now I'm going to cut this big rectangle in half lengthwise so that I have two long vanilla rectangles I need to flip both halves over and remove the carmelization from the bottom times the carve these two long rectangles into two halves of an eclipse for the top half and the bottom is a six inch round pan helps upside-down at each end to round them out the norm of a classier pot of elegant cotta and then I take my serrated knife and round the cake down all the way down a fan actually came up with the pun on this team and it's available only for a limited time at how to keep it up [Music] for the chocolate cake I removed it from its pan leveled it and then this time I cut it in half width wise cut the two halves of my chocolate cake to the desired width and then I sort of bust them up against each other lengthwise so now they're as long as my hot dog this cake will become the center sort of the chocolate cream in my Eclair I also need to round out the ends of this long chocolate rectangle this coming is a five inch round pen held at the end at a small serrated knife to round them off you with me are you watching me wick are you watching me cake cake I have cake cake yeah yes yeah a cake of cake yeah we struck Drake on the cake of cakes on our Instagram in the hopes that I could make history Priscilla and a lot of my wonderful viewers tagged him students Ralph John we've got 40 million followers I think it's hard to see your thoughts now that I'm happy with all my cakes Chris your squeeze is here to help me simple seriously once the simple syrup are soaked in it is time to plumb coat these cakes and get them in the fridge to check yeah I did it for all three cakes let's I see takes one more time nice and smooth and children in the French again for my Eclair top and bottom I have died from fondant to look well kind of a beige choux pastry color you see it's not shoe like the shoe on your foot if you like CH golden your face is this pastry that you make in a pot and flour and eggs and you cook it and then you type it I have to like again add this to our food coloring collection turkey skin steak steak base I feel like we're going to have the most disgusting line of food coloring but no one will go we're just going to call it ill I roll out my pastry colored fondant and then I drape it over the cake some of them with a fondant smoother and trim away the excess at the base with a sharp paring knife I do this to both halves of my éclairs and once I'm happy I start to mix some paint to paint them a little bit I want to paint a layer onto my pastry colored fondant just to give it a little more life so I'm what potion oh yes tiger I mixed oh I wish I could see drop in space because she wasn't like I breathe it she's like ivory again like all you ever talk about is high but you have a drawer full of like suturing and it's all the time right I've replayed right that was how she's better that was how it was I read oh it was ivory in connection with a little bit of brown and a little bit of white so Oh more opaque mix once the paint was dry I actually flipped what will be the bottom half of my betrayal over and I made sure to lay it on just a little piece of parchment paper because even though the paint is dry and we want to risk it have a six month course now it's time to play oh wait a minute I pressed mention while you of the chocolate cake trilling ahhh I slanted it a bit because I wanted to be a clay Claire usually like the silliness to the fuss maalai it's not just like great in order to place my chocolate cakes filling on top of the bottom of my Eclair the first thing I need to do is spread a crumb coat of Italian meringue buttercream now I carefully lift my chocolate cake using a really long spatula because remember we built this to change have you wanted to solve it first I carefully lift it up and place it on the center of my bottom clear just like in a clearance this is really satisfying actually so I use a whole lot of time meringue buttercream as I said in a piping bag with an open star tip and then what I did is I type the series of buttercream shells around the whole Eclair now on the back where the chocolate cake the strength is lower I only got one layer apply shells but on the front I doubled up into the second layer on top a good idea would be to chill your cake in between your layers just in case it's warm as it was for me and that way you won't risk ruining your first types players especially [Music] before I finish this with Claire take I want to let you guys know the camp cake is back I don't think give me a moment there we go Camp cake is a full-day live-streamed baking campuses me where I bake in this kitchen and you make in the

using the hashtag Camp cake squad it's time to finish the giant declare I need to clean I am using modeling chocolate as my glaze now I know I'm yours modeling chocolate on the channel before but it has always been made of white chocolate this time I mean it was dark chocolate I roll out the modeling chocolate the same way I would farm it and I pick up my modeling chocolate on a French rolling pin i draped the modeling chocolate over the top of my Eclair I begin to smooth it with my hands then I trim away the excess and I want it to look well like Glade so I don't want to cut a perfectly straight line first I use this tip of my knife to make a slight indent or mark it all the way around and instead of wavy line and once I'm happy with the way it looks I cut slices [Music] the thought of how good it felt to assemble the Eclair made me really excited maybe big excited it was so satisfying to talk to you Claire so all I had to do was pick up this final cake with its chocolate glaze on top and it was amazing I was so happy because I got it bang on the first time there's nothing worse than missing a little and then trying to shift things around it can be done but it's scary I'm so excited to decorate this Eclair I decided to first drizzle this chocolate glance with some pink and lavender candy now one thing that's hard about cakes is you can get so far and be happy but there's always a moment where you can wreck them it's just the truth so be confident and drizzle I further decorated the top of the Eclair using a variety of candies and decorations such as candy beads I used some really brightly yellow colored Jordan almonds what else did I use I basically wanted it to look like this is a like a real size declare I have sprinkles these decorations on but instead I placed each one with a little pat of caddy Mouse to glue it to the surface you guys always want to know what I'd use my case this week I'm saving this one for my mom because it's her birthday this week so

welcome back to how to cake it I'm Yolanda and this week I am making a pork cake from the upcoming listen chewy I know I could have made you but quite frankly you're way too hairy from the upcoming Star Wars the last Jedi movie thank you to Disney Studios Canada for collaborating with me on this video Star Wars the last Jedi is in theaters December 50 yes Chewbacca is also starring in it a bit later in the episode I'm gonna tell you about a chance to win a Star Wars prize pack with this guy Luke Skywalker to make this port cake I baked 21 pounds of cake that's my number who half of it was ultimate chocolate cake and half of it was ultimate vanilla cake I baked my cakes in six round pans and once they were baked and cold I removed them from their pans level them and cut the carmelization away from the bottom of the vanilla cakes with the two smallest round cakes I also layered them each into two layers it's time to read a simple set up these cakes and so I'm bringing in my own Jedi sir squeeze a lot that's right I bet you didn't know he's a Jedi and he has a sidekick too fun now why didn't we make a trailer about a movie about them my Jedi sir squeeze and his ultimate sidekick Finnell are available at how to kick it calm it is your holiday baking headquarters and your Star Wars baking head pores and your seam hiding headquarters I'm gonna begin to make this pork cake by building two cakes the first cake starts out with three layers alternating chocolate and vanilla and spreading Italian meringue buttercream in between I think Italian meringue buttercream is also a Jedi even though it doesn't have a physical form or the second cake is going to have five layers once again alternating between chocolate and vanilla with Italian meringue buttercream in between now that both of these cakes are stacked I'm going to put them in the fridge to chill to carve this cake I flip it and then I carved in a downward motion all around the cake just curving it out it's kind of like an upside-down Bowl moving on I need to carve the larger cake or the taller cake rather and this cake needs to be carved more into lake up almost like a pear you know what I mean not quite a pair an upside-down face yes an upside-down face so I'm carving this cake into like an upside-down face so that it's much more narrow at the top and wider at the bottom and now it's time to stack and download these cakes one on top of the other I want this cake to be more narrow at the top because this is his neck and wider at the bottom which will be his tummy first I turned my upside-down Bowl right-side up I make sure it's nice and level and then I insert dowels in a circular formation and put a board on top this board has been cut to the exact diameter of the width of this cake to secure the board in place I first spread a thin layer of ganache on the cake then the board and then again on top of the board now I can add my taller cake which is an upside-down base but I'm leaving it in that direction so that the widest part is at the bottom and now the cake looks like a pear more like a pear once my cake is put together I have a look and I do a little carving touch-up here and there until I'm happy it's a no headless spores to make the head of this fork I am using sculpting Rice Krispies so I just melt some marshmallows stir them into rice krispies and then I can use it like a pliable mixture to sculpt the shape anything I want today it's a point making sure especially that the bottom of this head is the same diameter as his knee because you don't want like a puny head even want to have this like yeah it has like a bit of an underbite and then its head at the back is not super round Jeremy did you capture what I'm trying to say good while I was making this cake I was reminded of my Olaf cake because I made him in a similar way with a cake body and a Rice Krispies head and the good news is we just made an Olaf step-by-step video over on our second channel how to kick it step us to time to attach my head once again I insert dowels down into the cake and then I think's a cake board that is the exact diameter of the neck in between securing it with chocolate ganache and then I rest my head on top the cords have very important I just made a cake I think it is now time to crumb coat and chill to do the strawberries music everybody keep going Cody please leave a comment below if you thought that was the worst rendition ever of the Star Wars song and share this video with others who will agree with you which is everyone once micron code is chilled I am going to move this entire cake to a sturdier cake board that I have prepared and place a thick dowel through the entire thing I'm gonna tell you after I moved the poured cake to the prepared board and place the dowel in I decided then he looked a bit too tall I really didn't want to decide that I really didn't I talked it over with Jeremy he agreed so once I have the head on I looked at just overall figure I was like I'll make pork czar this tall so I had to use two spatulas to raise the head off and then I cut a layer of cake away from his neck and then just rescaled it a bit to get it back to the same diameter and then I placed everything back vertice good job yeah music see when you explain it it takes 30 seconds but when you do it it doesn't it is time to ice and chill dis pork salt Star Wars do you know there are lifesavers and then there are light sabers you know what was my lightsaber in this episode Justin well my small offset spatula it won't help you if there's a villain around however if you have a sculpted cake it's perfect for getting in all the grooves I had to sometimes ice overhead ice underhand spin the League of Susan under her and like Jeremy backside Jamie that's that it was action a pork is pretty much white on the front and then sort of gray on the back and on his head with a little bit of rust eyes so I'm starting with the white front of his body I roll out some white fondant large enough to cover that area place it up against the cake and smooth it on and then I had made myself a little template of paper surprise so I held my template up against the cake and just trimmed away the excess fondant now I need to texture this fondant immediately because the pork looks like it's furry and cuddly in order to apply that fuzzy texture I need to do it while the fondant is still soft so in this case you do not want to put your cake in the fridge after fondant you want to immediately start texturing I used a sculpting tool as well as a pair of manicure scissors that's the first time out of cake it so what I did was I use the sculpting tool to just sort of stroke down the fondant the next move let's take your manicure scissors you want to snip into the fondant creating sort of more of a fuzzy texture this was tedious so I went as far as I could down holding my scissors upright and snipping and then I have to turn over and do it upside down I'm having trouble matching my clicks to my tab oh okay yeah I get it I looked again at my port picture and I decided I wanted more white on the front I think it was too narrow so I roll out more white fondant cut it in half and I add another band of fondant to either side of this belly I've created and once again texture it in the same way so the good thing about this fuzzy texture is it's really easy to hide seams what you want to do is pay close attention to where your seams are so where that new piece of fondant meets the already textured fondant you want to texture along the seam first every time I hide a seam on a cake we have to insert the seam hider intro and I just make that roll I bet you didn't know I could hide scenes with manicure scissors the scene you need to cover the rest of the porks body was fir but the back of his body is mainly played so for this I roll out gray fondant I cover one half of the back of his body and texture it the same way I worry how to texture it I'm surprised my hand and stop moving look at the owing to bed last night we're done and then I cover it the other half was great fun and once again and repeat the jockey when we get in behind scenes we did that last week and we did use eye cream over on our new channel how to kick it step by step we do compilation videos of some of my cakes and we'll show you how long each one of them come to me they take along even the seam hider needs rest I need to move on to cover the face of this port so the front of his face has some white fondant once again I rolled out a piece apply it to the face and guess what I check stir it with my sculpting tool and my manicure scissors I love using a tool that's not really meant to make cakes to make cakes like in my cake book I use herb scissors to make a little pom-pom on the party hat cake there are 21 that's my number amazing novelty cakes in my cake book to try and have fun Jocelin have you tried one yet at least to this part of his face I got to add a little more texture that being his nostrils and his like pout I think he's pouting once I'm happy with the front of my porks face I move on and cover the rest of his head with grey fondant and texture it Jeremy wasn't not riveting Jeremy what is afford without wings it's an org to make my wings I colored some gum paste the same gray color that I colored my father I rolled out my gum paste on a nonstick board with a non-stick rolling pin laid my template on top and cut out the first wing and then I textured it yep yep Jocelyn more texturing when I was ready I picked it up with gum paste though you have to work even faster than you do responding once my wing is fully textured I pick it up and then I glued the wing on with some royal icing and held it for a little bit till it was secure I repeat this whole process making a second wing for the other side please subscribe to this channel and share this video if you are a fan of Star Wars and you're looking forward to seeing Star Wars the last Jedi or if you're just a fan of manicure scissors if the porks feet are kind of like little webbed chicken feet so I rolled out my sort of rust colored fondant I rolled it up into two tubes and then I cut out or to fit chords and then I cut each chord into two three so now I have six toes and then I pressed three toes together for each foot but feet need nails feet with nails huh wings okay to make the nails I rolled out some more migraine gum paste just into a smaller chord and then I cut out six little short pieces and just sort of formed them into little masks I glued those nails to the front of all six toes with a little bit of clear piping gel and then what I had to do is cut the feet sort of down on an angle cuz they're just the toes are just gonna poke out from under I made my feet a bit shorter using a circle cutter since his body is sort of circular and then I took that circle cutter and indented the top of the toes a little bit give it some texture some chicken feet like the texture and now I can add my feet to the body of the foot so just stick it out which I wonder if they're related to chicken and City after that I need to add some more braids because right now we can see the top of the wing we can see a clean line where I cut the way and we don't want to see that so I'm gonna add some pieces of grey fondant on the side of his face over here going down to the wing and texture that fondant and try and blend it as well as I can yeah he's kind of necklace which is why would I first carved him and thought he was too tall it was more than I thought his neck was too pronounced because really he's more like this guy once I'm happy with all of the gray fur it's time to move on to that beautiful rust color fall fur I roll out some of my rust colored fondant the same fondant I used to make his toes and roll it out and used a template that I laid on to the rest fondant cut out and then I placed it over like over his snout between the white and the braid do you understand what I'm doing here yes I'm glad you asked I did texture that fun in as well I want to accentuate his nostrils I just realized how ridiculous that sounded as I was upset as well as his pouch cousins he's working the palate so I take my pork nostril fondant and I roll two little sort of teardrops and then I place it into the nostril and I just use a little sculpting tool to like Maldivian I want his nostrils to have Dabba next I take that pork coming fondant roll out a really thin cord I couldn't use my clay extruder but it was one cord and I thought to myself after I did it I should have used my cleanser because when you roll it really really thin it starts to get to the point where you just can't roll it anymore and I smoothed it in with you know I know you guys have been wondering how to get your chance to win your very own Star Wars prize now it's really simple all you have to do is leave the hashtags the last Jedi below and we will be selecting two people randomly on December 15 check the description below for all of the details and make sure to check your youtube messages no there are no manicure scissors in the prize pack Chewbacca that's my lip boy does a pork have eyes because I was like so for his eye is I took some black fondant and I pushed it into a half tablespoon that I have that's like a dome smoothing out their top so it fits right in chill it for a little bit before I tap it out and then I repeat that process making a second eye I'm going to attach them to the top of the body I am gonna use a toothpick just cut in half to help secure these bug and out eyeballs because I don't want them to fall over secure on either side of this little snipped smell right not only are his eyeballs pronounced they're like shiny he has shiny eyeballs I know so what I did is I painted the eyeballs with clear piping gel and then that way machine would catch the light hence why they call it a catcher the light has been caught in his eyes and now I need to make a little ring of fur around his eyeballs to create the ring of fur I roll some white gum paste into two cords and then I textured it I didn't have to use the sculpting tool I just used my manicure scissors just snip the tubes and make them look seriously then I picked them up and because the piping gel is still wet on my eyeballs I just glued it in a and cut away the excess I can't cut this pork cake because we are taking it to the movie premiere of Star Wars the last Jedi and I'm gonna cut it there I can't stop

welcome back to how to take it I'm Yolanda and this week I am making a giant carrot cake no like an actual carrot so not just like carrot now a carrot carrot cake got a carrot cake that's carrot cake inside I make new cakes every week so please subscribe to this channel and help me hit three million subscribers it would be a lovely birthday gift oh and here's a notification bell so you know when my new cakes are ready you can make this cake I baked 9 carrot cakes remove them all from their pans level them and then cut the caramelize a ssin away from the bottom if you would like my carrot cake recipe which is delicious you can find it on a playlist called yelled recipe box book put it in a pond now all of my cakes are ready for simple syrup but are they ready for sir squeeze now my carrot cake is really really moist so I simple served a little more lightly than I usually do I don't know if you've noticed but the squeeze is now in pin form they say you haven't made it until you've been pin now I need to ice the top of each cake with a nice layer of Italian meringue buttercream I'm going to ice all of them except one of the tiniest layer my Italian meringue buttercream recipe is in the same yost recipe box playlist up here I need to flip each of these case onto their side and start sandwich in them together but first I just want to trim a little bit off the side of each cake because this will actually be the saw them and I don't want these cakes rolling away from me I don't ever really know but I have nightmares little things like that it's not funny so you want to be really careful but essentially you just want to line them all up from biggest to smallest and you can already see like a giant carrot forming you're making a carrot out of carrot the carrot case is made out of carrots and the giant carrot is made out of carrot cake it's a lot guys this strap is I don't mean to interrupt but the strap is really bothering Jeremy we're distracting he is not fascinated enough by the fact that I made a giant carrot so just give me a minute yes Jeremy Jeremy no this is the strap but not a hair of the person I'll be like this Jeremy's like you're good you're good that apron strap my buttercream is nice and set within the layer so it's time to carve [Music] this is a good one because it's really easy to find our model not like watermelons carrithers good models I've seen quite a few carrots in my life so I did it by eye and the good thing is you don't want this case to be perfectly symmetrical I really hate saying that hurts me but you don't you want to see like a realistic natural organic carrot Jocelin right you could even carve like a bump on your carrot I have seen some strange carrots I won't like a Siamese twin carrot it looks like a set of legs wow it was really cool but eventually I have easy this is a great starter tape because even though it's big you could make it at any size and the carving is really easy you don't need to be intimidated by this type of carving this carrot doesn't come - enough of a point at the end for me so what I'm going to do is utilize some of my cake humps and I'm just going to sandwich them to the bottom of the cake so that I can make more of a point I actually trimmed my hump with some circle cutters just to get like all that you know nothing no so that I could create smaller circles at the end of the cake and the carrot would come to a point you [Music] if you want ideas for other Easter cakes you can make that very from really easy to super hard there's and peacefully lives right over here giant carrots to that playlist I'm going to count it from cake Cisco I'm going to crank out this cake with my Italian meringue buttercream and my small offset spatula and then I'm going to put it in the fridge to chill I actually like to have a variety of spatulas around when I'd crumb coating and icing because I always seem to change my mind throughout the process because of this we've put together a crumb coat and chill deluxe bundle at how to cake it calm it includes a variety of spatulas this apron so you know what you're doing so squeeze a lot and this pin may be sir squeeze wants to wear his own well he's like that you know what I mean my crumb coat is chill time to Isis cake one more time with my Italian meringue buttercream and chill it again kaki [Music] the hardest thing about this cake is that you have to cover it and orange fondant and you have to roll out quite a big piece of fondant to cover your whole cake I colored my fondant myself with some orange food coloring and I did add a bit of ivory food coloring just to make the orange a little more natural the one is neon carrot don't trust the neon carrot it's not organic if it's neon you know that means yeah first sign these are these are carrot alternative facts dynalift now that I've rolled on my large sheet of natural orange fondant I pick it up on my French rolling pin by tracing it backwards meaning the icing sugar coated side this piece up and then I pick that up and drape it over the hole [Music] I use my organic hand the to slow's of Stefan jostle it smooths the fondant around the carrot tucking the excess down underneath could you really want to keep that rounded sort of cone shape that I care it has I flew this on it as best I can but I end up cutting away the excess and I left with a very small team on the bottom don't worry it will be covered by the organic greenery that comes out of the carrot I need to make all of the little indents the Lions on carrots that run horizontally across the carrot so I used a sculpting tool actually known as a veining tool and I created all of these lines if your carrot cake is a little soft you want to puncture your cake so feel free to chill it for a bit before you move on a community event this is an organic carrot so I wanted it to appear like fresh from the dirt not too dirty but I just needed to enhance those indents with a little bit of light cocoa powder brush inside let's make up for a carrot in down [Music] you know this is contouring right carrot carrot contouring what - I mean all tourists are doing I know this carrot needs greenery Oh actually it doesn't know so it's already done Jocelyn before I get to be organic greenery on this carrot I need to let you guys know about replication that's the best time ever I am working on a super-secret project and I'm looking for amazing Baker's this is what I want you to do go to the replicate playlist right here choose the cake that you love and make it take it oh yeah help to chop that just works that is so good take a photo and post it on facebook or instagram using the hashtag replicate there's more instructions in the description below replicate or the greenery I made some green fondant just sort of a nice pale natural green and then I rolled it into two of various links they were about a half inch thick and before I was done rolling the tubes I inserted a floral wire down the middle of the tube and then I continued to roll the tube securing the wire inside I created about seven of these tubes with the wire inside I need to join these two together at their base where they grow out of the carrot because if you look at a carrot it's kind of like they're twisted together and then their frame they sprouted from the carrot I use a wooden cake dowel and what I did is I took the exposed wire that is extending from each one of the steps and wrapped it around the dowel because later we'll insert this whole thing into the cake leaving the greenery exposed once your bouquet of green stems is ready we're going to create the leaves before attaching it to the cake for the leaves I rolled out more of my green fondant this time I use the fondant rolling pin and a nonstick mat because I wanted to roll it nice and thin and then I used a just a regular pointed daisy cutter so it's actually a cutter used to make daisies but I'm going to use it in this case to make believe to add them to my stems first I use my sharp paring knife just to make little cuts on the ends of my stem you don't want these stems to be big enough that they'll break off it's just sort of a small detail you can add to add the leaves I brushed on a little bit of clear piping gel and add them to the end of every single stem remember they're at different heights so some of the stems are shorter some are longer all of this will just make it look more natural we're organic as a final touch I just want to paint this greenery with a little bit of green color Duff give it some variation so color dust is just like luster dust without the luster less fancy and I mix it the same way I do luster dust with a little bit of clear food grade alcohol and then I brushed it on all of the stems and all of the leaves and let it dry another good way to tell if a carrot is not organic is if it has sparkly metallic green rings that is a sad one so no neon carrots and no sparkly metallic greenery I don't really do dirt but in this case I surrounded my big giant carrot with a ton of 4000 pounds the greenery is dry it looks great it's ready to go and all we have to do is insert it into the different so we're going to slowly push the dowel and those wires into the carrot until it hits the place of the goonies if you can't get it up tight enough you can just do some or you'll crumble so this is dirt right there right is this organic there would be dirt do not our Medicare is not grow in the ground they do but they don't grow in organic dirt okay right and the other great thing about this big carrot is it is so versatile I mean think about it if you just make some pale yellow fondant you can make a giant parsnip okay everyone wants Maki who doesn't want a giant parsnip and you can make it at a parsnip cake thanks for watching how to cake it don't forget to subscribe and help me hit 3 million and hit that notification bell so that you don't miss the parsnip cake next week we're not doing a participation you're not doing a punishment case to do next week oh yeah yeah yeah and don't forget to replicate it check out the replicate playlist and I can't wait to see your cake I can't wait to see how you take it another one I can't wait I can't I can't over time I just I'm out pond

sheets of paper and then we glued or they glued like the cover on to another book just to show us what it would look like wow this is the first time you're seeing Jeremy this is so exciting look at that Wow but the amount of memories I have so yo tell everyone who you made this book with one of them is at home watching she's sorry she couldn't be here oh yeah I made this book with Jeremy and Connie of course Jeremy took all the beautiful pictures in this book and Connie was here every single day and she was I was dictating to her like as I did things you know I cut it to inches and she was taking notes so we would remember everything cuz every cake in here other than Walter over here I had never made before no and so he did a lot of the creative direction with you ya guys worked so hard and all that little bit we can sell them so them some little detail we obsessed over every shot in this book and not just the final of the cakes I mean every shot of me holding a knife to the edge to tell you how to trim we had many conversations about like you know just holding the knife like this show that they should hold it on we just had so many was just and then I remember that two and a half days we went away yes it today grass so tell them about that so then finally well the book is published by HarperCollins and they printed it all along these big sheets of paper we the three of us Connie Jocelyn I went away to Niagara Falls and have to go through it and read every single step see how it says step by step by step by step by step by step there just wasn't room on the book for that no that was too much text um but I just don't want you to think all these kinks are two steps not show them not actually because we get a teeth of the eggs okay guys leave a comment if you've been playing cake quiz yeah with us leave a comment Walter made it in Walter has put his contract that he has to always be a part of habit so of course he's in that first habit cake cake cake book um this I made in honor my son he is crazy for any kind of construction vehicle yes yes when we went to Iceland he was less impressed by seeing like glaciers and geysers every time you saw a crane or bulldozers and then this is a candy apple this was a really fun shoot I feel like we shot this really really late Jeremy I think he shot everything really late yeah Oh a night late at night yeah okay we can't we can't show them inside the bus but a little bit give a bit of a quick tease and that ease that by step by step there's actually only one cake in here guys and this is how many steps there [Laughter] tell them what is actually in there so we have all your basics and then we have all the basics so these are the recipes I like to make to build a cake because the type of cakes I make structures really important so I love baking all kinds of cakes but some of them aren't the best for building cakes that need to like stand up um I was really when we came up with the ideas for the cakes in this book I really wanted that them to be cakes that you could make it home so I didn't want to put things in it that you know are harder to reach or harder to get a hold of depending on where you live I wanted everything to be as accessible as possible and I wanted to do things that were adaptable and fun and everyone could relate to make their own version make your own versions like the crown like you can make that crown any color any color add any of your own kin yeah I actually made why I wanted to make a crown well a people do call me the Queen okay and Who am I to say and because I made my son a crown for his baptism and it was blue and it was beautiful this and it was different but I really wanted to make Sochi like a queen oh yeah see it's a Meyer for the female yeah show us a few shots that aren't cakes there's some beautiful shots of you there's like chapter shutters like my favorite recipes that I used to make these cakes so for example there's my ultimate vanilla cake we can see that which is on the blog but here's a visual it's so you want to stand right now man how many times I throw that sugar Jeremy how many times people don't understand many times I like spread the vanilla bean yeah to the right consistency you know so what's the picture of you at the veining of the chapters this is me oh yeah okay what are the chapter I love our chapter names remember it's not the first things that we sat around and yes what are the chapters so the chapters are let me go to the table of contents so the chapters are okay there's yos recipe box which contains all the recipes then there's Janos where I teach you things like this is how you should color fondant and this is how you should color buttercream and then when we get to the cakes chapter

you're watching how to cake it I'm Yolanda and this week I made a rocky road ice cream sandwich if you love cake Angelov ice cream and you have ice cream cake please share this video we would really appreciate it just click the button below share it wherever you like it's not ice cream love it don't deprive them give them your ice cream so I just live special I make eight pounds of my Yas ultimate chocolate cake I folded in marshmallows one and chocolate chips mom I bake the cake in baking trays like trays that I normally make cookies on I have never done that on panicky it's monumental it is orhan insert monumental needed ice cream festival and icy cold yes a golden one now from these two rocky road case I want to get three layers of cake to build up my ice cream sandwich so from each cake I cut one whole strips of the appropriate size and then one half strip so now I have two full strips and two half shifts that will make up pelea first ways was up to the challenge and help me simple syrup all of my rocky road cake layer it's not just chocolate cake right it has more attitude kind of like me with an ice cream tattoo you all right now you better like it don't ya ten of the pony tells you they don't let my hat to do I throw anything like mr. t I pity the fool tells me they don't like my tattoos these temporary tattoos are actually a set of four and they come in our summer time bundle which is available at how to keep it calm now that the simple syrup has soaked in I want to stack and fill these cakes with my Italian meringue buttercream like ice cream in an Ice Cream Sandwich vanilla iced at a full layer on the bottom buttercream then I use my two half layers to make one full layer butter cream and then the final four layer time to crumb coat giant cake and get it in the fridge to chill I always point over there as if that's what rich kid yeah we just don't put her in the interview she's a little you know she's very stainless steel II now I need to make the giant rectangular cookies that will sandwich this delicious cake and some buttercream later on for this I'm making some chocolate sugar cookies it's simply made by creaming together butter sugar brown sugar vanilla are you with me salt you know that pinch then when that's nice and light and fluffy I add in some eggs and finally I add my dark cocoa flour cornstarch to this in water mix the dough till it's fully incorporated but often some dry ingredients get caught at the bottom of usual so turn it out knead it on the table so it's fully incorporated and then chill your dough for about 30 minutes wrap it up tight and fast once my dough is chilled I'm going to roll it out onto some silicone baking mat roll down to a big rectangle cut all four sides straight and then I sort of round into the coins just a texture like an I treat them [Music] finally I'm going to use a piping tip to cut all the perforated schools that are in the city of a new suspect so I did this the same way I did it to my giant graham cracker cookie and my morphing not you better check yourself before you wreck yourself okay I did I just mix mr. t and ice cube I'm cold after I've cut out two cookies that are the exact same size with the rounded corners and all the perforated holes I'm going to chose my cookie dough because it's warm and it goes into a really hot oven and it just has such a crisp you want it to be nice and chilled and then place it in a hot oven apple doesn't kill that cookies before baking them because they're not spread that wasn't that wasn't I lost my sister to you I baked my cookies I'm taking them out of the oven to cool completely we are going to put this ice-cream sandwich together my cookies were completely cooled and I need to begin by picking one of them off the pen and flipping it upside that wasn't scary [Music] time to take out my case which is the inside of this ice-cream sandwich this wasn't scary either I had to lift up the cake and place it on top of the upside-down cookie Center and it went well I was afraid of the Christmas break and went well didn't break finally I need to spread a little bit of buttercream on top of my cake so that the top cookie will stick and then I carefully remove that cookies and place it on top of the cakes right-side up it's time to recreate the ice cream part of this ice cream sandwich and speaking of ice cream if you love ice cream cake we have a whole playlist right here it's popsicle in the toilet he is a frozen dessert yes I think you've got to be right we would like frozen yogurt in yes we would let so they answer this list well not me personally but you don't do survey kind of turn to this light dessert some on a light dessert I'd have some strawberries that's where I stand now that the cake is assembled there should be sort of a border around the case of buttercream lifts cookie I suppose a piping bag with a big round tip and pipes the buttercream in onto the sides of the cake [Music] then I use my spatula to spread it all around and a bench scraper to get it flush with the sides of the ice-cream sandwich she's my old dancer so what this is very easy which goes with - you're teasing and this really amazes but I'm taking this a step further you know how mr. t wears like a ton of change yeah I need to put some change on this edge big damage of I change I mean like chocolate walnut marshmallows and chocolate chips and sprinkles I need to chill this cake so that the buttercream is nice and firm before I add my topping the first thing I did was melt some compound chocolate so that I could pipe it onto the surface of my Ice Cream Sandwich cake and let it drift down the side I want to create a really clean diagonal line but actually laid a piece of cardstock paper which is just like sturdy paper on top so that I wouldn't get like a wavy line and wanted a nice line so it looked like it had been dipped I really want a fixed ice cream so yes lunch that's what we're going to happen looks good you know I could pour chocolate on the cake I'm making next it's another fruit that people often different chocolate the bit of a CD case like Walter it is it is so to create my uh what do I call it and yeah but it's not all over like their life remember this picture yeah there's a band of it so okay so what your thing is with your topic you organize them and strip yes I did organize a line of chopping to be fair it was randomly placed topping in a line give it some marshmallows I'm talking about chocolate chips of walnuts don't forget my sprinkle did is a fool who doesn't get a sprinkle returnees Bock these are the same sprinkles I'm using on Kent cake right now I'm here with you but I am also live on face a cat if you miss carrot cake this summer don't worry we'll be doing another one soon I have to tell you something dropping insult everyone let me tell you something that has made me very obsessed oh no everyone likes to ask what I do with the cake and often I give them away and up until now Jeremy has been very accepting but he now placed a cake ban on me chocolate cake Spence okay the week before I had three cakes in my fridge what is the mmm Lauren why would you take tissue three cakes if you love ice cream cake I have a playlist right here and if you love giant suitcase I have another playlist right here and you can subscribe right here thank you for watching don't forget to share this video with an ice-cream lover I fit in a fool who doesn't share this video oh you back a bit of a fool 
welcome back to how to cake it I'm Yolanda and this week I am gonna teach you how to cake the Big Apple not New York City a Big Apple to begin making the Big Apple cake we need to make 10 pounds of my ultimate vanilla cake batter in four round pans thank you what a beautiful shiny Apple what's your name Oh Apple that's very original once the cakes are baked and cooled we're going to remove them from their pans level them and remove the caramelization from the bottom the next thing I need to do is simple syrup all four layers who can tell me what simple syrup is that's part of the equation what is done to the water and sugar yeah now you put your head ooh I can tell what kind of student you were okay so now that the simple syrup has soaked into my four vanilla cake layers I'm going to stack this cake in two parts to begin with two of my cakes are eight inches round and two of them are nine inches round I'm going to sandwich them together with some Italian meringue buttercream I built this cake in two parts because I want to create the center with seeds just like a real apple and if you've had an apple in half horizontally you can see that the center is like a star-shaped Center that holds the seeds I believe the technical term is star shaped center of Apple do you mean the corn cake or I see you have your phone out Jocelyn there no fullness allowed in class now that both my cakes have chilled and the filling is set I want to stack them on top of each other just the way they are stacking the bigger cake on top of the smaller cake begin to carve the Big Apple down orhan insert Big Apple music what can I say about carving an apple Apple really helped thank you I rounded out the top carving away slowly I made a valley in the center where the stem will later go New York can you fire Broadway [Music] you see how they like in depth and then they kind of have feet but something weird happening I had a really hard time carving an apple it's so interesting to me when I make a cake that I think the carving won't stump me and then I start to carve it and then like why doesn't it look like an apple at one point Jeremy asked me if I was making a molar if anyone is interested in seeing me make a giant molder cake please leave a hashtag below hashtag giant molar cake and should it have a cavity I decided to just taper this Apple in a bit more I think that's where it's going wrong I need to make it look less like a molar more like an apple and when I'm happy with my shape I take the top cake off the bottom cake and flip it over some of the flat side and it is time to create the star Apple Center I'm actually using a calyx cutter that I have just because it has five petals like the star in the center of an apple then I use a leaf cutter that I had that was the perfect sort of teardrop shape to indent five teardrops in the center of each cake now I'm going to scoop the cake out of those teardrops using just a simple metal spoon scooping it out and essentially what will happen is now that both halves have these indents when I line the cake up together that will make up the core I want to line these cavities before I put the other secret chambers yes I got something right excellent Jocelyn and you're paying attention that was a test once the Apple secret chambers are ready and carved I want to coat them with a little bit of chocolate I just melted some white and I actually added a touch of green because it always has that fresh look it's very subtle and what I did is brush that chocolate on to each one of the secret chambers with a paintbrush this kind of works like a crumb coat so I can place my seeds in before I place my seeds into the secret chambers I want to spread a little bit of Italian meringue buttercream with a small offset spatula on that layer of cake for the seeds of my Apple I chose to use Brazil nuts week after a lovely brown skin reminded me of ourselves and then I took the top cake flipped it over and made sure to align the secret chain there was secret chamber alignment this is an advanced class and yet there's so much now class I hope you've been paying attention now that my cake has been sculpted and assembled what is the next step in this process if you need help with your crumb coat and chill we do have crumb coat and chill bundles at how to kick it calm and we even have back-to-school bundles when I went back to school they didn't have pencils with cake puns on them but now they do we change that at how to cake it and they are in the back to school bundles we should have a ruler with a cake bun joseline joseline please call Connie after class Thank You professor cake duty ace one more time yes we do joseline there's no need for the back is there ivory in the sink no there was a bit added to be colored but you don't see that it's like pre-colored my father i iced the Big Apple one more time with Italian meringue buttercream and place it in the fridge to church while my cake is chilling I have decided to work on the stem-and-leaf for this Apple to make my leaf I'm gonna roll out some green gum paste and nice and thin and then I'm using an impression mat that I have it's actually of a rose leaf but I thought I would work here and you just press your gum paste between these two mats to give them that greening that a leaf has and then I trim the leaf to a nice shape with a sharp paring knife and dry it on some crumpled paper towel you don't want to flat partly if you want a realistic leaf that kind of looks like it's already drying up a bit well I know most of the time when you go to the grocery store the apples don't have the leaves but I always find it really special when I get an apple this is really fun have we not discuss this perform that we shall do there's a strawberry the strawberry is the opposite most of the time they don't have the stem yeah and then you feel special with an apple I feel special and they're still over your father but I'm happy with my leaf I work on the stem of the Apple I used the same green gum paste that I just sort of lightened up a little and then I rolled it into a cord it's just a tiny bit thicker at one end trimmed it to the right length and then I inserted a floral wire inside this will help me place it into my cake and help keep the stand up right on it I wanted to create a bit of a curve on the stem so I just bent it ever so slightly and then I placed the exposed wire down into a cake dummy to allow my stem to dry the top right I'm headed back to the Big Apple I wish that was actually true right now I'm talking about my Big Apple cake and it's time to cover it in fondant I rolled my red fondant into a large enough sheet to cover the whole Apple I then picked up my sheet of fondant on a French rolling pin draped it over the Apple and began to smooth the fondant onto the cake this is really tricky because the cake is tall it's narrower at the bottom and it also has a valley at the top so there is going to be air trapped under that valley to release that air I use a straight pin I just make a slight hole in the center and use my fingertips to smooth the fondant down releasing the air through the hole and you don't have to worry about the hole because the stem will cover it up later smooth the fondant all around the Apple this can be really tricky when a cake is very tapered at the bottom because you get a lot of folds the fondant just folds up onto itself because there's more fondant than cake so take your time and really smooth it around pull the folds apart and smooth the fondant to the cake I did have some tearing and cracking in my fondant because it took a while to smooth all of it around the cake this is really common with tall cakes and also I find when I have fondant that has been dyed or needed a lot it can tend to crack a little bit more than untouched fondant so what I'm happy about is this cake will later be painted but I can also patch these cracks now that my fondant is chilled I'm going to use some my leftover fondant and make a paste listen up there is a new Jeremy I see you on your phone what do I normally mix with fondant to create a fondant water Thank You Jocelyn Jeremy just I think you should give up on the hand because it's not gonna work in this fast alcohol as we know evaporates faster than water that's why I paint with it and I thought maybe that will help my paste dry faster and a little more now so that it went into all the cracks and tears and folds and crevices you can just cover anything up and it was incredibly hot so what happens when it's hot is and humid do you fondant it can be very sweaty on the surface and this is sometimes not sometimes this makes it harder to work with so what I did to smooth my pace this time is I actually used a damp or wet paintbrush and in this case I wasn't that upset about having to do this because it added to the texture of the Apple look on the bright side sometimes things happen to teach you something those are called life lessons and Jocelyn's not but I do love that you tried bonded face into life is thatis for me it's a life lesson okay it's time to paint this food coloring is very intense it's very concentrated and it's always a little bit on the bright side except for ivory to paint my Apple I actually created two paints so one with some red food coloring and clear food grade alcohol and the other was some golden yellow mixed with a touch of white and cleared food grade alcohol and this is to help make the yellow more opaque first thing I'm gonna do is paint the entire Apple in one direction so that's up and down from the inside of the valley all the way down to the bottom with my red paint the next thing I'm going to do is then take some of my nice yellow paint that was a different brush I'm gonna paint areas again in the same direction but not the whole a whole just sort of patches of this yellow and that's because you've Apple please you can see areas right on Apple yeah yeah like she's not just plain red right there's spots and there's like these little patches and variations Thank You Apple you're gonna get an apple after class wonder if apples need apples and I also use some my yellow paint and speckled the Apple so just getting some paint on end of my paint brush and using my fingertip and basically flicking the paint towards the Apple if you'd like to pre-order my upcoming cake book you can get it before it's even on the Shelf through the links below the book has easy-to-follow steps to make 20 new cakes never before seen on this channel plus Walter because he forced me and I can assure you the steps will really help you much more than I do here you're pretty good yeah I'm good I'm good I'm good but there's editing involved well there was editing in a book ok fair time to add my stem and my leaf but before that I do want to add a little bit of paint and color to those items items the parts to those parts of the Apple to paint my leaves I am using some dry green and yellow color dust the same color dust I use on my strawberry leaf for the stem I'm actually gonna use some Brown gel food coloring just a dot of it and a clean dry brush and I'm gonna brush that gel on in an upward motion because when you really look at an Apple stem you can see that it is sort of a green base right this is the part that was attached to the tree and then as it dries out it starts to turn so I decide on what part of the Apple I like as the front and then I insert my stem down into the center and finally I attach is your coffee good Jared did you bring me one no actually I never understood why people brought teachers apples if I was a teacher I would want you to bring me coffee and then we're gonna add the leaf my leaf was just propped between my stem and the top of the Apple but you can use a little bit of royal icing to hold it in place community to this Big Apple is the perfect super shiny Apple to give to any professor even though she'd rather have coffee if you're getting ready to go back to school share this video with your friends I hope it makes you feel better thank you for joining me on how to kick it classes next Tuesday if you like giant food cakes there's a playlist right here and there's also a back-to-school playlist right here that you can also share it oh and everyone subscribe you'll get an A+ 
you're watching how to take it I'm Yolanda and they're all the rage so I decided to take a how to cake it digit spinner out of cake to make this business better cake I baked 10 pounds of my ultimate chocolate cake in four round pins the first thing I need to do is remove all four of my chocolate cakes from their pans and level them make sure to save your cake hump we're going to use them later Oh save the hump now I'm going to cut each cake into two layers if your whole tom is crave and you agree that fidgets spinner should be edible please share this video with all your fidget spinning friends I don't think I have anything consistent oh my son my son that count right yes sir squeeze is in the house as usual people don't stay in the house enough anymore time you got to be like so squeezes into half I feel like you should cheer when I say it like we're at a house party kitten play is over there or put in a house where you drop it okay there's okay I can't wait to see where Hans house party graphic excellent don't forget there is please it's part of our consult and show bundles and the herbs back and stuff that how to keep that like you know how to save your booze in the house of his crew anywhere without in bundles have you met offset spatula I need to give a proper shout out because someone else is in the house today it's the half man who made my fidget spinner turntable for me it's essentially like a lazy susan or a turntable but in the shape of digits minute so I just want to thank the hacks with so much because this morning is impossible without now I need to use my fidget spinners turntable just the top part not the turning part and I'm going to lay it upside down onto my largest round cake and now I need to trim away the parts that are sticking out the board that will become the center of my statistic I now say it's one of the 10 inch layers that I've carved away into the center of the fidgets spinner board I'm going to carve each of my seven inch cakes to butt up against the center cake completely covering my digits spinner shapes board that's a really easy thing to say now I have one layer of chocolate cake on the fidgets spinner shaped for the next thing I need to do is fill this cake and for that I've decided to dye some buttercream a nice shade of pink like a nice punchy how to cake it because this is a how-to cake it fidgets spinner so now I'm going to take this beautiful punchy pink buttercream and ice the top of this digits ability or what's the center of the picture okay once I have a nice layer of buttercream on I'm going to top the fidgets center with the other four layers of cake so they all need to be carved just like the first layers and fit in place completing the shape now guess what my DJ presidential from code and chill I've decided to come focus in Klingon Italian Ori buttercream and I use the small spatula just really gluing all the comments to the phidget spinner and then actually I chose a conical children to be spinning oh no no no no no no I wanted to let go wow this is my new participant it's time to ice my fidget Center cake one more time in a car alluring buttercream and chill it remember now chumps I told you to say we're going to use them now to recreate the center part of the fidget spinner which probably has me leave it in the comments below if you know what a skull and what I'm going to do is take one of my house level it a bit and create that little circular disks that sort of rest on top and bottom of the kitchen where you spent I used a small cake pan and a circle cutter to achieve the spinner shape I was looking for since this is a how-to cake it fidgets spinner I'm going to put sweets on each end I'm going to use my phidget spinner to help me decide what kind of dessert to have that's a great use right so I'm planning to make a tiny pie a tiny cake and a tiny doughnut well they're not really tiny the doughnut was real size I'm going to create my small cake for this I've again leveled one of my cake house and use a small pan to cut out a circle now I want to layer this tiny little piece taken two layers just like a cake for my small pie once again using a cake pan to cut out a circle but I also need to bevel this circle the way that a piping tip so I'm doing this upside down diffusing a small serrated knife to cut an a-line cut and create small pie finally I need to create my zone for this I cut out the same sized circle of cake from a cake hump and then I use a small serrated knife to essentially carve a doughnut and then using a circle cutter cutting out the center and rounding out that little Valley as well I really felt like eating a doughnut while making this that's just some personal information for others but I want to make sure that all three of my desserts are the same size on the ends of my fidgets spinner so I'm using the same size cake pans to carpet.this we admit the house we have such a good time as the last party we invited him again did you bring a bundle I just want to be clear sir squeezes bundle is not the only bundle in industry there is the summertime bundle that's - there's nothing like a summertime party right make sure to get yours at how to kick it calm once the simple things were soaked in Ivan crumb coated all of these cake parts the center of the fidgets Center the dullness of pie images oh and I also remember how I cut the cake into layers I filled it first and rounded chill time now I need to ice all four of these little cakes one more time in Italian meringue buttercream with the help of Sur squeezes bundle I'd be nothing about four squeezes and fumble are you interested in cocoa are you fair enough of those no back to the main digit spinner cake that sounds millions husband means finches so I decided to roll out my Till's on it into one huge sheets and then carefully pick it up onto a french rolling pin and drape it over working quickly I use my hands to smooth it down the fidget spinner really working on all of the edges first the corner first because that's where fundable to tear there was some mild cracking which I'll address later but for the most part of very happy and then I used a sharp paring knife to cut it I had to hold my knife parallel to the stingy spinner board that was made and run it along the base cutting away the excess I want places take images to chill so that the fondant can stiffen up a bit and I can address these small tears and cracking in the meantime I'm going to cover the top of the pivot Center the little top that I created in the same teal fondant I decided to cover the center of the fidgets spinner in two parts because I had I stood upside down so first i draped my teal fondant over one side and trimmed it and then i flip the cake over spread on a thin layer of buttercream and covered that side as my fields line we need to stop all this spinning for a minute and talk about the replicate contest remember a while back I asked you guys to replicate some of my cakes in your very own way and we have chosen the winners whose cakes will appear in my upcoming face book it's so exciting I've actually seen it myself your work printed in my book and they looked incredible we will be announcing the name of each winner over on my Instagram so head over to my account the handle is right here or you can always just search the hashtag replicate if you'd like to preorder my book the link is in the description below you can order it right now before it even hits the shelves I'm going to use some of my leftover teal fondant to create a fondant piece to fill in the cracks on my main digits inner cake I create a bit of fondant paste with some left over to your fondant and some water and what I like to do is just work the water in with a small spatula just sort of blending it until it reaches the consistency of royal icing now that my pace is a perfect consistency I'm going to apply it to the top edges of my citrus cake I like to use a small spatula and I just sort of iced it into the crap crap ourselves Center is made now we got to get to the little cakes on top first I'm going to work on my tiny little pie first thing I did was create the foil container that pies are often baked in for this I rolled out some grey fondant and covered my pie which is now upside down then I took some tin foil and crumpled it up and use this to texture the fondant and make it look like well crumpled up foil so I used crumbled up foil to create consoled up foil once I'm happy with my foil texture on my pie I then place it in the fridge to chill so that I can paint it now that the fondant is a little bit more sturdy I'm going to paint the gray fondant silver to look like foil so I just mix a little bit of silver luster dust with clear food grade alcohol and brush it all over my pie shell you don't have to brush the top because this cake will be turned over and nobody will see the bus once my paint is dry I can create the pie on top so what I did is roll out some red fondant a circle of red fondant and then I just sort of poked it sorry I don't have a more technical term for that I want to you know hope eyes don't look perfectly yes right so just wanted it to look like the top of a pot and then I laid it on top of my chocolate cake now I need to recreate the lattice pastry on the pie it's so much fun so what you do is dry your fondant to look like pastry so I used ivory chocolate and once you're happy with the color you're going to roll it out and then cut strips and I cut my strip without a ruler the pie it has to look rustic right right improve it it don't use that perfectly rustic don't use that word rustic and organic and then I'm going to create the lattice on top of the pie so you lay down three strips in the same direction then you bend them halfway back then you lay a strip down then you put it over that I'm not going to describe the full process but you want it to look these are intertwined so each strip should go over and they're over and under over and under and the next thing I want to do is paint these strips to look like a big-time library yes chocolate surprise I mixed my ivory with clear food grade alcohol and I painted each strip with my paint and as a final touch I will know it's not quite final almost final touch I sprinkled some sugar on to the pastry - I love that on a pie I love that like crispy sugary crust to recreate the look of a cooked pie I put some jam into a parchment paper bag and then I just typed it over my red fondant and all the exposed parts between my lattice mark engineering cake engineer yeah you'll and again I wear a tinfoil ring to prove it I'm gonna put one on and go to like an engineering convention and when I get there I'm going to be like this engineer is in the house I'm guessing I get kicked out right there I'm going to move on and save my doughnut my favorite kind of doughnut is chocolate bits of chocolate leaves because YUM I roll out my chocolates on it and then I touch a band and use that band to cover the inside interfere with the job I just the rest of my chocolate on it over the donut moving it around trim away the excess underneath the bottom and then I trim away the center hole as for my plays I'm using modeling chocolate I rolled out my modeling chocolate and drape it over the top of the donut and then I use the sharp paring knife to just sort of cut it in a you know a wavy circle around the donut is if it displays that was poured on I really wanted to do that I'm not going to like it every donut needs sprinkles I feel the first thing I'm going to do is brush on a little bit clear piping gel onto my modeling chocolate and then sprinkle the donut I actually use real sprinkles I didn't create some up on it because this donut in the light side strawberry seeds took me over the edge I just I need a minute finally I guess make the tiny shape so I covered my cake first with yellow fondant and trimmed away the excess and then I covered the top with some punchy pink fondant and I want to treat like a scalloped edge around the side as if that had been poured also like a glaze over the case but this time I wanted my scallop to be seasoned unlike my donut because that was enough random actions my cake is almost done but I feel it really needs some rosettes as any bakery pieces have so for that I'm softening a little bit of white fondant with vegetable shortening and placing it into my clay extruder and I'm using the face plate of the place to do that creates a rope it's actually you know what it's actually kind of this shape it's this shape the face plate and once you've extruded the cord you then just twist it slightly to get that rope effect and wind them up on each other creating the look of like a pipe tool set but it's fondant wanted to create the type of bakery cake that has you know the marks of where you're supposed to cut it already and slice it I cut out a parchment paper circle I then folded it into twelve equal sections now I'm going to use that as a template on top of my tiny cake and then I use a ruler and my sharp paring knife to join the lines create the slice marks you don't want to cut deep you just want to see the line now that my tiny cake is divided into 12 slices I'm going to glue the rosettes on to the candidature slices a little bit of clear piping I'm going to top each one of my rosettes with a cherry and in this case I'm using a small red candy B because of surface size it's time to assemble this digit spinner but before that I want to label it as a headache it's kitchen spinner I've rolled out some black fondant nice and thin and then I use some letter cutters to cut out HP I then place the center of my fidget spinner you guessed it in the center of my fidget Center gluing it on with a little bit of royal icing bit this this stopped really stressful because the spinner the fidgets that are kept spinning Oh Derrick how dare it do what it said it was going to do finally I drew on all three of my mini cakes my mini cherries hi my mini notes my regular size chocolate glazed doughnut pen my mini cake please

subscribe this channel and make sure to hit that notification bell so you know when I've made a new crappy cake this is your freezing this I am or good yeah it makes poop from the upcoming emoji movie chocolate is going to go on a while my two 8-inch round and two seven inch round chocolate cakes are out of the pen I'm going to level them and then as an and layers and peach into two layers next up I call into squeeze he's relaxing I feel calm chillin if you're wondering if we bought a pool floatie sisters please of course didn't we taken everyone to fill this poop cake I am using both chocolate ganache and chocolate buttercream and I'm also going to add some mini chocolate chips to the chocolate it's what's on the inside that counts I am redefining to that's what I'm doing I'm taking the words back we're going to make it ours we're going to make it positive this poop cake is like rich and chocolatey and delicious I'm going to make poop number one oh yeah now I have eight layers of cake stacked up and filled with alternating layers of ganache and chocolate buttercream in chocolate chip rich Jeremy how did it it smell it only will say like oh he thinks his poop doesn't stink his food doesn't I think who doesn't think he smells like chocolate on chocolate on chocolate you may have noticed something new about me I did it I got tattoos if you guys want your own tattoo temporary of course we have limited quantities of watermelon birthday cupcake and then we also have my giant chocolate chip mint ice cream called and my pasty being had a cake a temporary tattoo have already been sent out to keep the club members and their also in the summertime bunnies you can get your own at how to take it calm join wrestling now that my cupcake is chilled and the buttercream is set it's time to carve him into a piece of well you took a big drop right I use my serrated knife and I carved poop I did made myself a template it was just flat but I sort of used it to hold up against the cake and make sure my peak was high enough he was sort of rounded enough has like some girth at the bottom even with simple shapes is important to carve away little by little because it's easier to just keep carving than it is to try and put it back you don't want to have to build cake back up because it could end up looking like the very thing I'm carving right now I'm really happy with this piece of so I am going to crumb coat him in you know if you want to see more emoji cakes and other character cake there's a playlist right here [Music] time to I try poop cake once again in chocolate ganache and chill him a final time I don't know if you've seen the trailers of his upcoming movie but who obviously thinks he's hot so I'm going to put them in the fridge to chill out I need to make some of poops facial features now because they are going on underneath the fondant so first I want to make his eyeballs I've rolled out some white gum paste I need to cut an oval and as I roll I kind of create a little hump because I wanted us to be like two dimensional that's helping you Bryn I roll out more white gum paste and use my template for the shape he's definitely laughing about thank you to me probably the fact would be cold food probably for his eyebrows I rolled out some modeling chocolate cut out the shape of his eyebrows using my templates and then I gave him some texture with a veining tool this one's got some thick eyebrows I just want to put it up there for his pupils I'm rolling out some black fondant really really thin using a small oval cutter to cut them out and then I'm going to create a little bit of shine in his eye I just use my template to mark out where that triangle is and what I do to accentuate it is paint the entire pupil with a little bit of black food coloring and not paint best inner triangle that little triangle is less matte black and the recipes people is a shiny alert block oh yes I'll look it up fit your hands like a meaning that's somewhere ridiculous here's something I love about poop he is so different you know how a lot of my character cakes have catch lights and if you don't check out that play I mentioned earlier poops catch light r-square that's what makes poop so fabulous he has black Ashworth this print white bow tie I'm rolling out some white gum paste nice and thin get this full time looks like a minute that's hawlucha here like if you were pooped would you choose a white botas is risky it's just good I was thinking about how to create the linen texture and the best thing I thought of on the slide was I had some canvas plain canvas I laid it on top and then rolled my fondant pin over it and that created that linen texture in my gum pain then I cut out two equal sized bands and pinched both ends of each band together now I need to fold the two pinched ends up onto each other creating a loop and to keep that loop open I just took a little bit of cleaver towel rolled it up and put it inside so just something a soft cushion to allow it to drive out with finally I need to make the center part of the bone so I cut out a little band from my linen gum paste and wrap it around those two bows where they meet in the center before I cover poop I need to add his eyeballs and history I add them directly onto the ganache surface I use my template to help guide where they should be and now that they're secure it's time to cover poop in chocolate fondant what if somebody tunes in like right there it's time to cover poop in chocolate fondant I roll out my chocolate fondant large enough to cover this whole piece of poop and then I pick it up with my French rolling pin and drape it over I'm going to smooth this cake with my hands because while he's like give me soft using my fingertips to really smooth around the eyeballs and the grin I tell as much fun as they can underneath and trim away the excess [Music] now it's time to cut open till I focus on golf also what if you tuned in right here basically his eyeballs are completely covered and I need to help poopsie the light of day so I'm going to use a sharp paring knife and I'm going to cut the fondant that is on the bottom half of his eyes and then around the eyeball this way the fondant that remains looks like eyelid I also need to unleash his grin on the world because what a grim I use a sharp paring knife once again to cut away the excess and reveal his to perfect teeth it's the thing I love most about this emoji movie is that it's about self love and being your best self no matter what anyone else thinks of you

I need to do poops hair for his very crossed ways I take some chocolate fondant and just create so it was like a big long teardrop actually at one point it was dangerously close to poop not gonna lie - poop is a bit of a hipster look at me error hipster right with a linen bowtie yes linen go time he's bringing back the wave yeah I think I saw one I think they won't get that Torontonians you you know exactly where possible so I've created this sort of long teardrop with a point at the end and then I actually used some more chocolate fondant underneath his bangs at the back just to prop up that way OOP needs his pupils his eyebrows i glue them onto his face is a little bit of clear piping gel and now he should people charming you know he's the traveling piece of poop I think now I need to make his arms and leg and to get a sense of how long I want them to be I'm going to place poop on the cakes and I roll out two chords with chocolate fondant and I'm going to place a wire inside each tube to help prop up this way you know stick legs good yep move that stick legs stick legs on like long thin feet and then I also shape his foot at the end so bending that tube and then just shaping his foot enemy to it while I make the arms I just need to leave these legs in the position they're going to new place so I hold them up against the cheeks and and bend his knees and I'm just gonna leave them to the side of poop for now while I move onto the arms for his arms I want them to be like fixing and adjusting his bow time so I make them similar to the way that I made its legs and feet and actually the bottom or the top like this I roll this on it a little flatter and then use a knife to cut out fingers and then I gently use my fingertips to sort of round out so sharp edges that I cut so they look like it's three three fingers in the fun [Music] now it's time to place his hands and legs onto the cake so unfortunately I have to lift him off the stand so I can secure his legs and arms on the stand and then I place the arms on on either side keeping in mind that I want this position and against just his full time now I need to move poop back on the stand with the help

welcome back to how to kick it I'm Yolanda I'm still sitting in a sprinkle chair and this week I am taking a giant takeout box of Chinese fried rice one of my favorite foods to begin baking this cake I baked eight pounds of my ultimate chocolate batter in an 11 by 15 rectangular pan my cake is cooled and leveled and now I need to cut it into 4 equal portions which involves it's quite tricky to level a rectangular cake sometimes the center isn't as level so I took the opportunity to look at each little rectangle and make sure it was level now it is time for Sur SWE's a lot to help me I never calm so squeeze a lot anymore it's just there sweets you've shortened it yeah he's back home in yeah soon it'll just be Sur just call me sir just call me sir Andy's gonna go through Tommy's please days personally oh ok so like that mean speaking of sir squeeze a lot squeeze sir squeeze what was it squeeze face please squeeze face this week we've got all the tools I use on sale and how to keep calm including sir squeeze in our bundle up sale our people bundling up all over the world or is it still just us the simple syrup has soaked in and now it is time to fill and stack all four of my pieces of cake with Italian meringue buttercream I love the look of like chocolate cake and white buttercream I just love the way it looks it's so satisfied once it's completely filled I place the cake in the fridge to camp now that my buttercream is nice and chilled it is time to carve this into the shape of a takeout box so what I need to do is cut out set a line in a while that I need to make a line cuts on all four sides of this cake so to help me measure I placed a cake board on top that was a half inch smaller all the way around the cake then I made a mark was my knife along the sides of that cake board and then I used a ruler and the tip of my knife to draw a line on the sides of the cake from that top mark down to the bottom corner now I'm using my serrated knife I cut two opposite sides first then I turn the cake once again use my ruler to make those marks and cut the two remaining sets so it's like an upside down tickle boxers always start upside down always it's like my day once I'm happy with the shape I crumb coat and chill making while my crumb coat is chilling I'm going to make the flaps that will become the lid of the box so you know how takeout box is sort of open like this I need to make those flaps so what I decided to do and what's really easy to do at home is I took some cardboard the same type of cardboard that they make cake boards out of but a thin piece and I cut the shape of my flaps and why I'm choosing to do this is for two reasons one to help them be sturdy I won't have to worry about breaking them and I can leave some exposed cardboard at the bottom that will go down into the cake and then help support the side whereas if it was solid gum paste even pushing that down into the cake I break it and make it soggy before applying my gum paste to my cardboard I need to brush on a thin layer of clear piping gel lay it on carefully pushing out any air bubbles and then I flip the cardboard over and with a sharp paring knife cut away the excess gum paste once you cover the one side also make sure to trim the gum piece at the bottom nice and straight because that's what will meet your cake when we push the cardboard in now that all four flaps are covered on one side we're going to flip them all over and you guessed it do the same thing on the other side the only difference here is at the ends we also want to just fold the gum paste over so we don't see that line of cardboard through at the end of this process now you can enter this what do I do next Jocelyn you ice the cake and chill it over on our new channel how to kick it step by step we have some fun cake compilations going on you can click right here to see my four hot drinks cake compilation you can just veg at home watching our four hot drinks cake compilation wearing your 99 problems hoodie which is also a part of our bundle oops see how I bundled up all that information it's time to measure with the ruler again did I mention my love of rulers we want to take these measurements so that we can roll our white fondant into slabs that we will use to cover all four sides and the bottom of this cake roll your fondant slabs just slightly wider and higher than every side and the bottom it is time to cut and apply them to the cake so first I'm going to apply the bottom just because the cake is already upside down now it's time to cover the sides of the cake so the first thing I want to do is take the two slabs that are meant for these sides and trim them to the exact height of my cake and then I lay them up against the side smooth it on and to trim the excess I use a sharp knife and I sort of stand over the cake looking down that way I know I'm running my knife along the exact same a line angle as the change once the excess is trimmed from both sides now I can cover the front and back of my taken box place the slabs on the front and back one at a time smooth it on and then again using my paring knife and a slow hand trimming that excess fondant on the a line like keeping a close eye on it I kind of like wink when I do it I know you know a wink I guess but I acted it out for you if you like Chinese takeout or rulers or tea squares or winking while making a line cuts and fondant please share this video I'm sure the last reason is going to be of course of course so now my Chinese takeout box is all covered all trimmed and you know what I want to do I'm still the seam hider so I just want to address those scenes now to be fair at a go box does have some seams does but I didn't want them to be like too pronounced and I'm addicted to see my day also so I took some royal icing I softened it a little bit and just used a small spatula to cover those the next thing I have to make are the flaps cuz it I should have held to take a box what's wrong with me Jocelyn I'm talking about these flaps for this I roll out guess what more white fondant but I roll it thinner than I did for the subs that covered the cake and then I had made myself a template that's in this sort of triangular shape and cut out four of those pieces and then I glued them onto the cake folding over each other I chose piping gel to glue the flaps onto the sides of my cake it's a little bit sturdier than water and another note when you overlap don't press too hard because you don't want cracking you see how like it's nicely folded over but you're using fondant so if you press too hard you might get some cracking where it overlaps okay so it is time to paint the logo on the front of my Chinese takeout box we moved up how to write the word cake in the proper characters and I was reassured that it was both correct in Mandarin and Cantonese so you guys tell me if that's right guys we're just throwing you under the bus here they're like who's here at today you get to know her yeah so she sent me the characters she assured me it was correct in both Mandarin and Cantonese and if it's not let it go and now what I'm going to do is lay this template on the front of my cake I mapped it out remove the template and then by hand went over it very carefully with the food coloring marker so a red marker perfect sort of all the lines in the symbols that is one wrong move one wrong and it says something totally different and I won't even know what it says I won't even know I might have made a mistake I made it I might have made like one line too thick and now it says groundhog I don't know I don't know I need you to let me know I did notice something while my cake was laying on its back I did not patch the seams of the flaps I added to the side so I hit the scenes in the same way I did before a bit of thin drill icing in a small spatula very carefully you never want to add too much royal icing it will just look clumpy you know what I don't do enough of that was actually my 2018 resolution horsey horsey living so I wanted to make some fun things to go with this cake so of course I thought of fortune cookies and chopsticks to make some sugar fortune cookies I colored some gum paste the color of fortune cookies which I think I did really well considering I had no fortune cookies on him you roll out your gum paste nice and thin and then use a circle cutter to cut out a circle and then you what I want to say it properly now you take that circle fold it in half and use a little bit of piping gel at the top of the circle to glue the full together to make sure that it doesn't collapse on itself you use cotton balls so you put a cotton ball in either side in the opening then you want to have a mug nearby and you pick it up by the ends and you fold it over amok down over a month ok and then you allow these cookies to dry in the meantime I need to make the little tiny papers that the fortunes are written on so I roll out some white gum paste as thin as I possibly can and then I use a ruler and a really sharp paring knife to cut little strips and then I didn't want them to dry just completely flat so I picked them up and gave them like a little bit of life a little bit of wave and dried them in different positions and once they're dry enough you want to use the finished food coloring marker you can find and a very light and gum paste is really fragile the thinner it is the more fragile it is so some of these might break just when I'm writing on them write whatever you want if you guys have a good idea of what I should have written leave a comment below there's gonna be some good ideas leave them below I took those fortune cookies off the cup use tweezers to pull out the cotton the cotton is not part of the eating process no I actually dusted a little bit of cocoa along the outside edge of the fortune cookie just with a small paintbrush just to make it look baked right just put a little bit of piping gel on the end of the fortune and popped it inside the opening be gentle to make the chopsticks that I want to stick into this takeout box I am using some more gum paste also colored with ivory and I have two bamboo skewers basically enveloping look at that Wow I am enveloping some bamboo skewers in my sort of natural wood gum paste and then once it's completely covered I use my nonstick rolling pin to roll them out making sure they're nice and flat and the names a ruler and a sharp knife to cut around where the skewer is that I get more of a chopstick shape you know what I mean and at the top I just used my knife to make a little indent to look like the part where you would break them apart you know when you get takeout food they give you like the cheaper chopsticks right they don't give you the good ones once they're dry enough I again use a food coloring marker this time I use brown and I just draw some light lines in one direction and at the top of the chopstick i dot it with the brown marker and now for a final touch to make these lines look more natural and seamless I'm going to use a little bit of clear alcohol and I've oh and I used a paint brush and brush that on in the same direction as the lines I drew and this way I'm sort of blending them and dulling them and making them look a little bit more natural and now we can set these aside to dry it's time to make my Chinese fried rice I went to the bulk store and I found these organic rice puffs so what I'm mixing together is this organic puffed rice some dried salted peas coz I love sweet and salty then I'm using some dried papaya that I'm going to chop into little squares to look like chopped carrot guys sometimes wish we had like an 80s background sitcom noise then I'm using some dried papaya that I'm going to chop into little squares to look like chopped carrot and for the meat I'm using tootsie rolls okay slice the tootsie rolls with a sharp knife and then when I have each slice I turn it on its side and use my small fondant rolling pin to roll them out of flatten them and then I used a tool that I have have in this kitchen for ever but never use and it's called a fondant printer I bought this in England like in the year 2000 I just pinched the tootsie roll to create like a meaty texture I am going to use a little bit of pineapple jam which I strained if you can find a pineapple jelly just you just want a jelly that's kind of light and I chose to use pineapple because it will add more flavor as opposed to just clear piping gel which is just sweet I also like the cut of pineapple because it makes me think of like sweet and sour sauce why didn't we order fried rice on the Dan made this so I'm using this jam and I'm just going to stir all of these in together now unfortunately how to kick it doesn't have a cake out service where we can deliver this delicious cake a5 fried rice to you but we do have a sprinkle sanding I like saying that my sprinkle trap this feels right join our monthly sprinkle service and had a cake it calm and get delicious gourmet sprinkles delivered right to your door every month it's time to handle it what takeout box needs a handle see this little thingy basically worried about it not knowing how I was gonna do it until I got to this point Cody and I had an aha moment together both went a coat hanger I used a coat hanger it's perfect I used like a coated wire coat hanger and I had to use wire cutters to cut it oh yeah that's not easy some seamless footage here I'm like don't show my face in that footage so I also use the pliers to bend the hanger I it was really hard to bend and now I'm rolling my gum paste first a longer piece to cover the main part of my handle wrap it around as neatly as I can and cut away any excess but still leaving it quite rounded and then I roll out another piece cut two strips and cover the sides and I try to mend the seam as well as I can I brushed on some vegetable shortening onto the surface and then I used a nice soft makeup brush to brush on some silver luster a lot of things are like a first for Cody so when I used luster he was like wow that looks really silver like I get a lot of great feedback I'm like oh it is silver and that's what I intended I need to add the lid to hold it in place or the flaps that make up the lid now I insert the flaps on either side of the takeout box just sort of adjust them get them into place and then I do the front and back this is when cake decorating comes to a head like you do all this work and at the end of the day I could wreck this cake at this point you know what I mean it's still just a cake I can't touch it too much I have to be careful not to touch the front where it says cake I have to be careful of so many things so finally I decided to get them in place and they all have to be touching just a little bit and then aced a little bit of royal icing inside the lid and of course royal icing around the scenes of where I added the lid so between the flaps and the cake to help these flaps stay in place I'm going to use my masking tape trick so what I do is I wrap masking tape around the flaps backward so the sticky side is not up against the cake it's outside and I just keep wrapping it and this will just help them stay in place and dry it is time to add the handle to this cake so what I need to do is just make a little mark on the sides of my cake where I should insert to the wire and then really carefully sort of stretch the handle and insert it into the cake the tricky part about this is the cake is completely white and the handle is painted silver and luster goes where it wants so the more you get it wrong or sort of rub it up against the cake you'll get silver everywhere so be really careful yay it's time to fill this cake with fried rice I used my measuring cup and I scooped the rice in to fill the takeout box this was so fulfilling I don't know why but I was fulfilling no I was fulfilled filling the takeout box yep more abundantly but I'm not done I need to add my chopsticks down into the fried rice and don't forget the fortune cookies click here to watch my four amazing kids birthday cakes compilation and here to watch my four hot drink cake compilation over on step by step know how to cake it step by step I will be back next Tuesday I really know

popsicle buy new kids on the block I'm sure it's trending very like coffee it really is one of the talking songs deliver her if you want to do the crumb coat and chill dance with me live then sign up for camp cake cab cake is a live stream baking event where I bake here in this kitchen and you bake at home in yours and we do everything together step by step we're making two really great projects this year one is my taco pace that are upcoming book and the second our Sunday cupcakes Catholic is on July 29th hands August first so choose the days it was best for you and we'll be making the same projects on both days sign up and had occasion calm and this year we also have Camp cake bundles they all come in this cute camp cake bag the taco and the deluxe bundle both calm lists you guessed it the man of the hour I'm new at this super modeling thing you're going to get yes Joplin I am Dan ice to cape one more time now that Mike do you want to stay cold Mike crumb coat is chilled I'm going to ice this giant popsicle one more time and chill it again it's time for fondant I want to cover the cake in stripes for the red white and blue and I only want the colored fondant to cover the appropriate colored cake does that make sense I use a little bit of washi tape if you don't know what that is it's wonderful Japanese masking tape that comes in patterns and colors and I love it and I have a drawer full of it here I use my washi to mark in my cake board so I want red fondant over the red cake white fondant over the plain cake and blue fondant over the blue cake the first color I'm going to apply to this cake is red fondant after my red fondant was taped over the top of the popsicle I made sure to quickly smooth it into the ridges I use my hands and I fingertip for that just because anywhere that fondant is left to hang there can be cracking so you want to address that area first then I smooth it all around the side all around the top and pushed it in tight before trimming away the excess with a sharp paring knife now is where my washi tape comes in handy I know where to cut the red fondant across the top and all the way around the top I again used a fabric measuring tape just holding it over from end to end and then scored the fondant with a sharp paring knife first and once I was ready I cut all the way through all the way around the popsicles next blue fondant I drape the fondant over again addressing the ridges first with my hands smoothing it all around and down the base using a fondant finger on the flat bottom of the popsicles after I trim away the excess I once again use my fabric measuring tape to mark across from one washi tape to the other score the fondant and then cut through in a straight smooth line now all I have to do is cover the middle of the popsicle with white fondant I roll out my white fondant drape it over the middle of the popsicle this is why I decided to do white last because if I had done it ahead of time it would have been stained if the red or blue fondant landed on top of it so I trim just like I did with the red and blue but this time on both sides we have to trim the white where it needs thread and trim the white with the blue all around the popsicle and it's a popsicle oh it's not a popsicle unless it has a stick probably heard that same that's just an inspirational effective for my popsicle stick I actually use a flat long piece of wood that Jeremy cut and sanded and rounded one tidge isn't Jeremy was greatest she just did like a small nod and click as I am but I'm the greatest orhan I just want to tell you you're bad at sleeping well yesterday we sweet sprinkles it's the end of the episode and then orhan said please let me sleep before you and so I did but I feel like I'm looking right at your hump it's more like you just spread the sprinkles over there were sprinkled where I didn't even throw them sweep across the screen you're good at that kind of sweeping sculpture if you like giant fruitcakes I have a playlist right here and if you need ideas for summer cakes I have another playlist right here and if you're not subscribed yet you can do that right here trick yourself subscribe to this channel join camp cake and next week I'll be back and I'll try 
you're watching how to kick it I'm Yolanda and this week I am making a highly requested cake which is a strong thank you for your help guys your strawberries can also know what Walter I said it if you really love fruits with eyeballs or cakes that look like fruit please share this video you know Walter I gotta give him credit he's one of the most shared videos that we have this is a jumbo prize-winning strawberry because I baked 16 pounds of vanilla cake hide and yes I know strawberries are red inside but I wanted it to pop I level them and cut the caramelize ation off the bottom I also cut each one of my four cakes into two players so now I have eight layers of pink cake mmm this is your job I'm just trying to show you what you should be doing something like that now so squeeze has to help me simple syrup all of these layers of cake they're squeezed a lot is available at how to kake.com along with my summertime bundle which includes a summertime sketch book for all of your cake goals a unicorn ten to sketch them out with and a set of four temporary but yes there is a tattoo with you and I'm not wearing it what are you looking at while my simple syrup is soaking in I'm going to take this opportunity to make strawberry buttercream to make my strawberry buttercream I simply washed a bunch of strawberries cut off the green top and then I put them in a food processor and pureed them and once I had a nice puree I ran it through a sieve just to try and get out some of the pulp and a few of the seeds it's actually impossible to get rid of all because of CD your more CD than he is now that I'm having with my puree and it's been strained it's time to add it to some Italian meringue buttercream I did also add a little bit of pink food coloring just to brighten up the color well since so now sense of cell these eight layers of pink cake with my pink strawberry butter thing I used an offset spatula to fill my cake layers with strawberry buttercream and then stack the next layer on top and repeat I then use the straight spatula just to clean up any better scene that has oozed out the side [Music] and now it's ten children once my buttercream is nice and chilled I remove my cake from the fridge and then I'm going to cut one side of the cake off because I want to create a flat side that will then become the bottom now time to carve a strawberry a giant strawberry so I had a model your friend is Romanian she was incredible she was also delicious yo sorry she was gonna go bad for the body of the strawberry the first thing I did to my cake was carve a diagonal line I wish I had carved it a bit steeper but it all worked out for the top of the cake I wanted to round out all around where the stem would grow and I even use a small serrated knife to cut inside creating like an indent sort of like a little valley shallow valley where the stem grows in the leaves grow then I took that slice of cake that I cut off and I place it on the end of the strawberry to elongate it no strawberry is the same you can't really go wrong you know what I mean why would you don't cut it into a square it's still going to look like a strawberry what is that Walter Walters telling me they do make square watermelons yes I know Walter where does this go in Japan when it's young they put like a glass box then as it grows yes since in law I'm happy with my strawberry so I'm going to crumble it I made a little more buttercream that was just died I want all pink inside this strawberry but I don't want the seeds on the outside and one of my buttercream for the crumb coat to be smooth but I still wanted it to be pink so I died a little more buttercream pink with the same food coloring I used in the strawberry buttercream and Crown coated and chilled my strawberry once my grandpa was chilled I iced the strawberry one more time with that same pink buttercream I want it just to have a nice smooth surface allophones consistently all of this Walter's just staring at you very angrily hear what you say watermelons have like an extreme level of anger I might have to take a watermelon out of this kitchen don't be the first time I'm going to take the opportunity to make my giant strawberry seeds while my cake is chilling I took my gum paste I rolled tubes of gum paste accords with gum paste and then I used a ruler to cut even measurement so that I'd have the same amount and then I basically just rolled a little ball with my finger on my palm and then pinched the end to make it more of like a strawberry seed shape and then I made 430 here was that so respect oh my god I have to tell Jeremy though there's the laughing calm down he was more [Music] for everything I made I lost ten brain cells my palm was chased gymnast Oh Natalya now that I'm done making a whole bunch of seeds I'm going to cover this cake I rolled out red fondant large enough and then I picked it up with a French rolling pin draped it over my jumbo strawberry and began to smooth it with my all-around tucking underneath just making it look like a gorgeous jumbo strawberry when I'm swimming fondant on a cake that has a very natural shape like this one I do tend to prefer this image a smoother is great when there's any sort of straight edge but using a smoother here I'd run the risk of putting like lines into my fondant because it is so flat so using my hands is really helpful it also helps me tuck with on and underneath the strawberry as best I can my strawberry looks great already but it's a little bit matte I don't find many matte fruits do you I used red food coloring and some clear food grade alcohol and I painted the entire outside of my strawberry with this red paint just to ripen it up the next thing I need to do is make all the little indents that hold the seat know I can't just press the seat on you literally may be a bad word Jocelyn Racine is embedded Jeremy and I every time I make a cake we find ourselves going down the Google hole so Jeremy Google's about strawberries are you ready for this what are you into this the seeds on a strawberry are actually a bunch of ovaries on the outside oh my gosh wish I never what does that mean exactly no I use the ball to land a veining tool to create things in them the ball to make the rounder top part of the indent and then the veining tool to make it come to a point at the bottom and I did is I made myself a little knot a template but I cut out a little square of paper because they seem to be in a diamond formation but like seed seed seed seeds so I cut out a little square of paper to help me sort of space so I would never put them too close or too far from each other and if that didn't take any time at all right Jeremy just whip through it it was like I want to paint the surface of this cake once again for two reasons I want to enhance the color one more time and if the surface is wet it'll be easier to add my feet so I just reconstitute the same things I used before I don't even know if reconstituted like I Jeremy it's be constant hold on restore something dried especially food to its original state by adding water to it because the pain has dried up a bit I mean is that more liquid and reconstituted give her the dirty water remember he's always looking at me you look at Joslin there yes so looking at you once I'm happy with my coat of paint I'm going to add the seeds to every single indent yep we do all go in one direction which I admire so that's what I would do like if I wore you know four hundred and fifty five cents on the outside of the body I would make sure they were in one direction [Music] oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh do you know what this part of the strawberries called please see how the leaves are all one yeah so it remind you of anything perched on a test something we reference on the channel a lot because Queen Paragon all around yes cool it's a crown to make the crown I'm using green gum paste and then I made myself a template the kind of looks like HP now I need to roll out my green gum paste and lay my paper template on top and then I use a sharp paring knife to cut out that shape I don't I don't get it like older things are one way but then early aren't the same time I don't think nature mother nature is your zero I really like her but I don't think she does the next thing I need to do is insert some wire into each so I cut lengths of wire and I inserted them from the tip of the leaf just down the body avoids I don't want the wire to reach all the way to the center of the Daisy I just want something that will help me manipulate the sort of the way the leaf lays on the strawberries once it's off the next thing I'm going to do is use an impression map that I have and just create some texture on Lotus's I just don't want them to look flat and cartoon the next thing I need to do is paint please leave so I'm using some dry color dust in green and yellow to give my green gum paste a more realistic natural color and some texture really adds to the texture then I swipe my entire green gum paste Daisy over and make that same texture impression on the others so I paint one side of it with the DVLA then I flip it over and do the other side with some of my Dutch process cocoa and the reason I did this is sorry guys but often your leaves look like a little bit dirty or bruised as if people have just been picking you up by me you know the next thing I need to do is pick this entire gum peas Daisy up and a fix this in my cake so first brush the little valley on the top of your strawberry cake which - jack then pick up the Daisy as quickly as you can and place it in the center as I went along I use dabs of piping gel and then I dent each leaf and place it however I wanted it to look on the strawberry cake I'm glad it worked out I was convinced that great one if that wasn't scary enough I'm going to repeat that whole process one more time making another big Daisy and place it on my cake this time trying to aim these eight leaves between the ones I've already chosen so now the strawberry has a nice full crown the average strawberry I counted the leaves I've had 13 a warning we were shocked like if somebody's dog here in the street and says hey how many leaves in strawberry have you would have not guessed their type a 5 yeah no it's a lot more than fun I never really noticed them so I just want to eat orange for not noticing and on the ovary now I find when I buy strawberries they always like cut the stem right down to nothing but I like when you get those strawberries with the stem or have you ever got strawberry picking anyway yes I have yeah so I wanted to make a stem on my strawberry cake so what I did is I just used a little more of my green gum paste rolled it into a cord and then I took another floral wire folded it in half and twisted it just for a bit more strength inserted it into my stem very carefully I added a bit of texture using my mat once again and then I inserted that stem into the top center of the crown and don't forget if you like giant fruit cakes please make sure to share this video there's a button below guys I really wanted to make a strawberry cake for my new cake book that's coming out that you can pre-order now but you guys have requested it so much on YouTube that I really felt this amount here besides Walter

then I just take one more time nice that was like I'm the Beyonce of Devon my take is chilling and now I'm going to knead and roll up all of this fondant to decorate this cake and make it look like the wheel of misfortune that it really is you know this is a great time to make our big announcement okay this is this if you huge a lot of you write to me and ask me why we don't have a second

of all six of these colors and each one will cover one section of the top of my cake now I need to cut bands of fondant that I'm going to add to the sides of this cake I need to place the triangles of fondant on top of this cake but I need to make sure that they match up with the lines that I marked out on the lazy susan I'm just going to line it up on the line and make a mark on the side of my cake so that I can see it from the top just love one things line up justice that you love is limited you can use a flat spatula to help pick up your fondant carefully [Music] now I'm going to place the matching color on the sides of this cake trimming it clean at the must a sharp knife a good ruler and a fondant smoother are great tools to use for applying fondant in sections like this you may need to trim your fondant sometimes if it's a little too big again using your ruler and your sharp knife this cake is already starting to look a lot like a wheel of misfortune but I want to use my Finlay roll black fondant to create strips and cover all my seams between the colors then I'm going to cut out numbers and number them off and applying my flat fondant strips and numbers with a little bit of piping gel brushed on the back [Music] [Music] the final detail I'm adding to this cake is a black outline around the outside of the circle I'm going to use my place oh no you were like I'm

welcome back to how to cake it I'm Yolanda and this week because falls on its way I am making a giant baked potato cake I love warm hardy foods in the fall who's with me huh Jeremy what are you eat in the fall this is a 12 pound baked potato well what so I baked 12 pounds of my ultimate vanilla cake leveled them and removed the carmelization from the bottom I'm also removing the carmelization from the side so I'm just gonna finish that up yes you know like the bag of potato that weighs 12 pounds this is that in 1 now it's time for simple syrup this is not just regular simple syrup and regular sir squeeze this is how to kick it's our school yes now that the simple syrup has soaked into my cake layers it's time to fill and stack them sorry to interrupt the video guys but we have an important last-minute announcement all revenue earned in the first 48 hours that this video is released on YouTube will be donated to hurricane relief funds in the US and Caribbean so please share this video watch it over and over again and let's raise this money if you know of a charity organization or fund that could really use this help from us please leave a comment below and let us know who it is we love your input and we really want this money to go to the right place we hope that we can take a difference with our contribution now back to the video thanks for watching I'm going to fill in stack three of these vanilla cake layers with my Italian meringue buttercream I'm reserving one layer for later on to carve the potato I made myself a rough template of an oval just with a piece of paper what exactly what that I made a template of an oval I don't understand why this is funny at all I said rough template it wasn't even perfect I was cutting off two ends of the round cake right already this made my cake an oval but then I took those two ends and sandwiched them against the long end so I can make the potato a bit Luhan hey I just stacked it and chilled it Oh stack and chill we got a make that'll fit I think it could be a dance I think it could be a dance we're gonna Jeremy Jeremy agrees with nothing we say doesn't even like fall foods because of us we're gonna start to carve this cake into a potato I am except I'm carving cake into a potato not a potato into like a war figurine or something I don't know a unicorn is that what you would fart what would you carve out of a potato Jeremy okay for a man who doesn't like potatoes yeah you can go live in it make sure to keep some of your cake scraps reserved in a bowl because we're gonna use these later on remember the layer I'm going to use it so I flipped my potato cake over spread a little bit of a telling rank buttercream and then place that last layer on top I did trim it down a little it wasn't as high as the other layers and then with my knife I carved away the excess and carved it into the potato I love carving cakes like this because potatoes are not perfect I mean yes and milk [Music] why did we not put eyes on a potato I feel like this is discrimination do we only do that to fruits and then I crumb coated that area and flipped the cake back right-side up and once that was chilled i iced the entire potato again and chilled it this is truly a great starter cake because you don't have to be scared of the carving you don't have to even be scared of the fondant application or even what I do to texture this cake there's a lot of different things that you can learn along the way but it's not difficult as a whole and even if it looks a bit mashed baked potatoes look mashed it's just more realistic so share this video if you love giant food cakes and you're gonna try making this cake yourself I hope enough people share it that it ends up in Jeremy's personal feed and I hope you like dr. Karen ole this is an episode where I used some of the most delicious colored fondant I've ever seen do you agree Jeremy it was so fleshy imagine the skin of a potato if there was no dirt on it it was like my inner arm like it was just there was something about it before recovering this cake with fondant I'm gonna cover the top of it with a layer of plastic wrap so I don't want it to run down the sides of the potato at all I just wanted to stay on the top of the potato roll out the fondant as thin as you can drape it over the potato and then with your hands smooth it all over the potatoes so yes the plastic wrap is staying underneath the fondant for now don't worry we're gonna come back get it out [Music] okay it's like to texture the potato skin so if you ordered the turkey skin either from my infomercial when I first released it on how to make it it now doubles as a potato skinny you see the bargain we didn't even know the potential of the turkeys container back then after the shelf liner a used a pointed end of a spell stick which is just sort of a sculpting tool to poke the potato the next thing I'm going to do is use a ball tool to create some grooves I'm using the larger end of the ball tool and I'm just sort of rubbing it onto the surface of the fondant creating grooves and indents and the grooves don't have to be even or equal or the same shape see what I mean I know how to wing it if you know how to wing it hashtag wing it I think you know okay oh oh oh so I did something else I used a tool in a way you're not supposed to or nothing not supposed to but I never thought of so to create eyes on the potato I was going to use a series of piping tips so that I can make like a smaller circle within a larger circle and then I thought to myself I'm gonna use an eyedropper to make the eyes I don't think an eyedropper has ever been used to me that either yes finally once again I'm gonna return to using my cell stick and I'm just gonna use a lighter hand this time poking my potato all around just adding more texture to the kingdom the next thing I'm gonna do is keep this cake I'm using a combination of and brown and clear food grade alcohol to paint this cake I just want to give it a bit of warmth then I went back and darkened the paint with a little more brown and used a smaller brush to focus on the eyes you just wanted to darken them because you're more dirty usually gets inside of the eyes then once again with this darker paint I used a bigger more soft bristled brush to sort of dab patches and areas of darker paint now honey to put on my white jacket because I am going to become a potato surgeon we have to remove plastic have the fondant touched the cake it would have adhered to the cake so I just tried out this plastic method and it really really worked well not a lot of surgeons go into potato surgery it's very difficult it goes like heart surgeon brain surgeon potato surgeon just I like to use these interviews as an opportunity to get more ridiculous it's my way of pushing the envelope so I kind of waste some of the fondant across the potato and then peeled it back and then I made the lines that I cut even more imperfect by making them look more jagged we actually watched a Marcus how to get a potato orphan she's amazing cuz Jeremy all the other videos we watch everybody like cut them open oh no Martha bangs it on the table that's why she hangs out with soup now I knew I loved her if you also love Martha and Snoop Dogg together as much as I do share this video cuz I want them to see it this you know with Martha and Snoop are they're like my two favorite worlds colliding baking and 90s rap hello hello my life is complete now that the fondant at the top of my potato is peeled back and the plastic is removed I'm just gonna use a little more of my leftover paint to paint that inner fondant in case any of this is exposed at the end the next thing I want to do is place this potato cake in the fridge so that the paint can dry fully before the next step Oh once the potato is sentences more sentences once the paint is fully dry I'm going to paint this potato again but this time with cocoa what did I do this on I did it on avvocato I did on Turkey carrot yeah we also never put eyes on a carrot now we are discriminating against vegetables and it's fruit I ended up liking the way the regular cocoa looked more on the cake it really looks like potato dirt remember the cake scraps that I had you reserved you want to take a small bowl full of those cake scraps and I used a fork to just break them down and sort of mash them up and then I added a couple of spoonfuls of my Italian meringue buttercream and mixed it together this is just so that the cake crumbs will sort of bond together I'm going to lay a border of this cake crumb mixture all around the inside of that cut and it's gonna look like the inside of the potato that's revealed when you cut open a baked potato if you are a cake tea club member this is this month's cake teeth except it's an apron now you can like switch it up and wear it over some of the old cake teams wear it alone well weird but you there's no reason you can't do it in the comfort of your own home Jocelin also if you're a member of the Cady Club you get a free cake pun pencil this month as well as a postcard from me for the sour cream on my baked potato I am making a batch of my 7-minute frosting I have a video where you can see me do that and you can watch that right here [Music] on top of sour cream I'm planning to top this baked potato with chives bacon bits and grated cheddar cheese mmm YUM for the chives on this cake I'm using some thin green apple licorice and it comes in like strands remember that licorice I haven't had it in years because they're not dark enough I'm actually gonna brush on some moss green food coloring and then I set the strands aside to dry and let the color sort of just dry before we touch it again in the meantime I'm going to make my bacon bits and for that I'm cutting up some dried fruit strands or called fruit leather these are actually ones that my son loves true story my son ate four of them and Jeremy had to go out and get more honest true story so thank you Jeremy for the cheddar cheese I've made a batch of my white modeling chocolate that I've dyed to look like cheddar cheese and let it set up overnight in the fridge and now I'm gonna grate that cheese for my grated cheddar let me address the chives back to the chives once the paint on your green licorice strands are dry you can then chop them up like chives just lay the licorice strands together and use a knife and chop I did not measure I didn't lay a ruler beside it I just chopped it's very free now I have all my toppings I'm gonna set up a toppings bar and top this baked potato I want to know how you all out there top your baked potato do you chives or do green onions where do you put your song pepper is bacon involved we need these questions answered get your hashtags start ashtag chives hashtag sour cream hashtag butter hashtag cheese hash a anything that has nothing to do with cake only potatoes I don't do butter answer oh boy oh yeah she's wild Athena Johnson literally no sweat like this oh I do mmm girl sour cream and butter she did that that's what she did thank you for watching we'll be back next Tuesday with a brand new video please share this baked potato video so they won't land in Jeremy speed and larvas and Snoop not in that order reverse the order thank you you mean you captured that footage I tried and then trying to figure out the ratios Yolanda did you measure a potato I might have I'm not embarrassed I'm a potato measure 
welcome back to how to take it I'm Yolanda and this week I am taking an igloo because naturally that's where I live I mean we try to pretend we don't live in igloos when people ask us but the truth is we do and in the summer our igloos turn into outdoor pools to make my igloo cake I started by making eight pounds of my ultimate chocolate cake I baked some of that batter in a nine-inch half-sphere pan and the rest in a nine inch round pan if you want all the details of how I baked this cake just click right here I for igloo I layered them the 9-inch round into two layers and the sphere cake into five layers for a total of seven layers of course I needed sir squeeze to wake up and get out of his igloo to help me simple syrup these cakes it's so cold that sir squeeze came in with this fir and refused to take it off I had to make him take it off and then he did manage I put it back on I'm surprised the simple syrup wasn't frozen and you know what who do you think you are wearing a fur stole with a brooch and leaving your girlfriend Finnell in the cold look look she's freezing she can't even uncollapse herself I've decided to make a secret chamber in this case this is a freezing cold secret chamber and of course I need to fill it with ice so for that I'm going to use some light blue rock candy while the simple syrup soaks into all of my cakes I need to remove this rock candy from the wooden sticks that it comes on the next thing I'm going to do is use a three inch circle cutter to cut the secret chambers out of some of my cake layers is the first secret chamber mm what now we're here now this is looking like how to cake it now I'm back in it right secret chambers I'm saving the cake circles to make the door of my igloo later on let's fill this cake and let's fill it with Italian meringue buttercream because it's delicious begin by placing your first whole layer of cake down spread on that Italian meringue buttercream and now we're gonna start to build up this cake with the layers with the secret chambers oh this is Walters igloo yeah he lives in a really like fancy igloo so I wanted to replicate his igloo because you know he's like that as I place these layers on I also make sure to keep the inside of that secret chamber clean I don't want chocolate cake crumbs in my ice so I'm using a small straight spatula to just sort of ice the inside of the chamber as I go along I'm sure you know people who don't believe that Canadians live in igloos just share this video with them because it's definite proof I've now built up my cake with the chamber and I decide I want to make the chamber a bit bigger so I go back and cut another secret chamber in another one of my layers place it on top and then I'm gonna actually chill the cake at this point it's an igloo I have to keep this cake extra cold and the reason I want to do this is so the buttercream inside the chamber can become chilled so that when I put in my rock candy it doesn't get coated in buttercream as a further step to ensure that no cake crumbs get on to my ice the next layer of cake that I'm planning to stack on top I'm just gonna flip it over and spread buttercream on the bottom just a thin crumb coat Branko and chill once the buttercream inside my secret chamber has chilled I'm going to remove my cake from the fridge and pile the rock candy inside the chamber now that the chamber is filled I'm going to spread buttercream on top of this top layer and then flip that crumb coated layer on the top to seal the secret chamber that's why Walters igloo is so nice and cold not that I've been invited but I've heard was it cool in there or huh orhan I saw the picture of Walters in clue you guys all went to house cooling party and then you put the picture up on your Facebook I saw it to complete this igloo cake I add the final sort of domed layer on top and crumb coat the entire Jody did you not study the manual you were given which is my cake book did you not look at page 56 crumb coating ensures that the crumbs from your cake don't get into your beautiful icing if any of you at home wanna up your crumb coat and chill game you can pick up our deluxe crumb coat and chill bundle at had a cake accom it's on sale now and you can also grab yourself a copy of my cake book and make sure to read page 56 as Cody just learned before I chill this cake I need to paint the doorway into this egg glue so for this as I mentioned before I'm using the four cake circles that I cut out to make the secret chamber in order to ensure that my doorway will fit right up against my dome cake I need to cut away some cake so what I do is I use a nine inch round pan which is the same size as the base of my dome and I just lay it at the edge of each cake circle and cut away a little bit of cake and I need to just sort of create like an archway so the first thing I want to do is cut the two sides nice and straight with a small serrated knife and then cut the front nice and straight like a doorway and finally I'm just going to sort of round out the two top edges I'm trying to make like an upside-down you which doesn't spell a clue once I'm happy with the shape of my igloo doorway I then fill the layers they've already been simple syrup I fill them with Italian meringue buttercream and crumb coat the whole doorway and then I chill the dome and the doorway crumb coat and chill guys I don't know if you notice but Orhan is here doing this interview with me Johnson's not here because she decided it's too cold outside so she's hibernating in her igloo now that my crumb coat is chilled I can move on to icing this cake so I find it really helps to ice a skier cake or a dome cake with a small offset spatula because the cake is so rounded it just really lets you get around you're not using a long straight edge on something that's not straight in the first place once you're happy with your icing job you can place both cakes in the fridge to chill it's fun and time it's time to cover my igloo cake with white fondant now I'm gonna be decorating this a glue with mini marshmallows to resemble ice bricks I'm rolling my fondant to 1/8 of an inch thin as thin as possible because it's just there to hold in the buttercream and it's gonna make a nice surface for my piping job this is a really easy beginner cake so if you end up making this at home please don't forget to put up a picture and tag me on Instagram I'll put my handle down here and feel free to make an igloo cake even if you're not Canadian moving on I need to cover my little doorway with white fondant so same thing rolling out the white fondant as thin as I can and then draping it over make sure to keep the seam of your fondant at the back of the door where it will meet your dome cake because no one will know it's there except us it's another secret if you've never seen in a glue when you look into the entrance it has quite like a blue hue so what I want to do is create a little bit of light blue fondant same sort of tone as the ice inside the chamber and roll it out nice and thin then I'm gonna pick up my little door cake and place it face first onto that fondant and cut around it so I'm cutting the exact same arc shape out of my blue bottom once I've done this I just brush a little clear piping gel on the back of that blue fondant and place it on to the front of the doorway okay it's marshmallow time don't you wish you heard that more in life yeah it's like a sweet happy hour before I start applying my mini marshmallows to this igloo cake I'm just going to mark out where my door will be placed on the dome time to line up my mini marshmallows like ice bricks on it Bakley so I am laying them horizontally all along the bottom of the game and then I want to make sure to lay them in a brick pattern so when I start my next level I offset the marshmallow so that the first marshmallow starts where the seam is below it you know what I mean you so footage you can cut to fit the marshmallows as needed because as you get up the dome the circumference changes so you might find that it's not quite aligning in a brick pattern and here and there you need to cut a marshmallow in half and place it and just feel free to eat the other half because that's what I did I find it really helps the process you know it's like I was one with the marshmallow bricks I was a marshmallow Trek so keep adding your marshmallow bricks round and round and all the way up to the top I make all kinds of novelty cakes on this channel not just igloos so if you want to see hats and books and turkeys please subscribe as I went along you know marshmallows aren't perfect I've come to accept that but here and there there were some that when I looked at the igloo overall I didn't like that I just like poked them out ate it and then replaced it with a more suitable marshmallow it's time to add my doorway now it might not fit perfectly so what I did is I removed just a row of marsh along the side and then I piped some royal icing onto the opening and pushed my doorway up against the igloo and then I can repeat the same brick pattern laying the bricks in the same horizontal fashion so I started at one side of the doorway up and over and here you're gonna have to cut and eat quite a few marshmallows [Music] for the opening arc to the doorway I am going to place my marshmallows upright gluing them on with some pipe trial icing and just cut them as you need and design the opening archway as you like you know how Walters igloo has like those ice pillars around it I mean it was built by a world-famous Andrew architect so I have to I have to really replicate it properly I'm going to go all out and even decorate around this angle it's actually sort of set beside a forest so there's just tons and tons of trees around his house and to recreate some of these trees I'm using some sugar cones and a piping bag is royal icing piping it right onto the sugar cones through a star tip and to finish them off and make them look nice and snowy I'm just going to sprinkle some coconut shredded coconut all around and there you have it a beautiful snowy tree you can make a few trees you can make a ton of trees and just place them around your igloo cake you have a lot of fun decorating outside your igloo cake you don't need to make as much land as Walter lives on so I sifted some caster sugar and icing sugar around the egg glue I added my sugar trees pearl luster dust salt to melt the ice Walters kids were playing outside the other thing you should know about Walter is he has a flag of himself on the outside of his igloo that's the kind of melon he is just [Music] it's time to destroy Walters house I'm gonna enjoy cutting this cake click here to watch my hand bag cake compilation and here to watch a step by step of my t-shirt cakes over on my new channel how to cake it step by step and make sure to subscribe while you're there I'll be back next week Walter won't

you're watching how to kick it I'm Yolanda and this week I am making a highly requested cake which is a strong thank you for your help guys your strawberries can also know what Walter I said it if you really love fruits with eyeballs or cakes that look like fruit please share this video you know Walter I gotta give him credit he's one of the most shared videos that we have this is a jumbo prize-winning strawberry because I baked 16 pounds of vanilla cake hide and yes I know strawberries are red inside but I wanted it to pop I level them and cut the caramelize ation off the bottom I also cut each one of my four cakes into two players so now I have eight layers of pink cake mmm this is your job I'm just trying to show you what you should be doing something like that now so squeeze has to help me simple syrup all of these layers of cake they're squeezed a lot is available at how to kake.com along with my summertime bundle which includes a summertime sketch book for all of your cake goals a unicorn ten to sketch them out with and a set of four temporary but yes there is a tattoo with you and I'm not wearing it what are you looking at while my simple syrup is soaking in I'm going to take this opportunity to make strawberry buttercream to make my strawberry buttercream I simply washed a bunch of strawberries cut off the green top and then I put them in a food processor and pureed them and once I had a nice puree I ran it through a sieve just to try and get out some of the pulp and a few of the seeds it's actually impossible to get rid of all because of CD your more CD than he is now that I'm having with my puree and it's been strained it's time to add it to some Italian meringue buttercream I did also add a little bit of pink food coloring just to brighten up the color well since so now sense of cell these eight layers of pink cake with my pink strawberry butter thing I used an offset spatula to fill my cake layers with strawberry buttercream and then stack the next layer on top and repeat I then use the straight spatula just to clean up any better scene that has oozed out the side [Music] and now it's ten children once my buttercream is nice and chilled I remove my cake from the fridge and then I'm going to cut one side of the cake off because I want to create a flat side that will then become the bottom now time to carve a strawberry a giant strawberry so I had a model your friend is Romanian she was incredible she was also delicious yo sorry she was gonna go bad for the body of the strawberry the first thing I did to my cake was carve a diagonal line I wish I had carved it a bit steeper but it all worked out for the top of the cake I wanted to round out all around where the stem would grow and I even use a small serrated knife to cut inside creating like an indent sort of like a little valley shallow valley where the stem grows in the leaves grow then I took that slice of cake that I cut off and I place it on the end of the strawberry to elongate it no strawberry is the same you can't really go wrong you know what I mean why would you don't cut it into a square it's still going to look like a strawberry what is that Walter Walters telling me they do make square watermelons yes I know Walter where does this go in Japan when it's young they put like a glass box then as it grows yes since in law I'm happy with my strawberry so I'm going to crumble it I made a little more buttercream that was just died I want all pink inside this strawberry but I don't want the seeds on the outside and one of my buttercream for the crumb coat to be smooth but I still wanted it to be pink so I died a little more buttercream pink with the same food coloring I used in the strawberry buttercream and Crown coated and chilled my strawberry once my grandpa was chilled I iced the strawberry one more time with that same pink buttercream I want it just to have a nice smooth surface allophones consistently all of this Walter's just staring at you very angrily hear what you say watermelons have like an extreme level of anger I might have to take a watermelon out of this kitchen don't be the first time I'm going to take the opportunity to make my giant strawberry seeds while my cake is chilling I took my gum paste I rolled tubes of gum paste accords with gum paste and then I used a ruler to cut even measurement so that I'd have the same amount and then I basically just rolled a little ball with my finger on my palm and then pinched the end to make it more of like a strawberry seed shape and then I made 430 here was that so respect oh my god I have to tell Jeremy though there's the laughing calm down he was more [Music] for everything I made I lost ten brain cells my palm was chased gymnast Oh Natalya now that I'm done making a whole bunch of seeds I'm going to cover this cake I rolled out red fondant large enough and then I picked it up with a French rolling pin draped it over my jumbo strawberry and began to smooth it with my all-around tucking underneath just making it look like a gorgeous jumbo strawberry when I'm swimming fondant on a cake that has a very natural shape like this one I do tend to prefer this image a smoother is great when there's any sort of straight edge but using a smoother here I'd run the risk of putting like lines into my fondant because it is so flat so using my hands is really helpful it also helps me tuck with on and underneath the strawberry as best I can my strawberry looks great already but it's a little bit matte I don't find many matte fruits do you I used red food coloring and some clear food grade alcohol and I painted the entire outside of my strawberry with this red paint just to ripen it up the next thing I need to do is make all the little indents that hold the seat know I can't just press the seat on you literally may be a bad word Jocelyn Racine is embedded Jeremy and I every time I make a cake we find ourselves going down the Google hole so Jeremy Google's about strawberries are you ready for this what are you into this the seeds on a strawberry are actually a bunch of ovaries on the outside oh my gosh wish I never what does that mean exactly no I use the ball to land a veining tool to create things in them the ball to make the rounder top part of the indent and then the veining tool to make it come to a point at the bottom and I did is I made myself a little knot a template but I cut out a little square of paper because they seem to be in a diamond formation but like seed seed seed seeds so I cut out a little square of paper to help me sort of space so I would never put them too close or too far from each other and if that didn't take any time at all right Jeremy just whip through it it was like I want to paint the surface of this cake once again for two reasons I want to enhance the color one more time and if the surface is wet it'll be easier to add my feet so I just reconstitute the same things I used before I don't even know if reconstituted like I Jeremy it's be constant hold on restore something dried especially food to its original state by adding water to it because the pain has dried up a bit I mean is that more liquid and reconstituted give her the dirty water remember he's always looking at me you look at Joslin there yes so looking at you once I'm happy with my coat of paint I'm going to add the seeds to every single indent yep we do all go in one direction which I admire so that's what I would do like if I wore you know four hundred and fifty five cents on the outside of the body I would make sure they were in one direction [Music] oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh do you know what this part of the strawberries called please see how the leaves are all one yeah so it remind you of anything perched on a test something we reference on the channel a lot because Queen Paragon all around yes cool it's a crown to make the crown I'm using green gum paste and then I made myself a template the kind of looks like HP now I need to roll out my green gum paste and lay my paper template on top and then I use a sharp paring knife to cut out that shape I don't I don't get it like older things are one way but then early aren't the same time I don't think nature mother nature is your zero I really like her but I don't think she does the next thing I need to do is insert some wire into each so I cut lengths of wire and I inserted them from the tip of the leaf just down the body avoids I don't want the wire to reach all the way to the center of the Daisy I just want something that will help me manipulate the sort of the way the leaf lays on the strawberries once it's off the next thing I'm going to do is use an impression map that I have and just create some texture on Lotus's I just don't want them to look flat and cartoon the next thing I need to do is paint please leave so I'm using some dry color dust in green and yellow to give my green gum paste a more realistic natural color and some texture really adds to the texture then I swipe my entire green gum paste Daisy over and make that same texture impression on the others so I paint one side of it with the DVLA then I flip it over and do the other side with some of my Dutch process cocoa and the reason I did this is sorry guys but often your leaves look like a little bit dirty or bruised as if people have just been picking you up by me you know the next thing I need to do is pick this entire gum peas Daisy up and a fix this in my cake so first brush the little valley on the top of your strawberry cake which - jack then pick up the Daisy as quickly as you can and place it in the center as I went along I use dabs of piping gel and then I dent each leaf and place it however I wanted it to look on the strawberry cake I'm glad it worked out I was convinced that great one if that wasn't scary enough I'm going to repeat that whole process one more time making another big Daisy and place it on my cake this time trying to aim these eight leaves between the ones I've already chosen so now the strawberry has a nice full crown the average strawberry I counted the leaves I've had 13 a warning we were shocked like if somebody's dog here in the street and says hey how many leaves in strawberry have you would have not guessed their type a 5 yeah no it's a lot more than fun I never really noticed them so I just want to eat orange for not noticing and on the ovary now I find when I buy strawberries they always like cut the stem right down to nothing but I like when you get those strawberries with the stem or have you ever got strawberry picking anyway yes I have yeah so I wanted to make a stem on my strawberry cake so what I did is I just used a little more of my green gum paste rolled it into a cord and then I took another floral wire folded it in half and twisted it just for a bit more strength inserted it into my stem very carefully I added a bit of texture using my mat once again and then I inserted that stem into the top center of the crown and don't forget if you like giant fruit cakes please make sure to share this video there's a button below guys I really wanted to make a strawberry cake for my new cake book that's coming out that you can pre-order now but you guys have requested it so much on YouTube that I really felt this amount here besides Walter

you are watching how to kick it I'm Yolanda under here somewhere and this week I made myself a birthday cake that's not bad oh I'm taking myself a giant ice cream a lot of going on this week I'm having a camp cake flash sale on instead of flash a good one for more information on that sale click the link in the description below we're leaving in every single thing I said this week because it's my perfect we have to make games with 40 minutes on TV you guys don't TV for my giant ice cream sundae birthday cake I baked 10 pounds of cake total let's start off by building the foal it wasn't just Andale this is a big birthday and I want to pink Sunday I cut my round cake into two layers and I cut my bull cake into three later first squeeze better do his job right today because this cake is for me so I haven't simple syrup all of the way I decided to have a Neapolitan ice cream sundae and what I'm going to do is enhance some of my enhanced yeah because I'm more mature now so I'm going to enhance my buttercream so that I can fill my bowl seat while I listen to the lovely zoo tank I'm only going to talk like this from now I'm an adult we'll have to raise the audio you quiet is it quieter it's like a calm journey it's just quiet okay I enhanced my buttercream with a plethora of flavors I've labored half of it with a vanilla bean which is so lovely and smooth so that Jeremy had a lot of questions about the meliboeus a lot I answered them then I chopped some strawberries mainly the red part but I wanted to remove sort of that white part inside and nothing against it but it's not colorful and it's not as flavorful folded them into my Italian meringue buttercream along with a little bit of pink food coloring for my chocolate buttercream I added mini chocolate chip time to fill my bowl cake alternating the buttercream I'm going to start building my super bowl upside down I add the board then I add the bowl cake which is now kind of three layers later when I flip it I'll have support and you guys any shirt up a little board in it that doesn't work it's more like if you wanted to stand that finishes red of the Lord and I wanted to get my bowl a little bit of detail so I added some indents to the side I used a circle cutter to help me mark it and a small serrated knife to cut out eight indents evenly around the bowl now I need to crumb coat miss cakes I feel like it's my birthday and I want other people to dance for me I want to show girls I want like Rockettes I want 40 Rockettes with cakes on their heads kicking thank you or hi luck or ha there's a lot of times oh my god Susan look just focus on this case needs some dowels to support it before I flip it over I'm going to insert a few delves into the cake in a circle formation that way when we flip it they'll be support because I'm going to be adding a lot of ice - we have dancing dolls or hot it's my birthday I'm going to ask for everything I want I want some dancing dolls they're my support group get it and now I'm going to ice the cake again with my vanilla buttercream I knew this cake is more difficult than it looks because I've gotta get buttercream into all the little indents that I carved earlier if you have a cake enthusiast in your life who also has a birthday coming up like me we have some great sprinkle themed wrapping paper cards mini cards at how to keep it calm so you can wrap up their cake gifts in cake paper and it will be a kick-ass dispersed and enthusiast did you hear that yes I've used in hence plethora and enthusiasts this is the new me I need some ice cream to put in this interval so I also baked vanilla cake that I'm going to turn into ice cream I use some half-sphere silicone mold to bake a bunch of half-sphere cakes in different colors I quickly leveled off the hump with and the silicone molds and now they're all out of the mold now it's time to glue two fins together to create a scoop of ice cream I'm actually going to glue them together with chocolate because I really want to make sure they stay together as an ice cream scoop I don't like the management role of the party so for the vanilla ice cream scoops I've used is it a white chocolate for the strawberry I use a bit of pink chocolate and for the chocolate I use chocolate chocolate you know that chocolate chocolate right chocolate that's chocolate and I have to once again call on sister sis please this princess Queen needs you now it is time to crumb coat all 12 ice cream scoop woo footage I have to chill all these ice cream scoops now so rock [Music] dimension is the best birthday ever I have to ice my ice cream scoops one more time and I used my adventure I iced them I use a small spatula and then I use a little piece of acetate to smooth them because I wanted them to look cute not by you you know what I mean yeah I wanted them to I need to ice all 12 ice cream soup soup ice cream too I can't stand when my ice cream oh I have a thing about it I get so mad if I'm using ice cream and heat I eat it so quickly but don't turn okay Ivan I don't want a milkshake I want ice cream I get really upset that I could do that really upset like it's one of my biggest pet peeves melted ice cream it's my birthday so I decided to make a pink Bowl I roll out my pink fondant to be 1/8 of an inch thick and then I use a French rolling pin to pick it up and drape it now i spose up on it all over my cake using my hands and my fondant smoother however air will get trapped in the indents naturally so you want to have a straight pin handy to help release it just gently press your pin into the fondant and then guide the air is fingertip now this giant sundae cake is too much for you to handle we are making sundae cupcakes at camp cake and taco cakes camping is a live stream making event where I bigger mr.chen make at home and yours we do everything together step by step I am rolling back the price of Camp cake to $19.99 but for 48 hours oh my goal is now fully covered and smooth and I need to trim it just a little bit higher than the cake so when I flip it over there's a bit of a lip do you know what it's time for whoo it's better since you spells nonsense you have been practicing yes not better so now my Super Bowl is right-side up and ready for ice cream before adding my scoops I want to make sure this bowl can really handle them so I am going to hammer in a sharpened dowel right down the center of the bowl into the cake or added base and this will help it stop wobbling because it would be a lot of a chain and I don't like my natural number four I'm going to arrange the scoop first in a circle at the top of the bowl and to make them fit perfectly I'm just having a set of circle cutters on hand so if I need to trim away any cases that they can all fit in there nicely I will do it as I see fit well I will do that as I see fit you really are my mentor I know something happened there you go in other news you're not now that my first six scoops are laid around the perimeter of the bowl I need to fill in the space that's in the center I don't want any fallen ice cream of any time I use a circle cutter to trim the scoop down so that will fit right in the center and support to the next layer of ice like an ice cream puzzle you're like fitting them together like this yes I like that analogy but wait I need to add the little edges at the end of my scoop what I'm doing is taking extra butter cream in all three flavors and using a small spatula to just how did I even do it again tapped it on the edge I just added a ring of buttercream that just looks sort of ruffled and natural along the edge of each soup in the bowl doing one flavor at a time now I need to add three more scoops on top one of each chocolate vanilla and strawberry and finally the crowning glory is the final conclusion now Kate rules everything around me cream get the layers spread it's ready round job we're really good guys sorry we've gone off track a lot in this episode but it's my birthday so if you two love wrapping and Katie's this is the official t-shirt this month to the cake pink lips let's sing for them Jocelyn and if we just get it so what do you like on a Sunday chocolate yes I mean a really simple chocolate sauce in the microwave with chocolate butter and a little bit of corn syrup which gives it a bit of shine just melt it all together until it's completely smooth and then I don't want it to be too hot because it's buttercream it melts I don't like melted butter cream either once the chocolate sauce was smooth and melted but not hot I poured it onto my slab and you want to know supreme I even let the soft grip onto the outside of my fool what because I Jocelyn I'm so mature I understand that all things can't be controlled oh wow understand life how to kick it up asone chocolate song you have to just go with it you know what else run Sunday well what I like on a Sunday I like chocolate shaving so I'm gonna make some with a vegetable peeler haven't seen that on that oh no you have carrot cake vegetable peelers were originally called chocolate pieces and then people started using them on like carrots and potatoes and somewhere along the way the name was changed I have my chocolate shavings they're ready they're peeled I'm going to sprinkle them on to my chocolate sauce before that this fun day is almost ready and I'm getting really excited but it needs two more thing can you guess what they are justice definitely sherry good fries no sprinkle No the shaving for the sometimes okay listen what would you rest the cherry oh oh every thank you so for my whipped cream I'm using Italian meringue buttercream absolutely plain no vanilla bean in it I wanted this is whipped cream I put it in a piping bag that I fitted with a star tip and piped a real tight and then finally every Sunday music cherry on top I made my cherry out of red fondant that I stiffened with a fit of CMC and I'm actually making it bright red because I want it to be like a maraschino cherry which I don't actually like but that's what I think of when I think of a scented then it led Jeremy and I down the path of how maraschino cherries are made and I wish I could run back off up do not Google how maraschino cherries are made just buy fresh cherries that came off the tree once the cherry was assembled I brushed on a little bit of piping gel with some red food coloring mist in to make it really you know really maraschino and I placed it on top of Manhattan you know I'm calling this time if this is like a never before heard of thing you ready because the ball is so big it's mine why do I look at the broken one okay ready it's my this will always be something I look back on economy so when I'm an 80 year old woman who's even more mature and sophisticated I'll look back if it's 40 year old first and thing if you want more ice cream themed cakes we have a whole playlist right here we don't right here I was a green metallic bug it was just a confetti you know what else I don't like I don't like melted ice cream and I don't like fun joke do this that's important if you want more giant food cake and finally if you want to subscribe which I'm sure you do is firstly after this episode I just sure 
welcome back to how to cake it I'm Yolanda and this week I am gonna teach you how to cake the Big Apple not New York City a Big Apple to begin making the Big Apple cake we need to make 10 pounds of my ultimate vanilla cake batter in four round pans thank you what a beautiful shiny Apple what's your name Oh Apple that's very original once the cakes are baked and cooled we're going to remove them from their pans level them and remove the caramelization from the bottom the next thing I need to do is simple syrup all four layers who can tell me what simple syrup is that's part of the equation what is done to the water and sugar yeah now you put your head ooh I can tell what kind of student you were okay so now that the simple syrup has soaked into my four vanilla cake layers I'm going to stack this cake in two parts to begin with two of my cakes are eight inches round and two of them are nine inches round I'm going to sandwich them together with some Italian meringue buttercream I built this cake in two parts because I want to create the center with seeds just like a real apple and if you've had an apple in half horizontally you can see that the center is like a star-shaped Center that holds the seeds I believe the technical term is star shaped center of Apple do you mean the corn cake or I see you have your phone out Jocelyn there no fullness allowed in class now that both my cakes have chilled and the filling is set I want to stack them on top of each other just the way they are stacking the bigger cake on top of the smaller cake begin to carve the Big Apple down orhan insert Big Apple music what can I say about carving an apple Apple really helped thank you I rounded out the top carving away slowly I made a valley in the center where the stem will later go New York can you fire Broadway [Music] you see how they like in depth and then they kind of have feet but something weird happening I had a really hard time carving an apple it's so interesting to me when I make a cake that I think the carving won't stump me and then I start to carve it and then like why doesn't it look like an apple at one point Jeremy asked me if I was making a molar if anyone is interested in seeing me make a giant molder cake please leave a hashtag below hashtag giant molar cake and should it have a cavity I decided to just taper this Apple in a bit more I think that's where it's going wrong I need to make it look less like a molar more like an apple and when I'm happy with my shape I take the top cake off the bottom cake and flip it over some of the flat side and it is time to create the star Apple Center I'm actually using a calyx cutter that I have just because it has five petals like the star in the center of an apple then I use a leaf cutter that I had that was the perfect sort of teardrop shape to indent five teardrops in the center of each cake now I'm going to scoop the cake out of those teardrops using just a simple metal spoon scooping it out and essentially what will happen is now that both halves have these indents when I line the cake up together that will make up the core I want to line these cavities before I put the other secret chambers yes I got something right excellent Jocelyn and you're paying attention that was a test once the Apple secret chambers are ready and carved I want to coat them with a little bit of chocolate I just melted some white and I actually added a touch of green because it always has that fresh look it's very subtle and what I did is brush that chocolate on to each one of the secret chambers with a paintbrush this kind of works like a crumb coat so I can place my seeds in before I place my seeds into the secret chambers I want to spread a little bit of Italian meringue buttercream with a small offset spatula on that layer of cake for the seeds of my Apple I chose to use Brazil nuts week after a lovely brown skin reminded me of ourselves and then I took the top cake flipped it over and made sure to align the secret chain there was secret chamber alignment this is an advanced class and yet there's so much now class I hope you've been paying attention now that my cake has been sculpted and assembled what is the next step in this process if you need help with your crumb coat and chill we do have crumb coat and chill bundles at how to kick it calm and we even have back-to-school bundles when I went back to school they didn't have pencils with cake puns on them but now they do we change that at how to cake it and they are in the back to school bundles we should have a ruler with a cake bun joseline joseline please call Connie after class Thank You professor cake duty ace one more time yes we do joseline there's no need for the back is there ivory in the sink no there was a bit added to be colored but you don't see that it's like pre-colored my father i iced the Big Apple one more time with Italian meringue buttercream and place it in the fridge to church while my cake is chilling I have decided to work on the stem-and-leaf for this Apple to make my leaf I'm gonna roll out some green gum paste and nice and thin and then I'm using an impression mat that I have it's actually of a rose leaf but I thought I would work here and you just press your gum paste between these two mats to give them that greening that a leaf has and then I trim the leaf to a nice shape with a sharp paring knife and dry it on some crumpled paper towel you don't want to flat partly if you want a realistic leaf that kind of looks like it's already drying up a bit well I know most of the time when you go to the grocery store the apples don't have the leaves but I always find it really special when I get an apple this is really fun have we not discuss this perform that we shall do there's a strawberry the strawberry is the opposite most of the time they don't have the stem yeah and then you feel special with an apple I feel special and they're still over your father but I'm happy with my leaf I work on the stem of the Apple I used the same green gum paste that I just sort of lightened up a little and then I rolled it into a cord it's just a tiny bit thicker at one end trimmed it to the right length and then I inserted a floral wire inside this will help me place it into my cake and help keep the stand up right on it I wanted to create a bit of a curve on the stem so I just bent it ever so slightly and then I placed the exposed wire down into a cake dummy to allow my stem to dry the top right I'm headed back to the Big Apple I wish that was actually true right now I'm talking about my Big Apple cake and it's time to cover it in fondant I rolled my red fondant into a large enough sheet to cover the whole Apple I then picked up my sheet of fondant on a French rolling pin draped it over the Apple and began to smooth the fondant onto the cake this is really tricky because the cake is tall it's narrower at the bottom and it also has a valley at the top so there is going to be air trapped under that valley to release that air I use a straight pin I just make a slight hole in the center and use my fingertips to smooth the fondant down releasing the air through the hole and you don't have to worry about the hole because the stem will cover it up later smooth the fondant all around the Apple this can be really tricky when a cake is very tapered at the bottom because you get a lot of folds the fondant just folds up onto itself because there's more fondant than cake so take your time and really smooth it around pull the folds apart and smooth the fondant to the cake I did have some tearing and cracking in my fondant because it took a while to smooth all of it around the cake this is really common with tall cakes and also I find when I have fondant that has been dyed or needed a lot it can tend to crack a little bit more than untouched fondant so what I'm happy about is this cake will later be painted but I can also patch these cracks now that my fondant is chilled I'm going to use some my leftover fondant and make a paste listen up there is a new Jeremy I see you on your phone what do I normally mix with fondant to create a fondant water Thank You Jocelyn Jeremy just I think you should give up on the hand because it's not gonna work in this fast alcohol as we know evaporates faster than water that's why I paint with it and I thought maybe that will help my paste dry faster and a little more now so that it went into all the cracks and tears and folds and crevices you can just cover anything up and it was incredibly hot so what happens when it's hot is and humid do you fondant it can be very sweaty on the surface and this is sometimes not sometimes this makes it harder to work with so what I did to smooth my pace this time is I actually used a damp or wet paintbrush and in this case I wasn't that upset about having to do this because it added to the texture of the Apple look on the bright side sometimes things happen to teach you something those are called life lessons and Jocelyn's not but I do love that you tried bonded face into life is thatis for me it's a life lesson okay it's time to paint this food coloring is very intense it's very concentrated and it's always a little bit on the bright side except for ivory to paint my Apple I actually created two paints so one with some red food coloring and clear food grade alcohol and the other was some golden yellow mixed with a touch of white and cleared food grade alcohol and this is to help make the yellow more opaque first thing I'm gonna do is paint the entire Apple in one direction so that's up and down from the inside of the valley all the way down to the bottom with my red paint the next thing I'm going to do is then take some of my nice yellow paint that was a different brush I'm gonna paint areas again in the same direction but not the whole a whole just sort of patches of this yellow and that's because you've Apple please you can see areas right on Apple yeah yeah like she's not just plain red right there's spots and there's like these little patches and variations Thank You Apple you're gonna get an apple after class wonder if apples need apples and I also use some my yellow paint and speckled the Apple so just getting some paint on end of my paint brush and using my fingertip and basically flicking the paint towards the Apple if you'd like to pre-order my upcoming cake book you can get it before it's even on the Shelf through the links below the book has easy-to-follow steps to make 20 new cakes never before seen on this channel plus Walter because he forced me and I can assure you the steps will really help you much more than I do here you're pretty good yeah I'm good I'm good I'm good but there's editing involved well there was editing in a book ok fair time to add my stem and my leaf but before that I do want to add a little bit of paint and color to those items items the parts to those parts of the Apple to paint my leaves I am using some dry green and yellow color dust the same color dust I use on my strawberry leaf for the stem I'm actually gonna use some Brown gel food coloring just a dot of it and a clean dry brush and I'm gonna brush that gel on in an upward motion because when you really look at an Apple stem you can see that it is sort of a green base right this is the part that was attached to the tree and then as it dries out it starts to turn so I decide on what part of the Apple I like as the front and then I insert my stem down into the center and finally I attach is your coffee good Jared did you bring me one no actually I never understood why people brought teachers apples if I was a teacher I would want you to bring me coffee and then we're gonna add the leaf my leaf was just propped between my stem and the top of the Apple but you can use a little bit of royal icing to hold it in place community to this Big Apple is the perfect super shiny Apple to give to any professor even though she'd rather have coffee if you're getting ready to go back to school share this video with your friends I hope it makes you feel better thank you for joining me on how to kick it classes next Tuesday if you like giant food cakes there's a playlist right here and there's also a back-to-school playlist right here that you can also share it oh and everyone subscribe you'll get an A+ 
you're watching how to take it I'm Yolanda and they're all the rage so I decided to take a how to cake it digit spinner out of cake to make this business better cake I baked 10 pounds of my ultimate chocolate cake in four round pins the first thing I need to do is remove all four of my chocolate cakes from their pans and level them make sure to save your cake hump we're going to use them later Oh save the hump now I'm going to cut each cake into two layers if your whole tom is crave and you agree that fidgets spinner should be edible please share this video with all your fidget spinning friends I don't think I have anything consistent oh my son my son that count right yes sir squeeze is in the house as usual people don't stay in the house enough anymore time you got to be like so squeezes into half I feel like you should cheer when I say it like we're at a house party kitten play is over there or put in a house where you drop it okay there's okay I can't wait to see where Hans house party graphic excellent don't forget there is please it's part of our consult and show bundles and the herbs back and stuff that how to keep that like you know how to save your booze in the house of his crew anywhere without in bundles have you met offset spatula I need to give a proper shout out because someone else is in the house today it's the half man who made my fidget spinner turntable for me it's essentially like a lazy susan or a turntable but in the shape of digits minute so I just want to thank the hacks with so much because this morning is impossible without now I need to use my fidget spinners turntable just the top part not the turning part and I'm going to lay it upside down onto my largest round cake and now I need to trim away the parts that are sticking out the board that will become the center of my statistic I now say it's one of the 10 inch layers that I've carved away into the center of the fidgets spinner board I'm going to carve each of my seven inch cakes to butt up against the center cake completely covering my digits spinner shapes board that's a really easy thing to say now I have one layer of chocolate cake on the fidgets spinner shaped for the next thing I need to do is fill this cake and for that I've decided to dye some buttercream a nice shade of pink like a nice punchy how to cake it because this is a how-to cake it fidgets spinner so now I'm going to take this beautiful punchy pink buttercream and ice the top of this digits ability or what's the center of the picture okay once I have a nice layer of buttercream on I'm going to top the fidgets center with the other four layers of cake so they all need to be carved just like the first layers and fit in place completing the shape now guess what my DJ presidential from code and chill I've decided to come focus in Klingon Italian Ori buttercream and I use the small spatula just really gluing all the comments to the phidget spinner and then actually I chose a conical children to be spinning oh no no no no no no I wanted to let go wow this is my new participant it's time to ice my fidget Center cake one more time in a car alluring buttercream and chill it remember now chumps I told you to say we're going to use them now to recreate the center part of the fidget spinner which probably has me leave it in the comments below if you know what a skull and what I'm going to do is take one of my house level it a bit and create that little circular disks that sort of rest on top and bottom of the kitchen where you spent I used a small cake pan and a circle cutter to achieve the spinner shape I was looking for since this is a how-to cake it fidgets spinner I'm going to put sweets on each end I'm going to use my phidget spinner to help me decide what kind of dessert to have that's a great use right so I'm planning to make a tiny pie a tiny cake and a tiny doughnut well they're not really tiny the doughnut was real size I'm going to create my small cake for this I've again leveled one of my cake house and use a small pan to cut out a circle now I want to layer this tiny little piece taken two layers just like a cake for my small pie once again using a cake pan to cut out a circle but I also need to bevel this circle the way that a piping tip so I'm doing this upside down diffusing a small serrated knife to cut an a-line cut and create small pie finally I need to create my zone for this I cut out the same sized circle of cake from a cake hump and then I use a small serrated knife to essentially carve a doughnut and then using a circle cutter cutting out the center and rounding out that little Valley as well I really felt like eating a doughnut while making this that's just some personal information for others but I want to make sure that all three of my desserts are the same size on the ends of my fidgets spinner so I'm using the same size cake pans to carpet.this we admit the house we have such a good time as the last party we invited him again did you bring a bundle I just want to be clear sir squeezes bundle is not the only bundle in industry there is the summertime bundle that's - there's nothing like a summertime party right make sure to get yours at how to kick it calm once the simple things were soaked in Ivan crumb coated all of these cake parts the center of the fidgets Center the dullness of pie images oh and I also remember how I cut the cake into layers I filled it first and rounded chill time now I need to ice all four of these little cakes one more time in Italian meringue buttercream with the help of Sur squeezes bundle I'd be nothing about four squeezes and fumble are you interested in cocoa are you fair enough of those no back to the main digit spinner cake that sounds millions husband means finches so I decided to roll out my Till's on it into one huge sheets and then carefully pick it up onto a french rolling pin and drape it over working quickly I use my hands to smooth it down the fidget spinner really working on all of the edges first the corner first because that's where fundable to tear there was some mild cracking which I'll address later but for the most part of very happy and then I used a sharp paring knife to cut it I had to hold my knife parallel to the stingy spinner board that was made and run it along the base cutting away the excess I want places take images to chill so that the fondant can stiffen up a bit and I can address these small tears and cracking in the meantime I'm going to cover the top of the pivot Center the little top that I created in the same teal fondant I decided to cover the center of the fidgets spinner in two parts because I had I stood upside down so first i draped my teal fondant over one side and trimmed it and then i flip the cake over spread on a thin layer of buttercream and covered that side as my fields line we need to stop all this spinning for a minute and talk about the replicate contest remember a while back I asked you guys to replicate some of my cakes in your very own way and we have chosen the winners whose cakes will appear in my upcoming face book it's so exciting I've actually seen it myself your work printed in my book and they looked incredible we will be announcing the name of each winner over on my Instagram so head over to my account the handle is right here or you can always just search the hashtag replicate if you'd like to preorder my book the link is in the description below you can order it right now before it even hits the shelves I'm going to use some of my leftover teal fondant to create a fondant piece to fill in the cracks on my main digits inner cake I create a bit of fondant paste with some left over to your fondant and some water and what I like to do is just work the water in with a small spatula just sort of blending it until it reaches the consistency of royal icing now that my pace is a perfect consistency I'm going to apply it to the top edges of my citrus cake I like to use a small spatula and I just sort of iced it into the crap crap ourselves Center is made now we got to get to the little cakes on top first I'm going to work on my tiny little pie first thing I did was create the foil container that pies are often baked in for this I rolled out some grey fondant and covered my pie which is now upside down then I took some tin foil and crumpled it up and use this to texture the fondant and make it look like well crumpled up foil so I used crumbled up foil to create consoled up foil once I'm happy with my foil texture on my pie I then place it in the fridge to chill so that I can paint it now that the fondant is a little bit more sturdy I'm going to paint the gray fondant silver to look like foil so I just mix a little bit of silver luster dust with clear food grade alcohol and brush it all over my pie shell you don't have to brush the top because this cake will be turned over and nobody will see the bus once my paint is dry I can create the pie on top so what I did is roll out some red fondant a circle of red fondant and then I just sort of poked it sorry I don't have a more technical term for that I want to you know hope eyes don't look perfectly yes right so just wanted it to look like the top of a pot and then I laid it on top of my chocolate cake now I need to recreate the lattice pastry on the pie it's so much fun so what you do is dry your fondant to look like pastry so I used ivory chocolate and once you're happy with the color you're going to roll it out and then cut strips and I cut my strip without a ruler the pie it has to look rustic right right improve it it don't use that perfectly rustic don't use that word rustic and organic and then I'm going to create the lattice on top of the pie so you lay down three strips in the same direction then you bend them halfway back then you lay a strip down then you put it over that I'm not going to describe the full process but you want it to look these are intertwined so each strip should go over and they're over and under over and under and the next thing I want to do is paint these strips to look like a big-time library yes chocolate surprise I mixed my ivory with clear food grade alcohol and I painted each strip with my paint and as a final touch I will know it's not quite final almost final touch I sprinkled some sugar on to the pastry - I love that on a pie I love that like crispy sugary crust to recreate the look of a cooked pie I put some jam into a parchment paper bag and then I just typed it over my red fondant and all the exposed parts between my lattice mark engineering cake engineer yeah you'll and again I wear a tinfoil ring to prove it I'm gonna put one on and go to like an engineering convention and when I get there I'm going to be like this engineer is in the house I'm guessing I get kicked out right there I'm going to move on and save my doughnut my favorite kind of doughnut is chocolate bits of chocolate leaves because YUM I roll out my chocolates on it and then I touch a band and use that band to cover the inside interfere with the job I just the rest of my chocolate on it over the donut moving it around trim away the excess underneath the bottom and then I trim away the center hole as for my plays I'm using modeling chocolate I rolled out my modeling chocolate and drape it over the top of the donut and then I use the sharp paring knife to just sort of cut it in a you know a wavy circle around the donut is if it displays that was poured on I really wanted to do that I'm not going to like it every donut needs sprinkles I feel the first thing I'm going to do is brush on a little bit clear piping gel onto my modeling chocolate and then sprinkle the donut I actually use real sprinkles I didn't create some up on it because this donut in the light side strawberry seeds took me over the edge I just I need a minute finally I guess make the tiny shape so I covered my cake first with yellow fondant and trimmed away the excess and then I covered the top with some punchy pink fondant and I want to treat like a scalloped edge around the side as if that had been poured also like a glaze over the case but this time I wanted my scallop to be seasoned unlike my donut because that was enough random actions my cake is almost done but I feel it really needs some rosettes as any bakery pieces have so for that I'm softening a little bit of white fondant with vegetable shortening and placing it into my clay extruder and I'm using the face plate of the place to do that creates a rope it's actually you know what it's actually kind of this shape it's this shape the face plate and once you've extruded the cord you then just twist it slightly to get that rope effect and wind them up on each other creating the look of like a pipe tool set but it's fondant wanted to create the type of bakery cake that has you know the marks of where you're supposed to cut it already and slice it I cut out a parchment paper circle I then folded it into twelve equal sections now I'm going to use that as a template on top of my tiny cake and then I use a ruler and my sharp paring knife to join the lines create the slice marks you don't want to cut deep you just want to see the line now that my tiny cake is divided into 12 slices I'm going to glue the rosettes on to the candidature slices a little bit of clear piping I'm going to top each one of my rosettes with a cherry and in this case I'm using a small red candy B because of surface size it's time to assemble this digit spinner but before that I want to label it as a headache it's kitchen spinner I've rolled out some black fondant nice and thin and then I use some letter cutters to cut out HP I then place the center of my fidget spinner you guessed it in the center of my fidget Center gluing it on with a little bit of royal icing bit this this stopped really stressful because the spinner the fidgets that are kept spinning Oh Derrick how dare it do what it said it was going to do finally I drew on all three of my mini cakes my mini cherries hi my mini notes my regular size chocolate glazed doughnut pen my mini cake please

you don't know this right no I you know what I think cuz I was doing that today with the cake I made him today and Cody asked me why I was using a pin cuz you can't really see on camera the bubble as well as you can like your eyes but they're there I think only when the mind the fondant is colorful that is like easier to see colorful today it's colorful but it wasn't that big of an air bubble okay not good I'm glück with these learning as well yes is asking the important question I'm taking a Nolan all right so there's the sidekick of sir squeeze that's an easy one yes well like you put together they always want to be together yeah so I keep them together and then they I see okay salt well I see sprinkles somewhere where are the sprinkles no okay let's - question because I know that

welcome back how to take it I'm Yolanda and this week we are gearing up to Cinco DeMayo tilt I am taking an avocado this time I just thought I'd make it flow please subscribe to this channel and don't forget to the notification valve so you know when I have new videos we make my avocado I think vanilla cake in an egg-shaped pan but first I have to dye my batter the perfect avocado color we make to have just like a sphere pen so I like to level the cake in the pan if your cakes would have baked over the lip a little and minded I use a smaller knife to cut away the crust so that I could see the top of the pan before leveling the next thing I need to do to the two halves of my eggs are removed all the carmelization so I put them flat sides down and then just use a serrated knife to cut away all the carmelization from the stone side of each cake we just want to see avocado yellow cake at this point now I'm going to hold my two halves together and carve the avocado shape because I bake this in an egg pan there really isn't not much shaping to do I just sort of tapered in what was in the neck of the avocado if you can't find an egg pan you could alternatively make this in a fair pan you'll just have more cake and carve away avocados have a big pit inside so I need to create a crevice inside what a crevasse I started thinking about what I would use as the pit and I decided on a kinder egg and so what I did is I just split open the kinder egg along the seam I just use the tip of my paring knife and then I melted some cocoa candy milk and filled to the inside of each half of the egg I actually filled two eggs just in case plus I can give the toy to my son and get bonus points once the half of the eggs were filled I put them in the fridge to chill and set up so that it will be sturdier when it's the fit inside my avocado once they're fully set I'm going to lay one half on one half of my avocado cake with a flat side down and then I'm going to Center it and position it where I want it and just trace around it at the top of my paring and then I use a spoon to scoop out that area of case so that might fit to be nestled perfectly inside now I want a simple care if you taste with the help of this squeeze a lot so that they stay nice and moist avocados are far from dry I use a little bit of chocolate spread on top of one half and sandwich both have together to create a solid profit in order to sandwich my avocado cakes together i melted some green and yellow candy melts and blended them together until they match the color of my feet I spread a thin layer onto one half of my avocado paste gently place my chocolate dipped in and then I don't with the other half of the avocado cake on top again you can fill in any gaps in the seams of the cake with some more of your avocado colored chocolate it's time to crumb coat and chill this avocado however I need to color my buttercream to the perfect avocado like that green goodness that's right we have the skin of an avocado if you like making food cakes as much as I do and get creative making cakes look like your favorite food there is a food cake playlist right over here that you can check out broke to you ah burger eat up helping up they're just ready watermelon that pineapple okay turkeys oh yeah forget Turkey that's my favorite now that my buttercream is the right color I'm going to come coat and chill this avocado yours also dance has to incorporate Star Wars and please good mile go hold on I don't even know okay I'm gonna do I like my favor and if you want the Meili Cady with your t-shirt it's at how to take it calm if my crumb coat is chilled time to ice this case with a nice layer of my avocado buttercream and chill it once again once your buttercream is chilled and really do want it to be changed to the next steps you can smooth out the ridges using a small icing spatula and get the avocados nice at this point I started to get really hungry I did I wanted guacamole I've colored some fondant to resemble avocado skin which is a very dark green but almost with a brown undertone a very natural dark green I roll the fondant out about an eighth of an inch thick making sure it's large enough to drape over my cake pick it up on my French rolling pin and drape it over and then I use my hands as usual when I have a soft round cake to move it all over the case cuffing respondents underneath then I cut away some of the excess but not right SSE and I decided to flip everything I've got I know I decided to split my avocado onto a soft floral fun and then just bring all these excess fondant up around the bottom trimming away the excess I thought I was really clever I figured that because the turkey skin eater worked so well for Turkey you can get your turkey skin creator right here on how to cake it clearly it could help me create the texture of avocados yes no no no it wasn't seeds enough it wasn't like wrinkly so i decided to use some hemp oil that i crumpled up yeah yeah so this we're going to put on how to take a joke on as well we're going to call it the avocado skin either I use my avocado skin either to press gently into the fondant all around the avocado so delicate and rare tool it's only available at had a cake accom don't think you can just go to your dollar store and get some simple that have lit up you can't I'm going to pre crumple it for you once I was happy with my avocado texture I decided to paint this cake and give the avocado color a little more you know I look at avocados I'm like this got it got the hump I mix a little bit of avocado food coloring with brown food coloring and then I dilute it with the clear food grade alcohol I paint this mixture over the entire surface of the cake to give depth to the color and then I put the cake in the fridge to chill and let the paint dry avocados skin looks different in the ripening process and the promise of avocados is you buy them can we sit down and they're like I'm alright I'm not right I'm not right I'm not right I'm not right all right I'm bad that's the problem with them and I think you have a seven minute seven minute window to eat the avocado when I made my watermelon cake which you can watch right over here otherwise known as Walter melon I had to make an of the top of him so all the bottoms have enough to and they kind of stick out a bit from avocado I use a small amount of tan colored fondant like left lemon el and I just molded and sculpted a little nub using some sculpting tools I used a star piping tip to just create texture and finally I painted the mouth with a little bit of brown food coloring diluted with clear food grade of the giant avocado is looking a little bit shiny so what I did is I used some light cocoa powder and a soft brush and brushed it all over the surface it just dissolves on the surface and absorbs and it mattifies the avocado color I have to eat this avocado face away in Colorado I cut it open around the tip and separated the have and then I just jug in with a spoon it was perfectly like I got the seven-minute window thanks goodness thank you for watching how to take yet please subscribe to this channel and hit that notification about you know I have made a new face [Music] 
you know what I want to wear this and order a pumpkin spice laughs just walk into a coffee shop like guess what I want lemonade welcome I'm having cake it I'm Yolanda and today is the release of the first patty cake get cake bug yes we have a soft cover Edition and a hard cover I'm a cover girl and in celebration of Halloween today I am making a jack-o'-lantern trick-or-treating make this jack-o'-lantern trick-or-treat bucket I am baking 12 pounds of my ultimate chocolate cake dyed black Wow some really scary though it's a really cute jacket laughter right once my cakes are baked and cooled I'm gonna remove them from their pans and level them the next thing I need to do is simple syrup these black chocolate cakes sir squeeze and Finnell are inseparable they come in a few bundles together on how to kick it Tom they demanded I store them on the same shelf you know she's a bit like Yoko you know what I mean oh she is no she's had a cake it is different since she got here that's all the same to fill these cakes I dyed some of my Italian meringue buttercream orange actually I've got a whole batch - an orange like hallelujah unmistakeably right it's orange now I'm going to fill my cakes with this butter theme layering the black chocolate cake buttercream black chocolate buttercream so it's all stacked up and it's plate bitch - check there's no it's not pumpkin it's not sunset whatever other words it it's not fast orange the next thing I want to do is carve this into my jack-o'-lantern bucket shape I begin by slipping line cake I flip my cake over and I mark a five inch circle on top using a small cake pin and then I carved from that mark down about halfway rounding out the cake this is when I slipped it back right side up and carved again down to the center and I realized I felt like the keepers in the wheel bitch I really did so thank goodness here's a tip whenever I love all my cakes I always keep my hunks like I have them in a bowl or tray next to me so in this case I used up and I actually didn't even have to put ice in between it because I think just from having my hand to press it and hold it no such a thin piece of cake so just sit here I I'm gonna crumb cotton shell yes said it with confidence yes how to crumb go and chill its page 56 under what yo knows it's 56 look at that I am crumb coating in Chile and of course you need my Italian meringue buttercream recipe which is in here oh let me look in your recipe box I put it in a golden bowl I wanted it to be like one of those cards so when you flip to this page and do it but apparently they can't do that in publishing and it's in his contract but I have to show him cancel here's sir screen he's more dressed up than I am look at him look at me I'm like - and he's formal but once my crown saw it was chilled I iced the cake again all in orange buttercream orange I sent to Jeremy if I never see orange buttercream again I'll be shocked if you love the idea of black cake and orange buttercream please share this video it's extremely Halloween and we have an entire Halloween playlist I need to tell the truth about this cake when can I do that [Music] time to address the handle these buckets have like a thin plastic handle perfect so you can like saunter down the street with your candy I used to hate when so there's the handle breaks and it falls out of the rock I think then I risk candy on the sidewalk and that's upsetting I'm going to take some black fondant and roll it out and then I'm going to brush some clear piping gel onto a for a while set that onto the fondant and then just pinch the fondant up around the liner put the handles quite thin and then what I'm gonna do is roll that fondant with a wire in it on the table and just make it look like a nice smooth I need this handle just sort of bent not sort of bent I need it to Bend so it will fit into the cake but because of the wire it has a tendency to want to bounce back so what I did is I wrapped it along the bottom edge of the cake pen and I use some masking tape on the exposed bit of wire and tape them to a cake board to sort of hold it in place so now that we'll have some time to somewhat dry while I finish this cake at the bottom of the thin handle there are some little round black things don't know what they're called but I think they prevent the handle from pulling out of the bucket so I'm gonna make them I rolled out a little bit of black fondant and used a round piping tip to cut out a few circles and then I just used the blade of my knife to make a little line in it because that little black thing has a little scene remember when you go trick-or-treating and you see like a chocolate bar on the floor that was like a run over by a fight it's so sad is that this mine okay I don't like wasteful candy you know what else I don't like I don't like when you get to somebody's house and they give you raisins if you are a raisin giver please stop time to cover this cake in fondant guess what color or an orange a little tip about making orange fondant I find it easier to mix yellow fondant with red supposed to adding a bunch of orange food coloring to white light so to cover this bucket I'm going to cover one side of it first halfway and then the other side of it and some of the SS because these jack-o'-lantern Halloween buckets actually have a theme I want to create a scene on purpose perfect yes purposely making a scene happens rounding on her Jacob I'm going to cut a seam I did use of fabric that ring came to help me measure halfway and I also aligned the fabric measuring tape up along the side and ran my knife along it to cut the seat I'm going to rule out the rest of the fondant and cover the other half of the kink in the same manner once again I am gonna chill it before having the scene when cutting off the excess fondant at the scene this time you want to make sure not to cut too much because we don't want that gap so just really keep in mind where you're finding this cut underneath this slab of fondant and carefully cut the scene once again now for the excess fondant at the top of the cake I'm going to use a circle cutter to trim that away and this will be the opening of the jack-o'-lantern bucket I wanted to address a lot of the questions people have about fondant in my cake book and so there's a section called don't fear the fondant can you see my eyes Jeremy don't fear it don't fear that I shouldn't use the hardcover oh my god wait for that more time hold on yes I like this now it's getting Halloween don't fear the fondant should move my finger the next thing I need to do is make indents in this jack-o'-lantern pumpkin because it has lines in it to show you that it's a pumpkin not a ball but unlike my pumpkin cake which I made last year where the lines really since nature this one is not really for nature the lines are evenly spaced around the bucket I use the measuring tape to measure around and make sure that they were equally spaced and then I also held it along the side and ran my bone tool I didn't use a bone tool I used to painting tool I'm so sorry they're like I use a sculpting tool thank you now I need to address the scene because the seam on these buckets sort of sticks out a little I guess it's made in a mold yeah so what I wanted to do was use my clay extruder with the smallest circle faceplate I extruded some orange fondant after softening it with a little vegetable shortening and then added that thin thin cord of orange fondant over the scene with a bit of clear piping gel [Music] the next thing I need to do is make a rim for the top of the bucket so once again I extrude it some fondant actually using a face plate on my clay extruder that I've never used before it's like a long rectangle and then I took that strip and I wrapped it around a circle cutter that's the same cutter I used to cut the opening and then I just set it in the fridge to chill for a bit before adding it to the cake time to make this plastic pumpkin a jacqueline I made myself a template of the type of face that's usually on these buckets it's kind of like a laughing jack-o'-lantern what's that - because he needs a lot of candy from the template I cut out two eyes a nose and a mouth and leave three to use these template pieces line them up on the front of my pumpkin and cut them out I used it's not really a scalpel but it's an exacto knife but it's all metal so it makes me feel like it's a scalpel that's my Halloween once the face is cut out and I'm happy with it it is time to paint this cake because these jack-o'-lanterns buckets are plastic they have a bit of machine so nice flat exponent so I'm going to paint it with you guessed it Orange I mixed some orange food coloring with clear food grade alcohol and I brushed it all around the cake in an up and down motion thank you to everyone who has pre-ordered my book they are going out as we speak and if you have it order you can still order get it on how to kick it off Tom or you can go into your local book store and buy one I actually can't wait to walk into a bookstore and see it and I'm going to do that tonight at my book signing at indigo war p.m. that's please come and say hello it's gonna be so much fun I can't appeal and I can't wait to see this on the shelf it better be neatly displayed I'm gonna have to go there everyday now it's gonna be a problem while my paint is drying I'm going to roll out some black fondant I used the same template pieces that I used before for the eyes nose and mouth I just lined them up on top of my black fondant is the same exacto knife and cut them all out now that the paint is dry on my cake only do this once the paint is dry I'm going to add these black features into the gaps that are left behind on the cake a good thing to do is use a paintbrush if you do need to push in that way you can sort of use the paintbrush and just stroke along the fondant pushing it in rather than your fingertip which will leave a mark unless you've cut off your fingerprints I'm trying to make this really scary I mean under my first year we made up I made a plain second year I made a severed maggot filled leg and this year I'm like I feel like we're Britain so I'm just trying to add some scary elements in a merry time to add my handle to this um I was really excited okay the good thing about making this handle on the same day and not too far in advance is that it will be a little more stable but it won't be so dry that if I have to adjust it as I'm putting it into the cable we don't love that I mark an equal distance on either side of the bucket right beside the seam from the top rim and then I poke the whole handle and guess what goes nice bucket what is this bucket ensign thank you fill the top of this bucket with Halloween candy of your choice I did chocolates some eyeball chocolates that were wrapped up what I'll say for the net oh I both gummies hashtag no raisins hashtag no raisins please don't [Music] I like raisins just not as a tree I just feel like it's wrong I feel like it's you know it's wrong it's Halloween don't ruin your child's Halloween was crazy I will see you guys on Thursday at 5 p.m. est for my YouTube live episode I'm not going to tell you what city I'm gonna be ok so no no I want to tell this right now you're gonna love this or huh so do you remember when I mentioned to the viewers that checked used to rule like to guy ritchie the clips meaning he would flip the camera while i took the cake for really fish shop and jeremy acted like that commented me bothered him but apparently when I went to flip the jack-o'-lantern fuck it Jeremy was like oh watch what I'm gonna do except she didn't realize is that because he has the camera on a monopod the monopod physically stopped the camera from flipping all the way so or how we have something like maybe 1/4 clip it was amazing it's amazing and then when I flipped it back he tried it again guys I even changed my flip direction for Jeremy the second time because he felt more comfortable clipping this way and I was like fine I'll I'll reverse my hands still no chat shot yeah hashtag check Ritchie let's do it let's do it and then it just

welcome back to how to take it I'm Yolanda and this means there is a battle on how to take it it's the French macaron versus the magazine I wanted another wrestling like a rocket from macaroon pregnant natural sounds back it's true it's ignored is to make my macaroon cake I am using vanilla cake and chocolate cake I've dyed my vanilla cake I know will not laugh I'm going to keep saying lol a package oh you've ever said that know anyone for my to pink vanilla cake I placed a smaller cake pan on top and a small serrated knife straight down to help remove economization from the side I round off the top edges all the way around to create that Mackinac cookie shape and I want to remove all of the criminalization from the sides itself so the chocolate cake I level that baby of mothers of water sizzles now yes isn't it okay of course the chocolate cake is going to become like the buttercream filling that's inside the macro so I leveled it and then I slightly rounded off the top edge and the bottom edge so it's kind of like a big chocolate disk for patty at this time I'm going to flip over to my macaroon cake now so this case I have faced coconut one of my favorite and it makes sense I removed my free coconut cake from their pens leveled them remove the carmelization from the bottom and then I stack them one on top of the other just to get an eyes to the shape on one now I'm going to unstack them and carved each one I'm trying to create just a little cake mound let's take it out it's more of a skill so what I do is I carve each layer removing all the carmelization on the sides and I do one at a time but keeping in mind that they're all going to be stacked together so then they are back to want to make sure I see that coconut I want to run through a cookie I want to go to home island Jeremy no comment sir you like I know I knew it Jeremy's like I wish I had a coconut to throw it once I'm happy with the shape it is now time to simple syrup all of my cake yes I'm going to simple syrup for macaron and the mushroom together because despite their differences they actually get along for now can we place it so like I'm reading it that we are just going to hope we're not giving in so much work now yes we make a little bit fold it it let's dive back into my Mackinac cake for the Mackinac shells which is a king can delegate I want to pay some pink buttercream a plastic so I take a little bit of my spelling meringue buttercream and diet to masticate asbestos to boozy you don't need you to match all of all who like containers captain left it's time to crank up see pink macaron shells with my pink buttercream I apply it with a small offset spatula i crumb coat the two pink shells and pop them in the fridge to kill you my family always point to the fertilizer they can't even see it right now - maybe the door yeah yes they have me wedged between the prison and ovens when I got this I just want to be clear now for the chocolate cake that's going to come to filling I crumb coat that with my plan Italian meringue buttercream and pop it in the fridge once my crumb coat is chilled it's time to ice cream cake so again I'm icing the pink macaron shells in my pink buttercream try to get them as smooth as possible at this point and placing them back in the fridge to check now for the chocolate cake that is filling Joplin I used my invention oh my gosh numbered us yeah I don't even have it it I might as well because you can't see it the little piece of acetate that I use because I want to maintain that curve so that it looks like the buttercream filling that is suppressed I've also used my invention to make my giant cupcake cake and my Venus clinic yeah if you want to see more food cakes I have a pretty list here except we're going to put both methanol and exactly it is time to cover my method off help in size pink fondant I have created a shape that's similar to cake and buttercream inside some little more wisely and then I roll it out pick it up on a trench rolling pin and Jerry's like I am NOT coming back how did I end up here I had a real job Marilla and then I served it over with my friends and the finest meter trimming away all the excess fondant from the bottom with a short hair then I repeat this process for the second now I need to recreate the little sort of layer of fluffy air bubbles that happens at the base you don't know just where out directory how could I not do that you think I would leave that out on this interview strictly me looking at Jacko's like and what I decided was to take the remaining pink fondant that I had and I really needed it well quite a gift and vegetable shortening although vegetable shortening help soften your fondant you can take it too far it ends up breaking it down so I basically took the fondant too far unperfect because I wanted it to break yeah then what I did is I rolled it into one long Jam that is the comfort of my picnic as I roll it you can see the edges like spring and breaking and pulling apart but in this case I'm actually happy is happening to apply these bands for the base of each cake I'm going to first rush on a little bit of clear speaking gel and then I carefully apply the band all the way around now they did break apart when I pick them up which I expenses at this point that's the local going for the great thing is don't have to hide the themes you don't have to hide the flaws it's just helping it go realistic we are going to assemble our French macaron cake first I put one of the pink layers up skies down to the flash siding top then I carefully transferred a chocolate buttercream liner right on top and then finally the final pink layer on top with the dome inside okay Mac it off you're ready you look beautiful but it's time for you to step aside for a moment and give a little bit of a spotlight to macaroon it is her date well after all I need to fill and crumb coat her I decided that the macaroon need it to be more coconuty so I ended up taking my three layers and layer in them Oh so that bad so I'm going to create some coconut buttercream I like to mix in some creams coconut which is just the same thing that they used to miss Pina colonics I just whip spat into my brother family chastity and then I spilled all six layers with my coconut butter spoons crumb coated them and so what's the consult and Sheldon young Americans in letting that go I feel like I can't else do the Stormtrooper duck function it's pointless yes I can't go back there it'll just drop them in every video people women no longer make stuff if you haven't seen my Star Wars stormtrooper helmet cake I will put it in a character service right over here and don't forget the maybe Casey with you t-shirt is still available and how to keep it off along with my crumb coat and chill tea now that my crumb coat is chilled I'm going to ice this cake with some more coconut buttercream I'm putting on quite a good layer because now I'm going to press in some toasted coconut chips they've been lightly toasted to give them a surin a hue like it's already doing so with the balls in my hand I'm just pressing in the coconut just getting it all around this macaroon I relate to her because she's probably wishing she could control her coconut more the way I was told my hair but she she's come to accept that how she looks she's not trying to be a French knock it off she's trying to be that's rude now I happen to like my macaroons with a little bit of chocolate I love chocolate and coconut am i right oh yeah I'm not even dating Jeremy what I did was I melted some light cocoa candy melts and then piped and my on top of my school I also piped online of chocolate down around the base to make it most husband Matthew tipped so take that French macaron are you dipped in chocolate no I don't think so I don't think for YouTube delicate for that in conclusion nobody won the battle they were both beautiful and delicious in their own way don't forget to watch next week because it's yo-yo day and finally going to reveal my secret project and an amazing way to you guys whispers please shoot whatever you got don't forget to subscribe to this channel hits a notification bell and I will see you on Tuesday yo-yos the yo-yo and her yo-yos 
welcome back to how to cake it I'm Yolanda and this week I am gonna teach you how to cake the Big Apple not New York City a Big Apple to begin making the Big Apple cake we need to make 10 pounds of my ultimate vanilla cake batter in four round pans thank you what a beautiful shiny Apple what's your name Oh Apple that's very original once the cakes are baked and cooled we're going to remove them from their pans level them and remove the caramelization from the bottom the next thing I need to do is simple syrup all four layers who can tell me what simple syrup is that's part of the equation what is done to the water and sugar yeah now you put your head ooh I can tell what kind of student you were okay so now that the simple syrup has soaked into my four vanilla cake layers I'm going to stack this cake in two parts to begin with two of my cakes are eight inches round and two of them are nine inches round I'm going to sandwich them together with some Italian meringue buttercream I built this cake in two parts because I want to create the center with seeds just like a real apple and if you've had an apple in half horizontally you can see that the center is like a star-shaped Center that holds the seeds I believe the technical term is star shaped center of Apple do you mean the corn cake or I see you have your phone out Jocelyn there no fullness allowed in class now that both my cakes have chilled and the filling is set I want to stack them on top of each other just the way they are stacking the bigger cake on top of the smaller cake begin to carve the Big Apple down orhan insert Big Apple music what can I say about carving an apple Apple really helped thank you I rounded out the top carving away slowly I made a valley in the center where the stem will later go New York can you fire Broadway [Music] you see how they like in depth and then they kind of have feet but something weird happening I had a really hard time carving an apple it's so interesting to me when I make a cake that I think the carving won't stump me and then I start to carve it and then like why doesn't it look like an apple at one point Jeremy asked me if I was making a molar if anyone is interested in seeing me make a giant molder cake please leave a hashtag below hashtag giant molar cake and should it have a cavity I decided to just taper this Apple in a bit more I think that's where it's going wrong I need to make it look less like a molar more like an apple and when I'm happy with my shape I take the top cake off the bottom cake and flip it over some of the flat side and it is time to create the star Apple Center I'm actually using a calyx cutter that I have just because it has five petals like the star in the center of an apple then I use a leaf cutter that I had that was the perfect sort of teardrop shape to indent five teardrops in the center of each cake now I'm going to scoop the cake out of those teardrops using just a simple metal spoon scooping it out and essentially what will happen is now that both halves have these indents when I line the cake up together that will make up the core I want to line these cavities before I put the other secret chambers yes I got something right excellent Jocelyn and you're paying attention that was a test once the Apple secret chambers are ready and carved I want to coat them with a little bit of chocolate I just melted some white and I actually added a touch of green because it always has that fresh look it's very subtle and what I did is brush that chocolate on to each one of the secret chambers with a paintbrush this kind of works like a crumb coat so I can place my seeds in before I place my seeds into the secret chambers I want to spread a little bit of Italian meringue buttercream with a small offset spatula on that layer of cake for the seeds of my Apple I chose to use Brazil nuts week after a lovely brown skin reminded me of ourselves and then I took the top cake flipped it over and made sure to align the secret chain there was secret chamber alignment this is an advanced class and yet there's so much now class I hope you've been paying attention now that my cake has been sculpted and assembled what is the next step in this process if you need help with your crumb coat and chill we do have crumb coat and chill bundles at how to kick it calm and we even have back-to-school bundles when I went back to school they didn't have pencils with cake puns on them but now they do we change that at how to cake it and they are in the back to school bundles we should have a ruler with a cake bun joseline joseline please call Connie after class Thank You professor cake duty ace one more time yes we do joseline there's no need for the back is there ivory in the sink no there was a bit added to be colored but you don't see that it's like pre-colored my father i iced the Big Apple one more time with Italian meringue buttercream and place it in the fridge to church while my cake is chilling I have decided to work on the stem-and-leaf for this Apple to make my leaf I'm gonna roll out some green gum paste and nice and thin and then I'm using an impression mat that I have it's actually of a rose leaf but I thought I would work here and you just press your gum paste between these two mats to give them that greening that a leaf has and then I trim the leaf to a nice shape with a sharp paring knife and dry it on some crumpled paper towel you don't want to flat partly if you want a realistic leaf that kind of looks like it's already drying up a bit well I know most of the time when you go to the grocery store the apples don't have the leaves but I always find it really special when I get an apple this is really fun have we not discuss this perform that we shall do there's a strawberry the strawberry is the opposite most of the time they don't have the stem yeah and then you feel special with an apple I feel special and they're still over your father but I'm happy with my leaf I work on the stem of the Apple I used the same green gum paste that I just sort of lightened up a little and then I rolled it into a cord it's just a tiny bit thicker at one end trimmed it to the right length and then I inserted a floral wire inside this will help me place it into my cake and help keep the stand up right on it I wanted to create a bit of a curve on the stem so I just bent it ever so slightly and then I placed the exposed wire down into a cake dummy to allow my stem to dry the top right I'm headed back to the Big Apple I wish that was actually true right now I'm talking about my Big Apple cake and it's time to cover it in fondant I rolled my red fondant into a large enough sheet to cover the whole Apple I then picked up my sheet of fondant on a French rolling pin draped it over the Apple and began to smooth the fondant onto the cake this is really tricky because the cake is tall it's narrower at the bottom and it also has a valley at the top so there is going to be air trapped under that valley to release that air I use a straight pin I just make a slight hole in the center and use my fingertips to smooth the fondant down releasing the air through the hole and you don't have to worry about the hole because the stem will cover it up later smooth the fondant all around the Apple this can be really tricky when a cake is very tapered at the bottom because you get a lot of folds the fondant just folds up onto itself because there's more fondant than cake so take your time and really smooth it around pull the folds apart and smooth the fondant to the cake I did have some tearing and cracking in my fondant because it took a while to smooth all of it around the cake this is really common with tall cakes and also I find when I have fondant that has been dyed or needed a lot it can tend to crack a little bit more than untouched fondant so what I'm happy about is this cake will later be painted but I can also patch these cracks now that my fondant is chilled I'm going to use some my leftover fondant and make a paste listen up there is a new Jeremy I see you on your phone what do I normally mix with fondant to create a fondant water Thank You Jocelyn Jeremy just I think you should give up on the hand because it's not gonna work in this fast alcohol as we know evaporates faster than water that's why I paint with it and I thought maybe that will help my paste dry faster and a little more now so that it went into all the cracks and tears and folds and crevices you can just cover anything up and it was incredibly hot so what happens when it's hot is and humid do you fondant it can be very sweaty on the surface and this is sometimes not sometimes this makes it harder to work with so what I did to smooth my pace this time is I actually used a damp or wet paintbrush and in this case I wasn't that upset about having to do this because it added to the texture of the Apple look on the bright side sometimes things happen to teach you something those are called life lessons and Jocelyn's not but I do love that you tried bonded face into life is thatis for me it's a life lesson okay it's time to paint this food coloring is very intense it's very concentrated and it's always a little bit on the bright side except for ivory to paint my Apple I actually created two paints so one with some red food coloring and clear food grade alcohol and the other was some golden yellow mixed with a touch of white and cleared food grade alcohol and this is to help make the yellow more opaque first thing I'm gonna do is paint the entire Apple in one direction so that's up and down from the inside of the valley all the way down to the bottom with my red paint the next thing I'm going to do is then take some of my nice yellow paint that was a different brush I'm gonna paint areas again in the same direction but not the whole a whole just sort of patches of this yellow and that's because you've Apple please you can see areas right on Apple yeah yeah like she's not just plain red right there's spots and there's like these little patches and variations Thank You Apple you're gonna get an apple after class wonder if apples need apples and I also use some my yellow paint and speckled the Apple so just getting some paint on end of my paint brush and using my fingertip and basically flicking the paint towards the Apple if you'd like to pre-order my upcoming cake book you can get it before it's even on the Shelf through the links below the book has easy-to-follow steps to make 20 new cakes never before seen on this channel plus Walter because he forced me and I can assure you the steps will really help you much more than I do here you're pretty good yeah I'm good I'm good I'm good but there's editing involved well there was editing in a book ok fair time to add my stem and my leaf but before that I do want to add a little bit of paint and color to those items items the parts to those parts of the Apple to paint my leaves I am using some dry green and yellow color dust the same color dust I use on my strawberry leaf for the stem I'm actually gonna use some Brown gel food coloring just a dot of it and a clean dry brush and I'm gonna brush that gel on in an upward motion because when you really look at an Apple stem you can see that it is sort of a green base right this is the part that was attached to the tree and then as it dries out it starts to turn so I decide on what part of the Apple I like as the front and then I insert my stem down into the center and finally I attach is your coffee good Jared did you bring me one no actually I never understood why people brought teachers apples if I was a teacher I would want you to bring me coffee and then we're gonna add the leaf my leaf was just propped between my stem and the top of the Apple but you can use a little bit of royal icing to hold it in place community to this Big Apple is the perfect super shiny Apple to give to any professor even though she'd rather have coffee if you're getting ready to go back to school share this video with your friends I hope it makes you feel better thank you for joining me on how to kick it classes next Tuesday if you like giant food cakes there's a playlist right here and there's also a back-to-school playlist right here that you can also share it oh and everyone subscribe

Patrick's Day playlist right over here oh that is perfect really yeah my crumb coat is set it's time to ice my cake once again with Italian meringue buttercream getting it as smooth as possible now I'm going to chill my cake again and prepare it for fondant I need to roll out a piece of black fondant large enough to drape over this cake so I use my fabric measuring tape to measure from the bottom of one side of the pot over top to the bottom of the other side and then I roll out my black form into an eighth of an interestin pick it up on a French rolling pin and drape it over the pot as soon as I get it onto the cake I start to smooth immediately using my hands you really want to make sure to press the fondant in on the top sides of the cake because if you leave it for too long the weight of the draped fondant will actually pull and tear the fondant and you're kind of trying to push the air out from underneath as you smooth the fondant onto the cake then I trim the excess fondant away from the bottom but not flush up against the cake just really close because now I'm gonna move like a leprechaun flip so let us pretend my little friend is my pot of gold case do you mind okay and this is what I did vielen be fun I feel smiling it's hard to tell if he's upside down no he's good so while making it flips over I take the opportunity to trim away the excess platform it first i smooth it tight up against the cake and then I use a sharp paring knife to cut away the excess thank you for your flippin assistance he's a little busy it's time to make handle so that this little guy can lift up a pot of gold cake to make the handle for this pot I roll two equal portions of black fondant into six tubes and then I formed them around a circle cutter just to help me get the shape I trimmed the excess off the end and join them together and then I pinched it together because I wanted more of an oval shape rather than circular shape and I set them aside to dry I don't know how he's going to lift it he's going with a light weight you can actually make these ahead of time and let them set and another great tip if your black fondant happens to be on the soft side you can add a bit of CMC to it and stiffen it up a bit before making your hands on head low okay now it's time to make the rim of the pot the rim on the lip you're going to do that in the same method that you made your handles except you're going to roll a longer thicker tube and then what I like to do is sort of taper the tube down this is a bit tricky because what I did was I rolled out a tube I use a fondant rolling pin to sort of roll over the children so it's how do I show them I have no sign language for tapering a sudden didn't we see you yeah oh footage what I want to do is spin out one long ends of the tube and then trim it perfectly and then that way that thinner end will be the outward facing side of the tube as you add it to your cake I use clear piping gel to glue the tube on because on Heaviside so I was afraid that water just wouldn't cut it well I am feeling like this pot of gold doesn't look dark cauldre me enough culturally you're trying to just conjure up the cauldron effect so what I'm going to do is use a little bit of black food coloring diluted it was clear food grade alcohol and I'm going to paint the entire pot I used a large paintbrush and I painted all the way around the cake turning my lazy susan to really help me now that the paint is dry I am attaching the handles to the top I need to roll out a bit more of my last fondant to create some bands that will hold the handle to the cake I basically just okay I roll through okay I cut to Lucia once my fondant is rolled nice and thin I cut out two bands that were the exact same size and then I fed the band through my handles where the scene was then I glue the two ends of the band together it was a bit of clear piping gel and in order to adhere these handles to my cake I once again used clear piping gel and I used a toothpick to help keep the handles in place because they're heavy and the pot is rounded and it handle breaks off how is he supposed to get the gold home to all his other friends you're always thinking about Patrick a little leaf I know he didn't even give me any goals not even a tip once my handle is secured I'm going to use a small round piping tip to just make two indents on each of the handles that look like I don't know what it would be called where the pot was welded together the cauldrons riveting the track if the pot looks called your knee but the handle not so much so when you use the leftover paint that I need before and paint the whole pot including the handle one more time in addition to celebrating st. Patrick's Day with this cauldron each case we're also having Saint Patrick's Day get lucky sale at Habakkuk accomp know this happens not for sale this is an original / Patrick thank you is there anything this pot is missing gold so what I did is I need punished toffee I don't know why I'm so happy because it burnt the first batch and the fire alarm went off yep once your son's coffee is ready you want to break it up I started to use like meat tenderizing mallet that didn't quite seem in DFS I wanted so I just took the son Shafi out of the pan instead of breaking off chunks I want these nuggets of gold looks big and nuggety then I placed all of my son's coffee and Nuggets into a big bowl and I sprinkled on some edible gold luster dust and tossed it in the holes so century essentially you're tricking him into thinking your son's hockey goal time to place my counterfeit gold nuggets onto the cake here's a suggestion I actually taught my nuggets to a sieve and I even knew that Jeremy what's that camera duster thing called Lord a blower I used a blower just to blow away any excess luster dust because this stuff gets everywhere it was in the air and make sure that no dust will fall on during a beautiful Black Cauldron and now to the counterfeit gold coins he's not even mad because you want to know something they're not gold but they are chocolate nothing to be mad please help me get to 3 million subscribers by subscribing to this channel and pressing that notification valve so that you know wouldn't have got to Mexico outfit on because I mean that's why we're really here isn't it where do my glasses go well I know oh you Jeremy you try this on ah oh yeah that looks great that looks good do I look better it is like looking through grain blind bass is good it is I'm telling you the window blinds 
you're watching how to cake it I'm Yolanda and this week I made a rocky road ice cream sandwich if you love cake Angelov ice cream and you have ice cream cake please share this video we would really appreciate it just click the button below share it wherever you like it's not ice cream love it don't deprive them give them your ice cream so I just live special I make eight pounds of my Yas ultimate chocolate cake I folded in marshmallows one and chocolate chips mom I bake the cake in baking trays like trays that I normally make cookies on I have never done that on panicky it's monumental it is orhan insert monumental needed ice cream festival and icy cold yes a golden one now from these two rocky road case I want to get three layers of cake to build up my ice cream sandwich so from each cake I cut one whole strips of the appropriate size and then one half strip so now I have two full strips and two half shifts that will make up pelea first ways was up to the challenge and help me simple syrup all of my rocky road cake layer it's not just chocolate cake right it has more attitude kind of like me with an ice cream tattoo you all right now you better like it don't ya ten of the pony tells you they don't let my hat to do I throw anything like mr. t I pity the fool tells me they don't like my tattoos these temporary tattoos are actually a set of four and they come in our summer time bundle which is available at how to keep it calm now that the simple syrup has soaked in I want to stack and fill these cakes with my Italian meringue buttercream like ice cream in an Ice Cream Sandwich vanilla iced at a full layer on the bottom buttercream then I use my two half layers to make one full layer butter cream and then the final four layer time to crumb coat giant cake and get it in the fridge to chill I always point over there as if that's what rich kid yeah we just don't put her in the interview she's a little you know she's very stainless steel II now I need to make the giant rectangular cookies that will sandwich this delicious cake and some buttercream later on for this I'm making some chocolate sugar cookies it's simply made by creaming together butter sugar brown sugar vanilla are you with me salt you know that pinch then when that's nice and light and fluffy I add in some eggs and finally I add my dark cocoa flour cornstarch to this in water mix the dough till it's fully incorporated but often some dry ingredients get caught at the bottom of usual so turn it out knead it on the table so it's fully incorporated and then chill your dough for about 30 minutes wrap it up tight and fast once my dough is chilled I'm going to roll it out onto some silicone baking mat roll down to a big rectangle cut all four sides straight and then I sort of round into the coins just a texture like an I treat them [Music] finally I'm going to use a piping tip to cut all the perforated schools that are in the city of a new suspect so I did this the same way I did it to my giant graham cracker cookie and my morphing not you better check yourself before you wreck yourself okay I did I just mix mr. t and ice cube I'm cold after I've cut out two cookies that are the exact same size with the rounded corners and all the perforated holes I'm going to chose my cookie dough because it's warm and it goes into a really hot oven and it just has such a crisp you want it to be nice and chilled and then place it in a hot oven apple doesn't kill that cookies before baking them because they're not spread that wasn't that wasn't I lost my sister to you I baked my cookies I'm taking them out of the oven to cool completely we are going to put this ice-cream sandwich together my cookies were completely cooled and I need to begin by picking one of them off the pen and flipping it upside that wasn't scary [Music] time to take out my case which is the inside of this ice-cream sandwich this wasn't scary either I had to lift up the cake and place it on top of the upside-down cookie Center and it went well I was afraid of the Christmas break and went well didn't break finally I need to spread a little bit of buttercream on top of my cake so that the top cookie will stick and then I carefully remove that cookies and place it on top of the cakes right-side up it's time to recreate the ice cream part of this ice cream sandwich and speaking of ice cream if you love ice cream cake we have a whole playlist right here it's popsicle in the toilet he is a frozen dessert yes I think you've got to be right we would like frozen yogurt in yes we would let so they answer this list well not me personally but you don't do survey kind of turn to this light dessert some on a light dessert I'd have some strawberries that's where I stand now that the cake is assembled there should be sort of a border around the case of buttercream lifts cookie I suppose a piping bag with a big round tip and pipes the buttercream in onto the sides of the cake [Music] then I use my spatula to spread it all around and a bench scraper to get it flush with the sides of the ice-cream sandwich she's my old dancer so what this is very easy which goes with - you're teasing and this really amazes but I'm taking this a step further you know how mr. t wears like a ton of change yeah I need to put some change on this edge big damage of I change I mean like chocolate walnut marshmallows and chocolate chips and sprinkles I need to chill this cake so that the buttercream is nice and firm before I add my topping the first thing I did was melt some compound chocolate so that I could pipe it onto the surface of my Ice Cream Sandwich cake and let it drift down the side I want to create a really clean diagonal line but actually laid a piece of cardstock paper which is just like sturdy paper on top so that I wouldn't get like a wavy line and wanted a nice line so it looked like it had been dipped I really want a fixed ice cream so yes lunch that's what we're going to happen looks good you know I could pour chocolate on the cake I'm making next it's another fruit that people often different chocolate the bit of a CD case like Walter it is it is so to create my uh what do I call it and yeah but it's not all over like their life remember this picture yeah there's a band of it so okay so what your thing is with your topic you organize them and strip yes I did organize a line of chopping to be fair it was randomly placed topping in a line give it some marshmallows I'm talking about chocolate chips of walnuts don't forget my sprinkle did is a fool who doesn't get a sprinkle returnees Bock these are the same sprinkles I'm using on Kent cake right now I'm here with you but I am also live on face a cat if you miss carrot cake this summer don't worry we'll be doing another one soon I have to tell you something dropping insult everyone let me tell you something that has made me very obsessed oh no everyone likes to ask what I do with the cake and often I give them away and up until now Jeremy has been very accepting but he now placed a cake ban on me chocolate cake Spence okay the week before I had three cakes in my fridge what is the mmm

period while this simple syrup soaks in I'm gonna make a template for our secret chambers I what Yolanda we should should we zone into just my mouth I've decided I want my secret chambers to be this big so I'm using my trusted circle cutter and here I have a piece of paper that I've cut a 12 inch circle out of which is the size of my cakes divided it into six folded it into six and then trace this circle cutter in the center of one of the triangles now I need to fold it back up and cut out this circle I'm gonna rest this template on top of each one of my cakes and use the circle cutter to cut out six secret chambers voix from each layer we're gonna fill form these secret chambers with complete nastiness things that don't belong in cake and in two of the secret chambers we're putting Halloween candy and I really hope I get one of those chambers I'm building this cake on a lazy susan because we need to spin it later so I placed the first layer of cake onto this lazy susan and I'm going to fill it with Italian meringue buttercream trying to avoid the secret chambers as much as I can please write a song for me and sing it about filling a cake with Italian meringue buttercream go jump in like a musical like little court jesters jumping up like oh boy I'm just gonna use my small straight spatula to clean out the secret chambers I don't think the Queen of Hearts should be cleaning out her own secret chambers I feel like this is wrong I'm going to add my second layer of cake lining up the secret chambers and repeat this process [Music] I'm going to place my final orange layer of cake on top and use the buttercream losing out of the sides as the crumb coat I'm using my crummy buttercream to coat the top of this cake please sing the crumb coat and chill song I'm the queen the queen does not sing her own song the queen just iced her own cake now that my crumb coat is chilled it's time to fill the secret chamber so I have some gummy eyeballs guys I'm really tired

deliver them hi guys guys Jocelyn's here with repulsive ingredients oh whoa that smell now we have sardines in an olive and caper tapenade really garlicky pesto and then we have this was really so beautifully done I wanted it to look like pieces of a human body that were torn out and what you do is you shove raw spaghetti through it and then you cook them together yeah and then I tossed it in a little tomato paste so this is olive black olives mixed with red piping jelly they look like eyeballs I might not watch this episode it makes crashing against your lips guys I have some bad news I'm

your cake into six pieces you want the tape on your lazy susan between the chambers like where you're gonna cut where you're gonna cut I'm gonna crumb coat the top of this cake so that these little doors get crumb coated it's like another bolt and then we're going to clean up so we can ice it so I can ice I'm using a combination of large spatulas straight and offset and I'm also gonna use my bench scraper scrape definitely a scary one you're good [Music] when I want a nice smooth finish on my cake I like to use a bench scraper I'd like to point out that you always want a nice smooth - on your cake that's it there's nothing wrong it's never that you don't want one do people running marathons cuz they're like you know what I don't want to cross the finish line no once I've been shaped my sides I returned to my straight spatula to the return of the straight spatula and I use it to drag the excess buttercream into the center the Chamber's have been sealed we know that there between these tape lines but we don't know which one is which and speaking of guessing games I think it's time for a cake book quiz or on custody and edge leave a comment below with what you think this cake

buildings and then Jocelyn you're gonna use these square cutters to cut squares from this yellow and once we place the buildings on the side of the cake these will be like the spooky windows we're kind of creating like a Halloween costume for the cake yes it's going on the cave this is going along the sides of the cake dressing we're dressing up the cake [Music] and they don't have to be placed perfectly what's scarier than asymmetrical windows nothing nothing now I'm gonna add these haunted houses haunted town houses to the sides of this cake haunted brows haunted brownstones because if you have to go haunted make it a browns make it a brownstone with a stoop I'm picking up the fondant strip really carefully I'm lining up the straight edge at the bottom at the bottom of the cake it's a haunted cul-de-sac with this bit what would this be Crescent a Crescent but now we need to make the top look like a roulette wheel so we need to divide it into six we're gonna use this black licorice as the divider for our slices perfect line up the licorice [Music] now we're gonna use lollipops inserted into the cake sideways it's the final we're gonna add some black fondant numbers to this cake and then a few extra gory Halloweeny details so I've rolled out some black fondant and now I'm gonna cut out the numbers squeeze a little bit of blood over here in the center yeah joseline joseline

welcome back to how to take it I'm Yolanda and this means there is a battle on how to take it it's the French macaron versus the magazine I wanted another wrestling like a rocket from macaroon pregnant natural sounds back it's true it's ignored is to make my macaroon cake I am using vanilla cake and chocolate cake I've dyed my vanilla cake I know will not laugh I'm going to keep saying lol a package oh you've ever said that know anyone for my to pink vanilla cake I placed a smaller cake pan on top and a small serrated knife straight down to help remove economization from the side I round off the top edges all the way around to create that Mackinac cookie shape and I want to remove all of the criminalization from the sides itself so the chocolate cake I level that baby of mothers of water sizzles now yes isn't it okay of course the chocolate cake is going to become like the buttercream filling that's inside the macro so I leveled it and then I slightly rounded off the top edge and the bottom edge so it's kind of like a big chocolate disk for patty at this time I'm going to flip over to my macaroon cake now so this case I have faced coconut one of my favorite and it makes sense I removed my free coconut cake from their pens leveled them remove the carmelization from the bottom and then I stack them one on top of the other just to get an eyes to the shape on one now I'm going to unstack them and carved each one I'm trying to create just a little cake mound let's take it out it's more of a skill so what I do is I carve each layer removing all the carmelization on the sides and I do one at a time but keeping in mind that they're all going to be stacked together so then they are back to want to make sure I see that coconut I want to run through a cookie I want to go to home island Jeremy no comment sir you like I know I knew it Jeremy's like I wish I had a coconut to throw it once I'm happy with the shape it is now time to simple syrup all of my cake yes I'm going to simple syrup for macaron and the mushroom together because despite their differences they actually get along for now can we place it so like I'm reading it that we are just going to hope we're not giving in so much work now yes we make a little bit fold it it let's dive back into my Mackinac cake for the Mackinac shells which is a king can delegate I want to pay some pink buttercream a plastic so I take a little bit of my spelling meringue buttercream and diet to masticate asbestos to boozy you don't need you to match all of all who like containers captain left it's time to crank up see pink macaron shells with my pink buttercream I apply it with a small offset spatula i crumb coat the two pink shells and pop them in the fridge to kill you my family always point to the fertilizer they can't even see it right now - maybe the door yeah yes they have me wedged between the prison and ovens when I got this I just want to be clear now for the chocolate cake that's going to come to filling I crumb coat that with my plan Italian meringue buttercream and pop it in the fridge once my crumb coat is chilled it's time to ice cream cake so again I'm icing the pink macaron shells in my pink buttercream try to get them as smooth as possible at this point and placing them back in the fridge to check now for the chocolate cake that is filling Joplin I used my invention oh my gosh numbered us yeah I don't even have it it I might as well because you can't see it the little piece of acetate that I use because I want to maintain that curve so that it looks like the buttercream filling that is suppressed I've also used my invention to make my giant cupcake cake and my Venus clinic yeah if you want to see more food cakes I have a pretty list here except we're going to put both methanol and exactly it is time to cover my method off help in size pink fondant I have created a shape that's similar to cake and buttercream inside some little more wisely and then I roll it out pick it up on a trench rolling pin and Jerry's like I am NOT coming back how did I end up here I had a real job Marilla and then I served it over with my friends and the finest meter trimming away all the excess fondant from the bottom with a short hair then I repeat this process for the second now I need to recreate the little sort of layer of fluffy air bubbles that happens at the base you don't know just where out directory how could I not do that you think I would leave that out on this interview strictly me looking at Jacko's like and what I decided was to take the remaining pink fondant that I had and I really needed it well quite a gift and vegetable shortening although vegetable shortening help soften your fondant you can take it too far it ends up breaking it down so I basically took the fondant too far unperfect because I wanted it to break yeah then what I did is I rolled it into one long Jam that is the comfort of my picnic as I roll it you can see the edges like spring and breaking and pulling apart but in this case I'm actually happy is happening to apply these bands for the base of each cake I'm going to first rush on a little bit of clear speaking gel and then I carefully apply the band all the way around now they did break apart when I pick them up which I expenses at this point that's the local going for the great thing is don't have to hide the themes you don't have to hide the flaws it's just helping it go realistic we are going to assemble our French macaron cake first I put one of the pink layers up skies down to the flash siding top then I carefully transferred a chocolate buttercream liner right on top and then finally the final pink layer on top with the dome inside okay Mac it off you're ready you look beautiful but it's time for you to step aside for a moment and give a little bit of a spotlight to macaroon it is her date well after all I need to fill and crumb coat her I decided that the macaroon need it to be more coconuty so I ended up taking my three layers and layer in them Oh so that bad so I'm going to create some coconut buttercream I like to mix in some creams coconut which is just the same thing that they used to miss Pina colonics I just whip spat into my brother family chastity and then I spilled all six layers with my coconut butter spoons crumb coated them and so what's the consult and Sheldon young Americans in letting that go I feel like I can't else do the Stormtrooper duck function it's pointless yes I can't go back there it'll just drop them in every video people women no longer make stuff if you haven't seen my Star Wars stormtrooper helmet cake I will put it in a character service right over here and don't forget the maybe Casey with you t-shirt is still available and how to keep it off along with my crumb coat and chill tea now that my crumb coat is chilled I'm going to ice this cake with some more coconut buttercream I'm putting on quite a good layer because now I'm going to press in some toasted coconut chips they've been lightly toasted to give them a surin a hue like it's already doing so with the balls in my hand I'm just pressing in the coconut just getting it all around this macaroon I relate to her because she's probably wishing she could control her coconut more the way I was told my hair but she she's come to accept that how she looks she's not trying to be a French knock it off she's trying to be that's rude now I happen to like my macaroons with a little bit of chocolate I love chocolate and coconut am i right oh yeah I'm not even dating Jeremy what I did was I melted some light cocoa candy melts and then piped and my on top of my school I also piped online of chocolate down around the base to make it most husband Matthew tipped so take that French macaron are you dipped in chocolate no I don't think so I don't think for YouTube delicate for that in conclusion nobody won the battle they were both beautiful and

welcome back to how to cake it I'm Yolanda and this week I'm making a cake that you guys have highly requested I'm making an Oreo cake the giant sign doubles for this cake I baked eight pounds of my ultimate chocolate cake in two 12 inch round cake pins the first thing I need to do after my cakes are baked and cooled is remove them from their pans and level them to the same height both these cakes are gonna become the top and the bottom cookie now that they're layered I want to use a small serrated knife to just round out the top edge of each cake ever so slightly once my two cakes are leveled I want to level the hummus slightly as well to the same height that's what we're gonna create the center from I love let me get to use like the most now it is time for Sur squeeze a lot to help me simple syrup these cakes I make sure to flip one of the humps over upside down while I'm simple searing simple searing Sur squeeze has been bundled up with our cake book and that bundle is on sale at hat akika calm right now that's a lot of fun in a bundle it's time to create the middle or the cream of the cookie the first thing I do is lay down my upside-down cake then I spread a layer of Italian meringue buttercream inside and now a layer of Oreo cookies it's Oreo ception people let's [Music] so once you're happy with your layer of Oreos again spread another layer of buttercream and then rest your cake hump right side up on top do you want it all or do you just want a slice if you think Oreo ception is the best thing since sliced bread please share this video there's a link in the description can we call this video or yo section so this is the filling cake and I need the filling cake to be slightly smaller in circumference than the two clipping cakes since my cookie cakes are 12 inches round I laid an eleven and a half inch circle on the top and just trimmed away a little of the excess of the filling cake and then I use my small serrated knife just trim around it like to round out the top and bottom edge happy with my filling cake and I can plumb and chill it I know this is really easy okay I don't need to dance in here I'm on a sprinkle throne that call my dancers have them dance for me don't forget to crumb coat and childer to cookie [Music] now that my clown foot is chilled I need to ice these cakes and children again yesterday Cody was like did she would've been sad it's like no it's acetate but we call it that I call it the event we call it the invention and you just bend it as you're icing around the cookie so that you can have like the buttercream and a nice curved so that middle filling cake I need to take it out of the fridge once it's chilled I need to flip it and then I need to just sort of perfect the icing and give the bottom of that cake a crumb coat of butter now that all the buttercream is chilled it's time to move on to fondant I'm going to begin with my filling cake and the first thing I need to do is flip that cake back right-side up and then I roll out some white fondant larger than the cake drape it on top and smooth it on the top of the smoother and around the cake now don't trim the excess fondant what I know because what we're going to do is quickly flip this cake over with the excess and then quickly pile that excess on top and smooth it down around under and this is because I don't want to see a seam on my filling what did I say yeah so what was I doing exit you distracted me with the boomerang I'm just gonna lay a 10-inch round pan upside down on top and trim away the excess I need to cover this 10 inch opening on top of my cake so I roll out some more white fondant drape it on top and I use a sharp paring knife to cut the fondant where it needs the fondant that's already there and if your fondant pulls away or you cut it a little too short just use a smoother to stretch it out to meet the other fondant they want to be friends yes until the Cody fondant comes along if you want to get our behind-the-scenes videos that only the VIPs get to see sign up to be a VIP at how to kick it off it's time to move on to the cookie cake leaders I mix together two pounds of black fondant and two pounds of chocolate so this way I'm getting a bit of chocolate flavor in there and I'm sort of dulling the black I roll out this Oreo black fondant and cover the first cookie cake covering it nice and smooth trimming away the excess at the bottom and then I repeat for the second section this Oreo cookie cake would be so great for a kid's birthday and we have an amazing kids cake compilation over on how to kick it step by step which you can check out right here I bet you haven't studied the pattern of an Oreo as like think about an Oreo what do you think the pattern looks like complicated it does doesn't it so I blew up a template of that pattern and I need to cut all the pieces out and that only takes hours I decided that the best way to recreate these little triangles in the pattern was to first use a square cutter and cut out squares of black fondant then I lined up my little triangle stencil at one corner of the square and used a sharp paring knife to cut out the rest of the triangle 48 of those pieces I always cut a few more just in case there's an accident you don't want to fund an accident don't make me start talking about fondant accidents I'll get really upset the next thing I want to cut out are the like perforated lines that go around the Oreo so for this I'm using a letter I cutter that I have it's just a straight I with rounded edges and lucky me it was just the right size or actively because these lines are laid on the Oreo and they're sort of curved in the circle I laid each one onto my template and informed the curve see how I'm sure there's real footage or you can just watch me do this the next thing I want to cut out are the dots on the Oreo cookie and for this I'm using a number 10 round cutter as a circle cutter and I just cut out all the dots I needed I also have to cut out some special pieces that's what I decided to call them so anything that's specific to the Oreo cookie I cut it out of the template lay it on my fondant and cut it out with a sharp paring knife so there's kind of like this double cross above the oval and then there's the word Oreo which is in a specific Oreo font other triangles here and there that are not the same shape as the 48 triangles I already cut out I also need to recreate all of the lines that go around the perimeter of the bottom and top for this again I'm using my letter I cutter but I do have to make them a shorter length so if I have an eye I made a mark and then I use the eye cutter again to cut it to the right length so this way it still has two curved edges and with the remaining piece that is now sort of an I've of a straight edge I just cleaned that up because I'm going to use that on the bottom coat I want it to look as if the line was coming from the bottom cookie and a little bit up around the sides it is time to lay the pattern on to this cookie the first thing I want to do is use some straight pins to actually pin my template in place right on top of the cake I'm going to glue all of my pieces onto the cookie cake with some clear piping gel I'm going to start by laying the oval on the center of the cake and for this I chose them to use my clay extruder and extrude a long port then I glue that cord following the lives of my template to create next thing I added was the word Oreo inside the oval as well as the two sort of long triangles that are above and below it whenever I'm using a template and I feel the template could get in the way of laying the fondant I just simply sort of Bend back the template because I still want to use it as a guide but I don't want it to rip my fondant if it gets in the way I've decided to place the dots next and so what I did is I used a pointed sculpting tool to just mark where all the dots are and then I can remove my template and he knew all the dachshund was really interesting too because without the rest of the pattern there once I laid all the dots I could kind of tell that it was in a grid pattern I thought that was interesting mr. Christie what a design what a cookie does layers and layers of design then I added my sort of curved perforated lines that go all between the dots circling okay this is where my template is really gonna come in handy when I'm laying this sort of four-leaf clover pattern so to help me figure out how that pattern gets laid I'm going to cut into three of the clovers on my template and just sort of Bend back the template then I place my template back down and use the tip of a sharp knife to make marks so I know where to lay my triangles once I lift the template off then I glue down my first set of clovers and rather than having to cut my whole template the whole way around the clover pattern just repeats so this way I just sort of turned the template lining it up with what I've already laid make my marks again lay some more clovers and repeat until I'm all the way around do you remember I don't know if you did this but I did this before there were double stuffed Oreos I would take two Oreos take the lids off and then make my did you ever do that I might have invented Double Stuf jars at this point the cookie is looking great but I decided I didn't like the clay extruded oval after problem is it's much more waste from the cookie than the rest of the pattern so for this reason it's got it go I just used the pieces of my template to cut out an oval it sounds easy to cut out an oval but I find when a shape is really simple if you make any mistakes or any off cuts it's really noticeable so take your time when you're cutting up people [Music] it's time to lay the stripes around the perimeter of the cookie for this again I'm using clear piping gel to glue them on and I'm using a toothpick to help me space them so I lay on a stripe toothpick lay on a stripe toothpick Lana stripe toothpick guess how many lines there are do you actually know I actually sew my top cookie is complete it looks like a giant Oreo I'm so happy but I do need to add these perimeter stripes to the bottom now we don't have an Oreo cookie service but we do have a sprinkle service join our monthly sprinkle service at how to kick it calm and get exclusive gourmet sprinkles delivered right to your door this month we're featuring our take it to the limit sprinkles which are the Beyonce of sprinkles and I use them in my sprinkle make a cake over on how to kick it step by step speaking of which there's an amazing contest going on in that video so click right here to watch because you could win a it's time to assemble the double stuffed Oreo cake but to begin I'm taking my bottom cookie cake which is the cookie cake that only has the perimeter pattern now I'm going to spread a thin layer of royal icing and blue the filling cake on top I need you to actually put that sound effect in good because as soon as I did it I could see that I could see some of the top cookie I need to talk this bottom cookie cake was black fondant because you could see the cake and that's not what an Orioles like now I only had a bit of black fondant left in my special audio black so I tried my best to roll it out to a 12 inch circle but I could tell it wasn't gonna make it so I used my knife and cut like a star like I cut slits in it to help it stretch up so it could open in the middle help it stretch out rolled it out and then I laid it on top of my cookie smoothed it down flip the cake over and then I trimmed away the excess around the cookie and I flipped it back over and then I laid a cake pan on top and trimmed a wave that sort of cut up fondant from the middle ah now all is right with the world and I can move on so I spread some royal icing in that sort of open circle I placed my filling cake back on top centered then I spent some more royal icing on top of the filling cake and finally I add the top cookie cake with the complex Oreo pattern it looks like an Oreo please subscribe to this channel hit that notification bell and keep your requests coming this cake was a request and I loved it so I want to hear more of your ideas to watch my chocolate madness cakes compilation click here and to watch my amazing kids birthday cakes compilation you say giant and I think we need a man's voice man yeah giant giant double stuffed Oreo cake

welcome back to how to cake it I'm Yolanda and you know it's the season of pumpkin spice lattes but I just feel like they are all missing something so I made my own version right now I am pumpkin to make my pumpkin spice latte cake I baked four pounds of pumpkin spice cake in four five inch round pans back last year I made a pumpkin cake out of it this year I'm making a pumpkin spice like I remove them from their pens and level them then I cut two of the cakes into two layers so now I have two layers of cake that I've left whole and four thinner layers play with me once I'm happy with all my layers I of course need to have looks they're squeezed to help me simple syrup them all to perfection stir squeeze wants me to remind you about his girlfriend miss collapsible funnel the two of them come as a pair on how to kick it calm because now they're inseparable like pumpkin spice lattes I decided to fill my pumpkin spice cakes with coffee buttercream to make my coffee buttercream I added some concentrated coffee to my buttercream and whisked it in until it was nice and smooth and tasted just the way I like it I like that idea a latte what else you like a latte I like this t-shirt a latte I like all of you a latte I know I just realized I wasn't making good use of it I like puns a latte I'm going to begin by sacking my cake as two cakes to start off so first I stack the thinner four layers of cake sandwich Inge them together with coffee buttercream then I stack the remaining two cakes which I did not cut into layers with one layer of coffee buttercream and place them in the fridge to chill [Music] by building this cup upside down so I'm going to leave the four layer cake on the bottom and place the 2 layer cake on top of it for now and now I need to carve it into the shape of an upside-down coffee cup the first thing I do is place a circle cutter that's about three and a half inches in diameter on top and make them work this will just help me as a guideline while I'm making my a line I like a lines a latte and then I cut from that point down to the outer edge of the bottom cake with my super 8 at night I use my circle cutter set all the time not just to cut cake or fondant but also to make marks and guidelines as I'm doing right here all of these essentials are now bundled together in the Baker's bundle at hat akika calm now it's time to add a board to the middle of this cake as well as some dowels and a board on the bottom I unstack my cake lifting that top cake off the bottom one now I need to cut myself a board to fit there I'm using foam core and I happen to have a nifty circle cutter it's a different kind of circle cutter cut the circles out of paper oh yes I have many circle cutters I like circle cutters a latte once my board is cut to the right size I'm going to add it on top of the cake I just spread a thin layer of coffee buttercream added the board and another thin layer of coffee buttercream and now I'm gonna add my top cake back on top and the next thing I'm gonna do is add some dowels because once I flip this over I need them for support and then finally I need to cut another little board I place it on top of the cake again spreading a little bit of coffee buttercream as glue and just place the board rail now what time is it yeah very good I like your answer a latte I am using my coffee buttercream because I happen to love coffee like love it's by far my favorite and it's a pumpkin spice latte P I love coffee so much that I have a coffee Central playlist right here once my crumb coat is chilled I'm going to ice this cake again again with coffee buttercream and I'm going to use a bench scraper to help me out I'm using a bit of a longer spatula because I really want to make sure these angles are nice this I like ice pumpkin spice latte cakes a latte that's a lot that's a lot that's a lot too that's a lot eight to say it's now time to cover this cake and I've chosen to cover it with orange fondant because later on I'm going to paint it a really nice color and orange is the perfect base for that color I don't want to give it away Jocelyn I rolled out my fondant to the perfect size picked it up on a French rolling pin by wrapping it around the rolling pin and unraveling it around then I cut where the fondant met itself and over left I held a blur and cut a clean seam through both layers of fondant and remove the excess and then I just push this thing together if your fondant is soft you can chill your fondant before trimming the top and bottom just so you get a nice there's a couple of kegs in my upcoming cake book where I use this technique for covering my cakes in fondant if you want a chance to win my cake book the yo poke contest and happening right now over on my Instagram for the handle is ranked there or if you'd like to preorder my cake book internationally you can do that through the links below and don't forget if you pre-order my cake both you get a 20% off coupon for anything I've had to go home once my cup is completely covered and nicely trimmed I do need to add a lip to what will be the top of the cup so I take some of my extra orange fondant soften it slightly with vegetable shortening and then run it through a clay extruder using the largest circle face plate once I have my cord a fondant I do onto the face of my cup with a little bit of clear piping gel brushed onto the cup it's time to roll out some black fondant for my logo and then I'm going to use some quick sticks to cut out the words pumpkin spice latte and then I'm going to use a tap it to cut out the word cake in a different font that looks more written as well as a strip cutter just to cut out a line for my design I like fonts a latte it's time to paint to elevate this pumpkin spice latte cake to the next level the how to K k't pumpkin spice latte cake is served in a copper cup so I mixed some bronze and orange and gold luster to extend the copper luster I already have and once I was happy with the color i diluted it with some clear food grade alcohol and painted the cup making sure to paint in one direction the tricky thing about painting luster is if you don't let the first coat dry enough when you go back and paint it actually lifts the first layer rather than applying another layer so it's really really tricky you should allow your first coat of paint to dry to the point that when you touch it it doesn't come off I'm going to allow the final coat of paint to dry completely because I'm going to need to flip you know Jeremy I didn't want to bring this up but when Chet used to film me every time I would do the flip he would try to like I hope I'm saying the right director Guy Ritchie it is it Guy Ritchie's he does it yeah he would guy ritchie it and we would like count and we'd get ready and then he would turn his camera while I turned the Cape yes I'm just telling you I'm just telling you look he had vision I just that's all what happened to me don't know me come on to put the spicy glasses on a spicy now that my cake is flipped right-side up the top of the rim needs a little bit of copper so I'm just gonna touch up with my copper it is time to add some pumpkin spice latte to this cup so for this I used royal icing and I dyed it using a little bit of ivory very good brown and buttercup yellow until I got that pumpkin spice latte color because it's kind of the color of a latte but slightly like not born in June but warmer yeah so once I have the color correct I then place that royal icing into a parchment piping bag and piped it around the top edge of the cup unfortunately royal icing drives from the inside oh so it would take a long time if I wanted it to drive completely but I wanted it to be dry enough that when I typed my buttercream as whipped cream my buttercream wouldn't move all the icing and have it spill down [Music] it's time to place my logo on the front of the cup I used a ruler and measure just a sort of place where the letter should go because I want them placed evenly I won't have it I won't have crooked letters on the how to cake it pumpkin spice latte I glued my letters on with a little bit of clear piping gel brushed on the back of them and then I glued them on so that they would say can't get this is backward to you pumpkin spice and then I used the line or the strip that I cut out with a strip cutter and place it across the word latte like I was wiping that away and then I used my other letters which were more of a script and added the word cake underneath it and I actually did not add those in a straight line I wanted it to look like it had been written on the whipped cream that comes on the how to cake it pumpkin spice latte cake is of course Italian meringue buttercream I placed some of my buttercream into a piping bag fitted with a large star tip so it would look like piped whipped cream and then I did just that I piped the buttercream in a nice pile yes whipped cream comes in and how they can't get pumpkin spice latte cake it better yeah so no special orders either this elevated no like half that no foam blah blah and leave the cinnamon nope you take it away you get it as a final touch on the how to cake it pumpkin spice latte cake there is a mixture of spices all from Grenada so we do some ground cloves some ground cinnamon and then freshly grated nutmeg mix those spices

I run it one month but this time when the size crops your face you have to change of a surface that's an excellent idea Connie you are watching how to take it I'm Yolanda and Canada is turning 150 so what better way to celebrate them making two giant Nanaimo bar cakes they're like what are Nanaimo bars I'm going to show you I started by making the crust on the bottom I am thinking brown it's just because I like any excuse to bake brownies and I love brownies and in addition I folded in some toasted coconut chips and some slivered almonds because normally in an enamel bar crust there is almonds and coconut along with graham crumbs and cocoa and butter and it all just compressed so I needed my brownies to look like the crust of a nanami bar once my brownies are baked and cooled I removed them from their pen the brownies are already a square but I want to cut off the ends of the brownies on all four sides so that I can reveal this beautiful coconut and almond inside then I decided to slightly level my brownies they're pretty much level they're more level than cakes and they don't even have a hump they have more of a slight valley okay so you've leveled up the ready the base of my Nanaimo bars are ready I'm going to move on or undo one of the things we're going to move on to the stilling I baked one large rectangular vanilla cake and then I removed it from its pan leveled it and cut it into two squares and then I will bars have like a sweet creamy filling and there's normally a bit of English custard powder inside which gives it a slight yellow tone but my Nanaimo bars are going to have vanilla cake as the filling ice on the outside and the top with Italian meringue buttercream that I'm going to die the right color once I have my two even squares Isis Beach one over and remove the carmelization from the bottom now it's time to you guessed it the square is simple and get hot on oh my gosh I simple serve dry banana cakes making sure that they wouldn't dry out while we decorate I just want to let you know how devoted how to cake it is to Canada miss Jocelyn over here tried to get Justin Trudeau on the show and for those of you don't know that is our prime minister which is like the president so the leader of Canada Canada's turning a hundred and fifty this year this is a big deal which also is like hey I think you should learn to prop code I'm going to be excellent exposure for him right Cassini's exposure I'm going to die some of my Italian meringue buttercream with a little bit of yellow food coloring to turn it into that creamy custard e color I find it easier when I'm trying to achieve a lighter color to just take a bit of buttercream out put it in a smaller bowl dye it and then add it back as I need to because once you go beyond you can't go back unless you have more about it there's no return from colored butter or on some kind of like scary treatment now that my buttercream is the perfect color I am going to crown coat and chill these two vanilla tea your friends a favor to you just passing my green juice yes miss Jocelyn owl and goose sounds exactly like what you would drink organic curly kale Organic dinosaur kale organic apple yeah I think that's mighty organic the owl is drinking a green juice I've seen enough good I'm going to now I sees cakes with a thicker layer of my Italian meringue butter Spain and I want the edges to be as straight as possible as well as adding a thicker layer on I find it really helpful because we seek is loading a small straight spatula on the side and then a larger offset spatula to drag in the excess see [Music] cap cake is on sale today early bird pricing is only for one week so register now while the pricing is low I have a question is the early bird an owl that drinks is you know I think it's just a burden eat cake you're right kam cake is a one day live stream baking camp hosted by me on Facebook this year kam cake is on July 29th and August 1st you get to spend a full day with me while I'm in this kitchen and you're in yours we will do everything together we will be making my taco cake which I have never made on this channel but they are in my upcoming book as well as Sunday cupcakes so pick the date that works for you because we'll be doing the same project on both days head-to-head Katy calm and register now I can't wait to bake with you and you get to see another hunk oh good I'm going to be watching this next Nanaimo bars our cover the final layer is melted chocolate with butter for my cake Nanaimo bars I'm going to make modeling chocolate modeling chocolate is really easy to make no matter what type of chocolate you use you just put your chocolate into a bowl along with corn syrup and then you place a bowl over a pot of simmering water you let the ingredients melt on their own and then you stir it together until all the chocolates is melted and pour it into a bowl to set our support into a plastic bowl because it does get sort of sticky and you will need you know a plastic scraper to scrape it out of the bowl when it's said it should be quite firm but your people can model with it for all the details on my modeling chocolate recipe we will put that in the description below I'm going to roll this modeling chocolate out to a big enough square to cover the top of each Nanaimo bar and I wanted some texture because often when you pour a glaze on a dessert bar then you would use a spatula to spread it and so you might see a little bit of texture even after it settles so I use a smaller rolling pin and basically created like full ways wave in my modeling chocolate I did this twice because I'm making two Nanaimo bars and then I put the modeling chocolate in the fridge to chill so it to be nice and set when I cut it into a perfect square to assemble these bars the first thing I'm going to do is spread just bump up your path of my custard colored buttercream onto the top of my brownie now I'm going to save my iced vanilla cake on time at this time if you find that your sizing is off if your brownie is a little too big on one side don't worry just trim it where necessary and feed it I didn't even have like a scrap pool beside me at this point because you're looking at the scrap Bowl here's a great way to prospect the icing I cut a cake board to the exact size of my brownie and then I laid that cake board on top and I lined it up I actually use the fondant with her not for fondant I just held it up against each side making sure that the board was lined up with the brownie and then I use a small straight spatula to fill in the icing along the sides of the cake does this one look a touch up and then carefully remove the cake board and again dragging in the excess buttercream to the center top of this cake can this just be the hostess finally it's time to add our chocolate glaze or in this case our modeling chocolate what I'm going to do is take that same cake board and I'm going to lay it on top of my wavy modeling chocolate now I'm going to use a sharp paring knife to cut all four sides into a perfect square this is why it's imperative imperative it's imperative that your modeling chocolate is cold because if it won't warm at this point your glaze would be like you understand that yes and you don't want that I use a straight spatula to help me lift up my chilled modeling chocolate square and then I place it carefully on top topping off - now on the first one that I did my squared modeling-chocolate was so a touch too long so quickly took it off trimmed off like an eighth of an inch and put it back this is another reason why it's great to work with cold modeling chocolate so your hands are very awesome because it is imperative and it's tenant 150 yes that's very fine yes only Justin Trudeau was here he would have been like what am i doing on this show so about it no that is not it chocolate Canada is turning a hundred and fifty so of course I had to make a gum paste Maple Leafs whoo yes cut it out let it dry and then once it was dry I attached a bamboo skewer to the back with some oil I think and then I can stand it up like a topper but the key is you need to make this ahead of time so it's really really dry you can even do this weeks before I mean I knew the birthday was coming Jocelyn I feel like you'd failed me I could have been sitting here with JP and drink imagine a second sold it would have been amazing it would have been me like this [Applause] four more giant food cakes I have a playlist right here and I also have a great summer cake playlist the fun ideas of summer and don't forget to register for camp cake at Hanukkah kiss calm I can't wait to bake with all of these black 
welcome back how to take it I'm Yolanda and this week we are gearing up to Cinco DeMayo tilt I am taking an avocado this time I just thought I'd make it flow please subscribe to this channel and don't forget to the notification valve so you know when I have new videos we make my avocado I think vanilla cake in an egg-shaped pan but first I have to dye my batter the perfect avocado color we make to have just like a sphere pen so I like to level the cake in the pan if your cakes would have baked over the lip a little and minded I use a smaller knife to cut away the crust so that I could see the top of the pan before leveling the next thing I need to do to the two halves of my eggs are removed all the carmelization so I put them flat sides down and then just use a serrated knife to cut away all the carmelization from the stone side of each cake we just want to see avocado yellow cake at this point now I'm going to hold my two halves together and carve the avocado shape because I bake this in an egg pan there really isn't not much shaping to do I just sort of tapered in what was in the neck of the avocado if you can't find an egg pan you could alternatively make this in a fair pan you'll just have more cake and carve away avocados have a big pit inside so I need to create a crevice inside what a crevasse I started thinking about what I would use as the pit and I decided on a kinder egg and so what I did is I just split open the kinder egg along the seam I just use the tip of my paring knife and then I melted some cocoa candy milk and filled to the inside of each half of the egg I actually filled two eggs just in case plus I can give the toy to my son and get bonus points once the half of the eggs were filled I put them in the fridge to chill and set up so that it will be sturdier when it's the fit inside my avocado once they're fully set I'm going to lay one half on one half of my avocado cake with a flat side down and then I'm going to Center it and position it where I want it and just trace around it at the top of my paring and then I use a spoon to scoop out that area of case so that might fit to be nestled perfectly inside now I want a simple care if you taste with the help of this squeeze a lot so that they stay nice and moist avocados are far from dry I use a little bit of chocolate spread on top of one half and sandwich both have together to create a solid profit in order to sandwich my avocado cakes together i melted some green and yellow candy melts and blended them together until they match the color of my feet I spread a thin layer onto one half of my avocado paste gently place my chocolate dipped in and then I don't with the other half of the avocado cake on top again you can fill in any gaps in the seams of the cake with some more of your avocado colored chocolate it's time to crumb coat and chill this avocado however I need to color my buttercream to the perfect avocado like that green goodness that's right we have the skin of an avocado if you like making food cakes as much as I do and get creative making cakes look like your favorite food there is a food cake playlist right over here that you can check out broke to you ah burger eat up helping up they're just ready watermelon that pineapple okay turkeys oh yeah forget Turkey that's my favorite now that my buttercream is the right color I'm going to come coat and chill this avocado yours also dance has to incorporate Star Wars and please good mile go hold on I don't even know okay I'm gonna do I like my favor and if you want the Meili Cady with your t-shirt it's at how to take it calm if my crumb coat is chilled time to ice this case with a nice layer of my avocado buttercream and chill it once again once your buttercream is chilled and really do want it to be changed to the next steps you can smooth out the ridges using a small icing spatula and get the avocados nice at this point I started to get really hungry I did I wanted guacamole I've colored some fondant to resemble avocado skin which is a very dark green but almost with a brown undertone a very natural dark green I roll the fondant out about an eighth of an inch thick making sure it's large enough to drape over my cake pick it up on my French rolling pin and drape it over and then I use my hands as usual when I have a soft round cake to move it all over the case cuffing respondents underneath then I cut away some of the excess but not right SSE and I decided to flip everything I've got I know I decided to split my avocado onto a soft floral fun and then just bring all these excess fondant up around the bottom trimming away the excess I thought I was really clever I figured that because the turkey skin eater worked so well for Turkey you can get your turkey skin creator right here on how to cake it clearly it could help me create the texture of avocados yes no no no it wasn't seeds enough it wasn't like wrinkly so i decided to use some hemp oil that i crumpled up yeah yeah so this we're going to put on how to take a joke on as well we're going to call it the avocado skin either I use my avocado skin either to press gently into the fondant all around the avocado so delicate and rare tool it's only available at had a cake accom don't think you can just go to your dollar store and get some simple that have lit up you can't I'm going to pre crumple it for you once I was happy with my avocado texture I decided to paint this cake and give the avocado color a little more you know I look at avocados I'm like this got it got the hump I mix a little bit of avocado food coloring with brown food coloring and then I dilute it with the clear food grade alcohol I paint this mixture over the entire surface of the cake to give depth to the color and then I put the cake in the fridge to chill and let the paint dry avocados skin looks different in the ripening process and the promise of avocados is you buy them can we sit down and they're like I'm alright I'm not right I'm not right I'm not right I'm not right all right I'm bad that's the problem with them and I think you have a seven minute seven minute window to eat the avocado when I made my watermelon cake which you can watch right over here otherwise known as Walter melon I had to make an of the top of him so all the bottoms have enough to and they kind of stick out a bit from avocado I use a small amount of tan colored fondant like left lemon el and I just molded and sculpted a little nub using some sculpting tools I used a star piping tip to just create texture and finally I painted the mouth with a little bit of brown food coloring diluted with clear food grade of the giant avocado is looking a little bit shiny so what I did is I used some light cocoa powder and a soft brush and brushed it all over the surface it just dissolves on the surface and absorbs and it mattifies the avocado color I have to eat this avocado face away in Colorado I cut it open around the tip and separated the have and then I just jug in with a spoon it was perfectly like I got the seven-minute window thanks goodness thank you for watching how to take yet please subscribe to this channel and hit that notification about you know I have made a new face [Music] 
welcome back to how to get I'm Yolanda and my son is turning 4 and given his obsession with superheroes and the Justice League movie coming out I thought I need to make like a comic book superhero inspired BAM boom smash cake I'm gonna be cake girl in the comic books and I'm gonna say go ahead Caitlyn before my son I'm baking my favorite flavor he loves it too he loves it too chocolate banana now that all my cakes are baked and cooled I'm going to level them and with the banana cakes I will cut the carmelization away from the bottom once I'm happy with all of my cakes I'm going to cut each one of them in half horizontally to create two layers from each all together it was 18 pounds of cake he's only 4 I know I'm setting myself up 2016 I'm making a 500 pound cake him and his friends will go in and they'll just eat their way out it's time for sir squeeze he's got a whole 15 layers of cake to say Oh sir Sir squeezes my Robin yes yes this is amazing get my oven mitts sir squeeze let's go I'm on my way look look you could do you could whip these hey I got it aha I got it right in the head whoo-hoo it didn't hurt it's very soft oh okay now I understand it's time to build all three of my tears by sandwiching my chocolate and banana cakes together with Italian meringue buttercream you can find my Italian meringue buttercream recipe on page 30 of my cake book after filling each tear I simply used the buttercream that was sort of seeping out the sides to crumb coat all around and on top and then I chilled all three tiers you know what's the cake girl crumb coat and chill the ends oh you're not ready for that I need more room I do it in the air but with legs and everything crumb coat chill friend cape girl is gonna get herself on a Justice League you know what they mean another girl Wonder Woman needs a friend yes cuz Wonder Woman looks like she'd skate for sure I'm sure she enjoys Kate responsibly it is time to ice my cakes all again now you know I've told you before when I'm making square cakes it's really difficult I like to keep my sides and my corners very sharp so if you need to when you ice your cake use a bench scraper to help you and feel free to chill it and then go back and touch up and ice again four-year-olds are definitely very particular about angle yes because he's gonna be like mom that's not perpendicular or parallel he's not even gonna want to play with his friends or open gifts he's going to be it's so preoccupied if my angles aren't right I'll ice you that actually sounds very violent it's had four fondant and in order to keep these tears nice and square I'm gonna roll my fondant into sheets and apply it in sections to each tier of this cake starting with the bottom tier which is the largest square cake I'm going to cover this one in a yellow fondant I rolled out five sheets of yellow fondant and the first thing I need to do is cover two opposite sides now I need to trim the excess away from these fondant sheets so essentially I'm cutting like panels of fondant exactly to the right height and then adding them and trimming them on the cake so the edges are nice and square the final panel is a sheet to cover the talk I like to use a set square to cut a perfect 90 degree angle on one end of the square afonya add it to the top of the cake and then I use of course a ruler and a sharp paring knife to trim the other two sides flush to the cake I repeat this process once again for the two remaining tiers I cover my middle tier in blue fondant and the top tier in red funding for more tips and tricks on how to cover a box-shaped cake nice and square check out my gift box cake it's in the cake book on page 211 it's a good gift inside it's chocolate the next thing I want to do is like a comic book I want to frame each side of each cake like it's a frame from a comic panels to do this I'm rolling out some black fondant nice and then and then I'm gonna cut a whole bunch of quarter inch strips with a ruler and a sharp paring knife and I'll attach them to the edges of all the sides of my case with a little bit of clear piping gel brushed on the back of each strip where the strip's overlap I'm gonna use my sharp knife to cut them with a like a mitered cut you like a picture frame my gift box cake shows you see how I do that Kate girl is like Yolanda Gant by day right then she gets into like a mixer and she comes out cake girl go ahead take my day I know guys who do you think she play me a skate girl colorful oh this is gonna be so very oh boy leave a comment below with the hashtag cake girl with the name of the actress you think should play me cake girl now I need to fill these panels with a scene a scene where the cake girl can fight cake and Justices she will fly into your kitchen and she will whip that box cake mix right out of your hand so my son actually has a city skyline in his room on the wall so I made a template out of that and cut it out of paper and then I laid it on some more rolled out black sheets of fondant and cut out the city and I need enough scenes for all four sides of three cakes okay I'm not gonna lie I didn't do the back you did it no he's not gonna see the back and this was a lot of work like doing the city took me hours now that I have all my city scenes cut out I want to score the lines between the buildings to define them a little bit further so I use a ruler and the very sharp point of my paring knife I just score it to define the buildings and I even want to step further and I used a food coloring marker in black to draw over those score lines just to give it a little more definition I wanted to look like a dark city skyline you know what I mean in the dark of night when bad things happen yet people buying generic grocery stores slab cakes and then cake girl hears about this she flies through the sky with a cake bug cake this I would never throw a book at people and now this nighttime cityscape meets some lights you know I use my strip cutters to cut out of different sized strips of gum paste I even used it in two directions so if you use your strip cutter this way and cut out strips and then you line it up this way you'll get the squares you see what I did there I do Windows that's how you can make a bunch of little squares at once and using my ruler lining everything up clear piping gel on the back I decorate all of the cityscapes this only took about four hours but orhan show like two seconds of footage just to cover us off so in the meantime let me remind you about camp cakes it's happening on December 9th and it's

up and place them again [Music] now I can finally dabble and stack this cake each tier was built on its own board which you don't see but it allows me to put dowels in between to support each chair of cake and I can't have this cake collapsing imagine imagine I of all people that was at my son's birthday party in the cake collapse who would say his name not cake girl cuz I'm cake girl who does cake girl call that's why I need to be part of the Justice League so I haven't call him that yeah and maybe they can help me I cut the dowels flush to the same height as my tier of cake insert them straight down and then I add just a little layer of royal icing before placing the final little red tier one thing I know about comics is the sounds are really loud but they're written out for you for this I have rolled out some yellow blue and red fondant I also rolled up some more white gum paste and cut out the words pow bang crash was my quick 6 cake girl always has click sticks in her back pocket what if she has to like cut a word out of gum paste on the fly and then I laid each one onto a piece of cardstock that I'm going to use to make my template for my sound burst once I've laid out my letters I just take a pencil and draw around once I'm happy with all three of my templates I cut them out of the card stock with scissors and then I lay it on to a color and cut it out so I lay the template on cut it out and then I glue that first color on to the second color and then cut around it so that I see a border of that sound finally it's almost time to add my letters but first I want to outline them using a black food coloring marker then I glue the words on to their sound bursts with you guessed it clear piping gel I glue my enemies to the sides of cakes get them out of my way and I add them in angles you know over the city how bad crash I really like it so freaking square please share this video this cake is perfect for any little guy or little girl who loves superheroes

shell bet you flash can't ice the cake as fast as I can can't 
welcome back to Harrogate I'm Yolanda and this week I am taking giant egg waffles for 11 from strangers named house she had a cake version of waffles [Music] to make these giant waffles I baked eight pounds of my ultimate vanilla cake in two 12-inch round pegs once my cakes are baked and cooled I level them remove the car Malaysian car Malaysian I decided caramelization was too long of a word so I'm just gonna sink our Malaysian from now on now I need to round out the edges all around the cake on the top and bottom first thing I do is mark along the sides about a third of the way down and then I use a small serrated knife to round out the top edges down to that line I do this to both cakes and then I flip them over and round out the other side no Jeremy don't attempt to flip them he didn't even mention it felt like he was walking on eggshells during the cake slipping so I go shells cut it out now it's time for sir squeeze a lot to help me simple syrup my two waffles I'm gonna simple serve these waffles on both sides cuz I don't need a dry waffle you don't I'm saying [Music] so now I need to crumb coat this cake and chill on both sides so I'm gonna start with what is the bottom of the waffle crumb coat with my Italian meringue buttercream and chill once that ground coat is chilled I'm going to flip my cakes again with no fancy flipping shots and crumb coat the other side and shell now I'm going to ice the top side of these cakes and chill them again these are pretty chilly waffles I just want to place a sheet of parchment paper so that when I flip them back right side up I don't rip off all of this buttercream so I'm going to flip them both over so that the bottom side is up which is just a crumb coated side and now I'm going to cover both of them with how do I say a go coloured fondant guess what one of the colors I used was Drossel ivory and yellow don't forget all of these recipes are in my cake book biz recipe for simple syrup my ultimate vanilla cake and of course Italian meringue butter [Music] now I need to trim away the excess but not at the base of the cake about halfway them I've chosen to cover the waffle in two parts top and bottom because jostles have a bit of a scene it's not really a scene it's more like cuz they're in a iron some of the batter overflows and this is the way I'm going to recreate them so now I'm going to flip these cakes back over so that the top side is up and just remove the parchment paper we are going back out on tour stay tuned we will be in Le we're gonna put all the details that you need below before I cover this top side I need to create well the waffle print pattern walk with a pattern I need to measure and Mark out the grid pattern that will make this a what is if I cover right now it will just look like like a chubby pancake which you're not really going for without a grid is it a waffle if there are no waffle irons in the forest once I've marked out my lines I then need to roll a ton of fondant cords and lay them over this grid pattern that I have marked out on the cake so let's get rolling orhan there's a lot of footage it's really hard to roll out cords to the same size when you're doing it by hand so what I did is I actually weave little balls of fondant so like one and a half ounces of and then roll the intimus all around the same way before I apply these chords to the cake I need to sort of change the shape of them I don't want them to be as rounded so what I did is I use two rulers that's thrilling that could be excited whoo that could be a scene in stranger things is that thrilling so what I did was I compressed Jeremy stop laughing once I've done this to all of my fondant chords I begin to apply them to the cake starting with the first cake I lay all the chords on in one direction and then I take the remaining chords and cut them and fill in in between I was having memories of ice cream cone King while I did this because I I made that pattern in a similar way there's also like a circle around the waffle it's like the edge of the waffle iron so I laid a circle on top of these cords that was slightly smaller just to mark around and cut the ends of all the cords leaving a circle around while I work on this cake I want to remind you guys about Camp cake yeah well I know it's the same words I don't think that's called the same word you should send every rapper a newsletter with this info just nice same word every sentence in the song ends with the same word camp cake is a live stream baking event happening on December 9th where I bake in the comfort of this kitchen and you bake at home New York we're going to be making some great holiday baking projects together step by step there's a link below to register or you go to how to keep calm and the sale price is still on I will see you on December 9th guess what I'm gonna do I'm gonna roll out some fondant cords yeah I'm gonna roll them out just slightly thicker than the other 50 I rolled out and it was a 15 it was more like 20 but this time I'm not gonna flatten the course I'm going to leave them completely round and then I wrapped them around so that they fit perfectly around a grid pattern and trimmed with a fondant mint you really need to chill these cakes for a while before we cover them because we need to let these cords get really really cold and stay in place otherwise when we cover it with fondant we're gonna squash them or move them around we can't have like a misplaced grid pattern how scary is that put that in stranger things I bet there are misplaced for patterns in the upside-down world the name itself tells you what it's about right I want to go to right-side up now it's finally time to cover the tops of these waffles and make them look like giant waffles I take that same angle colored fondant and roll it out large enough to cover the waffle and then I drape it over and here's where it gets tricky I need to work all of the fondant down into each sort of square of the grid pattern so what I'm gonna do is use a straight pin just to get out some of the air trapped underneath and a soft paintbrush and that brush is gonna help me sort of brush it down and release air through the pinhole and then I can go back with my fingertips very carefully and smooth out the fondant within each square because the grid pattern is obviously very square but the waffle is round as you get to the outer edges of the waffle you won't have full squares you might have like little triangles so those are really hard to work the fondant into because the space is really small so if your paintbrush pokes a hole don't worry take a little more fondant soften it in your fingertips push it in and then can you dip down with a paintbrush once all the fondant is smooth into the grid pattern we will address the sides of the cake so just smooth it along the sides with the palm of your hand and then we're going to trim the Fond it at that halfway mark and I found it helpful to do it with a pair of kitchen scissors waffle seams aren't even it's over full so it's usually not even all the way around in my cake book I make waffles in an easier way way less than half the time and tastes delicious and I paired those waffles with fried chicken so make sure to check that out leave a comment below if you have seen my fried chicken and waffle cake in the book hashtag fried chicken and waffle house 11:00 paired her waffles with fried chicken yet leave me a comment below let me know so to toast these waffles I'm gonna toast these waffles guess who I invited back to the kitchen to help me with these well okay Burnie guys can we cheer for Bernie or something he's he doesn't mommy Wow that was not I don't think I realize how hard Bernie works I don't want to toast it as much as the crust on my pizza cake because I find that like pros and waffles when you put them in the toaster they don't really brown that much make sure to brulee underneath the seam as well and then all around the side and finally the grid pattern which was really a lot of fun it's okay if one side of your waffle looks more toasted than the other I think that makes it look more realistic I feel like they Brown slightly or they're burnt is anyone with me on this don't you agree yeah exactly they're either like not ripe enough not ripe enough now right but I'm not sure it's not ripe enough over right now we need to brulee the second waffle you're a pro now go ahead now I'm going to chill these giant waffle cakes and let them cool completely and in the meantime I want to make some butter well some butter colored butter cream so I use two shades of yellow to color some butter cream and I keep a pound of butter beside me to match it up and then I just place that butter cream into a bowl pack it down and chill it until it's completely fun I just use an ice cream scoop and form gonna be like four scoops of butter colored buttercream and I placed them on a plate until I'm ready I'll never forget the first time I went to like a breakfast chain in the States and I ordered waffles and the butter was in a suit and I was like what is that honestly I was like is this did they put ice cream on my waffles because it was like whipped butter and the scoop was quite big I have never seen that before or the syrup on top of these waffles I am going to use of course 100% Canadian maple syrup so I'm going to mix my maple syrup with corn syrup about half and half stir it together just to thicken up the maple syrup finally I'm ready to serve these waffles and

you are watching how to kick it I'm Yolanda and this week in honor of Father's Day I am taking a giant t-bone steak out of red velvet cake it's a red velvet sink please subscribe to the channel and hit that notification bell to you know when I have a freshly baked cake for 6 to make this cake I baked two 12-inch square pans of red velvet cake cooled them and remove them from their pants then I level the top but I left the carmelization on the back Oh Jeremy you're not shocked you sound more like okay like just like take state ground floor on the outside of the pocket so I want to leave the carmelization and Jeremy sunshine is just bad at acting that's why is behind the camera now I'm going to stash my cakes together placing one with the carmelization tanks down and the other tipped over on top - Lissa carmelization it's time to carve this cake into a steak just assuming I drew myself a template is really easy there's a ton of big pictures online I'm not joking endless endless supply so what I did is I leave my template on top and carved out the main portion of the page I vented the exercise of cakes that I've cut off because the state gets narrow as it skips to the bottom far far part is also card something else it hasn't actually it's a serrated knife that I use a small one to carve cakes is really a statement see ya Jeremy Lee I want to call Danny mr. positivity from now Kenny some of the balance of the universe that section this is a lot over here a lot of like rainbows like sprinkles just fall from the sky over Joe's head I'm not even joking once I'm happy with the shape of my steak I'm going to simple syrup all of this thing you don't want to over your dad's sake you want to give them a juicy tender steak that's perfectly cooked with the help of this week it's time to guys some Italian meringue buttercream a deeper shade of red velvet cake I use the same food guys I used to color my cake batter and I just adjust them as I go comparing my buttercream to my cake until I'm happy I'm going to fill this cake and restock it but unlike most cakes I don't want to just spread an even layer of buttercream in between I kind of want to gel mitt a little in the center because the thickest part of the state could be the least cooked now I flip my second cake on top completing my state cake and before I crumb coat I just want to darken the buttercream a bit more since it's on the outside I want it to look more like a clip and then I cramp out and chill my steak once my gram coat is chilled I'm going to ice this giant steak cake again and chill it one up my baking tools are kind of like my barbecue tool to barbecue peculiar barbecue that is so far beyond who I only barbecue how does the barbecue like that's so 2006 week to cover this cake I colored some fondant in like a reddish brown color i measured the width and the length of the cake rolled out my fondant picked it up on a French rolling pin and draped it over the cake then I smoothed it with a fondant smoother and my hands and trimmed away the excess recipe if your dad is not a state guy we have a ton of other great Father's Day ideas for cakes in a playlist right over here and in fact if you guys make one of these cakes for your dad you could win how to keep get prize pack here's how make one of the cakes from the playlist take a photo of the cake with you and your dad's and post it on instagram using the hashtag HTC I love step three finalists will win a fun product prai's max I'll deliver bye Jeremy you won the prize the next thing I want to do is create the grill marks and the steak very important very important you want to mess up the grill max right you want to prove that you know how to cook this thing so I just use a wooden dowel to press in my grill marks I did use a ruler shocker to space them because I know if are because grill would be even with fence oh yeah I think it was warranted yes okay so just use a wooden dowel press it into the fondant and you can leave indentation stay healthy it's barbecue Larissa I am making the t-bone on the giant steak cake with some modeling chocolate so I like to roll it out in a bit of cornstarch you can use a nonstick mat if you feel that you need to and I rolled it out big enough to cut out a bone I cut out the t-bone that I then laid on top of my face the next thing I did was roll out more of my modeling chocolate because truthfully the phone will be right through the state so we need to add a band of white chocolate along the top side that comes up to meet the bone to give the illusion that that phone is going fully to distance [Music] the next thing I want to do is create the layer of like fat or gristle I believe it's actually called crystal along the side of the meat so what I did now is dyed the rest of my modeling chocolate with a bit of brown food coloring to get it a darker color then I rolled out my modeling chocolate making sure it was the thickness of my steak or the height of my steak and I added a bent all along the one side gluing it on with a bit of clear piping top with my remaining Brown modeling chocolate I created the end of the bones would be sort of a sharp piece at the bottom of the T and I attached that to the side of the cake coming up to meet the goal for all my basic recipes red velvet cake simple syrup Italian meringue buttercream and modeling chocolate I have videos in this playlist right here it is time to score this week because the surface of meat has a texture so to start off I'm going to use the tip of my sharp paring knife and I'm just going to continuously score the meat with natural sort of curvy lines all over the surface of the cake to texture the centre of my bone where it usually looks sort of dark and porous I use a small piping tip that's used to make grass or hair so it's a piping tip that has several little round holes I just put it on my fingertip almost like a symbol and then I pressed into the modeling chocolate ball and chocolate is great that's why they call it modeling chocolate because basically depending on its temperature you can always go back and remodel it it doesn't develop a skin on the top the way that fondant or gum please do it's time to paint this fake cake I began by using ivory food coloring with a bit of clear food grade alcohol and I painted my first layer on the victim then I darkened that paint was brown with some black and I basically mix different combinations of the panes watering it down more sometimes and a whole different selection of brushes to paint layers and layers and layers Thomas Piketty I also enjoyed using I enjoyed using a dry brush the great thing I love about painting is I find it more forgiving than a lot of key techniques because you even have the ability to erase if at any point you feel like your steak is too dark or you don't like a technique you could always brush over it with more clear food grade alcohol I can get into a soft cake and wash your pain away and start again [Music] I found that as I was painting I was kind of losing the texture that I scored into the meat of my knife so I deep in those three using a gaming tool and I also made more of them along the side without the fact to enhance like grill marks I painted in a mixture of black and brown these colors now unfortunately we don't have any eat more cake teeth for Dad but if you remember this is Key Club this is this once t-shirt and it comes with a free little yo-yo not a mini version of me an actual like the toy graduated job oh yes I branded the state oh yes yes I did I use some metal alphabet cookie cutters that I had I actually gave them to my friends they never use them anymore so I have to go sleep in bath and his mini kit shadows Azores and what I did is very carefully I helped each letter with a tweezer and then I use Bernie to heat up the letter and then I branded my stake with the letters C a ke big cake and so basically the cutters just sort of melted into the fondant and when they left that little frayed line I painted in the group with a very fine paintbrush black C to make it was charred I'm very happy if you want to present this state cake in a way that looks the most real you can even put a little bowl of coarse sugar beside it in your dad sugar hood stay tuned sugar it now that is how you make a steak add a cake for your dad I wish dad
