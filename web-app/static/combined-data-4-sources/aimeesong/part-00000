hi guys it's Omni and I just came back from this cool conference that Lilly Singh was hosting at the YouTube space it's all about girl love so it's so common to see girl-on-girl hate and this whole initiative about girl love is just spreading love instead of hate which I absolutely like the idea of and it was so inspiring I don't know how to like really put it into words I've always never been a great speaker but I did film some parts or Nicolas did so I'm about to share that with you guys I think it's really common to see girls spreading negativity amongst each other being their worst critic instead of complimenting each other supporting one another it's easier to hate on each other and I see that so much on the internet especially but even in high school when I was bullied in middle school in high school it was amongst other girls it was from other girls it wasn't from guys it was yeah guys teased me but the ones who were mentally really tormenting me were other girls and now that I think about it I normalize that situation I thought when you're surrounded by a group of girls I always get more I always get so intimidated or I used to get very intimidated because I always feel like I have to act tough or you know you have to toss it but in reality we're all going through the same struggles like every single one of us are going to the exact same struggles it's so hard to be a woman in nowadays it's 2017 and it's still super hard to be a woman and the same issues that we used to face 50 years ago 40 years ago hundreds of years ago women are still facing them and there's so much more issues and bigger things that are happening in this world that the least of our problems should be grow on grow hate like if we can support one another focus on bigger issues I just like the whole initiative and I like the wareness that Lily was trying to raise and I thought it was such an amazing event I think it's so important for us to us women especially to be our own attitude [Music] the first panel there were three speakers and there were guys all guys one was humbled opposed so these three guys are all feminist and they've been surrounded by women and for them true masculinity means being supportive of other woman and being there for them and also believing in equity as well the other guy's name was he's an actor and Sofia from my team with fangirling so hard will show you guys out video because we did film that part she's like freaking out all the sudden 45 I guess a bit like his name is Justin and he's on this TV show called Jane the virgin I've seen a few episodes of Jane the version when I was on a plane and he is a very good-looking guy but not only is he good-looking but oh my gosh his heart the entire time he was talking about how appreciative he is a woman he apparently has a younger sister he has a wife he has a daughter and his wife is pregnant with his their second kid and he was just professing his love to his wife and I thought that was so sweet and genuine and he strongly and truly believes that feminism and that woman are equal to men and that we women should support one another and that how how great an amazing we all are right and then the third guys his name was Louis house and I believe he's an author he wrote tubas and he's coming out with a third book and he was really close to apparently he has two older sisters so he's always grown up surrounded by a lot of women a lot of strong women so he understands how to treat a woman the second panel was a Q&amp;A between myself and Jared so Jared been a really good friend of mine and I was very honored that Lilly's team and Jared yeah he also now works for you to invited me over to talk about my experience and you want to bring up one of the participants of our workshop I'll be song of some style and I am talking on me about why it's important for her the female to use her platform on me is a very successful fashion blogger she likes to remind me she's been voted number two in terms of most influential hobbies also friend but want to talk to her about why it's important for her with her platform to use her voice to empower other women and also what it's been like 20 YouTube so how are you I'm going to hi guys I'm adding the song offense Thank You YouTube and Thank You Lily for having me here and very honored to be amongst all of your a whose presence bulwarks on it you're here you have a very large platform across your blog your social media platforms and now reason they join you in YouTube as well for you as a woman why is it important for you to use your platform to empower and inspire other women it's very important for me not because I have a big platform but for all of us it's important because we have some kind of following amongst our friends or family like there's something that's always going to listen to us and for me to have this platform and be able to like promote positivity support one others I feel like I'm just doing good for the whole community and it could all just start from one person and I believe that that can actually make a big impact amazing and you've recently joined you to your blog was very text and image based and recently moving over to video what has that experience been like my video important for you to share your message I only wanted to show a certain type of images because I come with that come from a fashion background and it's very fashion can be a very close my discernible but once I became myself I realized that's what people started responding and it felt like video helped me do just that and especially recently I was in Paris for Fashion Week and I was attending the most glamorous events but I felt so loud because I felt like I was trying so hard to fit in and I created a video and it is something that I would never pose on my Dexter grammar like my blog because so curated but that night I just recorded on my iPhone and I just fell tonight she like talked about my problems and I really didn't have the intention of sharing it with the audience and but something in me said okay maybe if I feel so broken despite what the world sees what my life is like maybe there's somebody out there thinking oh my gosh her life is perfect her kimchi on the field world Ganges and maybe somebody would relate to that so I decided to share that on my parents Fashion Week blog and actually got a really big response I was actually really shocked and surprised and even from my peers other bloggers and other designers [Music] [Music] [Music] I'm sorry once the automation part of it I really wanted women to all the front no sectors of the industry and run into a problem like I mean literally I connected with every single person I knew this such a great panel it was so I even drew the real comment America we don't cover below yeah I acestes love to do the guys haha everybody every times again it comes to get somewhere communal date to meet under the poppy thank you of course yeah what I wanted to share with you guys was I think it's super important to be supportive of one another even in the media even on TV when you watch TV like all these like reality shows on Bravo Oh like the real housewife is like a very easy example like wonderful women are is just like fighting with each other always trash-talking you know I talking about things that don't matter like you guys should be talking about something else you guys should be uplifting each other and we really need to do more of that so I encourage you guys to go out there and compliment somebody lift somebody up and honestly you'll have more people rooting for you if you support one another and show and love so everybody would will root for you and they'll be on your side and I believe that the reason I have such an amazing connection with you guys and I feel really grateful of like my community our little close circle that I have with you guys and my relationship with you guys I don't see a lot of hate in my community and I feel so grateful about it and I I'm so proud of you guys and thank you so much for being such a good example of making my life easy by you know supporting one another always standing up for me I mean once in a while definitely get hate comments and like my skin got thicker and I didn't take it jessalyn can take it but sometimes I love it when you guys stand up for me they're like why are you hating you know like it's so awesome like I seriously have such an amazing like family of friends and I can't thank you guys enough so thank you thank you so much so the next panel right after me was debby ryan who's an actress and singer and rippy core I think that's how I pronounce really the crazy thing is I was like her name sounds familiar like I met her and then I wasn't thinking much I was like I've heard that name before you know why I have her book it's called milk and honey it's in my bathroom and every time I'm in the bathtub or on the toilet I read her but she's a poet and her poetry is so beautiful and so emotional just like speaks to me um and I mean I don't know I just love her book and she's the number one New York Times bestselling author if you don't have her book you should definitely get it you know I sit with her and then I'm Quinta Brunson who also works my feet and Lilly Singh Lilly Singh was moderating the whole panel and there was this four girl talking about girl love and I thought it was just so empowering there they're always like they're in their own circumstances talking about how much girl and girl support means to them and how great it is when all of us get together like how big of an impact we can make and it's so true I mean there is this little thing with an amazing experience for me like I just feel like I didn't have like one role model growing up I couldn't identify with like somebody growing up like the famous Asian people were Lucy Liu I think it was it like I grew up watching Lucy Liu and every time I was with two other girls I'd be like our Charlie angel truth formation when obviously I think she's so amazing but I feel like I'm so different from her you know yes we're both Asian but I feel like I don't identify with her I was much more of a tomboy I did take Ando for seven years I played sports my parents were divorced we grew up in a broken home at a very loving supportive sister though and I just felt so like such like an outcast I was a minority growing up an all-white neighborhood and then I switched schools so many times I think every two or three years I moved schools because I was bullied no matter where I went I couldn't fit in and I tried so hard to fit in and I could have fitted I just hope that my channel in my videos and whatever work I do like if somehow inspires you and touches you to pursue your dream and your passion and to be kind I think it's so important to be kind and loving to one another and I really hope I can be that role model to you guys and yeah just to be positive and happy and grateful you know like I have my ups and downs still and I want to have a meaningful relationship with you guys it's so important for me like so thank you so much for helping me do just that and thank you so much for watching good night I'm going to finish my avocado of course you 
bonsoir and Tommy just say Tommy I'm in Paris and welcome to my hotel suite at the Lebanese and you guys were wondering what I packed to Paris I want to do a packing video or unpacking video so it's super late right now it is 12:20 1:00 a.m. but I still want to show you guys what I packed so here we go so first of all I only brought a bag so I brought a lot of leather pieces because I knew Paris was gonna be slightly on the chillier side and I wanted to bring the edge Giambi song out in Paris so I have a really cool leather skirt you saw this from my unboxing video it's from rosie huntington-whiteley and page and this leather skirt I finally have a brown mini leather skirt and this is from arias something Navis collection with Nordstrom and then I brought a pair of longer leather trousers these are from frame and they're high-waisted this one is from Celine I haven't worn it yet I bought it last season while I was visiting but it was too hot but I knew I wanted something that was like really nice and something that was more straight like it I really didn't pack a lot those multi shoes and bags and baby products [Music] so a lot of the shoes that are brought are like mini heels my favorite ones I know that are gonna be on repeat are the Manolo Blahniks and then the Chanel slingbacks that I've worn many many times and then I also brought a lot of flats like pointy flaps like slippers I wasn't really sure what I was gonna wear in Paris so I I brought a lot of like simple heels that would go with a lot of things like now that I look at it I'm realizing that a lot of them are black and red I have my black pumps with red lips on it like the simple summer on my heels that look good on anything and then then you push into your black pumps with the red hearts so in this closet I have all my accessories and handbags and then my clothes for the show you get to see it here first my Dior dress I'm going to watch the show just a my fitting today and then obsessed that's my son Laurent dress I couldn't decide whether I was gonna wear the sweater miniskirt or this dress but I felt like this dress is a little bit more extra inappropriate for a nighttime event and then just all the jackets that I brought I didn't bring that many jacket it's not crazy cool but I would help fornia girl and anything under 70 degrees is freezing for me Blazers are always so easy to wear so I like to pack my Blazers so I have I brought a black one and then I also had like I brought a Timmy blazer that I probably threw somewhere the gray one and then you saw this one from my previous video the rosie huntington-whiteley 4 page and then I run a white blazer and a leather jacket for like if I want to feel like badass or edgy and it's easy to just throw on basically all my jackets or jackets that I can wear with anything and then I brought more shoes I think I brought three pairs of shoes per day and I'm here for ten days so 30 pairs of shoes not being extra at all so the first pair of boots that I want to show you guys are the new Chanel two-tone boots are you wearing this at the Chanel boots yeah I am the capital part is satin and this part is suede and I think it's so perfect for fall and these are also a new addition to my closet I just got these right before I left LA how cool are these these are from Iiro and I'm in love with the ruffles on this side that's so cool so if a girl has her leather boots she also needs her suede boots so these are from Dior and they're thigh high it comes almost up to my crotch and I could literally wear this like underneath a dress or skirt or I can be like really kind of like sexy and cute with a miniskirt because I wasn't sure about the weather really wasn't sure about the weather whenever I'm in Paris I'm always like oh I wish I brought this I wish I brought that because the weather is kind of unpredictable I'm really excited about these so I don't really own any boots that are a camel tone these are John B Taurasi and they're like the perfect shade of camel they're only like three inches high so it's like really comfortable and it has that chunky heel one last one the massive Dior boots I remember seeing these boots during the cruise collection in LA in Malibu the models were walking down wearing really beautiful dresses but with these type of boots so it was it was like pretty and feminine but then again at the same time really badass like I just like that little juxtaposition and this is exactly what I'm going to try to emulate tomorrow for the show so I have like my really pretty dress what's a really cool pattern and then crazy combat boots Chimay what this suck number two mini bags I'm all about stacking rings this one's missing its friend this one's missing its friend this one is missing its friend I'm actually happy that the one earring trend is back and is actually really big right now because these are all missing its partners you 
hi guys it's amy from song and style and you guys were requesting lisa to be on the video so today i'm picking her up we're going to the mansard a vo show so Lisa you said you were seeing a lot of shows yeah I mean it's back to back between shows and appointments and I do a lot of previews of collections so yeah it's been a hectic few days and then from nanopore today like how do you guys divide who's going to which shows because you guys here are so many brands I'm in the lucky position that I cover as much as possible so I cover everything you cover everything yeah oh I do my best I mean it's impossible cuz you're the fashion director another four days can you explain to us a little bit what you do yeah so I work with buying team and we look a look after over 400 brands and so I work with the buying team to really look at what the key trends are going to be one of those like key pieces that everybody's going to want I do love scouting for new brands so it's kind of being on the road all the time looking for what the next great collection is going to be so in a way you you kinda are a trend forecaster because like people go to net or to see what's cool what's in yeah and you're like telling the buyers and the consumers this is what you exactly it's anticipating what everyone that's gonna gravitate towards next season because we work six months ahead you know it's not that kind of immediate what are we what are we seeing around on the streets it's actually what is everyone going to want in six months time how do you know what people want this just a feeling it's really hard to explain but there's a real sort of gut reaction to collections and pieces I wish there was more sign into it but there's not were you always involved in fashion yes so I started my career in online retail and I'm still in online retail what did you serve in college I studied fashion management at the London College of Fashion that was I did I mean I worked alongside studying so I did my degree part-time and so that was quite intense he's working at masters fashion calm mm-hmm every day yes sir yeah I've had an internship in New York just for now what did you intern I actually interned in a buying office yes I moved here for nine months interning isn't the easiest thing to do by any stretch 18 or 19 I was yeah and I didn't know anyone in city and and you didn't have any fashion experience no I mean I've been stat just my studies just oh and I worked as a shop go oh I worked in retail first right like my first meeting with the fashion director at the time and I was in so I was in orifice so much her name's Bridget and she was like I'm gonna I'm gonna give you my trend notes and so she was dictating her trend notes to me and we got to the end and she was like this is perfect you know all the spellings of the designer names and I was like I've worked on the shop floor for a while so even though you don't think that those little jobs are going to amount to anything it actually meant that I had a great first start with and when you're an intern in New York for nine months did you have to pay for your own room did you like yeah it was tough it's not it's definitely not easy and I don't think the industry is changing much in that sense yes a lot of it is it is definitely difficult one of the questions I get most from people is how to land an internship and if you're not in the position to intern for free yeah like what is your advice for people like that it's really difficult I mean I would suggest trying to get an internship where you can balance weekend work or something along side it and recognize that ultimately the hard work will pay off and it will be well yes I think that's really I mean I worked the entire time I studied and it's the only way I could afford to do it so I was I had two other jobs while I was interning for free for an entire year and at those internships is where I learned the most valuable lessons that schools won't teach you yeah I don't feel like it's so like worth it you know totally I couldn't agree more and then so from the internship did you go straight to matches yes I did and I spent six years there six years yeah and then I moved to Munich and work for my tracer and then I came to mr. Porter and how long have you been at six years as well wow so you're like loyal uh yeah I mean I think when you're in a business that's growing so quickly and that's one thing that I would definitely advise someone that was embarking on an oniony on a career in fashion is that when you work with smaller business early on you get exposed to so many different elements of the business and so it kind of helps you shape your career and decide what you're really interested in rather than being like I mean if you're certain and you know exactly what you want to do that's great but I think a lot of people it's quite good to be exposed to lots of different kind of departments and skillsets and yeah yeah and then where do you see yourself like five years from now that is the toughest question because I asked myself this regularly because I have a great job and I love what I do and I actually can't see what that next step would be because I'm enjoying the ride and I would that would be the other thing that I say like it's so easy to get caught up in like what's next what's next but don't forget to look around and enjoy the career that you have at this moment and then are there any challenges as a fashion director for online retail it's very fast place and I travel a lot so you have to be prepared for that and you have to have very understanding friends and family because you know you're not around yeah a lot of you know a lot of things that are really important to you I'd say professionally it's trying to stay one step ahead yeah so it's very it's a very competitive environment and I don't mean one step ahead in terms of with your peers because I'm very much about empowering each other and supporting each other and if you do well then other people around you do well and I vice-versa but I think in terms of staying one step ahead of the industry that's really tough yes because of the pace do you feel like cuz you are also talking about how you your job is to discover younger ones that maybe no other retailers carry like how do you discover these brands so there's so many different ways that we can discover your brand's it can be kind of receiving an email with an image attached to it that you're just very intrigued by and you want to learn more we get said look books we do a lot of walking they're kind of showrooms like the big convention yeah I mean there's those and then there's like there's several showrooms in in each city that you kind of learn to trust their okay and they've curated a selection of brands for you to see social media is playing a bigger and bigger part of me and I just remember thinks I mean Instagram and a lot and you rely on influencers truly yes I mean I think one of the biggest things in terms of exposure and if I was gonna advise and young brand to spend their marketing then limited marketing budget really wisely I would suggest it's to go you know to kind of go down that social media route because you have a direct line to consumers I didn't exist yeah so yeah I'd say that's probably the fastest growing source of new brands mhm and I do a lot of I do a lot of small smaller Fashion Week's so I used to just do York London Milan Paris and now I do Copenhagen and Sydney and Seoul and this year I'm going to typically see and I want to go to Kiev and Stockholm so it's kind of and that's where you're finding a lot of interesting yes yeah and if it was like a designer or brand who doesn't have the money you know like a lot of independent design they're so small they're spending so much money on their production yeah and they don't have the money to shoot or like be in a show because Sharon's cost a lot maybe they don't have the money to like pay an average on social media what is the best way for them to be discovered by somebody like you well I mean one brand that we had we actually found because they dressed a girl in our office just you know an assistant buyer was wearing a piece and I chased her down the corridor and I was like what is that dress uh-huh and so that was Rick so London which London yeah yeah great pregnant and so that really caught my eye but it can be summarized as you know is that you like dress somebody like in your office and then you just notice it yeah and then for you do you also do the hiring at your team yes I mean it's kind of between myself we've got buying managers we have a senior but we you know we have a senior vice president buying so we always have and what's the best way to get into and work without up or take it so the first thing is to be clear on which area you want to go into you and at net sports a certainly we're at a scale where you've got to be kind of going into the area that you're interested in so because it's such a big so whether that's you want to work in buying or you want to work in editorial or you want to work in marketing do your research and figure out what kind of job you want to apply for I would say when you get to the inter I would say make sure your CV is absolutely perfect any resume sorry yes if you have any like the smallest typos in there it's a real turnoff for me why do you think about people who d mu for job or like do you prefer email I would like to try and help but sometimes it's quite difficult by social media I think it's great to try and establish a direct line and that's one thing that I'd say an interview kind of have personality you know we try and be confident I know it's the most intimidating situation especially when it's the job you really really want but try and be that person that you think yeah I want to have that girl around or I'm gonna have that guy I want to travel with that guy so personnel yeah I have a personality I think it's really easy to become shy and kind of not show who you are but if you can yeah do you think a fashion major is very important like somebody having the fashion major like steady fashion um no I don't think it's a deal breaker I think it can help even if it's just for you to understand whichever you want to go into I would say that if you're looking at something in the volume world you know kind of your analytical and mathematical skills are really important your business negotiation skills yeah so I'd like to think so yeah you've got a basic if to be in buying you've gotta have both sides yeah he created an analytical exactly like friends and like somebody was once telling me of that you need to be good at Excel and I was like really yeah hi guys for entry-level buying positions we've got to accept that for the first two years you're gonna live in a spreadsheet you're gonna spend your life working on spreadsheets and working in an office and you're not gonna be in contacts so much with product yeah until you kind of get to that fire level so assistant buyers it's very administrative thank you my last question is if you don't live in those piece cities like London Milan yeah Paris or New York yeah and still want to make it in the fashion industry what is the best way for somebody to make that moving is gonna have to be part of your plan whether it's immediately or not I mean having an internship maybe like as I start out it's like in those key cities is for anything I would say I'd say yes but I don't think the key cities are as limited as they used to be so once upon a time the key cities were you know the passion cities we all know but you know you can be in Germany and being Munich where there's a great publishing industry or you can be in the US and actually want to be in LA where there's so much going on now and new brands coming from LA all the time so I think it's about finding a good balance where it's somewhere you want to be because yeah there's so much going on in a lots of different cities yeah thank you so much thank you guys I'll put her handle below so you guys can follow her thank you very much you 
[Music] [Music] [Laughter] hey at least I didn't film here earlier we still look beautiful earlier you look like you're 12 and now I'm literally I've literally created a mess within about 10 minutes since we checked into this hotel but let me give you a quick tour I remember that lady is so design Miami district is spoiling me with some champagne that's not gonna get any years unfortunately some skincare products ooh bath soap Jonathan aller candle oh I love Jonathan Ella ooh what a Fendi bag this is going to be my very first Fendi bag sick whoa very spiky I'm about to like cut somebody and

Brazilians being this pretty but she makes the most beautiful sculpture like pieces I love her jewelry and that way see the bracelet I love you make it in Rio yes I make it I make everything in Rio Stasi did you always like fashion but I didn't think I was gonna have this type of job the newer younger studying in college or university what kind of job did you think you'd have I thought I was gonna be Andy in the devil oh really or like Boyd and Conrad from the hills but I really wanted to be more like Emily the intern you wanted to work in an editorial like magazine yeah I thought like working and I seen this like the dream created that in a bigger scale actually yeah I think we created that new age of a what a magazine is thought about what is after what happens like what magazines Bowl what happens when people start watching TV if you have known TVs and buy cable anymore we stream and they watch on their phone so grass is like always thinking about how do people yeah and content yeah and that's on our phones very goldberg yeah it's really beautiful [Music] the thing is last night ate so much that I can snip off my dress morning [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] the weird thing ever happened so we go to our hotel room when all sudden like the key thing where you just stick it in it's a different thing so they completely change the lock system that were while we were out like completely we literally first split second we thought we're at the wrong hotel like wait what back to the lobby speak was giving you key well that's so weird we're gone for three hours within those three hours they completely changed a lot like before you stuck it in now you just scan it yeah that's so weird the entire floor I feel like I'm just like and like a week I felt like no stupid I was like wait what happened you just had a huge hotel epic Bell hashtag epic fail such a passionate pool [Music] this is very intimate matches my back outfit thank you for having me in your view this is our third time going down they gave you the wrong key again it's 11 o'clock at night it's really annoying what are you gonna do if it doesn't work again sorry I worry so finally finally get into our Fatah room hallelujah so Saturday night in Miami which is our last night obvi song that's a bright idea walk to a grocery store so I could get my dessert so I had dinner I had a full-on dinner and dessert we had dessert - it was very delicious very very sugary but I'm still craving something sweet there's my last night and since I'm not partying like I normally do so in Miami during our boss I always party but this time I'm with my ask for more scheming breath I rather like hang out with my Milan skin actually this time I don't know what it is I just feel lazy to go out at night and like being a crowded spot and matter oh yeah we've been doing a lot actually also last year there was a Kendrick Lamar concert this year it's Drake he's awesome but I like I'm not down to being a crowded space for Drake I could see him in LA dilemma so people on my last like what I eat in a week slog you guys were talking about how I'm eating way too many fruits or like sugar and whatnot so I'm trying to figure out what's like the healthiest dessert I can eat at this moment was it I'm thinking banana but it's banana I do feel like I'm gaining a lot of weight my grocery run which are you bigoted Madame Rickard who I've met in New York in front of the Oscar dollar at the show okay let's do something thank you so we're just like going into this like sketchy area you think we just saw a prostitute she was working her this area kind of looks like a murder scene waiting to happen and it kind of reminds me of CSI Miami [Applause] Dunkel pool what was your favorite part about this Miami trip probably looking at the art okay looking at the art the Art Basel and Convention Center design Miami itself yeah looking at the pieces just thinking about how art is presented mm-hmm thinking about why certain are available and like the whole process of exhibiting art and like sometimes I wonder because artists are is a commodity but it's not like a necessity yeah sometimes I want her if there has to be there with World War yeah so that things like art becomes not necessary anymore yeah then I wonder about the crisis if it's worth it like some art it's like worth so much but then again it's a gold you can't eat with gold yeah so art is like a luxury huh in some way yeah modeling commodity now that I have a house I'm like really interested in getting art you know I got my first art piece that you guys saw it's like the blue like a bunch of flowers like it's a painting it's by this artist named blue his pieces are so amazing he's a artist from Texas and actually before I even knew it I realized Kendrick Lamar schoolboy q they both have his pieces and now because of me Kelly Rowland wants one I met him through my sister of course Donny knows all the coolest people and he just likes such a cool dope guy and then I asked him to do a painting for me he did that flower painting I'm upset my favorite part about this Miami trip was meeting the people that I met art was cool but I feel like this season I wasn't paying too much attention to the art because I was just like so inspired by the people I was surrounding myself with so like Stacy whom you guys done like the other clips I met her when she was that covered to our years ago she's always been such a nice person and to see her doing her own like creative agency and being so kind to all of her team like members like that was really inspirational there were three girls I met that worked what Stacy these three girls are all so lovely two of them happen to be Canadians I think there's something about Canadians why are Canadians just so nice I love Canadians anyways so just meeting them tangelo he was so cool he was the creative director of supreme or something like that product designer and now he owns a brand called awake and he created this pop-up caught social studies in Miami and what's really cool about this pop-up is that anything you buy inside the pop-up they're gonna donate to charity the proceeds go to charity like that like a t-shirt food like books whatever but the other really cool thing is like people like Virgil and like people who work at Nike and Angela like these people they're doing workshops so like to like kids and people who want to learn about this industry like especially especially the street wear industry like Angela wants to share his knowledge and teach these kids the history of t-shirts graphic design graphic tees like music how to create a business how to take an idea and create it into a business like he wants to share his knowledge because there's nothing like that so he wants to create a a workshop and that's what he's doing for free and I thought that was very very inspiring and just talking to him like made me realize like what is it that I really love doing and I love love love sharing and that's why I loved interviewing like people in the fashion industry during Fashion Week I really enjoy it I really enjoy learning about how people got to where they're at like how they became so successful what roads they took what decisions they had to make especially if they came from nothing so to me that's very inspiring I don't care the end result I'm more curious about like the process [Music] [Applause] [Music]

[Music] - lazy and walking the Dolce &amp; Gabana me I know I can't believe it I'm getting fitted for the Oscar party so many beautiful options I can't believe it and when I say that about me walking out the show the first thing he said was oh what did you immediate yourself to consider the shortage out of all demonic like geez things done this one looks like a classic dolce &amp; gabbana I feel a little too naked you guys I'm torn with a little too sexy for me listen what do I wear just finish my fittings I hope I don't get parking tickets look who's here I have a four hour layover in New York this is my second stop my first stop was San Francisco and yeah Coco came to hang out with me just like my first time going I'm along without you oh yeah that's true mmm no way I'd reply I just like the word [Music] I love my outfit so beautiful I was worried because everybody has their fitting like yesterday and the day before and my opinion today and to show it to tomorrow so it's a little worried but if it means most likely because kind of model size and that's but Nahuatl I look white out [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so the dolce gabbana show has already happened and they still can't believe that I got to walk the show oh I mean we were getting ready since 8 a.m. where was an item for in the fire and you're going to get ready for the dolce gabbana shower Omega be the show was at 2 o'clock well of course being a fashion show it started around like 230-240 and I remember what I was I don't know it's like this just happened over there those heels is it happen like a week ago because it kind of feels like a dream you know when I get so lucky and Pat tough she's going to finish my makeup with some Momus others you know long con [Music] finish my hair manga waiting on my nails and this is going to be my crown err pitch suddenly but if I remember it just we're all like there are hundred and I believe twenty of us there's so many of us waiting in mind for the show and just a whole thought of me being one of the selected people Oh Thomas - my eyebrows - see you guys eyebrows make everything a real person not a supermodel being on that stage meeting Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana it all seems like a dream I can't thank the team from Dolce and Gabanna enough because you know what they're doing is risky for such a global brand to use real people that are not model size to use so much diversity in their show when this industry is still wanting the same type of girl so I'm forever grateful to them and I feel blessed that I was really selected and I got to experience it and it was such an amazing feeling to walk on that runway I remember like my personality I don't get nervous until the minute of even if I if I had to like give like a speech in front of a bunch of people I won't get nervous until literally like the minute I'm going up on stage and then all the sudden I get anxiety going up to the devil with my 10 and I'm doing a secret prayer hoping that I don't [Music] I'm a little nervous Johnson Elias I don't get nervous until the finish and it literally melted you got about 15 seconds so it was like that up to show too like I was I didn't hit me I think I just still couldn't believe it and I felt like in a way if I was doing it I felt like maybe the show's not cool because why would they select me you know I I still don't think that I'm cool it's so weird I think it's like I was so traumatized as a child not being the popular person that I always feel like it's weird when I get selected even it's just weird like for example even when I like played sports in high school I was no matter how good I was because I was not the popular one I was always elect at last anyway I don't know what I'm talking about but I just wanted to say that I was beyond grateful to be given the opportunity to walk the dolce gabbana show and do to be able to walk the show with so many amazing people so majority of the real people that were walking worry they're celebrities kids like Pamela Anderson skidded Jamie Foxx's daughter who else Christie Brinkley's daughter her name was Taylor she was so sweet and beautiful and then it was meet ami song whose parents Bijou and kevin song are not famous they're wonderful wonderful people but you know they're not famous or rich so having somebody like super real like me coming up growing from a normal family I don't know it was great and then I remember as soon as I was done I set the videos and like photos to my dad and my mom and it was like still I think early morning and the fact I like my dog got so excited that made me so happy but yeah and also being able to walk with so many like wonderful girls like my fellow bloggers like needed Alexandra and Hellena were liked all such wonderful girls to be able to be in such great company that was amazing too because this industry Camby caddy and to have the support of really nice sweet uplifting girls that was an amazing experience for me and you know love really made me happy though was after I grab like walk the show I got so many like messages from you guys and I have to say I really apologize that I don't directly message you guys all the time

likes and thousands of comments from all of you guys and the fact that I made you guys proud was like that meant something because I felt like we did it all together and like without all of your

sure to subscribe oh yeah 
[Applause] here's another pattern I chose made in love with life because close to 50 especially since the border border with your remote and still work through my entire layout total calories I can't decide if I like this or not any I like it a lot but you know I have to love it last pot sees what is the nature this one dois yes finally have my Florian and he decided to keep it simple black and white so classic and go to the style of a house and if you remember from my first video this used to be separated so this is like kind of like that where the ladies would hang out the coat whatever and then this is like a powder room like a small murder bathroom but I felt like it was just too many groups bosses together so I open up the wall and not as one giant powder room and what I want to do it Oh frosty till again because they feel a golden graphite look so good again playing black so we get any toilet here I want to do a beautiful brass of bosses play ladies ideally atomic gold legs a valued would draft legs like that bold I feel like that will be really free but I haven't about hating in my point so I'm still a holding off on my oh my god sighing you should just get a normal cabinet but I rather way to not have anything and just buy something cheap and changes later because ends up some ways when you do you don't know where I don't if that makes sense I rather should like wait and say what my knees I don't get what I want like that the one that I really want so the idea is Helen tonight family right here and then a nice marble top clean thing and then brass hardware like brass posit okay so great and then I wanted a gold there and then like hold light I mean okay a lot of gold in here it doesn't flash your room but it's gonna be watching by clapping and Phil chic this is kind of like this creation behind now exciting the countertops in finally hi very excited are you excited as I am reflect receives beautiful gold faucets from waterworks abscess or unlocker price will eventually age a little but I think that's the beauty I wanted on back on purpose mara mirror on the wall who's the fairest of them all Marvin good job that's a good job good right yes the height is okay we just have to make sure this is David so this is the final powder room so basically I use the leftover marble from the master bathroom and then I kept things fairly simple with white and black since I have a lot of brass accents going on oh and then check out the toilet isn't it super fancy the kitchen is waiting on the appliances Jana I spend all my money on the cabinets and the construction and actually I have under budget no matter like even though everything Lee plays really pricey I wonder what your because I that contractor I didn't realize how expensive appliances were I just really thought with for like $2,000 I can get all the appliances but reality tech before I wasn't in care I can be a kitchen about from designer but I've never bought the appliances myself I would just design the kitchen cabinet and all the finishes and then decline [Music] angry people in this neighborhood so I never had any experience buying any appliances to be honest actually I saved a lot of money in the kitchen because I actually went with IKEA cabinet so the intent of the cabinets are idea but the outside this is real wood and especially for somebody who doesn't cook so much and I travel a lot and I rather spend more money in the bathrooms that I do every single day event while the kids in the kitchen but I just wanted to think that was functional a something that will last and then something that will look nice but still be affordable and then I turned to idea because ideas kitchens are known to be like affordable at night and functional that's why I wanna thank you campus with insights are a.cian campus and then the outside I found a company and a sadena cup semi handmade and I believe they do ship overseas or like out of state maybe not overseas but they do ship out of state so what you can do is if you don't like the typical IKEA cabinet doors then you can custom make your own cabinet doors through this company so that's why they're called semi hami because it's like all happening but it's like semi custom because you have very and then everything outside is custom so this one has been really wonderful to work with the only thing I'm missing and it's not their fault it's only chosen later on we decide to switch things up so in the beginning pastor refrigerators here a giant retreated here that was 36 inches and just being - we're going to be pantries so when I have to win out of the cabinets that's exactly when I specify but when the cabinet I was installing them were pets the soup and she's here effort and he left this for the refrigerator space I looked at it and I realized I didn't have enough counter so the premise to just get rid of the other pantry because it I don't really need it refrigerator here so that like all the space which is open and airy so I'm just waiting on my refrigerator I'm the only dilemma I have right now is that list from here to back side of the wall the outside of the pantry is exactly 3 foot which is an average 36 inch refrigerated what I don't like about having it being 3 but is I felt like it's just going to be too bulky things over there this is 32 inches so this actual can turn 30 inches I'm just I'm wondering if I go with a 36 inch refrigerator and just replace this cavity because I think it'll be actually cheaper the only thing is I got all the cost of me I could reuse this part I wonder if I could like I would have to get new doors I have to go check online see if they have something that like maybe 24 inches I will go to the 30 inch but I don't think they do my voyage because right now it's a 30 inch covered it with two doors 20 interesting below too small for two doors but maybe they have like a 15 like that just has one more and I won't really need a two towards thing I won't get back to you guys i'ma go check on IKEA we're trying to figure out where to put the hinges boy Nicholas is going to explain to you why the hinges should be on the left side it is all you open like this and you have the wrong hole here huh I think it makes sense [Laughter] apparently somebody came like that that's all you got and then like I think it's nicer to display my shoes here you know do you think as opposed to like [Laughter] the plumber and saw my brand-new faucet and you guys know anything different so why is my handle here supposed to be up the right side or the left side if you're lucky but I just love how he just arbitrarily determined to put this right here okay here's the kitchen progress so far it's pretty much done but I'm missing just a few pieces like the doorknobs for all the cabinets so basically I wanted to not do any wall cabinets because I like that open airy feel of the kitchen and plus I already have so many cabinets that I didn't feel the need to put in wall cabinets but instead I put in a marble shelf but I love how it turned out I mean it's just so beautiful and it just looks so clean you know I could store all of my shoes in the cabinets just kidding oh and then I decided to go with KitchenAid appliances because okay don't laugh I fell in love with the handles on the refrigerator I just really like how sleek and minimally looked and yet still like very sturdy and strong over I'm really excited to you know finish this kitchen up I'm going to get new barstools and whatnot so make sure to keep on tuning in and don't forget to subscribe bye 
I'm so excited to see the difference all my faith after I finish this like one week full of facial masks mmm Center Friday night TGIF hey guys it's on me and for this video I challenge myself to do a face mask as day so some suction back from Korea I mean I've been obsessed with skincare like to the next level when I see people with really nice skin I always ask them what do you do to your skin and numerous people to a week but they do a face mask a day or they try to so I just fight ahead note since I'm a face mask quarter and a beauty junkie especially can't I come back from South Korea I decided to do a face mask a day so basically that means whatever basket is whether it's like a hydrogel mask or a con sheet mask I just no matter how tired I am you just put a face mask every single night you guys will see of this video how much my skin transforms so I should watch it okay so which mask should i do today think I'm going to go with this one but I got from Korea it's from Medi hill and it's called the mms a query Apple mask Rex it's supposed to be moisturizing and doesn't have any parabens and here it says true dome kiss on which means I'm good for your wrinkles anti-wrinkle probably needs I come in zone or me put Kim tell Nene Baek means like white B so when Koreans say whitening it's not like making her face wait but what they really mean is they want to brighten your face it's not like you want to just have a lighter skin till where you just want to have a brighter skin tool so your skin to the lids go so this is what I'm going to use here so this masks are has like a subtle scent inside the mask so for somebody like me who has really sensitive skin I prefer masks with them or any kind of a products with no scent but even though my skin is very sensitive I don't feel any sensitivity or irritation against this mask and it's really hydrating so far so I mean only time will tell but so where I really really like it okay today's mask is from a brand called I woke up like this because I felt like I've been in the Sun today I went to the pool so I needed a whitening mask and again whitening doesn't mean that it's going to turn my face white or pale it's more about like a brightening up side and I use the same brand sunscreen that then you this is actually my second bottle half proof see so in this mask they have vitamin C ginger powder I think which is pearl powder and nos and AM eyes nice and a mind which is which gives you the brightening effect this is what I look like oh my gosh I look super scary mm-hmm damn I look freaky as hell I think especially because it like literally p√∫blicas my hair too but I think I look like saw today I'm going to try two different maps my skin is a little bit sensitive because I've been a little stressed and yesterday I was like out of the Sun I got like an eczema inflammation like on my forehead so so I'm going to do something that's a little bit more calming apparently the so the ice try these two masks before once before and I shared it on my Instagram stories and there's gold in it and apparently have anti-inflammatory effects okay so what's cool about this mask is that you can kind of like customize your mass so instead of just using one full-on sheet mask these two different one so this one's that ones that I'm going to use for my forehead and my eyes is called lines begone rose-gold mask and it's anti-aging and lifting which I want and then this one for my bottom half of my face is soothe and purify so it's calming and common detox so this is what I look like with the mask on so the top part is the rose gold mask and then the bottom part is the black gold mask Susan purified the interesting thing about this mask is the site they feel different one side is really smooth and soft and then the other side there's some kind of texture but the thing is I don't know which side I'm supposed to put on my skin out first I put the smooth side on my skin and the mask fell off so now I kind of like the rough side on the skin but it it's like it's not scratching because it's like not really rough there's just like a little bit of the texture but it's not super pleasant I'm going to try to flip it again okay I like these have a mass more like I don't know what this is called it's not a cotton sheet mask oh because they're called a hydrogel mask and I do prefer hydrogel last more than sheet now because I just feel like it's much more hydrating and I really actually feel like the ingredients are being absurd into my skin by the way when you're using a cotton sheet mask make sure you don't go over like the 20 minutes or whatever it's time they suggest true story I don't put it over and I think in the longer I put it on my face it's better but apparently in cotton sheet mask if you put it on to your face too long once everything has been absorbed into your skin they actually absorb all your nutrients or the moisture back into that sheet mass so that's why you're not supposed to leave it on more than what they suggested so I mean usually it's a 10 to 20 minutes this one is 10 to 20 minutes I always like watch TV or answer emails or edit my Instagram photos and time flies by time goes by and next thing I know I had it for like 32 minutes 35 mins oh by the way you know what happened today I was working out with my trainer finally his name is Patrick at body would Patrick and then he was saying that my shoulders are very stiff and there's like some kind of blood cop around like like my shoulders and that's why I like I'm always kind you know my shoulders concave like Edwards so he was scraping my shoulders like my armpit so the most painful thing ever he said you're supposed to do it for like 10-15 minutes I lasted five minutes when we see the lotion on me like right around my armpits I was like so ticklish because I'm like the most ticklish person ever work but anyways Lydia's putting lotioning of transcript me in the beginning and it tickled so bad and then eventually it started hurting really bad so you want to see what happened it's kind of gross warming it's really gross look see that I'm all bruised up here too and it hurts I feel it I feel like somebody punched me really hard or like I was hanging on something for a very long time okay I'm gonna go watch masters none right back for C to learn for my next face mask so today I'm going to try the college in velvet mask and you know I kind of have like this XML rash on my neck and you know a lot of times we forget our neck so I want to do the one on my face and then one just for my neck turns out this Collins elven mask comes with a neck mask which is nice the brand is called it's in Korean artists own which means beautiful and it's so long stay collagen velvet mask and its really good for soothing I think it's just cooking in Korean and I think that they're referring to soothing and this sheet is apparently according to them very soft just like velvet and softens the tone of your skin or the texture of your skin also just coming up con tiny oh pill bottle or glue gun we're almost people in a little bit so which means it's really good for lifting and gives you less elasticity and very also soothing yoga I don't know what I don't know my Balu house I don't know what ooh sizzling yokai means Oh sue I don't know what the name is soothing I think they're talking about sue name who is peeling so the thing about my neck is so I've mentioned this numerous times before I have eczema and whenever I get like super stressed or eat really bad I have a habit or like I get eczema flare-ups like on my neck and also on my forehead so like my neck is very sensitive and I just felt like I needed to do something for my neck because I'm really afraid that I'm going to come with a big green neck because a lot of times my neck is really dry and then whenever it's drew Ryan looks like a homeless bunch of wrinkles when it's war sure eyes fine but so that's why I'm doing a mask here on my neck and then also on my face I'm so excited to see the difference on my face after I finished this like one week full of facial mask so yesterday last night number I did that soothing favorite so I woke up this morning and my skin feels much better like remember like I have to piss me off there my forehead like right neck I feel oily skin feels better like the witness is gone I think pretty much fun so I'm going to do another shooting ass today it's going to be the one called calendula soothing reliefs mask and it's supposed to calm your skin and even skin texture is the hundr percent organic cotton sheet mask it's a 15-minute instant relief with camp calendula and elder not sure what calendula is I'm going to research that I'll let you guys know but I know aloe vera is really good for soothing to the skin or coming the skin so sometimes when I have like really bad eczema flare-ups I used aloe vera and right now I have nothing on my skin other than this morning I just used all what my face was by her mom and sk2 essence of this by the way this video is not sponsored I'm just giving myself a challenge if I could do a thing every day and right now is about 10 a.m. not starving which is an interesting thing about this month how does like you I think you can cover your eyes if you want to but if I cover my eyes I wouldn't be able to see anything or do anything would i I'm so hungry I start early this one feels really good always good there's no tingly feeling being that doesn't bother my sensitive skin at all okay I'm going to read this to you it's a 100% organic cotton mask that 76.5% calendula extract helps to calm the skin stimulated by strong sun rays while olive leaf fermented extracts and the fire deparment it extra delicious dry skin and it's sue for sensitive skin okay I mean you can set off like 15 minutes I think I'm just going to cook something maybe I'll make kimchi fried rice start making right are you pretty sure the dick I prefer like it you look so pretty so I'm using the character masks from the faceshop lines hydrating and Tyler is using the kabuki mask is amazing you actually like somehow look good yeah it's cute it for you it was made for you sir we should call this a Jared mask yours is falling off can you go like weird hmmm Center Friday night TGIF mm-hmm I think I like the most ridiculous No do you think you'll do this again will this be your habit Oh Jared you - do you think you'll do a face mask oh my digits a smile sometimes just not often because they take a lot of work this is a skit on June 3 should the only room it has a more good space do you want to be on Army's YouTube yeah I wanted to freaking you're on I'm back today I'm going to try dr. jart water replenishment cotton sheet mask and it's good for redness and dryness which I both have [Music] hi guys today i am at Calamigos ranch because it's my baby's birthday anyway so today's mask I think I'm going to do something slightly different today so I'm probably going to start with one of these masks today first and then do a look mask I've never done this before but I've seen so many good reviews and heard so many great things about this mask from k and CBD so I'm going to give it a try but first I'll start with a face mask I always like anything that's like moisturizing so I'm going to do the juice cleanse mask that's the more sure recipe with honeypot squeeze and what's the difference I mean okay these are the differences so in this master suite celery kohlrabi a note that it is pear avocado yeah the vit b5 for a vitamin b5 is easy and this one which is for anti-wrinkle there's raspberry lentil acai berry blackberry blueberry and vitamin A so I'm definitely going to go with the green one that has avocado which is much more moisturizing so out of all the masks that I've tried I think this is my least favorite because my skin I mean I'm sure it is really sensitive I'm very very sensitive skin and I've seen some Sun so maybe it's a little bit more sensitive today but I don't know it feels it feels sensitive with this mask on anyways I'll just leave it on for like ten minutes and see how it goes oh so freaky imagine like you opened the door and then like it's me answering the door hello welcome yours is raspberry lentil acai berry blackberry blueberry vitamin A so a bunch of berries very sweet you don't feel any sensitivity Myskina club thus good you're so lucky so I mean now it feels it doesn't feel bad anymore in the beginning like right around my forehead and I think it's because I also saw some Sun today at the pool there's a little sensitive but overall I think that I wanted always oh oh I have a complainer bald and laughs except this side as you're sure - sure unhearable with members was cool it up maybe your forehead is big in your chin is short like all the way love that yeah you're right maybe we just have like no one - right because with the my eyes yeah with your eyes are small okay so I'm going to do that lip mask so this can see beauty lip mask but you see there's freaky would like look at her oh so freaky okay so this can see beauty mask my sister's tried it and a few of my friends tried it but it basically conditions your lips moisturizes plumps and hydrates without any artificial dyes or fragrances and it hasn't been animal test it which is really nice I think it's naturally plumps my lips and moisturizes and hydrates it so let's try it so what I learned from doing a face mask a day is that like my skin I really did see a difference in my skin I feel like my skin seemed more hydrated than usual I have really really dry sensitive eczema skin and usually towards the end of the day which is right now like right now is like 11 p.m. easy it's almost 11 p.m. so usually towards this time of the day my skin is extremely dry extremely dull makeup doesn't stay on well I mean right now I don't really have makeup on them I have my system wash razor from this morning like this morning meaning like 8:00 a.m. my brows from this morning and that's it but I feel like my skin feels really good and since probably like two days ago people have been noticing the difference in my skin like I see my skin every single day so I don't really notice it so much except that I know that my Slayer up top like the redness invasion has disappeared a little but like yesterday and day before like my best friend and Nicholas they're both Beneatha and in goes really well your skin looks really good and I think it's inspiring them to start using space masks will I do it again will I after this challenge will I continue to do a face mask a day I'm sure it's good it's a lot of work and then it's not a lot of work but it just I don't know it's it was more work maybe it's because I'm I filming and I'm like trying to share it with you guys I honestly don't think I'll do it every single day but I'm going to try to do it as much as I can like maybe three or four times a week or cover letter and remember but I do definitely see a benefit in my skin the texture of my skin the redness firmness I don't know about wrinkles because I think one week the face mask isn't help the wrinkles but yes I hope you guys enjoyed this video if you liked it please give me a thumbs up if you didn't like it so give me a thumbs up don't be stingy

good morning my travel is fashion week officially really starts today because I'm actually doing shows today kind of minor drama my self portrait skirt hasn't come yet and it's 9:20 shows that tent I mean other than me not being ready yet so necklace is helping me track the self-portrait skirt oh by the way if you're wondering what that is I I have just called a little bit about the skirt I mean I don't know what's the bigger problem the sphere not being here or I'm just started doing my makeup at 9:20 when we have to leave in 10 minutes you trying on outfits right before cuz I'm not gonna have time to come back like a button I'm thinking about going with a an all Burgundy that's cool right really no damn you your lot legs look like 10 feet tall [Music] Hanyu killed the show self-portrait he makes high-fashion accessible and wearable what I really really liked which i think is going to make a huge huge comeback is that I want to say like that Chinese fabric like the silky chinese-inspired like embroidered pieces [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] good bet it's not an elevator our super for escalators way more although we have to walk up I got to stare at Camila at the entire it's like a punching bag and if you're smart this is what you do [Music] I mean like as fashion people we don't like to use our brains to leave issues completely we don't wear hats Jonas oh no oh this is what I'm stuck in with my outfit today no so you're gonna well if I'm changing wait let me see my gosh I look like a North Korean like we're bringing a lot of food my friend has dietary restrictions as in has to be gluten-free vegetarian and organic so what did you guys think about tippy Tim it was really cool again 90s like all the black and white blazers like minimal looks I mean that's what TV is really good at minimal but like statement looks plaid and houndstooth check her it's still in still really in my favorite definitely the shoes and the statement earring like they're so good with accessories I thought the belts yeah well what happened the spring color is purple really purple yellow the yellow shoes aren't see on all the models we're like running down the runway and that kind of reminded me of like back in the day when like 90 supermodels they would just have so much fun [Music] [Music] last night at the party remember you were freaking out and then the irony of it basically what happened is this woman died now had worked for like literally like locked us in the basement until we cleaned it and they cleaned all the mold and like dust and I knew that it was wrong and basically I ended up leaving right after I was done doing my step-and-repeat which was like where the Photowall is um she goes like holy I see my old boss she locked me up in the basement I was like what and then like the crazy part is that woman is somebody that I know like I'm not good friends with her I just met her a few times she say hey I'm back designer and won't say no but she's a handbag designer and she's try to like semi bags many many times and then she comes up to me and she's like so friendly eyes like ah me and then Erika's like calm me down sailing but I was like hi this is my team and I was like Sofia Erika and then what did she say she's so nice yeah I saw her face change as soon as she saw Erika yeah she didn't like no Erika and she was so nice to me and saying like yeah you should come by our stores I say yeah tell my team be a dress always be nice to people it doesn't matter if you're like the president or whatever don't lock people up in the basement that's a legal woman finally I get to see you alright I'm what I saw come on start Manny how was your day it's good I wonder sorry the room is a bit of a mess I don't know what happened I came in and look like this it wasn't me very good no baby well you're on and I fix it because I'm very good organized yeah I'm so happy you're here so you can clean my room the thing that used mention what the video ah the thing that I mentioned was my viewers and my friends from all around the world yeah they wanted me to do a boyfriend tag but I'm not really like familiar with what a boyfriend tag is I don't really vlog but it's all about I have to ask Sofia right it's all about like you I think like me asking you questions or something I don't know exactly what it is or they want me to do like they want you to do my makeup but you know what Sophia sighs she thinks you'll do a really good job for some reason well I'm not really sure about it and then Sophia was like or somebody was like oh what if he styles you for an event and I'm like yeah he's gonna do an amazing job yeah I'm like that yeah couple works in fashion oh by the way people are wondering yeah so bunch of my readers were wondering what do you do for a living alcohol I take photos and I consult for fashion brands that's what I do but he doesn't take my outfit photos only when we travel we travel I do yeah but like he's fun he's not like he doesn't follow me around and take my outfit photos not that there's anything wrong with it like he has his own job he doesn't work for me unfortunately I'm a busy man yeah the other thing is so yeah Kapoor lives in New York but we don't get to spend much time together this season because he's working every single day on a shoot different shoots were so busy baby I know you're so tall my arms are like literally like going like this how tall are you opposed 187 which is six fine P okay six foot three I'm five or a six and a half okay okay we're gonna have some quality time see you guys later I'm gonna go to an event tonight together no this is red tie I think it's beautiful okay should I try it sure it's nice it's just not super yeah cuz of the fabric oh yeah option two it's a little too tight but I think I like this one it's a black tie that's nice it's really nice the shoulders are really cool because what I look like in person and in photos is always different and then I could just like see it I love the way this was I'm not sure about the pattern I think I like this okay I don't know what do you think it's nice it's got a cold the shoulders are a little bit like in your face okay baby [Music] you 
hi guys bun Joe actually bonsoir because it's late at night it's ami from Simon style and in today's video I wanted to answer most of your New York Fashion Week or fashion week questions on my last video I asked you guys if you guys have any questions regarding fashion week and in today's video I wanted to answer all of your Fashion Week questions so make sure to watch and see if I answer your question and if I have it make sure to leave a comment below and I'll try to answer all of them I've been very fortunate enough to build a really great close relationship with some of the designers so it's out of respect I like where their clothes to the show's whoever the designer is it's always base and like respectable to wear their pieces you don't have to nobody's forcing you to but if you have the opportunity to yeah obviously you have to have some kind of a connection or a relationship with the brand how I get invited is I have these different brands or the PR companies who send me an email and they send me the invitation so I'm I guess I'm in a luckier position where I could say yes and no to a lot of the brand's my very first fashion show was Betsey Johnson I was sitting like six row and I didn't get invited to it I had a friend a blogger friend her name was Liz so her boss got invited and her boss had like two tickets so we're both sitting six row and I got so excited like Betsey Johnson like came down the runway she was doing cartwheels and I've always like admired Betsey Johnson she doesn't do shows anymore but I really admired her who she was so it was a really cool first experience if you're a fashion blogger and you haven't done Fashion Week before but you want to go to a show a lot of times they like when New York Fashion Week or like Paris Fashion Week when they have the schedule out like Google is Google is gonna be your best friend see what the schedule is and then sometimes a lot of times they have like the press email I suggest you emailing whoever the contact is right who you are and asked if you could attend the show [Music] changing usually happens in the car unless I have a lot of time so this season I'm so lucky to be working with Volvo which is one of my favorite car brands and I'm in the xc90 you guys saw me on Instagram and on my insta stories I've been driving this car around has the best sound system honestly that's the only reason I really wanted this car but that's the main reason cuz honestly a car is a car it goes it takes you from one place to the other thankfully I have a lot of space a lot of trunk space too so I'm going to be doing a lot of changing in the car but I'm gonna try to like limit myself to three outfits max a day there were times when I did like four or five outfit changes that was a little ridiculous if you're still in school and you want to you know get your foot into the fashion industry I highly suggest interning somewhere when I was studying interior architecture I interned at an architecture firm for free didn't get paid so I had to have a side job I was working a lot and you know good things only come to those who hustle I interned for an entire year without any pay but it was the most valuable lesson I've ever learned in my entire life I learned way more than I did going to school and I was so much ahead being an intern and starting from the bottom or somewhere is always good so if you live in New York City I think the best place you could intern ad would be like the fashion show venues like milk Studios has shows or like back in the day Lincoln Center that you would you could intern there or like mercedes-benz Fashion Week just email them email your resume always have a good cover letter now that I think about it so there's Sophia in my team the one who missed her flight the reason I hired her is Sophia emailed me like and she wrote a personable letter like an email like a random you know she emailed me I wasn't looking for anybody but she emailed me and she reached out to me and I get these emails a lot but her email just stood out because it was very personal boy and I couldn't tell that she was like eager to work with me and it was one of the best decisions I've ever made so and even with like Nikolas - so you guys already know the story behind how Nikolas and I started working together if you don't know I'll link the video like up here somewhere so you guys can hear about it after parties not every single designer doesn't have to party for like Alexander Wang always does like an amazing crazy after-party which is like a festival but nobody really talks about this show which is party and hang out during the show I always talk about the show well I'm either like oh my god so good like that off it's amazing or like we're like looking at each other like definitely not gonna be posting about that I get so much inspiration this is why I go to show after show after show especially for me being an interior designer I get so many color inspiration but being a fashion lover I get so much inspiration okay good example Christian do your fall winter 2017 if you look at Zara right now it's a complete knockoff of the entire Dior show that money I cannot see yeah she did like next-level knock-up how can you knock something off like that much the Hat the entire color scheme the blue blue was like it was like all about blue right and the velvet like everything the denim it's a complete knockoff but I guess I guess when you can't come up with something you got to knock it off like I'm a little bit mad about that at Zara the best way I can describe it to somebody who's never been to a fashion show is that it feels very much like a concert because we're all there to see like somebody you know just like really fast-paced it's hectic for the ones who are running the show I think it's very stressful for me as a show goer the only thing that stresses me out honestly is trying to get there on time it's always like in a rush like you get there you sit down like oh we made it you find your seat and the link you sit there and it's just like okay no like we're gonna wait for the show to start try to be on time unless you're Anna Wintour but Anna Wintour is always on time so there you have it always be on time don't be that person who's like late to a show the show has clothes and knocking on that door saying I need to be here it kind of feels like a high school reunion or like the first day of high school when you're like getting back to school and then you're like seeing all your friends after vacation I actually talked about this on snapchat and a lot of times it kind of feels like Mean Girls so one season I go to the shows and I was sitting front row and my name was clearly like their ami song and there's this one blogger who like I'm not like super friendly with but I don't have any beef with her and she was just like very rude to me like didn't really acknowledge me like fine cuz I'm like the type of person that says hi to everybody like especially if I'm sitting next to you I'm gonna say hi even if I don't know you cuz it's awkward pretending like they don't exist when you could have just easily said hi and it's the Energy's just better that way but anyways it was her and her best friend and like her other best friend like three bloggers the girl was like let's take a selfie and then she'd like dummies like not you and then the three of them took a selfie and then like they were talking amongst themselves so they're like you can't sit with us and then they posted that selfie and the hashtag was you can't sit with us and like I got really offended you know and I got really hurt because I felt like that was really petty so photographer usually comes by right and tries to take photos of the people on the front row and then he comes and he's like okay you guys like let's take a photo of the front row and and if you google that photo I am NOT gonna pull this up because I don't wanna name anybody but in the photo you can see like they're like all hugging each other I'm in the corner trying not to get into the photo but the photographer too so it's just like me like it looks like I'm photoshopped into that group photo in a way it felt like being bullied again in high school and it brought memories so like I don't like the whole thing about like hashtag you can't sit with us like why can't you like in my world you can always sit with me my favorite part about Fashion Week is really seeing the shows and seeing like the designers creations and the seeing the designers grow so much like for an example self-portrait Han from self-portrait like he grew so much season after season and I remember his very first show which was a presentation and I was like so happy for him and then it became an actual fashion show and last season it was a legit fashion show and then this season it's also another like see dat fashion show not a presentation so the difference between a presentation and a fashion show its presentation is like the models are just standing and then nobody is seated you just go through as if you're going through an art gallery that's like the best way I can describe it like a museum where as an actual fashion show is where you're seated or you're standing and like the models walk down the runway so Honda came from doing a presentation to a fashion show and like all of you guys probably now know whose self-portrait is right like the brand everybody knows about the brand and just those are like my favorite moments like seeing young designers establish themselves or designers make a statement like probably wrong last season he had models of different sizes different ethnic backgrounds different body types come down the runway and that was amazing and then at the end of the finale he had these t-shirts with like political messages and I don't know if you remember from my last Fashion Week like outfits but a bunch of bloggers girls and I am boy blogger boy and we got together and we wore like those political t-shirts to make a statement because we knew we were going to get street-style snapped so we wanted to use that platform to make a statement saying like hatred doesn't belong in fashion right now my staple items definitely would be a blazer I'm like super into Blazers whether that's this Tibbie blazer I just bought a pink blazer from matches fashion calm the night before I left for New York I was like I actually don't have any outfits like online shop I just fell in love with the color from MSUM Blazers are just so easy to wear boots some kind of boots whether it's like this knee-high like Dior boots I also have like these brand-spanking-new Jimmy Choo boots that are like burgundy oh they're so beautiful and sexy I can't wait to wear them and then what's my other staple hats I am obsessed with hats I think it's the new haircut I'm obsessed with the Dior hat from last season or two seasons ago fall winter 2017 do our hats are so major they're so beautiful I think it's cute with the boots yeah you're hiding it from me I was not any kind of hat I am obsessed I am a really great an efficient Packer I roll everything my luggage might be small but it's like 80 pounds no drove it's so heavy I Love New York but Paris honestly Paris is magical even the shows like think about Chanel when they do a fashion show they freaking built a mini Eiffel Tower when Dewar does a show it's like a legit like whole lot full non-production not to say New York shows aren't that but just Paris is like on a whole nother level the entire world is watching Paris [Music] constantly eating sometimes it's hard to like just sit down and eat an actual meal but I think my date evolves around food and that's what I look forward to the most starts with avocado and salmon like a full avocado like one whole avocado is salmon olive oil and then blueberries and banana I'm just trying to think what I ate this morning but usually it's an avocado chosen when I'm staying at eleven Howard cuz they literally have one of the best avocado toast throughout the day I always have some kind of juicer smoothie and then usually I snack a lot I always buy a bag of chips but I stopped eating a bag of chips right now I see like my chocolate like snacks and like these random healthy snacks that I bought they're healthy or they're not healthy the ingredient is organic unsweetened coconut organic agave organic cacao organic coconut sugar organic vanilla extract that's gluten free and Himalayan pink salt so it's healthier like compared to like most chips that I eat you should last season I was in like this this is me after whole 30 I'm like trying to be healthier [Music] so if it's just like a press sample as in like it already walked on the runway but they're not out in production yet so like those type of pieces when I get to borrow those clothes I always have to give it back because it's a press sample and somebody has to use it and then sometimes like there have been occasions where I get to keep those press samples because they don't need it anymore but a lot of times I have to give it back and then also if I'm not borrowing the press samples I do get to keep some of the clothes recently like yesterday I did go to like one of my favorite denim stores called frame and then I got to shop and pick out some denim you know because I'm a California girl I loved I know I'm a denim girl so I got to pick out some denim and I get to keep those I barely sleep last night and slept like three hours the night before I slept zero hours because I was talking up until 4:00 a.m. and I got into over at 4:30 so I didn't sleep I was on the plane with a bunch of Real Housewives from Beverly Hills they would not let me sleep because they were talking so much is it brands who pays for the flights of different cities during Fashion Week so if I have a project and I'm working with the brand then don't usually play me out or like this season I flew myself out because I knew I was gonna go to Fashion Week so I just booked the tickets way beforehand but I'm also gonna be working on a few different things for like Paris Fashion Week it's the same thing like sometimes like I'll be working with the brand so like the brand will exclusively fly me out but sometimes I fly myself out because I don't want to have the obligation to the brand because sometimes they don't want you attending other shows because they flew you out specifically for their show so sometimes I just find myself proud it's like an investment [Music] it's all about like emailing them and writing our personal what email and don't send the mass email don't send like copy and paste copy and paste people can see right through that don't copy and paste and also like you have to start somewhere let's not forget that I didn't get invited to my first fashion show and I got lucky that I got to attend the show and I sat sixth row yet I was so excited about it it wasn't all about oh I went to a fashion show that wasn't what excited me it was like going to concert and seeing it seeing the clothes walk on the rug like supermodels seeing Betsey Johnson see the music lights all that exciting me so much that I wanted to like go to different shows that our designers that I am Meijer like I'm not gonna go to a show just because it's a fashion show my time is valuable so is your time so go to shows I really really excite you super super super important be a good person be a nice person I've been doing fashion shows and I've been in this industry for like nine years I started my blog nine years ago so like the people that were interns like seven years ago six years ago now they're like assistant directors are like PR directors at big companies and they remember everything like you may forget what people said to you but you'll never forget how somebody made you feel don't feel entitled always be humble like work really hard you always have to remember how lucky if you get to go to a show that you've always wanted to go you have to remember how lucky you are to be going to that show cuz people so many people would die to be in that place maybe email them and say thank you for inviting me like how do you build a relationship say thank you like thank you so much for inviting me to the show like and let's say you blog about it you went to a show and you took some amazing photos on Instagram or blog and you did a report or like a fashion show review that's completely different from other people when you went out of their way to do something because you felt so inspired by the show maybe you couldn't email the press department or something and say hey by the way thank you so much for inviting me to the Shoei I did a blog post or I did this like so that they're aware and how would I feel like let's say I got invited to a fashion show and then somebody wrote a beautiful story about my collection I think I'll remember that didn't want to invite that person again or want to work with them in the future on my period day three and how do I style myself I try not to wear white it's tough being a girl do you know how hard it is to find a bathroom that's clean enough like when you're going through a period and there's no bathroom like oh I try to wear clothes that I know like if something's gonna happen like hopefully not god forbid don't like nothing happened but I just try to avoid wearing weight during my period cover my foot but it'd just be well prepared like this morning thank goodness I had Sophia like I realize as I was leaving in a rush I realized I only packed one tampon and it's not that one tampon kind of day and I had to like text Sophia from my team I was like Sophia I need you to hurry up and get me a tampon like can you buy me like a book of tampons like she came to my rescue like if it wasn't for her it would have been bad if you guys see my Paris video you know I was like suffering and emotionally not well and a lot of it had to do with like just seeing other people and everybody just looks so happy and beautiful and like I just didn't feel happy like I looked up people and everybody smiling and I felt so broke inside and it's because I was just going through a lot of things and hmm it's I think it's totally fine to feel sad but like how I grew up Jordan it's not okay to be sad like it when you're feeling sad you don't want to feel sad you always just want to feel better about yourself so like my personality is a type where I try not to stay sad and I'm like why am I feeling sad why am I feeling like I shouldn't be feeling this way and I always try to like suppress that and try to feel happy and I think that really took a toll on me but like now I didn't like much better it's hard to like not compare yourself like I want to say don't compare yourself beer like be confident you know like do you but I know it's really hard especially with like social media and everything is a comparison you know I'm reading this really good book that you guys should read called a subtle art of not giving a it's an amazing book I highly recommend it to everybody what makes other people happy might not necessarily make you happy everybody's happiness is different so just try to like focus on what makes you happy don't think about what everybody else is doing cuz honestly who gives a  you know you don't know what people are going through they might look like they're perfect and happy but everybody is going through things I used to compare myself so hard I used to be like oh everybody's gonna be dressed like this everybody's going to the show why am I not going I need to dress really well well who cares you know we're gone your inner happiness so I just stopped giving a and when you stop giving a  you can really focus on yourself and not compare yourself with other people a lot of things are like superficial and surface-level try to like punch through that and just go with your heart you know don't obsess over light stone obsess over taking the best photo those are all like surface things so just try to remember that my sister always says when I'm surrounded by beautiful girls and I'm like everybody's so beautiful I'm not I'm only like five foot six and a half like I'm this short is I'm Asian I like different Donny's like at least you have a great personality so I just always remember that that I have a great personality it's fine thank you guys so much for watching and so this week this season I'm doing something different where I'm trying to vlog every single day so I have my entire team here in New York so I'm like really excited to tell you guys that we're gonna try to vlog every single day so we're gonna work day and night my team they're really gonna have to like stay up pretty late and help me edit the video and like so we're gonna just be doing that by the way though I think that was Jackie boy was keen he's still alive and we're still dating for those who are asking he just lives in New York for those who don't know we have a long distance relationship surprise what you want to sit here I'm gonna try to vlog every single day and I thought like how can I make it interesting and exciting so like that's why I wanted to answer all these questions the reason I wanted to answer like as many questions is because I feel like there isn't a place where you can like google it or girls and women in general we always say like we want to support each other but in the fashion industry people are just sort of secretive and they don't want to share their trade secrets or whatnot but I don't want to be like I don't want to be that person I have a younger sister and I have like a lot of good friends who I always turn to and ask advice so like I wanted to be that person for you guys which is why I'm creating this video and trying to answer as many questions as I can regarding fashion week but if you guys have any other questions please leave a comment below and I'll try to answer them I think I answered most of your guys's questions if you guys can help me out on like any cool vlog ideas if there's something that you really want to see during Fashion Week thought maybe I haven't touched based on or like I haven't shared with you guys don't hesitate like leave a comment and I'll try to keep that in mind and make a video about it I was also thinking like maybe I could do like some kind of challenge whether it's like just go up to like a certain designer and ask them certain questions you know nothing rude and offensive but if you guys have any ideas help me out you know we're a whole community so just leave a comment below and I'll all I'll do them thank you bye you 
Shh no everything pull-ups your foot pull okay Bienvenue welcome back - a while just so kumusta need that I think that's how I say it and curry it well I said like thank you for coming back anyways welcome back to style by number my newest series on song of style and in today's episode I'm going to show you guys how to style a white t-shirt one of the requests I got the most from you guys from the previous videos was how do I dress up a white t-shirt without looking too casual to dress down as you can see I'm a big fan of t-shirts when I find a uniform for busy days like t-shirt and jeans or like a white dress shirt and jeans then I tend to accumulate the same or different variations of the same look so for an example I don't just have one white t-shirt I have like several I mean I kind of have a problem as you can see I have like so many different variations of white t-shirts because not all white t-shirts were created equal you have the cool White's like that has like the greyish bluish white tint and you have the warm white there are a lot of different white t-shirts and there are also so many different necklines like the crewneck that I'm wearing there's a v-neck scoop neck boat neck eunuch you name it so in today's episode I'm going to show you guys so many different ways to wear a white t-shirt but one of the questions that I get asked the most is how do you wear a white t-shirt without looking too fussy or too casual or to dress down how do you make it appropriate for work how do you dress up a white t-shirt so that's exactly what I'm going to show you this first t-shirt is actually from two songs and it actually never went into production but now that I'm looking at it I should just go into production the thing about white t-shirts for me is I always like something that's two things one slightly boxy and not too tight and it has to hit me on the right spot and what I like about this t-shirt is that it has two different lengths so two different hems so it has a little slit which makes it super easy to tuck in so for my first look I'm pairing my Toussaint's t-shirt with my everyday J Brand Jeans but how do you make this more work appropriate and how do you adjust this lookup so the easiest way to do that is by throwing on a blazer so I'm wearing my oversize Timmy checkered blazer checkered plan and houndstooth these are all the patterns that's super hot right now for a fall you've seen it on the runways over and over and over again Stella McCartney how it's better McQueen Tibby Calvin Klein as you can see the sleeves are longer and it's a boxer shape you can easily achieve this by sizing up a regular blazer or even just stealing or blazer from your dad your brother your boyfriend if you don't have one of those you can even search this like this belt I actually drifted it for about like $15 [Music] and I'm wearing my goatee sites from product every time I think of a typical work outfit or power woman outfit I don't know why but I always think of a highway sub pencil skirt and this heard is from self portrait and it's on trend with the military trend my legs oozing ashy English better McQueen's tip to make it more work appropriate throw on a blazer and the thing about this look is because you're wearing something that's high-waisted I went for a cropped blazer and that's more tuxedo inspired as you can see and this blazer is from theory and for the shoes I'm wearing a clothes pump shoes because I feel like sometimes when it comes to work clothes pumps seem more appropriate so this outfit I find it more appropriate for work especially with the sleeveless trench coat and the thing about trench coats is it's always in for fall this one is from Michelle Mason and what I like about this trench coat is the length it's the perfect length where it's like not too short and not too long so I'm wearing a pair of tippy culottes if you want to wear culottes but you're worried that they're gonna make you look a little shorter I always suggest go with something that's high-waisted my shoes are from mansoureh Gabrielle they're super easy to slip on and slip off if you were to invest in one bag this fall I suggest this bag from Chloe it's super big it's like big enough to hold your laptop your no plug your beauty products your dog you can fit basically everything [Music] so this is one of my foot big it's like chilly because I want to sauce with this dress you guys saw me wear this last year in December in Miami during Art Basel and I got so many compliments and it's from DVF one of my favorite people in the fashion industry so it's Jonathan saunder for DVF and I really love what Jonathan saunder is doing for DVF right now he's making it so much younger and more fun and what's amazing about this dress is the extreme v-line but for those who feel like it's a little too much adding a white t-shirt to your slip dress definitely gives it a new look and it makes it more fall or whether appropriate and since it slightly on a looser fit I'm adding a belt on my waistline so if you want to look taller or have that illusion of your legs are longer belt your outfit but built it higher up you don't want to built it down here because it will have the opposite effect I'm seriously obsessed with the only way I'm wearing this and to finish off the look I'm just wearing one earring and it's also from DVF [Music] so this t-shirt is from Vince and what I like about this t-shirt is the distressed look as you can see from the sleeves and I wanted to showcase that by wearing a sleeveless vest the save this bus is from Topshop I'm wearing my high waisted frame denim with a cuff off the bottom in order to dress up a t-shirt and denim look I like to wear my like lower heel pointy pumps and these are like super fancy Manolos they literally make any outfit fancy and this look is something that I would wear probably to like an art gallery or to the museum or honestly even on a date night you know boyfriends for some reason they always like their girlfriends in a t-shirt and denim but more on the dressier side so this look is actually styled by Sophia from my team and I love it I really love this whole monochromatic look I feel like it's super on-trend and you stand out no matter where you go so let's say you're going on a blind date and you want your date to find you he doesn't know what you look like you just say I'm the girl in with the all red so I mean I just love a whole monochromatic look especially to make the statement without trying too hard and if you look at the individual pieces that I'm wearing they're not like super crazy they don't really they're not statement pieces this is just a simple white basic tee this is a pair of high-waisted red pants my Topshop boots that I've been wearing so many times and then everything is quite simple and somewhat minimal but keeping it in the same color tone actually makes a big statement so this jacket is perfect for this outfit especially because my Rachel Comey jeans are high waisted and I want to show that it is high-waisted or so the Vita jacket is cropped which makes it look less fussy if you know what I mean so if I were to wear like a longer jacket then I feel like this outfit wouldn't look as polished I mean if I'm gonna do a monochromatic look I'm gonna be extra and really do the monochromatic look by adding a red bag this one is from Rebecca Minkoff so this is like my sexy going out like a white t-shirt in the leather skirt what makes this outfit cooler is definitely the zipper in the middle for easy access and also my really really cool bomb on ankle boots because it's super tight on the ankles I actually find it sexier than regular ankle boots and this outfit let's say you went out and you went to the bar and you let a guy or a girl you go to the house you ended up sleeping over and the next morning you have to go for brunch and go meet a friend but you don't want to wear the same outfit or you don't want to look like they slept over it's like this morning after without outfit you know what you do you just steal their shirt like an oversized shirt put it over and voila you have two outfits [Music] but with a bonus so this look is for my lazy college students or high school students you know those days with my lazy college students or high school students you know those days misses for that but to make it more interesting I always like to wear my white t-shirt underneath my sweatshirt and have a peek out a little bit I will call this like the

hey guys it's amy from sang of style of bonsoir from my Persian hotel so this week this Paris Fashion Week has been my favorite passion week so far for so many different reasons but it was also my most daring Fashion Week because I had a hair stylist and a makeup artist my and on almost every single day so I wanted to do an entire video all about beauty with my every single day we've been doing something different and whether it was like bold graphic eyes or like glittery eyes full of bright pink lips that made my lips look like I just got lip injections it was so crazy because on a daily basis I never get compliments on my makeup nobody ever says wow your makeup looks cool so it was such a cool experience for me to see like people just commenting on my the beauty looks not just on my Beauty but on the makeup and my hair and my style so in this video I kind of compiled a bunch of different beauty looks throughout the week some of my favorite Beauty moments and I learned so much with my so I wanted to give you some of her tips if there are any makeup looks that you want to see in more details just hit me up leave a comment below and I'll do it to dedicate a tutorial so why do you always to Isis cuz I falls under because I bought a little face and just easier cleanup why do you do that for yourself to when you do makeup yeah I always put face person but I buy your best yeah it just becomes too messy cleanup or try to blend video so skew you are and I feel like you can do anything and music do it once if you hate it okay whatever we don't do it again but we try it okay I like but I'm doing like a jewel tone smokey eye wearing super dark clothes but with you know some silver highlights so I'm just making her eyes dark but not to punchy's and it's more greenish yeah and what's this highlighter discovered highlighter a little too late in life well yeah but now I can't get enough of it damn this outfits though and my hair makeup so major when you use a cream shadow do you put anything under the cream shadow to let it stick or no it's just regular foundation so for Elijah it's such a bit like a really cool look I just thought it would be pretty to highlight like the soft Pink's are Nami escapes and just do something naturally okay we're gonna do some lashes but I think this pink will look really pretty to me I feel like this Pink's not super bright like you obviously can see it but because you know there's so many different shades of brightness or color if you're scared I would stick with my pastel or softer shades and then if you do do a pastel I always recommend making sure your lashes are defined so making sure you add some kind of depth because then it will just look washed out if you don't when you're putting makeup on do breathe yeah like he was amazing makeup artist mm-hmm he wasn't breathing but the problem with can't really Harry you know and then he when he was doing my makeup the hair cannot go into my mouth what can you do he should say what can I do what can he do cuz like if you've got hairy fingers I mean well when I usually touch so once you have oh yeah sometimes with us okay Thanks so it doesn't mess up your face yeah it also if I had hairy knuckles it wouldn't know it you say if you have hairy knuckles tip so my always starts with the eyes yeah before foundation before anything just is it easier to clean up exactly what stop concealer ah you put concealer on the eyes is there a reason why you do that instead of primer um prema is just another option and I just I don't know I feel like it's a it works the same and it's the same product like I'll use somewhere else so it's like one less product ah true I think that's always good when you get one product and does like multiple different things my friend is it clean of all create a pro or GERD okra oh is that what they call it okay yeah it's just fade oh yeah higher now you're doing me Brown - yeah they're like Warlow Browns would sure did you start this line okay just that one yeah and then I added like a really soft brown in the crease just to like fade it okay so you prefer a liquid highlighter as opposed to a powder highlighter well for every day and for like soft outside kind of you know shoots nothing too bright but like if I want it to really pop and I would lay our powder over it I'm doing the same on your nose oh yeah I make my nose big play here finally what a big-ass nose okay what did that way but people were saying that the highlighter was like on point good let's thought you were but you just mix I next to shape so I mix like a champagne like gold uh-huh and then I mixed a little bit of like a pinky silver and it just gives it a nice balance if you mix it to a champagne and pinky silver okay and they're both from the same brand yeah they're from Al Janis winged liners that await you know and I trust you know what's a trusted face white they use I love the Holy old panic oh wait yeah there you go hey so when I'm looking down it's like a rectangle yeah but when I look up there's even a little like I did my eyeliner car was [Music] like I make myself sick such a narcissist so you clean it up with concealer yeah yeah what kind of concealer is it later though but I'll use like a I'll use that a q-tips and hi and they're all like yeah it's raining [Music] so hope you guys enjoyed this video and if there are any looks that you guys want to see in more details or in depth depth know her death in depth it's so it's so late it's almost who I am again you guys leave me a comment below and don't forget to subscribe okay ciao good night and see you in the morning Asians not say that spell depth D th yeah so where's that coming from depth [Laughter] you're saying I said here with a sec second gap in between you

hi guys what's up it's your girl Auggie song so today I'm going to show you guys how to do the raw bar so basically actually did a whole tutorial on how to make a raw bar last week right before I went to Paris with my friend Jenny and my sister Donnie but it was a really half-assed tutorial where we were just like having fun so it was like a last minute thing where we forgot to film the entire most important part the granola part and I do have to say in advance that even though this is a raw bar tutorial we actually do use the oven once and it's for the granola when you're making the granola in this raw bar there's no added sugar the things you need for this for army songs raw bar is first oh you can get a simple sprouted oats or you can get actually any kind of boats chia seeds just just cheetah or Chaya I never know how to pronounce it correctly you need walnuts and if you have a nut allergy you will forego this step dates obviously they're the best natural sweeteners ever and then you also need some fire seeds and coconut flakes you'll need coconut oil not too much just a little in salt and pepper alright so the tricky part about making this raw bar for you guys is actually don't know how many people it serves because I honestly eat everything by myself mmm so do what you got to do I'm sorry I apologize in advance I suck at like actual measurements so how much boats should I do I put this much oat maybe I won't do it by ratio okay you put however much tires but Child's good for you to Chia they're good free because they have eight times more omega-3s than salmon and then they're basically like superfood so you add it to everything you thought I'd member races right now just those are right here I put I think that was about four tablespoons and then I put maybe like like a small handful and then I mix the oats and then the important part here is you put coconut oil but you don't put too much coconut oil I put about one giant spoon just kidding maybe like I only have a little it's just like you do what you got to do everytime my recipe changes and while this is all happening you preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit you want to make sure the oats are to fully cover with the coconut oil okay it's nice to have like to make more granola because you could keep this you know and put it in your smoothie or acai bowl even if you don't use the whole thing for the raw bar so you just cook the whole thing and you can also put a tablespoon of olive oil if you want so you put some salt and like a very small pinch of salt and pepper [Music] I'm here and then the only thing is you can put a coconut oil if you want or olive oil just tiny bit so basically what I do is I just spread it so that the granola doesn't farm I'm sure there's a better way to do this and then what I do is I put this on the paper and you spread these thin it out has to be even okay it doesn't have to be perfect Hayek oh cool all right so we're gonna put it in the oven for about 15 minutes max [Music] do you know when the granola is done when it's slightly golden if it's still like this color like pale you know it's not done oh my god oh no that is done and you let it cool for about five to ten minutes and what you're gonna do is you're gonna put this and back in a bowl and mix it with dates and dates is what's gonna make it all sweet like make this all stick together oh it smells so good pretty smells like popcorn okay so I'm gonna just put the whole dates and what I do is I you can use your fingers but I don't like it because it gets really really sticky so in Korean this thing is called ami would say you Tony let's cook today and I'm like what I want to make sure the dates are covering the oats yeah I'm pressing it okay y'all go pull my translator right here literally looking at me with such loving eyes you are quite funny charcoal so I just rub it okay I want to make sure there are no dates that look like this this has to be like finely crushed yes so basically if a gym leader massaging somebody no other way it's a robber no lebar wiry preheating [Music] perfect so basically what we're doing is this is done we're done we just like dump the whole thing in here cuz remember I said it's raw and then we just put in the freezer so that it's frozen slice it that's it this is like crazy super easy to make it's like I'm trying to remember yesterday in the morning what happened why was that annoyed oh we always fight like every like literally every hour I was annoying I want to make one with no nuts for eternity to be honest I'm like a really big germaphobe enjoy being on fat like porn example dawn you like this is your root of straw right like she would drink this and then Jenny would drink this yeah like that's okay would drink out of the same straw like I can't but I know only her I wouldn't do that with everyone so an elementary school haka one I remember like my with like tacos like lunch or something for school and you know like when you packed lunch to school you share with your friends right I did not like it when other people wanted to eat my food or like I I see them like talking what with their like mouth open while eating and if I see like them chewing food like that would just like make me lose my appetite so honestly I would just go in the corner and like eat food by myself and then everybody like the teachers would like toll call my parents saying like ami doesn't like to share and it was more like I don't not that I don't like to share food it's just that like yeah it's actually about I don't like to sure and then you steal other people's food okay so this is what it looks like wait what you do you know but germophobia I think it's like an actual like genetic thing it is right Donnie like oh my god sighs they're all like oh yeah I think that's how you were brought up that's why it's not really Nora that's not how I was brought up look at Donnie of my mom they're like the least awful people oh my god what you doing Jerry you're gonna love this but anyways we are done and we're gonna just refrigerate it or we're gonna put in the freezer freezer how long should we put in the freezer for like two three hours by the way if you're looking this is not sponsored but honestly KitchenAid is my favorite appliance in the entire world oh you know what oh I forgot to tell you guys that you're supposed to saran wrap it what's the other one oh so I forgot about that Hey so this one Donnie did this I mean I won't even say what it is all right Oh perfect it's hard all right I'll show you guys how I slice it it's super easy now cuz it's raw it's frozen you just slice it and then good wrap it in this type of paper like after school right like you're thinking and while your left where'd she go like food in the refrigerator from last night and then you come back home and Donnie song ate the entire thing I thought makes me mad more than anything when you think there's food and there is it it's a dough okay perfect we're gonna wrap it [Music] technically they said dates last like two years but you could keep it in the fridge for like five months this whole thing that's insane for me this entire thing lasts maybe like three days max Natali I'm good at to me laughs for watching how I say that Mina for one yeah let's see mean a pair of Easter video Oh better pair aware avert vista they stop it video a video a video in video grandmas song okay Graz in pair for okay good grazie Mille better a van visto in video don't forget to subscribe and give me a thumbs up okay [Music] you [Music] 
Bienvenue to my hotel do you ever have to say that in French I have some questions for you today are you ready to answer yes okay the very first question is what is your favorite trend piece that you think looks good on everybody should we go to the closet it is right there definitely kitten heels I mean if you asked me about five years ago what would be one pair of shoes and I would never work it would have been kitten heels and now cest I remember my mom used to wear these all the time and I liked them especially like the smaller one blow right because they're just so comfortable that's specially like the pointy pops like these are from the row and I've had these for so long I warned them so many times it's my third time changing these souls or the heels where did you get your a s initial necklace from my a s initial necklace is from Chloe what is the lipstick that you're wearing right now my lipstick I'm wearing let me show you actually so I have bare minerals lip pencil and the color is statement kisseth on under over lip liner so I just outline my lips clip it in and then use the golf da of something ball comm over it what is your skincare routine how do you manage not three thirds that like from traveling well that's two questions my skincare routine is basically I start with a cleansing oil I remove my makeup would buy one cleansing oil and then I use the rectus the cleansing foam cleanser and then after I'm done like we're living with makeup I use I usually use like my floor water either from viral thermal visor it's a French brand from a French pharmacy so it was like a little toy or Garnier and this one is awesome because it removes like waterproof mascara and everything and then after I use the micellar water I use sk2 essence and then depending on my skin if it's super dry I'll use boiling oil also from bio sauce I try to put coconut oil on my body but I don't do it all the time and then again I have far as moment I gel this is not a lot of foam pad you should really like their product by a pump oil so I also like to do math if you see my previous video you saw that I did a lot of like sheet masks I also do these type of mask this one in trouble and Rickson it has like people can a little stove inside so it's really good for exfoliating and then this is like their newest mask and it's called the Hydra lady Top's map detox detox mask and for me is really hydrating so which is why I like it what would you tell your younger self when Sano style was just starting out be a little bit more organized oh the other thing I would say is like spend more time with your sister Johnny Moriah Epps chambers wants to know how are you I'm doing great I'm a little tired today because I will go bad 5:30 a.m. and currently it's 5 p.m. and I think I'm getting sleepy five cups of coffee what is your inspiration when you wake up in the morning I when I wake up in the morning I just feel really grateful that I'm awake although it takes me about life for just an alarm call how did you and iacopo meet actually you guys don't know how we met we met a Morocco and that's on how we started dating or anything we were sitting in the lobby and I thought it was gay you know me and my gays I love my gays so much so us sitting in the lobby with his likes cross like this so this is exactly how he was sitting in the lobby so I thought he was gay I sat right next to him and I was like hi and as soon as I talk to him I really do it straight and you want to start shooting the campaign and I was there with the Tourism Board so that was about it

humber Daugherty knew and asked me do you have advice for people who like to someday do what you do which is fashion and blocky or stuck in a creative block what inspires you the most favorite designers okay so my business advice for people who want to do something similar to what I do is definitely like if you're going to do is don't have acid and just go for it you can't you can't do everything I realize that in life as many things as I want to do you can't do 100% if you're doing so many different things so if you really want to have a career in blogging or work in fashion I say go for it and maybe in the beginning it won't have the results that you want to have but eventually the universe will help you because you're putting out this energy saying that this is exactly what I want and I'm going to do it no matter what so in the beginning maybe the universe will conspire against you and if you give up then maybe it wasn't for you but if you push through it one day it will be amazing between our deadline to ask me what is your all-time favorite TV show that you come back to Sex and the City I mean I could watch any episode of Sex and the City and I can still resonate it's so awesome Emily Bayne asked me how tall I am how tall am I so many people ask me this question but I'm five foot six and however been to Copenhagen no I would love to go up actually also on my bucket list my hopes and tears are amazing and also like you know Danish people under hookah hookah hookah hookah hookah where they're always like so positive and happy times like I need that I'm sorry if I haven't answered your questions I try to go through as many as I could without the camera battery trying to die but thank you so much for tuning in and watching my Q&amp;A video and if you guys have any other questions leave the comments below so I could do a part two you 
this is my current favorite tea from shop two songs so emotional it's totally fine to be emotional the funny thing is yesterday somebody asked after I told them I was a Sagittarius they're like are you quite emotional I don't like that uh yep they're not so hungry if they have anyway to her stammer and you look different in a fish or something hi i'm sami from sonia and today well I just got back from New York Fashion Week so I was away for about 10 days so Fran technically stayed at my house while I'm gone who pretends like he doesn't and he only comes here once in a while but I know he stays here because that was a catered camera and I see all the time kind of creepy anyways so as you can see while I've been gone I accumulated a lot of packages so I decided it would unboxing video for you guys so I already started unboxing a few things and then I was like oh the waiting I should have just done an unboxing video ok first this wasn't something that I actually ordered for myself I have a lot of LA Dodgers top but I wanted something more simple like black and white so that I can wear when I'm traveling especially since I didn't usually don't have any make makeup on at the airport my hair is like all nasty and greasy so I like to just wear a hat by the way this house is slightly haunted but only like a really good spirit so that was that was her lane 2 1 3 3 2 3 3 wood from know I feel like wherever you're going if you have a set of nice pajamas whether they're silk or not because sometimes like if you didn't hide you don't you wouldn't want to necessarily we're still cafe I just feel like there's so much Sharia so smooth I read member I suggest I used to be that girl that used to just wear a t-shirt and my boyfriend's boxer shorts when I used to live with my boyfriend the ones that's no longer in the picture how awkward with it all before place to just wear these boxer shorts and then when I broke up with him I would just literally go to like Duane weed or CVS and buy like a pack of Hanes boxer shorts or like underwear and just wear them and then it got creepy Oh so one of my favorite models and also she's kind of like this style icon rosie huntington-whiteley she's been doing this collaboration with page denim and so these are some of her pieces that she did with them ooh I've got a sexy body suit with the choker oh my gosh it's a duster jacket oh look at the sleeves it's slightly bell sleeves oh my gosh look how cute more than cute it's just it's just so nice it feels so luxurious it's like a velvet duster jacket duster coat and I don't know what I look like but I feel I have a feeling that I'd look good do I like my words even intan again just order shorter to add sugar if I wear heels oh she's so gorgeous I love her okay I'm not farting it's my brother seat oh so nice I know this one this girl her name is sue wah I will find out her exactly linked it I was outside of the coach Fashion Show and so I saw her painting something and I was like looking at her I said when you paint the second painting you look and she told me it's the first time she's ever actually gifted it to somebody she usually keeps it for herself but she gives it this team pay in this one it's from unique it encloses something pretty to wrap yourself up cute I just love anything anything that's printed anything that's like a wrap dress they're just so easy to wear -

it's a caviar stick and rose gold hmm I love this color this one is an orchid actually you've never really tried purple eyeshadow or a caviar stick so this is pretty cool i really like the shimmer on these and they do at least last 12 hours and then so the matte one in the brown packaging goes on like this so it's definitely mad I think I will personally you more of a shimmering one but that's only because I'm not very like bold with my eyeliner eyeshadow choice I make up well that's pretty cool this would actually make really pretty lip color like nude lip color this one is vanilla kiss oh that's pretty oh that's pretty I'm sure I wonder if I could use these as highlighters I really like last year on vacation and then got to finally meet her after like funky to review Instagram in Paris she needs my I think she came to my book signing douchey I saw her in front of club collection but I'm Anna and October oh my gosh so something of having her close they just make me smile and it seems like a very happy collection and I knew she'd be a happy person Oh colors hey my Paris Fashion Week wardrobe is complete it's a dress cute I should try these on pretty good I will try it on Oh cute oh yes yes yeah okay Paris Fashion Week first all right so have a restarting cleanser created circumference can undergo an acne treatment those are no point to me spot-on remedy so maybe this is good for Sophia not good for me and then we can ask if it worked or not I think I know what the factors are carrier during Paris Fashion Week so this I believe is a Korean brand from rola they make the most outrageous but cool bags there's nothing like it on the market look how crazy these are cute I don't think I should keep this well my friend just get folded this bag is so crazy I feel like my outfit has to be simple or it's a little too much you know but I feel like it makes for such a nice like a statement bag and this one is more minimal because I felt like one gonna be crazy and one can be more okay but it's so cute it can't wait it would be so perfect for like a nighttime event let's see today's cute I love this this is section under I'm tossing everything right now it's like a plan my outfits cool below the ballots this I don't want to wear what do I do with this I'm the one selected all these foot oh if you rub it and then like titers like a wrap dress yes like this so imagine me wearing with a blouse and then doing this or like a jacket you know then yes so I haven't even like a simple black leather version but now I have it in velvet perfect for fall so a lot of people don't know this brand and I feel like it says one ring you should really like look into is this brand based in New York called CSEA New York their pieces are so like they make beautiful knit they make pretty dresses glasses are like kind of it's like a lot of ruffles really very easy to wear and then like the ruffle glasses that they have where the dresses they have their own like statement pieces -

[Music] good morning guys today I'm finally here with the image head so you're the number one requested person that I have to interview on my youtube channel for years and years and years and it's not just Sophia and I like you both that's crazy to me they were gonna lie to you they don't have on anybody else but even try ya know they don't care Michelle Obama failed care Oprah maybe Oprah I would like to meet Oprah Oprah but I want to say I don't know if you remember this and I did a whole blog post about this but the very first time I ever met you was when you were working at team vote and it was my very first time in New York as a fashion blogger or my second time I was here during Fashion Week I knew one girl she was an intern at Teen Vogue and she wasn't even my friend she was a friend's friend like there were four or five of us we went to the Teen Vogue office and we're just like scooping around I do remember uh-huh and I remember I kept on asking this girl is like don't like for me as I was growing up not to age youren gave me like five years apart I don't know I'm I remember my other than like once in a while like seeing Asian models in the magazines you are the first Asian person I ever saw in like a huge magazine that I've been subscribed to and the fact that you were you were obviously pretty but you wear something more than a model because I couldn't aspire to be a model like I never saw myself in the glossy pages of magazine so I always like wanted to maybe me behind the I was thinking like how can a agent girl from Los Angeles without any fashion connections like get myself to become an editor or a stylist and I saw you I was like your little mini photo like the beauty editor and I was like oh my gosh like who is this person I remember like in 2000 something like I was like wow like maybe 2001 2000 know me maybe 2007 or yeah that's an 8 oh yeah I think 10 years ago hmm and then and then when I saw you at Teen Vogue in real life like I remember you were in your office and then the girl was like yeah she's there she said that office she's really nice but don't bother her and then I was like I went towards the door tried to look and then we made eye contact and you're like hi coming No oh my gosh oh my gosh and I went in and then I was like hi I'm from San Francisco I'm a fashion blogger and you're like oh tell me more about yourself and then you're like do you want to go to the beauty class I don't think yeah remember yeah then I remember like she let me go to the Beauty closet and I got like so many things she's like you can take everything oh my god and it's like that now still trying to give people stuff yeah always like I mean even till now I just had like a pack of dried mango but better to take all the dried mangoes take it off but I wanted to say like throughout the year is like I feel like both of our positions in our career has changed and I think you you're like heart always remained as a stay like you've always been like such a good person how did you find yourself like interning in a fashion like magazine world I mean I think that I'm a first generation American my parents are Chinese and moved here in the 70s a lot of the time Asian parents and any immigrant parents like what they want is their kids to be really stable and you would be unstable understandable careers because they work so hard and have had to deal with so much so I was proven like I was always like I want to be a doctor because that's what my parents want and it's also very stable but I interned at harper's bazaar or the somewhere between junior and senior year i just applied to like a million internships in high school I was in college I went to Johns Hopkins in Baltimore which is like the most pre many kind of school and then I was like I'm going to do a fun summer off and then I applied to like 20 or 30 internships I got a bunch of them but then harbor's was the only one that paid this was a long time ago I don't know if magazine internship still pay but I did it my super fell in love I basically was like oh my god this is what I was meant to do and I think the main thing for your your your followers and your audience that are thinking about working in fashion or music or whatever it is is that you have to intern or you have to find a way to talk to people so even if you didn't intern if you're from San Francisco Internet a fashion magazine talking to people who did and that's why I think Instagram is so great because you never know who you can DM whether start a relationship with I have talked to a lot of high school students over DM that sounds really creepy but they're like asking for like career advice and school advice and you just don't know you can strip a relationship with like use Instagram as a way to research different careers and do your research to see what it could be that you're interested in and I think it's also really important to know that like what you're interested in when you're 20 could be different from what you're interested in when you're 25 which is really different from what you're interested in 30 like it's really good to change your target because you're constantly changing as a person when you were 25 what did you see your future as okay when I was 20 I thought I was gonna be a doctor when I was 25 I was like okay I want to be like I mean like my weird thing is that I never had like specific things I wanted to be because any time in my life that I've been like this is what I want to be this is what I should be it's never worked so when I was like I need to be a doctor it didn't work I was just like it was just like not happening like it was just not right for me what I learned in my career is just like if you work really hard and you love what you do it will lead to more of our communities so I was a magazine editor for ten years I never expected I never went into magazines and was like I want to be an editor in chief or I want to like run this magazine or that magazine because it's like not always up to you either it's like a lot of industries like fashion but it's like there's so many different things that determine where you're going to end up in your career so I am I was beauty director at Teen Vogue then I was freelance for a bit and I lived in LA and then I was editor-in-chief of lucky which is where you and I said like worked a lot together thank you and then I like took a break because I had a baby I had my like wonderful daughter read and then I came here to Instagram and it's like everything in my career like the lucky job and this job here at Instagram it didn't really come because I was like I didn't have a good vision board or whatever they call it like a spur Asian journal where I was like I want to work at Instagram but like I loved Instagram I love posting an Instagram people would always ask me advice for Instagram like curling cloths or Pat McGrath the makeup artist they would ask me for advice and I didn't work at Instagram but I would be like oh I think you should do this or wanting to try that and I'd be more be like oh great advice like you should talk to this person next a second I work for Instagram and then extra girl calls and they were like you should work for us and I was like I guess I should yeah Instagram hire me so my other question is I feel like me knowing you personally I feel like your success other than being smart because I think there to be more than being smart is like your personality like how you connect with people because I think connection is so important in this industry and it's like being genuine I feel like do you think that made you go further in your career compared to like your hair I mean I think that a lot of people have the stereotype of fashion that it's like bitchy it's cold it's backstabbing you have to be like really mean and like sneaky to work in fashion it's like really not my vibe like for me it's like life is so short it's like why not just be happy and like help other people and that's always been kind of my motivation is like ultimately like I have friends who I went to college we're all doctors down where they literally tried to cure cancer like literally they are curing cancer I am NOT carrying cancer my goal is just to like help people and whatever aspects are right where I try to get back a lot to community I try to like a very environmentally conscious or try to be and I think like being just aware of the bigger world around you and how you can help other people it's really important I didn't get to where I am in my career by myself and no one is an island no one can do it themselves and so I think I always try to help other people along the way but I think that's really important you know like you don't know what people are going through you don't know where people come from as a background so it's like why not help people yeah so yeah that's always been kind of my goal and it's great because I didn't stab em I'm able to connect with a lot of people whether it's like small businesses like you're the same way like you love wearing independent designers and healthy like young designers think you were the first person that that I knew to wear self-portrait and it's like I love that line and I discovered an independent well he's pretty big now he's a big deal now but like I remember seeing self-portrait and seeing it on your Instagram and being like oh my god that like you know latest shirt is so beautiful it's like I've never seen that before and tapping on the tag and seeing self-portrait and discovering them and India make me of them and be like wow that's really beautiful it's like to be able to help businesses grow and to help people grow and help watch talent I think is really important and so another question I get asked the most is from a lot of like newer bloggers or influencers because right now the market is slightly saturated there's so many of us do you feel like there's still room for them to to be able to do what we're doing and how what's the easiest way for them to grow yeah I think that there's definitely still room like there's room at the table for everyone I think that's one of the things where people will say like you know uh you know there's only room for like they're these ten power bloggers and then there's no room for anyone else it's the same if you're a fashion designer if you have an original point of view and you are designing original things and you have an original voice there's room for you like there's always going to be more room for talent this talent is not like a piece of pie wait this is like a quote where they're like it's not a piece of pie there's that feminism quote that's like it's about like what research and people research and what it's about like wage like how it's like it's not like taking a piece of pie away from you it's like there's a it's like it's not a finite thing talent it's like it's about it's supposed to be huge and expansive and finding new fresh talent is so exciting so I think the most important thing for young bloggers or you know writers or anyone in the creative class as we call it it's like it's really to like have an original point of view so it's like it's not enough to I don't think it's enough to take pretty pictures yeah I think whether you take pretty pictures but it's a really unique one of you like you only do backstage what is one thing or you know you're a really amazing writer I just think there's a room for everyone so the most important thing I think is to be a part of the community on Instagram like don't feel like you're in islands like you know I mentioned people tag people like other people's posts that drives me crazy on Instagram where people like I will say to me like well I don't like about liking other people's posts because like it's not cool to like other people spo0a who says yeah and I'm literally like dude it's like Instagram is about a community like you first of all if you are telling people who you like and like when I like one of your posts and you like one of my posts and I like like you know Landon my like on my team's posts it's like you're creating this community and it's so much like more fun that way you know I think it's really important and so the people who are starting out it's like tap into the community if you are really into like another kids we are into this thing called slime uh-huh very yeah like a colles have so satisfiying like watching the slime so if you are really into brunch or really do pizza or - avocado like whatever it is hashtag avocado like join that community don't be afraid to talk to other people and reach out to people collaborate I think is really important you see how Gucci like has raised the profile of so many illustrators in so many artists from Instagram it's a to do that so don't obsess over taking like pretty photos like everybody else having a view not be collaborative yeah communicate yeah those are some key points she just summarized it all is actually so good at what she does just sees the big picture but yeah but it's like one example it always uses like okay I love avocado toast I love cappuccino art but how many photo what does that say what is I say like it's like everyone has seen that picture that's like avocado toast and a cappuccino art and a perfect pair of like you know do you are sunglasses right shot him above the wrist like sitting there with a perfect manicure and like maybe a cartier stack you know like it's nice but it's also like you've seen it a million times now if you show that picture but then I think so Graham stories you literally show the 56 outtakes where you're like oh and then the shadow came and then like my boyfriend sat down and spilled my coffee and I had to yell at him like if you show the behind the scenes that's what's so great and I think that's what people really want to see as well and also like you in the caption you're like this might look like the perfect picture but it took four hours and 23 minutes and being a blogger is hard it's funny you know it adds a sense of humor and I that's what so great about mommy not to like boast about her on her own YouTube channel but nobody like your stories are so fun because it's not just one point of view it's not just like you and amazing outfits like flying around the world and looking perfect but you also post like you making do you have those like energy deep bar things I did up until yesterday finished day all your stomach right now but basically it's like you see like I get to see you and making your recipes I get to see like you know how you're really amazing sense of interior design I think it's if you do public surfing the public service awareness thing that you did about like the uber kidnapping thing like that freaked me out by the way and I cow if you press those buttons on the phone remember I showed you that actually like how you press your button on the phone like five times and alerts like it's like I think talking about everything and but in a true way to yourself is really important and whatever it is you want to share about it just make sure it's like some simple but yeah that's the secret everyone say what's the secret Eva you work at Instagram and I'm like just be yourself the most basic advice but for somebody who was like completely starting I knew what zero followers like I think for their biggest thing is like how do they attract people to follow them so then they can feed themselves yeah yeah I think I get that question a lot in food which is like how do I get more followers on Instagram and the most important thing listen like everyone starts from zero in some way like you started with zero followers I certainty are followers and I think the thing is is that like first of all like part of it is that you just to put content and put like posts out there and not obsess over it yeah you find joy and truly enjoy posting Instagram the followers will come like it sounds weird to say that but really I believe that fashion people sometimes don't like hashtags this fashion I once did a meeting with a French designer Merced who had special tags so vulgar that's so tacky and I literally was like oh my god you're so mean the hashtags are so great because it's like it's a really good way to tap into a community so I have a friend who's a food blogger and she's been food blogging for about three years she literally like think I've known her since college I've known her forever but she had like three thousand followers and now she's that like a hundred and twenty three thousand followers literally just by using hashtags yeah you know so it's like find your community and then maybe be a part of the community I feel like if you're in college and you're like oh I want to make friends in college but I don't want to like join any clubs or like go outside it's like it'll be easier to make friends you can join a club and join committees and like and hashtags are kind of the equivalent yeah I think and then like like I said like have an original point of view would have a sense of humor and tag your favorite people and just try to have a dialogue were you always like this like confident and friendly and outgoing growing up um no I was thinking about this this morning like moment where I literally was like oh my god I get it now the key to personal style is wearing whatever you want sometimes looking awkward and bad but being confident about it so be confident in the fact that you were a bright red purple eyeshadow pearls on your shoes on your and then glitter blue glitter and glitter aren't like six years ago these are from like Teen Vogue era he's mute you are right I never had them because back then I couldn't afford him but I would roll over them yes like literally it's like just and I think that's something that like you learn with every decade right so when you're a teenager it's like you're figuring things out you're like unsure about things and you're like I don't know where do I fit in how do I fit in then in your 20s it's like the 20's are kind of this like an amazing decade because that you start out like kind of like Bambi legs like while waiting and you're like I don't know but at the end of your 20s you're like I kind of Know Who I am a little bit more 30s they were really great so 30s I feel like it sounds really old and I remember being like 20 and be like oh my god 30 year olds like grown up like but thirties are great because they you know how sometimes there are nights where you're like I was invited to this party I really don't want to go but I'm gonna go the great thing about being in your 30s is you're like as it readies of this party I really don't want to go so I want to watch The Bachelor like it's like you don't really you just like feel confident in all your decision yeah I think like it's taken me until like I'm like 30 seven-thirty I don't remember my 30 seconds like I know it but like I feel like it's taken me this long to be literally like become the winners yeah and some people are really lucky and they are that from the beginning right like I but I was shy very very shy growing up but it's taken me this long to get to this point and I think that you know it I think just owning it and being like comfortable and kind of being like life it's like it's you have to be able to laugh at yourself when you were first starting out in fashion worried like one of the very few Asian Americans within the department I feel like there weren't that many yet honestly I still feel like there's not enough Asian representation like everyone else right like when you turn on the TV it's like there are a few news anchors there's Constance was on that show fresh off the boat would like I love and she's in that book crazy rich Asians which is like a really funny book but basically well Jamie chomp yeah Jamie but like do you feel like you had to work a little bit harder because yeah uh race I don't know if I had to feel felt like had to work a little bit harder but I do feel like I have a responsibility to like raise up others and not just like Asians of course but like diverse voices diverse faces diverse bodies whatever it is I do feel a responsibility especially in New York City you walk around and you see this world that's so it's like everyone from everywhere and then it's kind of a bummer when you like open you know turn on the TV or open a magazine and it's just like literally one type of person so I do feel like if you are in the position whether it's being an incredible influencer such as yourself or having if you work in a magazine or you work at a TV studio wherever whatever it is you do but just be aware that you have a responsibility to help other people up from different backgrounds as you so yeah not just race but yeah always and like you know I watched a video that you did with shyona torini and Nicole Apatow where you guys were talking about diversity and like just everything going on in the industry and it's like I love that you know like I think that when people help other people up I think that's the most like the best qualities I'm gonna yeah okay now do you want to take me around yeah Instagram [Music] [Music] laptop batteries are expensive yeah wait wasn't one more read the track what else do we need okay this is the last thing we have to cut you off what made you hire virgin Radhika she worked with me a team code just like had so much hustle everything was always that yes like on it and she said no kind of but secretly yeah she just wanted to win team foe we worked together I brought her over to lucky and then I like brought her over here yeah so it's like if you work hard and you like click with someone and you admire their work ethic do you need pack background to work get in serum and your department you know and your department you just have to genuinely you just have to love Instagram though I do it's like really important to love it read them oh yes your chance to go to choppier we have complete we do service yeah [Music] are you hurting here for a sauna style has been acquired by Facebook Instagram [Music] you 
hi guys its Omni your favorite song I have shyona who've I've known for four and a half years no longer than that what we're not just fashion friends you know she means so much to me and then I'm super excited that Nicole who's like what okay Nicole used to be the fashion director for Allure magazine and now she's doing her own thing so we'll talk about that too and these two women they've been killing it in the industry neither of them really come from a typical fashion background so I felt like we can teach you guys something and their fashion insiders they know much more about fashion history than I do and thank you so much for joining me thank you okay let's get to some questions for me it was being treated with respect in the industry so like as soon as they found out that I was a blogger the tone changed in the beginning and then they found out how many followers I had and then the tone changed again that was like the biggest thing I will do a true life example I will never forget when we were in con at the Dior show yeah and a few of the other editors kind of were like who's that girl and you were like truly minding your own business you were like in your own photo shoot world but and I was like oh that's on me and they were you were the first blogger to be at a luxury yea trip like that and I remember before you when the PR director was like do you know this girl and I was like that's my girl and she was like oh should we invite her and I think ya might actually thank you and so you being on that trip it was like the first time a blogger was invited to like the trip like that with so many editors and I just will never forget that editor it's like being like oh who is that to today and now it's like oh she's mad cool and I was like why do you care like her doing her photo shoot capturing her content is really not your business and like it's really not bothering anybody and so I can definitely attest to that kind of I went through the struggle because obviously like you moved on and did your job but I remember that um I think that being non-american and having an extra layer to like not just am I gonna get this job over all these other girls but like how do I stay in the country and that was such a struggle for me and it was such a personal struggle and it was like such a huge expense I have a green card now but I in there but I so that was something that was like a real so in addition to all the stress and the competition and just you know try to make it and navigate through this industry a to do it like completely alone which is why I depend on or why I value so many of my friendships like oh you said at the beginning of this we're not just fashion problems like we're not I do not make just fashion rounds like because these are my people they're the only people I know in this country and so it's like being away from my family and trying to figure out a way to stay in America and like applying for different visas and like paying for my own lawyers at certain points like that was just an added element that I had to deal with beyond my day-to-day work mm-hmm now it's negotiating money yeah getting paid what you're worth yeah yeah you um I feel like mine is twofold in the beginning it was you know I had another career and I was starting over so I was always the older intern or so and I and I needed to work I didn't have the architects after that architecture I took a couple years off and then I was like all right let me figure out how to get into fashion I got an internship at Marie Claire and I can only be there for a certain amount of hours and I didn't want anyone to know that I was like I'm not 20 tricks and while everyone else was like in college still so I just kind of kept to myself to change to another job to like I had another like part-time job working with a friend who was doing PR and I'm her own little business so I kind of just made sure when I was there that I was giving it 1,000% and making sure that the editors who were there knew like hey that's not a really amazing intern and at the end someone quit and they hired me oh wow so and there was other people who were there all day long and they didn't consider them but they were like we want you to come work here is you're gonna make it work so passionate yeah and then my other thing like now it's juggling being a mom and that's something that we talk about a lot it's like you know there's this event and this event there's something every night all and all day long that you can go to and I'm like well do I take this time out to be like working on my career or do I stay at home and because my kids oh and my husband so I was like that's something that I I'm really trying to balance and I feel like I've done a good job at it but yeah those are my issues hmm did you come to America saying I want to work in fashion I always want to work in fashion and I I remember I came to New York on a trip with my parents and I was like you need to walk behind me because I'm gonna move here by myself one day so I need to get used to it and my mom was like but it was something that I was like there was never any doubt I used to like make my own clothes with my friend but it was always what the only thing I ever wanted to do so I think it was not so much about gaining confidence but being strategic and figuring out how to do that because I had such tunnel vision I didn't have a plan B I was like I'm moving to New York I'm working in fashion for me it was less about magazines cuz they were hard to get in Bermuda mine was music videos and like being like wait Missy Elliott how'd she get those clothes like it was always about like the clothes and the music videos and how those clothes told a story and I did not know I don't know what a PR office was I didn't know like the backstory to this I just was like this is what I'm gonna do I'll figure it out when I get there so I moved here and I figured her out when I got here I slept on people's couches I wasn't making money for a year I couldn't afford like the training and it was a huge sacrifice so I think it was less about gaining confidence but like being so focused on a goal that I wasn't nothing was gonna deter me not even like being broke not be you know none of that not missing my family like you know I have I have a hard time with that because like my grandfather died and I was like you know at a fashion event and I was like I'm doing this like my family's in Bermuda so it I think it's like less about confidence I'm more just like this is really what I wanted to do with my life and so like I guess I get like the energy from that to just be super focused and figure it out yeah interior architecture architecture i studied our urban design and architecture in history well what kind of history american history is what i concentrated in so yeah there's a lot of history that's why i'd like love that like know your history no you're wrecking it all comes from somewhere yeah I started as an economics major which I knew I barely comp like I certainly can't even like act upon to something but I started as economics and then I switched to English and then I was looking at a public relations textbook and I switch to PR because I was like oh there's a job where you like plan up in okay I can do that and so I did public relations jerk do you feel like your majors played a role in what you're doing now none for me no no I don't think that's you know that people who have an architecture background are visual people but not even inspiration like studying history shaped who you are in a study kitchen I feel like on my own I would really clothing and the fashion of the time to what I was studying and maybe that's why I'm what's interested in it but I don't I don't know I I mean I'm really good at researching yeah I'm like finding a reference and knowing what decades something is from and why it was relevant at that time so maybe yeah actually maybe it helps I did yeah like you don't have to major in fashion to join the passionate yeah I think you were I mean I feel like such a mom when I say this but it's like your education and your degree is really just like a foundation and what you lay on top of that foundation is entirely up to you I am really not concerned when I look at someone's resume at what school they went to honestly I just get like a five because I've hired people who have had zero experience and I have hired people who have like other fashion internships and it's I also when I interview people think about how they're gonna gel with the group uh-huh and so I make sure that my current assistants also interview them because they work so closely with my assistants I want to make sure that it's a positive like a positive like well-rounded group do people email you or D of you to intern for you I do not like when people DM me for internships I think it's just like I don't think it's perfect yeah it's not professional so it's like you know my email address is on my website I have a place where you can like contact us directly I post my assistants all the time like there are other ways to figure this out and I just feel like we're on Instagram and yeah it's just like I get it by any means necessary buddies you are in behind an email at your I think it's much more professional if you like release take your time to write a nice cover letter yeah they're like why you want to join the team and email us yeah that's how I hired all my intern something that I really hate that I want like all of your you know follow is do not message people asking them to be your mentors nothing makes me crazier it's like you are truly a stranger and I get it again I really believe in by any means necessary but I would rather you figure out what event I was gonna be at and bump in to me and have a conversation with me and ask me that than just like DMing me asking to be a mentor instead of just asking like can i shadow you can I assist you can I work on your team but it's kind of like I just think that it's it's crazy because there's so many people who have worked for us and we have so many interns and assistants that we have to look out for it's like these kids give up their time and their energy to help support our businesses and so it's like I'm gonna be their mentors yeah mentoring is like it doesn't end and it's not just a time commitment it's almost like you're parenting someone yeah absolutely looking out for them like I have people who were my interns so long ago and they're now senior editors and directors and I'm just like so how's it going I think you should do this and I we talk about like their Linux career yeah the time it never and and like even you know people were my assistant I call them my kids like that's it like they're a part of your family and you like Sofia's parents yeah no I feel that too and so it's like you know - I think that that's a mistake and I think that it just needs to be reworded because trust me you want a mentor who has your best interest at heart for the long haul and you're not gonna get that by just asking a stranger to be your mentor like you have to have some sort of genuine connection or like you know just like work for that person first and then there's tons of people who have worked for me and I'm like if I never speak to this person again fine that's that's just what happened and then there are other people where you're like I'm truly invested in this person's growth through the industry so many people who still work in fashion have been trained by me like no joke like will who you've had a tiny country and then like scheana see our fashion book and like you know so I keep those relationships going and you know that's what a mentor is someone who's like 10 years later is still like making sure that you're straight yeah I just think like if this is something you want you push towards it like there was a black woman who became a surgeon in like 1897 like you know save me slavery was like just abolish so if she's able to do it I think that if you have drive you just you figure it out you look at that person who you want to be at and you find out their career path like hey is this something that I can do like well how did they get to these steps and not necessarily mimic but figure out your route in that and and just really be passionate about everything that you're doing I agree with that to a certain extent I feel I want to address the male-female one first though because that's something that I do struggle with and I'm very conscious off when I look at the people whose style everyone's favorite like musicians or actresses it's not women it's not female stylist they certainly not black female stylist and that's something that like enrages me because I look at all these people being like black girl magic and with no one on your team is black so it's like yes I do think we have to work harder but it's like that's big think about that statement like always feeling like you have to work so much harder than the person makes you just because of the color of your skin yeah I think that part of the solution to this is that we have to take our you know white co-workers and counterparts to task and be like you know if you care about me and you care about like the greater good of this industry it's like it's up to you to speak up as well we can't always be the ones speaking up on our behalf it's like other people have to say you know what this is a problem I recognize this as a problem what can I do to try and help fix this yeah we shouldn't be the ones always you're not saying like I really think we need to put a person of color in this story it's like constant constant I really think we need to do this you know what about a what about a black model what about an Asian model like I've started speaking up we're not just black yeah I know my guys we've never shot an Asian model how about that like have you know like it takes it's taking white women to step up and just also fight for us yeah don't shop there ya go shop somewhere where you know that appreciates you your culture your background and your money so it's like I think that's an important step to realize that as a consumer you hold more power than you think that you do and we also like I said we're gonna call about culture so it's like take them to task get up in their DM so ya get up in their comment section suddenly you know show them like this is not right and I won't be shopping here anymore this is not right I will be following you anymore at first I was really offended because people are like there's no diversity I'm like Hello Asian girl right here I didn't hear from your guys's point of view you know I was and then it clicked like I I took some time off and I like really thought about it I talked to you I talked to Sophia like from my team cuz she was really upset about the whole situation too and she posted on her Instagram story and I was like dude Sophia like we're all the same you're right it's not that there aren't black influencers they kind of get overlooked and like it's true and you guys kind of get overlooked I think that um for in part of my freelance life I do as you know kind of like influence or strategy for Browns and it is soul-crushing to me to present a deck of like these are the girls I think will be great for this project and to receive that deck back from a brand with all of the black girls edited out this happens to me so often and I know that you guys know privately but it's like I felt like I lost a really big client of mine because I had to be like you know what enough absolutely not this is crazy I already pushed pushed pushed for like these black women to be included but then they weren't included kind of in the promo ocean of this initiative so basically you included them to shut me off but then you actually didn't use their imagery that eyelid created and it was beautiful and these are talented women and it's like there's not a project that I work on that I do not fight and speak up and drop out off and refund checks to when these Browns do not encourage and promote diversity there are tons of black girls with that amount of following but then the second layer is to hear a Brown say like oh well they're not our market or they're not you know that's like not our image and it's like oh really tell me why you know and so it's like because what I feel it comes down to is this deep-rooted sense of the standard of beauty and it comes down to that and it comes down to like that person might have just as many followers but they're not your market because you are so focused on this like traditional sense of what is beautiful and what is cool and that's not a black woman and that's a problem and when you see like your peers and people that you see it shows whatever just being like oh well no problem because they're including it like that's part of the problem you know and we spoke privately and it's like it comes up to a point where it's like I know you're not racist obviously not you know like I know that and I know you it's not your struggle and so you don't know kind of like that included back story about how black girls are notoriously left out of these like influence or trips and campaigns and things like that but once you educate yourself I think that you fully were like oh this actually is a problem how do I mean you don't we DM the body and about it before the world went crazy and i DM did to you and I was like I'm so sick of this it's just like you're so annoyed we're funny that we fighting that battle that you're just like well what's new so I just find it to be a problem like even we'll sit there I'll sit there at a show like now that it's Fashion Week I've said shows before word I'm like alright this is the second season I've come where there's not been one person of color okay now it's the third season and you've only chosen like light-skinned model I'm like I'm not coming back knock on my ear shown in one yeah so I just find my unholy I got it down yeah not shoot you man I don't have to like how do you think they can step up and be more inclusive I don't want to see one token black roll on that trap because that's still problematic because it's more than just a trick I just want to see what they do like like I'll be very clear that it's not just them and it's like they just happen to be the target of that and and I'm glad I'm glad that the black girls on the internet with like enough I'm glad that it started a conversation because it's something that we've seen all the time like right in front of our faces and they should fix it and I also found something beautiful that came out of it that all the black girls rally together and they're like hey since maybe you don't know some influencers here's some I like now your tango name five different more yeah what about this girl oh my god she's so cute I was looking at her and I was like clicking follow follow follow so I think there was some beauty that came out of it but it's like we're just constantly fighting these fights yeah that it's like alright your turn to step out it's something that I need to speak up about my circle of friends they're not all just like you know they were all the same tone like we're all so different so I know I have a responsibility to speak up and that's what I'm going to do is it too late to make into the fashion industry no what can they do I know it's like so hard but you have to if you if you can't in turn find your niche and say like like I actually spoke about this when I was at allure I'm to a group of women and someone's there with in her 40s and she's like I have children I remember what do I do and I was like what about like figure out you need to really first figure out what you love about fashion and I was like she's like well I think I actually like wanna be a blogger but like also style shoots and I was trying to give her advice like set up your own shoots like iPhones are really great right now take your own pictures do it on the weekends figure out those weekends we're like your husband or your significant other can watch the kids and you reach out to some photographers and some like hair stylist makeup artist anyone a stylist we like hi I'd love to intern for you for one day like can we meet for coffee first and see if we'll get along and like things like that and let me shadow you let me just be in the background and just chai you'd have to really get the experience it's what's important yeah I think that one of the misconceptions with things like Instagram and just on the internet is like this is a really small bubble like what people see and the people that they see is like such a small insular bubble and so there's nothing wrong with being an at-home hero like if you're older and you want to break into the industry and you like live in like Atlanta like Atlanta has a booming fashion industry like it's like you can start at home and maybe it will develop into something you know more globally known but that doesn't always happen and there's nothing wrong with being it at home like go to your local mall find that store that you always shop in like yeah I want to do in a bit I'm gonna bring in these amount of people we're gonna shock the store and then maybe they're bringing you to their next door and the next door to another store wants to do it and then it can develop from there like you just have to like figure out what can work for you and the space that you're in yeah if I go to your local newspaper and say yeah I love swim I want to do a swim story yeah I'll do it for free just to like get that clipping and you know build yourself up from where you are it's crazy to think that every like move to New York and be or move to LA and be able to you know be this editor there's only ten jobs and those are magazines are now they're in yeah it's just like you know there's something to be sad about kind of like figuring out your path from where you are no matter where you are all right so we got a wrap up but thank you so much for joining in make sure to follow co9 Nicole they their Instagram feed is super inspiring and their stories and everything so make sure to follow them if you guys have any more questions leave a comment below and we'll answer the next time you

so basically today she's styling me and three different outfits that like best represent genistein yes and it's so crazy because we really have different styles right like we like the same things but I feel like our styles are so different we both love fashion we both like sharing the things that we love with you guys but I'm just really excited oh also we did a video of me styling Jen in a very Omni outfit three different on the outfit so you guys can check that out link below so hmm gonna put you in a casual outfit really white tops okay yeah is there a reason why you prefer a white over black I don't know why good like super high maintenance or flattering in lighter clothes so I'm gonna put you in a fine like liked graphic tank like this one and overall our area it makes no sense makes a great trip nice a great trip okay so this is like how my dad texted me very nostalgic about that and now we're gonna shimmy on over to this side I think I'll just go for like a light bottom as well okay okay yes at least it here we go okay I'm liking this already we're done yeah we're gonna reward this this I've worn it to a bar or the side the cha-cha ouch once in their go-to outfit when you go out or like it all depends on is your army like that night I'm just excited that I got this top so I wore it out you got a hug created yeah yeah and it's just like I don't know I just like the graphic it's got like the red and the green it's like kind of Gucci vibes but [Music] color okay play with the red bomber jacket q yeah all right all right so here is my everyday Jen is amazing in this but yeah basically I really like a pop of color now and then so I threw on this lovely red bomber underneath I have this really fun graphic tank that I got from Korea I think it ties in with the red bomber really well I love that it makes no sense at all and it has bad grammar tucked it into some wide comfortable denim I'm always kind of like sloshing around so I like really comfortable that I'm like this belted it with a favorite vintage piece and then I asked ami to bring her chunky platform what do you think so like the denim is amazing like first of all this is something that I would wear these two I don't think I would ever wear so this is very different for me right and I feel very like being right because they feeling when they thinking about Jenny just think of like a ray of sunshine so this is like very fun I feeling young yeah it's a punchy yeah they're young and youthful cool like I feel like a really cool kind of like kind of like badass like Korean girl I don't know like I don't think like with an attitude yeah fun so I like this outfit so where would you wear this usually hmm I can literally wear it anywhere from like lunch with the girls or even a night out yeah maybe with like a really high pony would like an orange lip that look really cute but yeah this is like kind of like my go-to everyday look yeah I feel like you wear a lot of bombers too right so that's like your go to jacket he's so cool cuz my go to Jack is like a blazer or like the page one yeah [Music] yes okay so this is meeting Jen I like to be a little bit more polished for that but still kind of casual I still want like my personal stylist go through so I'm gonna put you in like a really nice trouser warm tones yeah these would be really nice to like see as well Q's nice and flowy and then back to the top her waist is so tiny something like this again a white top okay yeah I think this will be good I like bright colors to like lighter colors and then for accessories whoa you are so organized I'm gonna put your burrito for this okay okay I feel like Berets very much like when I think about Jen and it's like I always think of like a little burrito happy and berets and so in writing yeah they really are but I definitely but you to bring this see if you know just doing a little minimal choker so normally do you wear a lot of like jewelry i I just wear earrings honestly ear even hats are the way I like to express myself you know like statement earrings exactly but with this since you're wearing the beret I don't want so much stuff around you but for the girls night out outfit I think I'm just gonna go a little nuts let us put these crazy hoops on you all right so here good outfit number two this is meeting Jen so definitely more spruce stuff what do you think about sofa so far I love this outfit I feel like - the shoes this is something that I would wear Oh whole company should even the Bolivian on with the hat like some different aspects of it but I really love the blouse that you chose for me the pant I feel like you wear a lot of wide legged pants I feel like you could wear anything to let you wear skinny jeans boyfriend jeans but I know that you love high-waisted yes always yeah I love anything I wasted two and the to me like the shoes are like a very interesting choice but what makes it very new socks every like platforms chunky shoes that's just what I gravitate towards because it's just really comfortable to wear but yeah I wanted to have just more like an elegant top because of being meetings and I want to be taken seriously so I threw this on then for the pants I went for some high-waisted trousers I suppose in this nice warm tan color and then to make it classic Jen like you're on a beret okay it looks awesome but yeah I feel like this is something that you've definitely wear but you would just change certain elements do anything accessories yeah I really love this outfit though like I feel like this beret really feels like it's super trendy on the ball man you know like even Maria gratia cutie from Dior she did a whole collection on Berets and I mean you've been wearing it before you know like cute like very polished but still fun and elegant at the same time yeah thank you look great in this though what oh I love it have you worn this before no I haven't actually so you'll break it in right yeah definitely this is from current mood it's from dull to kill I went like I went really crazy on the outside yeah and just love doing that this is like borderline 101 dalmatians alright Cruella De Vil like a girl's layout wait a little bit more brave okay okay cool I'm like we're bold yeah like girl style I think having flash me would be really oh oh yeah oh my god I don't think I've ever seen you in something like this wait did you really wear this outfit yeah something you would wear I'll send you a picture yes this is like festival night out a period in my life where I do wear fishnets oh nice hot pink trends are coming back and you know beginning you again this is very late pump mm-hmm one I feel like I knew like blonde Mohawk I really right yeah I'm platform you mm-hmm mm-hmm this is like my fun bold edgy look yeah I feel like my style is really all over the place so yeah my Halloween stuff [Music] [Music] [Laughter] okay so this is the final outfit the girls night out one I freaking love this on you I've never seen anything like this on your body before so this really excites me right now so as you can see I really learned fall to the wall with this mesh top it is in this flashy yellow and then to make it more decent I threw in a plethora bralette with this cool metal harness I think it's very like bondage II but it makes it fun because we've got a nice zebra print to distract everything lastly is it gets cold I put this nice checkered faux fur coat on on me and then threw on some gold accessories to match with the gold cooler she already had on and then for shooters obviously look for some chunky black boots they kind of already have dogs ha but would a heel yeah [Music] how do you feel comfort scale comfort scale actually I feel really comfortable cuz everything is like high-waisted later and I feel like I'm showing skin but still covered with the layers and there's at first when you showed it to me I felt like it was too many patterns I thought I was going to clash but I think it makes it we're really really fun outfit like I want to just go raving or say yeah festival outfit or like a fait area look when you're when you really want to just like stand out and have fun vibe yeah don't you think I mean I feel like definitely something that I would find that like cool vintage snore in the mission definitely this is such a cool outfit it's something that I would like I would have never thought of it to wear but the pieces itself like the silhouettes is something that I really like I like the tight skirt doesn't I wasted I like crop tops paired with tight skirts and I love like a faux fur jacket especially if it has a pattern but I'd like to see it all together is very different for me I feel really really cool the bunny thing is like it's only as soon as I put on this outfit I felt like good and happy all those choices that you made for me I just felt happy and giddy in like I thought some type of way like go in a goodbye oh I feel like yeah I feel like seriously an African definitely trance when somebody's mood mm-hmm agrees okay would you go dancing in this outfit a hundred percent like this is not just your grocery shopping outfit you're definitely having a night like maybe staying out to 3 or 4 a.m. in this look this is really cool I kind of want to go to like we pride night yeah totally anyway guys thank you so much for watching and that was so much fun thank you so much for styling me oh also if you'd like to share which outfit was your favorite in the comments down below please do I had such a blast putting all me in my clothes [Music] [Music] 
hi guys it's amy from song of style and today i wanted to introduce you guys to a new series that i decided to do called friday favourites i want to share with you guys some of my favorite things that i've been loving the week of whether it's like beauty products certain apps that i really like and that i enjoy using music books quotes anything that's inspired me or that i've been easy for a very very long time this laura mercier eyebrow pencil has been my favorite I feel like it's really changed my eyebrow game the past couple years but look how disgusting this bull became because I always lose the caps likey over time you know my caps I always they like start falling out I found something that I like even more which is this Georgia Armani eyebrow pencil what I like about this is that the spool is kind of looks like a blade but it's not it's like a plastic spool looks like a little comb for your eyebrows it's easier to manipulate drawing strokes because the lead or the eyebrow pencil part is really thin and skinny whereas this one's much thicker so I mean I still love this don't get me wrong but now I find this eyebrow pencil a little bit more convenient so I've been using this a lot now that I live in my new house you're in my kitchen right now I've been trying to cook more it's really hard when I travel a lot and with my busy schedule it's hard to like grocery shops couple of like grocery food-related things that I really liked is one of this food service called blue aprons and what they are is basically there are like a delivery service so you tell them like I want to cook a meal for two for like three days then they send you just the ingredients for three days and then however many people you want to cook for and then the rest these are in there so so that you don't have to go to the grocery store yourself you don't have to buy the ingredients and it worked really well for me because of my travel schedule and then that actually Reese parked my love for cooking but it's trying to like cook more since now that I'm home for at least like a week and a half through Thanksgiving which is like awesome so I wanted to introduce you guys to two cookbooks that I just received so the first one is called cook beautiful the mystery in this book is just so beautiful I kind of like her little anecdotes throughout the book like you know I'm like wow it's so beautiful I try to cook one thing off of her recipe it didn't turn out that great I'm still an amateur chef and then the second book that I received is called Elsa's wholesome life I found out about Elsa through her twin sister Lauren who I went on a trip with so she has a cookbook she's vegan and she's like all about the healthy lifestyle and she sent me her button just like Athena's book the imagery is so beautiful but it's like slightly different when I'm traveling it's really hard to eat well and whatnot so I'm excited to try these books and I also wanted to talk to you guys about some of the clothing items that I've been wearing on repeat so on repeat on repeat repeat repeat so it's this red sweater I'm obsessed with this brand called Louann grace I ordered this sweater these two are both from blue and gray there was a pink sweater that I wore last weekend on Sunday I went to the Rose Bowl flea market and I posted an Instagram photo and everybody was going crazy about like oh my gosh where is that pink sweater from that sweater is also from LuAnn great and what I like about this sweater is it's so comfortable and it's so warm and the shape is so beautiful I really like this sweater like especially with the turtleneck and the sweater so much that I'm wearing this two days in a row so I find sweater shopping actually kind of deceiving especially when it's online you don't know how it's gonna fit sometimes sweaters can make you feel bulky or heavy or it's like scratchy itchy whatnot but I'm really pleasantly surprised that their sweaters are very comfortable the other thing that I'm really loving is velvet so last week when I was in New York with Armani I wore this like really beautiful velvet blazer it was from the Georgia Armani collection fall/winter 2017 I didn't wear anything inside because I wanted to look like why didn't I wear anything inside Oh first of all I didn't pack the right clothes like I had a t-shirt but I don't want to wear a t-shirt with the blazer because I wanted to keep the look very like chic but unfortunately I had to give it back because I was on loan so I wanted to share with you guys a few of my favorite velvet pieces so this was still I don't know how to pronounce a brand name it's Reysol or alice eve this brand you guys have seen me wear it in Paris during Fashion Week and I just love how luxurious this velvet blazer feels oh you also saw me wear the green version of this blazer during New York Fashion Week that's when I first were there pieces and it's so soft I love the color no velvet is huge for fall and winter so I highly recommend you guys stay with us in a nice velvet jacket the other one that I really really love you've seen me wear this throughout Fashion Week and just like on my normal days in LA is this giant long duster coat and this one was a collaboration between rosy pink and Whitley Whitley and Paige also so two things that I really love velvet jacket but also duster coats or kimono coats are like longer coats because I find them super easy to wear and another favorite of mine is this yellow velvet duster coat from Tularosa I wore this when I went to Disneyland everybody was asking me where it was from I'll link all the items below so it's easier for you guys to click on them another coat that I've been wearing a lot is this camel coat this one is from Ned Mishka and I really like the shape of this curve so I've been wearing this a lot especially in New York and another LA I feel like if you're going to buy just one coat I highly suggest investing in a camel coat because camel coats are will never go out of style so the thing about camel coats is my first sort of like first like favorite camel coat aside from my mom's Max Mara camel coat was the one that I found from Zara I believe it was a men's camel coat and then I bought a smaller size slightly like a darker shade I'll try to pull up a photo for you guys to see and it was beautiful it fit the job but it was a little too thin so it didn't keep me warm during like super cold winter months especially like if I wanted to go to like New York and wear it not what's not gonna happen and throughout the years I bought like cheaper versions of like the expensive chemical that I really wanted and then but in the end I kind of wasted all the money because I bought like three or four pieces and if I saved all of that and just invest it in one really nice camel coat I could have just but bought my dream camel coat so if you were to invest in any kind of coat I highly recommend in Anoushka camel coat or something similar I found some of my favorite chemicals that are worth investing and I link them below or you can check out on my blog song of style comm where every week we do a Friday

look like we're like a divorced what is there appreciated keep shooting nice our each today so far I think the weather is only like the temperatures will be about 30-something degrees but are just so windy and back on my favorite interview question possible [Music] if I'm really not happy about these pants you're sitting on stage no I swear I did yeah so regarding an ice cream it's free of everything which means it's healthy it's not free of sugar duh no we clearly means it's not happen maybe I ate those things it's like you need to know what you say pardon little we're ready eating go eat it first and everything tell me that it's unhealthy after I'm done eat so anyways one of the questions are I get asked the most from people is how do you make long-distance relationships work I think the longer time we've been away from each other is what three two months two weeks you're exaggerating again it's three weeks you always like exaggerate what's the opposite word of exaggerating minimizes a lot of things he do he does that with when we're walking to places and let's say it's like eight blocks away he tells me it's four blocks so where we said you have to multiply by two you do that all the time all the time baby because one weight equals like 13 days don't want minimizing singing Sanders anyways the question is is it the decision to do we move to LA oh yeah a public has moved into a new New York apartment really cool I'll just be like in today's world being away sometimes also gives me the time and the freedom to appreciate other things in the body life to progress through your career with your job to give yourself a little bit more time and do not project all of your visions all of your dreams all of your expectations on a single person every single day come on another thing I don't think it's bad you overcome being away from each other with spending really quality time when you have to where you are with the person and then you also focus on more things with it not with that person which gives more opportunities for both yeah it's preventive yeah I our relationship is a very modern relationship you know what I feel like this can't be going on forever of course most people sometimes mentioned that I'm either gonna comments they're like oh my god your boyfriend never approached us about you you must love him I know I just closed it yesterday my nature and stories oh I made it to Instagram to already I think it I think they can read filter without the batteries okay with your turn what your arms are longer you're closer okay now I'm a zombies piece because I wasn't I wasn't showing her affection yeah come on try I'm trying on me right by the head on beer ciao Yeo reum y'all need to be serious about maybe I never see you want a Marian she isn't her I want it I want a conversation I never said to be serious what you are say that I've talked about on long-distance relationship are ya know I'd feel like going in yesterday phone it's my up baby I wanted to talk about long-distance relationships about me it's like baby I wanted to give advices for people who have long distance okay I was giving them advices yeah but you always try to act all like toughen like macho yeah look at magical I was just explaining baby sure oh my God look at that result like all still trying so hard not to be negative the fog what are you talking about God complain Xu easy but you're sitting there what I just re-watched a bitter look like we're like a divorced watch we should see closer to me then next time you do a video maybe the camera is in the middle that's for the camera but good for me okay we will edit that part out exactly I'm sure it's not gonna be at it out people will object to yourself huh I like this I know and tigers present test I just woke up I wonder what is stark a fool yeah Kapusta de tul√©ar i love it it's the mirror that I compared on my bathroom counter good job y'all so cool [Music] I'm back at my favorite Cuban mental health cafe lagana which was my very first restaurant that I've ever eaten at in New York this exact same place where I decided to talk to my friend really can't believe everybody you really have to be here to tell her so I try not to be so upset so we're like internet profit or like wonder why so down I want to put out like great photos but I'm talking about a system where oh my gosh parsley is just literally like this and you like comment comment I'm not gonna check out like tell me like I said every photo I'm not going to settle for it if I'm satisfied with [Music] [Music] we're at my favorite alpha kind of couldn't sleep conjugate I found this like they're really generous with their own powers the ratio through one just how I like it three alpha cottage for one toast [Music] [Music] everyone is just to entice they need to save there's a little bit older out the subsidy house [Music] 
starting tomorrow Sophie and I are gonna go on a GM diet because we want to feel healthier and apparently it's like different body we just want to try it out there's not there's nothing wrong with trying it out right and I want to get better skin oh and oh yeah and then Jenny said it's good for our skin like apparently like your skin becomes really nice so like both of us meet that Sophie us I'm breaking out I've been breaking out a lot I feel like both of us haven't really been wearing makeup I'm gonna make up so yes some but we're trying to like wear less makeup flawless Peters so was i it and Rollins back to you guys are works or not does it look like I'm gonna finish this watermelon that I just bought ten minutes ago most likely get that watermelon juice shot watermelon juice day two on the GM diet I'm eating my Thanksgiving leftovers technically I don't think I'm supposed to eat quinoa but fuck it whatever I need some carbs eating my carrot sweet potatoes and vegetables and fish I actually don't think I'm supposed to eat fish either but whatever this GM diet of but is about to change to homie song diet um he sounds gonna eat though whatever the but she was I forgot to film what I eat in a day dinner edition so earlier I had an entire bag of sweet potatoes then dinner I went to Whole Foods got a bunch of salad stuff beets in it spring salad quinoa tabouli doesn't want to finish his I also put wild cam thank you for getting me flowers so technically I'm not supposed to eat any kinds of potatoes but I'm just hungry all the time even though I've been eating a lot so this diet is just mommy's diet doing whatever the hell she wants look how delicious these sweet potatoes look I love the one it's like kind of crispy and I don't know what when it kind of becomes caramelized mmm and I put some garlic minced garlic then I'm gonna put also this thing this is like my secret everything it makes everything taste so much more delicious everything but the bagel sesame seasoning blend but sea salt garlic and onion so maybe I was supposed to be on a diet should are you kidding how's the servings per container about twelve people honestly it was only like this much full half of it was like very sickly air day three is supposedly kind of healthy right only bananas three bananas no it's not getting every diet no it's of General Motors diet so apparently the today the people who worked at general mortars because they're always like on the computer not really working out like in front of a desk I guess they all gained a lot of weight it's like as a company and it's like I said one week diet and you lose weight but it's not really working out for me because I haven't been strictly on it so the first day you only eat fruit - bananas second day you only eat vegetables no fruit and then third day you mix fruit and vegetables but yesterday fucked it up because we had fun and then I had like and that you're not supposed to eat potatoes and I had six bags of floor six potatoes in that bag like the entire potato sweet potatoes as in today is only bananas but I fucked it up because I have four bananas that thing in the morning avocado tree peppers on and we're gonna go so basically it's I'm not on it anymore I think it's actually having a negative effect on because I'm eating I'm doing everything they told me to do plus more food yeah so I'm meeting more my thing is though like I need to I need some kind of like actual strict schedule like a extreme hardcore schedule in order for me to like quit eating chips if I didn't eat of a bag of chips and a bag of potatoes every single day I think my body would be decent not that it's not bad like not decent just that I've been gaining some weight so my jeans don't fit it's a little bit annoying I mean terribly Nanami why don't you leave the bottle in the car Tommy not big eyes but uh I'm just trying to be home grocery shopping where's auntie [Music] potato samosa balls and a bunch of salad and tuna and beets and mushroom now go put you rice and I'll grab the thing talking so y'all you're almost done vegan fudge brownies I've always craved a certain like something sweet what's your problem you don't need to lose weight but your real problem just like a I feel like you're the healthiest out of all you have like the most like resistance like when Sophie and I are munching on chips you're like no is that not good if you eat a pound of salmon oh shit Sophia sorry just stay away from me and you'll lose weight thank you for getting me food yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you could have some of my soup baby you know honey this might see you're gonna have to tell my Thomas that I ordered from prisoner for me I got pad thai with no peanut don't need a lot about that no it's this is what I ordered so obviously no more time that's not happening I decided that I'm just gonna eat certain healthy not eat a bag of chips I haven't eaten one batter not even a piece of trip today that's like major for me because normally I eat an entire bag of chips one Appetit whoever invented this is a genius so we try with no - chicken in it no it's not yeah it's chicken maybe no I'm no peanut ah I don't know Kim what you can no - put it away put it away [Music] so for those who don't know I'm a pescetarian I don't like meat I mean I eat meat but not like eight seafood and fish but no like chicken no read me nope or hell no support and then you series two chickens until my old housekeeper how you ate them I just can't but I don't judge people who eat it don't I try this if you don't do it myself you know mm-hmm there's a bug protein baby oh shit I think that just happened no no no this clearly was in this soup there's a dead bug in there how these are almost towards the end bitch at least I got all the mushroom good at least I only got everything I wanted to eat before I saw that as soon as long as I see it later I'm okay I even labeled a no mosquito in the soup huh bullshit you just so eat it at least I ate all my coke was green tongue no no soup are green curry was nice enough to let me eat his now you can see he could eat my pad thai before and then I have this it was too hard to eat new geography because I was just making a mess on my other jacket I didn't realize eating pomegranates just so hard such a work well apparently it's good for the skin and after I eat dinner always craves them too sweet instead of eating like my usual piece of chocolate or bag of chips I'm going to eat this for trying to stay healthy you know but somebody left me a comment on one of my older videos from Indonesia I think I forgot which video it was but I said something about me trying to cut out sugar that's why I'm eating a lot of fruit and they're like fruit is the lot of sugar did you know that it is a lot of sugar you guys so I'm trying to not overeat fruit that's good but it's only good if you eat it eat in moderation I don't eat in moderation so my thing is I'm trying to eat everything in moderation trying to not to overeat right mm-hmm I'll see how it works out good morning worked out this morning cuz I'm about that healthy life you know and I'm gonna make a smoothie that's gonna be my first thing that I eat this morning well I had coffee before but I was drinking oops well this is six servings per container six I usually put like one-third of it but I accidentally put two-thirds of it all right this thing is confident my god blend powered by no makeup three my person using it like three tablespoons I think I just put about two because I'm going to come more [Applause] [Music] your necesito hard one by the way what I love about this machine is that it's so aggressive but it liquefies everything instantly super strong mmm smells delicioso so it makes about two servings obviously because I put too much coconut milk but I kill it that's my breakfast I just got an email from Bonita who's my partner my best friend bought the t-shirt line so you know two songs my sister and I have a t-shirt line we don't spend too much time around it we only when we have something like we're passionate about we like imma put the t-shirt and then 50% of the proceeds of that t-shirt goes directly to charity and so far the loved ones t-shirt like we sold a bunch of it and half of it which is about like five thousand ninety seven dollars and fifty cents is gonna go directly to Trevor Project it's just going to eat well from her so I'm excited about that and she's saying so many people are asking about the stuff in the girl power of Eddie would you guys want me to every stop the girl power hoodie I think sorry it's a pretty cool I did no longer on the diet anymore as I mentioned before but I'm trying to be healthy right now since I had the giant smoothie for breakfast um I'm not that hungry it's about noon I'm headed to Jen's apartment or Jen's house because we're doing a collaboration video coming soon coming to YouTube near you and since I'm going straight to her house I don't really have time to eat but I'm not that hungry so I packed for banana has already had one just now I had to this morning my carrots these have a lot of protein and healthy fat in them nothing I'm Sophie on the other hand she's still on the diet you guys said she said she feels a difference in her body so you do know my way for skinnier your waist is skinnier wish you forgot to pack her food so it seems like I must I might have to share my bananas with her my brown bananas because like today is all banana debris right yeah how many bananas have you had so far I have had one yeah one yeah you didn't eat breakfast no but I am going to eat six to eight today how many are you supposed to eat six to eight six to eight so I haven't had a card for over two years my own car so I've been overing borrowing my sister's cars like Donny's car which had a card she does have a card you know so I would just borrow my dad's car for the past two years especially because I I'm never really in LA so I don't really need to drive and then my office to my house is really close so sometimes I bike all right just uber and now I finally got a car a brand spanking new Volvo I'm in love with this car it smells so nice but more than that obviously like the features are beautiful it runs so smoothly and then like look at the interior like my brand spanking new interior my favorite part about this car is definitely that the speaker the music the sound system it's incredible it feels like my so knows but yeah I'm super excited about my car same day different jacket it got too hot it started out so cold earlier and then now it's now it's 75 degrees so it was a little bit too ridiculous it wears a giant fur jacket faux fur jacket so I got really hungry so we got more bananas blueberries so the blueberries a mini I eat a pack of these or half of these every morning whenever I make my smoothie with a banana almond milk for Sophia because tomorrow she could only drink almond milk and tomatoes or something in beef I don't know how she's still doing that diet and then I got quinoa salad garlic hummus and then Jakob was just texted me saying that he has a headache so it kind of feels like Rocco and I are living together but we're just spending time together here since he's in LA for a shoot and obviously to spend time with me oh by the way the reason there's no home tour yet is because honestly my house isn't even done I haven't even hung that art the Sun rooms not done it's just like the dogs dead right now the kitchen is done the bedroom I didn't even have a bed up until literally like five minutes ago I still don't have a mattress so I am so sorry house two are coming soon I just want it to be amazing you know I don't want to show you guys like a half half house you know I I spent so much time and effort you know remodeling it making it look nice so I want to show you guys the furnished house and I know it it all probably never be complete you know good things take time but I will show you guys a house tour very very soon I just want to at least have like the bed situated and like have like my lights installed so the light that I really really want it just takes forever like my bathroom I still don't really have a light I have like the recessed lighting but no sconces or anything and I want to I want everything to be perfect while I was out filming I finally got the bed delivered so I'm going to be seeing it for the first time I'm super excited so I'll show you a sneak peek of the bed whoa okay so no mattress whoa it's huge I've never had a king-sized bed for dinner I'm eating spaghetti squash with tomato and she's on top some tomato it's a mushroom boletaria oh yeah much conversion so that's what I'm eating for dinner holy shit this spaghetti squash delicious goodness Jenny [Music] thank you and then I've been right gentlemen offers the entire lease plate and berries for me since I'm trying to pay for breakfast this morning my last morning with him escape notice my last morning yeah for two days I'm very heartbroken anyways I'm leaving in avocados yeah proposed drought half of it is mine the rest you can keep no you know half of it is mine off well then I'll order another one now I don't like sharing my favorite spots because if becomes so popular it that I have to wait so long to just sit and eat and then the service declines like for an example Jonathan binney's used to be my favorite place just takes forever to get a table like I don't want to be selfish and not share but [Music] you 
hey guys it's Augie from flying style and today I wanted to show you guys to do the move my closet so this is like the most requested video that I have for me guys a closet tour and the closet and basically done all the cabinets are in it's a fully functional closet and I mean the only thing that I don't have in the chandelier that a one I haven't got the actual lighting for my closet and for those who see my previous closet video I'll link it right here or here you know that I turned an extra letter into an entire closet so in the previous house I lived in a three-bedroom and the master bedroom was the manager but the two extra letters wanted to knit into a fool like walking of wardrobe closet and then the other room was like the accessory storage closet and when I moved into this new house I felt bad turning with nice bedrooms into a closet I mean if you see the first videos of my remember but this palace this master bedroom didn't really have fun walking closet it hasn't built in closet space in the bedroom like this and different isn't Sun and all but so this is all this thing but I didn't have an actual walk-in closet because I mean a girl's random raw storage space like Cara got out then I don't need a bleep creme okay there right so basically in order to fit all my clothes in this closet I have to purge a lot I been selling so many of my clothes on this website calls X here all link it below so you guys can shop so a lot of my high-end pieces like designer pieces are sold there and then another like shopping marketplace I'm selling my clothes is called D pop and I'll also link that here below the description so you guys can shop my closet all the closings go directly to Eternity so like further cost so all the cabinetry in the closet is from this company called California closet at order to get a turn of it but there were like the most amazing people to work with whatever really liked about them was how efficient and professional their work from beginning to end I think from designing it took like one day to design this motion because I knew exactly how I wanted the closet to be so before I went into their showroom I did a blue tent or I did a floor plan of what I wanted and then I told them like I have so much done in finder water broke we're done it and have tons of shoes I need like lots of room for shoes and for me like the first thing when you walk into the closet is I want to see all of my shoes and things you'll notice that my closet has gotten as much small to compare like the last closet or but all my like flats well pillars here my wife sauces are here you know I love my wife houses and then like they're all just color-coordinated to like the stripes to blues the colors and then like my Blazers and light jackets are in here sanim jackets are here leather judges are here and when I was residing I knew I had a lot of dresses so we planned it out that way so like these are all like the long hanging pieces right here so all my dresses because I'm are mr. self-portrait I try to color coordinate but it's hard I just it just becomes in that and then I also I knew I was going in work shoe storage so I have my shoes right here and then these are all organized five types of shoes so the great thing about these shelves are they're like removable so let's say I have like taller boots and I could remove the shelf and then they have like these pegs so I could like please them however I want to put them so it's a custom closet but it's still customizable offers you get your closet install which is my favorite part because growth I have options I'm going to continue to get more shoes and continue to like rearrange things until you have the topics are on the bottom and then these are all color-coordinated so it becomes here exist this side and this side are not symmetrical the width is metrical but the individual shelf height is not symmetric cards you can tell because these are like the color suits or like the ankles and and these are like this smaller like palms lower heels like right little mini times can kneel and then in order to fit as many shoes into this little knot little bit like limited space the way we organize the shoes are instead of putting them two together like this I have one back and one front so that I could send more shoes here because if I were to put all them like this I wouldn't be able to have enough space and then I also have like me sneakers my slides and then all of my denim so in order to fit as many denim as I can I have to like really really try out well first I got rid of a lot of Dennis and then these are right just my favorite sentence I kept but I could have part ways with and also there I try to organize them by color and type so like darker washes on the bottom like the black denim right here and then you know it's is arranged by color and then like the miniskirts are here the denim shorts are here I mean I'm a California girl so girls got to have denim shorts and denim skirts and a lot of options and then wear my leather pieces are here necks are here so right now it's summer so I know I'm not going to wear a lot of flutters so the thing that I don't wear at the moment I'm going to keep them up there because it's harder to reach and then all my t-shirts are right here so my son my graphic t-shirts are here these are most of these are like my shop Tucson t-shirt so you know I created this loved-ones t-shirt to benefit Trevor Project and of course myself love tea so this is the newest design from shop to sponsors like it's the newest colorway for me I'm all about the fit and I love the fit of this key slightly boxy not super tight but I wouldn't say it's super oversized or anything and it's so important so on my previous video when I was in Paris I talked about my struggles with like mental illness or like depression and I was also wearing a self-love tea and so many of you guys inquired about it and it's sold out like months ago and I just lied her like you know to raise more awareness to bring back the self love tea but this time in different colors so I brought it out in black white and also pink the same shade of pink that we did the Rose tips tea because everybody loved it so also link that below the way you guys can shop and as you can see I have a stack of slippers so yes I'm one of those people that go to hotel rooms and steal all the slippers and ask for more slippers because I am Asian and when I go inside the house I take my shoes off they're dirty you know how many germs are all those shoes so I don't wear my shoes inside the house true story and it's a funny story for what ain't it play with Barbies I would make sure all the Barbies took their shoes off before they entered the firehouse that's the type of person I am so of a bunch of surfers nice hotel slippers for all my guests and myself recently I've been really into working out I can't believe I'm saying this because I used to hate working out like the thought of working out will make me feel so dreadful and I mean I am just loving it right now so all my gym clothes are here like my gym leggings so this is a brand new legging that I got and it's from Coral I think it's called coral yeah they make really cute like gym clothes and has pockets I haven't worn it yet I wore one of the other designs before this took a while to come but it's so worth it how beautiful is this I didn't want to get drawer handles because I felt like it was clash with the front of the drawer so I want to show you guys how I opened this I just push and then tada and then these are all like my bras and then I have like my pajamas in here I'm obsessed with silk pajamas so these are all my silk pajamas this one is like one of the newest one that I got I haven't worn it yet but it's from this round called SN so so soft so I have their shorter version and I loved it so much so I just got like the longer version this is just so pretty I tend to wear like the same exact pajamas every single day like and every like for a week I'll wear the same one at night is our groom to wear the same exact pajamas for one week but I shower at night so I think it's not so gross because I can clean and I wear it and then in the morning how cute so I got this for my little niece I have a niece her name is Gia and she lives in Korea and when I wasn't either in Tokyo Kyoto I got this for her and but last time I went to curry I forgot to give it to her so this is my sock drawer when I was in Kyoto is about this look how cute these socks are I haven't worn them yet I just think they're so cute and then I also have like really smell fancy sparkly socks either for melodious sunny was a good friend of mine and then a lot of my sunglasses are here so you know me and sunglasses I have a huge collection of sunglasses but right now I can't really like just display everything out here because it won't say so these are just some of the sunglasses I'm wearing a lot to do you must sold out sentimos your sunglasses that are now back in stock and Nordstrom Seldon MIT well I think I'm falling in love with you this like always just parks or is it just hard when the kid got help wha-ha-ha that's what he got to do that I feel is desperate but so all my handbags are up here and I didn't realize this before but I have a lot of socks so yeah they're all like up here organized really well by type and size so all my teeth on like the box here pieces are up here like the boxy mini buy some like the 16 all - I need the selenium box bag I think the most recent act that I got was from selling when I was in Paris this is like one of my favorite vibe it's from Lou Vuitton and actually didn't go into production it was only for the runway and it would discuss it from the house and I love this book so much the petite mom and just the color homework so beautiful everybody asks about it right now these two guys are the ones that I carry a lot it was fyf you old festival so for like concerts and whatnot I like backpacks because they're easy to carry around and this one's from Chloe it's the mini fave a something just so cute and I can also wear it as a handbag and then this one is from Louboutin and I like it cuz I think it's supposed to be like a megaphone but I carry it is just so easy to carry and it goes with everything so if you were to invest in like one bag the grand I would recommend would be would be don't I think it's the most classic luxury band that's out there we'll never ever ever go out of style because they don't do anything like too creepy I always feeling it's super classic even with this slightly trend ear pieces like the 15 ball where they come let's come up with like different combos I still think they're so classic that they're never going to go out of style and then if you like things that are slightly more trendy in season eight I always recommend Chloe so more bands up here and then all my hat are affair I think I need a better solution on arranging hats right now I don't really have lost face but ideally I would like to like hang them so I could see the hats because sometimes I forget what has to happen just like all the way up there so I tend to wear like no hats or I wear the same task over and over again my most recent purchase where they swap more on heels ah they're so beautiful I haven't worn them yet I was going to wear them to a party but I decided my outfit didn't go with the healed but how I'm planning to wear these would be with like denim or even with like an all-black outfit soap operas like pink going on here I just have filled my accessory so right now I'm really obsessed I keep saying the word upset but I wear like I'm always wearing gold earrings and at the moment like you guys always ask me about who makes these earrings but there's some family love so either wear these earrings all the time or these these were only I think like $50 and they're 14-karat gold or gold plated so because I say this Ohio maintenance especially like around my ears like I always swell up if I wear anything that's a costume but right now these I've been wearing them for like the past few days straight my ears are totally fine and the funny thing is that Pamela loves these earrings I don't think they're fine jewelry I might be wrong but I don't think they were fine jewelry but they don't disturb my ears so I did just high-quality jewelry is different the other called thing about this closet is so I have these little pegs right I haven't really done much but you can just like put it in and that's how it organized my jewelry I don't know if this was intention for it but that's how I use it I want to say I want to take all the credit for organizing this closet and making this look so spectacular but I have to give a shout out to my amazing assistant Jessica who basically helped me organize this closet and make this look beautiful and then also Darlene from California closet she was the one who helped me organize all the shoes thank you guys this video is not sponsored but I just left help on

hello from Seoul it is 12:30 a.m. Pacific and this is Amy's song I'm going to find the articles that period grams equals the pain of a heart attack period pains can be as bad as a heart attack period pain is essentially as bad of a heart attack so why have doctors in northern expert compares parry pain to a heart attack well you feel tired imagine losing blood well you let's say you cut your finger and you're like losing blood don't you feel like you're feeling nauseous and like you're like oh that's how I feel what's up guys it's obvious in science style and today I am reporting live well not really live here it is live but it's actually required anyways I am in Seoul and I came here with Louboutin for their vvv exhibition which is voulez-vous gay William how do you say it again volley vogue a Voyager exhibition and it was my second time seeing exhibition the first time was in Tokyo and the second time is here in Seoul and they brought it to Seoul so I'm here for that and no soul trip is ever complete without a bunch of shopping especially beauty shopping and all these like little knickknacks every time I travel to Seoul or wherever usually especially Seoul I always make sure half of my suitcase is empty because I know I want to buy a lot of things so I'm going to show you guys what I got while I was here so the first day I arrived in Seoul I'm sitting at this hotel called Shula hotel and it's beautiful I've never stayed here before and I think it might be one of my favorite hotels I've stayed at - of food because they don't have avocado and then breakfast buffet I live for a breakfast buffet but their menu at the breakfast buffet is a little bit it's not as like diverse so if you don't eat as much as I do you will love this hotel but I really like the interior of this hotel and then the decoration of this plate because they use a lot of wood and I feel like it looks very Korean I arrived in my hotel room with some gifts from Louboutin so I'll show you guys that first so a disclaimer first this is not a sponsored video but this was a sponsored trip by my Louboutin family and some of the things that I'm going to show you guys were gifted so I'll call those out that were gifted but majority of the items I purchased myself so when I got to the hotel I have these waiting for me so we don't always does like these little cool travel city guidebooks and this one is soul and I think I have several of these and they are so useful and insightful because they tell you like where do visit what museums to go to like what's cool places I couldn't like shop bad and then they also have like an insider's guide I mean the insider is usually like a celebrity or somebody we really like well-known in that city so I thought this was cool and then they have like restaurants shopping beauty etc this was a present from Louboutin and what was really cool about this is you know like usually when maybe done does like a fashion show they usually send you give you an invite and like a really nice envelope but this time it was this which I thought was really cool so I could like put my beauty products or carry it as a clutch and then also Ragab instead I have it opened it yet how cool it's like a little this is the same thing the BBB and then at the dinners they have this on all of our place cards on the bag there's like a little I don't know if he's a teddy bear or a lion but I guess believe he's a character from Kakao Talk which is like the biggest messenger app in South Korea if you happen to be in Seoul during the BBB exhibition I highly recommend that you guys go to DDP and sees exhibition because at the end there's a special surprise for you that has to do with Kakao Talk I won't ruin the surprise especially poachy so that's it from wreath all this I got from the cafe um so one of the days I shot with Elle Korea and while shooting at Elle Korea we went to this area called X handle which is also cool place for hipsters to go to so there are a lot of cool cafes and cool restaurants dessert places and then like few shopping but it's in a very traditional looking village so at one of the coffee shops that I went to they have this like cool artwork around I thought it was funny because it's like this lady in a traditional Korean outfit but she's like very like in a seductive pose the postcard so everybody's favorite is my personal favorite every time I'm in Korea this is what I'm most excited about beauty products so I went to this place called Jung which is kind of like a smaller Sephora it of Korea where they have a bunch of different beauty brands and a lot of them are actually affordable so one of the first things I got was I got this which is like a lip liner set so Brandis aunt and Park you know I love my lip liners but me being typical oggi song I forgot all of my lip liners and lost all event because you're so skinny and they just like fall around or fall out of my purse so I desperately needed a lip liner and this is the color I'm using right now I don't even know if you can get this in America hopefully you can or maybe one of those cool Korean retail Beauty sites have it the thing is so this is a lip liner on one side but it's not like the typical lip liner because it's not sharp and there's no way of sharpening it but I still outline my lips and colored it in and then there's like a sponge on the other side and you just like spread it out I really like the color I thought just was really funny I also bought oh my gosh so after right after I bought some beauty products from the store at a lot olive and young in front of Olive and young there were like these little like carts or stand where people were selling things some stands were selling like dollar socks and then there is an other scan that's like guys tongue so guys time is like a height extender and the secret between Korean celebrities is a lot of them use this inside their shoots so it's like a height extender so basically you can put them in your shoes if especially if you're wearing like flats or boots and then you're instantly like an inch taller I mean I'm not short but hello who doesn't want to be taller oh I know this is funny cuz they gave me this and this back in this like fake Louboutins monogrammed pocket bag but if you look carefully it says la in the middle there's like me see the LA logo and then I got some mask oh so during the dinner there's I was asking everybody what math days and what beauty products they use and two different people recommended this brand Medi heal so when I went to olivine yard I try to get anything that said Medi he'll also this this this one was a little bit more expensive because not only is it a sheet Mouse but there's some kind of essence or liquid thing it's called ampoule inside the sheet mask so you put this first and then you put this the other thing I got were these like eyebrow shaving tools we sell it in America too but it was a lot cheaper in Korea so I got these and then the other thing I got was this thing called peri's ink velvet so they're kind of like a lip tint so you put it on your lips and it kind of stains it I noticed a lot of Korean girls have like these really pretty lip color and the colors are so vibrant they're different from lipsticks and I kept on asking everybody what is that and it looked really cool what's cool about Korean beauty sources they just give you a lot of samples so these are just different samples that they gave me by the way this is like one of my biggest pet peeve which is wearing normal clothes like outside clothes and sitting on my bed with all these products I would never ever do this in my own bedroom and the only reason during it here is the disc bedroom is like the only spa where I can get like at least enough light to film this and then also it's really warm in Seoul so I'm not going to use a blanket tonight I just feel like there's so many germs you know because I've been outside wearing these jeans oh and then I went to a beauty product store so there's this one lady that I saw she had really beautiful clean skin and I asked her what she uses and she recommended this product this is a Korean brand called Harris I have didn't sell it at Olive annyeong so I actually went to a Harris store and it's a little bit more expensive than like a normal toner so it's called Asia way vitalizing water which is basically a toner or in korean soup can so this is kind of like your step one and your beauty routine after cleansing the first thing that you put on your face and in Korea they do this thing called 7 step 7 seven toner so apparently you put the toner seven times on your face you're layering it seven times but the lady that was telling me about this product she says she does it like three or four times so instead of putting the toner on her face once or this revitalizing water once on your face you put it four times on your face over and over and over and over again another beauty product that I bought today was this man called harmless ooh so this brand I heard about this brand from my friend Jenny because she's like a beauty junkie and she uses a lot of Korean beauty products and then by chance a few years ago maybe about two or three years ago I got to work with them and there were this brand was my very first cushion perfecting crescentus foundation so it's like a compact cushion foundation where the foundation is inside and then you use this little cushion press it onto your face and it's like super moisturizing and it gives you really great coverage and the number i'm using is number 25 deep beige and then when I bought this he gave me a lot of things for free that's what I really like about Korean PD stories if you buy one thing they just give you a bunch of little things this was actually a gift from my best friend Jenny so she just did a collaboration with his Korean background handbag brand called toes Tovah tobu pulpit and I thought it was so cute I saw her wearing it I even know she did a collaboration until I complimented her hand back and then she said she just designed this I don't know if it's available yet because she said it was her first sample but she gave it to me um she's the best and what's really nice about this bag is 50% of the proceeds go directly to an orphanage and then this little mini coin wallet situation by the way I've been speaking so much Korean here that my English is kind of bad right now and it's really late we came back from Busan today so it's been a long day Oh another reason one was so tired today I started my period but this is a Korean brand so I started my period and you know that feeling when you wait into your person realize you don't have any tampons or pads yep I know Yahoo will can't relate but I know you girls can relate to me that moment when you realize you ran out of the essentials the nest subsidy and you're like this but thankfully there was a 7-eleven right around the corner so we went to 7-eleven they didn't have any tampons so I got this it says children if game feels good that's the name of the brand so and it's a magic cushion I don't know what that means but the pad has wings which I like so I went to gentle monster after I came back from Busan today for those who know gentle monsters are my favorite Korean some wax brand they're probably one of my favorite sunglass brands ever I got an opportunity to design a pair of sunglasses well one pair in four different colorways and it became one two three four best-selling item on their website and in store which is super exciting for me and thank you so much for all of your support and also if you haven't caught the pair make sure to go to gentle monster calm or to your local gentle monster in cup repair it's called the US 101 sunglasses anyway so I got to see their store in Hongdae whole day and I hopped a new pair which is less fun so right now my current favorite sunglasses other than the one that I always wear from my own collection with gentle monster are the de Oro surreal sunglasses it's like the color lens which I really really like super easy light and I just feel like it's really on trend right now so I got a different version of that like AK another color lunch and I like it because it's oversized and I like anything that's oversized and the other thing is that is the silver frame because I don't have any silver frame sunglasses and it's in pink I don't have any pair of pink sunglasses so I got these and my sister Johnny she got a yellow one in a slightly different shape my dad used to call me a full moon we're a little tired tired pop star like there's a song that he sings alright guys I'm going down something I forgot what it's called basically is saying like my daughter's face is like the full moon that's like that oh little ma so this one was actually a gift so the gentle monster sunglasses word gift the beetle to get but everything L basically I bought oh this is a gift and then this one was also a gift so basically it's like a cell phone case and they also do custom what are they called I can't think I've been speaking too much Korean in Korea now I can't really speak English custom embroidered no custom monogram still kind of like monogram but not really this is monogram what it is call anyways they just like stamp your name whatever you want and this one says gangsta because I feel like a gangsta sometimes it's hard to be super excited and everything when Jakub was there slices so I just feel like this video might be very boring because I'm putting them to sleep but I really hope it's not boring and if it's boring you guys just let me know that it was boring and I won't ever do a video like this again or if it's really awesome and want me to do more videos like this please give me a thumbs up and tell me that it's a good video and to be honest I don't know what I'm talking about but I am out I love you guys thank you chuckles either going to I'm going to wake up I mean boring so I forgot to tell you guys about this product I went to the pharmacy and then I was just like looking through the aisles at the pharmacy and then I was like what is that and then I saw this and I was like giggle well so that means like what is this and they're like it's like a massage thing so you just go insist so my favorite thing about sleeping with a couple whiskey is a massage but my favorite singer by oculus cake honestly like long distance relationships are hard because there's no way to give you a massage inmate okay 
so today's vlog is basically all about like what goes behind song Estrella how do we get ready each of our blog posts like what do we do [Music] these are samples they're a size bigger than what I normally wear do you know how to do it I'll show you you go in and then out I can't see myself right now just like if you could not like that but and then you have to like yeah so it holds the shape also fair now you're a pro now you can be a tailor I like this more it's easier I like dresses shares are still tribal I love this sweater like how major is this it's like more like the other ones dressier for sure we like this one more show outfit when we're doing like the makeup and like what's in your bag is it helpful if I like have it listed out in the video or would you is I like too much graphics I feel like that's too much also like a known thing to have problems and discussions of people know to type into description I just think it's also a little fast yeah you type it out like you forgot to pause the video mm-hmm because like sometimes I wonder cuz I have a lot of international readers if I'm talking too fast if they're able to like get what I'm saying would you guys want me to put graphics like let's say I'm doing like what's in my bag would you want to see like graphics on the video or would you guys do you guys always read it in the description box leave a comment below

once so pretty and it has like these rhinestones that say Christian Dior do we like this oh yeah diora just makes you feel so beautiful and so special my I don't like too big you guys to Bowl up shoeless you know what's the most annoying thing remember that one time I don't yeah like I don't know if that ever happens like you save food and you put in the refrigerator and that's cool you're thinking about your leftovers you think about an entire time like oh when I get home I'm gonna eat like whatever and then you go home and then the refrigerator it's not there anymore it happens to me all the time it's what you're talking with you guys and it goes you've done that to me Oh heart feel tired and feel like giving up you find a purpose reason and motivation to keep pushing through so this is our process of making videos I'll give him my notes like this is what I want to include and then Nicolas like films usually films and then edits it and then we go through your first round of edits like this is no let's not do this let's not do that and then like we edit it again and then we added it again but usually I mean Nicolas is amazing obviously he's like the most amazing human being ever because you always want to work with people that are better than you but Nikko's doesn't like to like listen he doesn't like to a he doesn't like to take notes be he tries to remember it see I tell him to take notes and he takes notes but he doesn't like to like take it in he looks sudden he's like okay whatever Roman I'll get like distracted like editing him another part of it and then don't think that I like did it and then I move on to the next one and then that's the problem with creative people they get many we have so many ideas we're both creative so it's really hard to stay organized thank goodness for Sophia who's actually helping us be more organized right and then there's so many different personalities that we're working on one thing then we talk about another and then we have like Erica who loves to talk about her own personal things all the time so we love like we know about each other like way too much niggas always says if I ever talk about myself a little more than like two minutes and it goes about doing the erica whatever so I have to repeat what I said cuz they said this is a real on me so I just love eating so much and when I love somebody a lot I do share so I said I love you guys so much and they're three of them here there's me and then there's Sophia Erica and Nicholas so I was like since I love you guys a lot I'll give you 183 share what you feel in love cuz cuz you know I've never shared when do I ever share food if I ever shares what that means I really really love you or that means it's not delicious like what just happened

we pull the girls into the highlight and then it's Sophia's basically it's her first time in New York so that's why we brought her to the West Village she's never been to the West Village and we thought you would like the Sex in the City stairs but turns out she's she saw Sex in the City for the first time yesterday and you know what she said she said she's too young for it I mean girl she ain't too young for that mean she just doesn't care about fashion in New York what did you say about Sex in the City doesn't that old no she looks so old I can't really when I was ten okay actually okay when I was really young English not my first language ice and that they only played it at twelve in the midnight so I thought is adult content it is a dog content cuz my mom wouldn't let me watch

chunk of it and on its alert Erica's younger than Sophia [Laughter] [Laughter] [Music] Eva Chen you mean so much to both of us we're just reminiscing about my first time my first encounter with you

public school in the morning I did a lot of things um what did I do after public school oh I went to see my friend who's in the hospital so I kind of want to talk about this so one of my best friend is in the hospital and it's affecting me a lot because it's my best friend I'm gonna talk about my highs and lows today because that's what I always do I always try to think about my highs of the day and then the lows of the day cuz no matter what kind of day you're having there is going to be a high and low of that day so first of all my low is like at the show there's just this incident where this girl was like very rude and mean to me and it this isn't the first time it's happened so that was my lowest moment and like my stomach was like and then I might have dropped a few tears when I was telling my friend my hi moment though is seeing my friend who's in the hospital and I'm not gonna name who this friend is at the moment but I'm so happy that my friend is doing better and every day I've been visiting my friend and it's been really like affecting me a lot because this person means so much to me and I just want to be there for this person but like seeing this person like smile and get better is making me very happy so that was my high moment too cuz everyday I'll asked how do you feel and my friend wasn't doing well at all but today he said he feels hopeful which was really

hey guys it's ami from song Italian today I'm with Katy with a licensed therapist I met her last week at Louise's girl love event and they were here at the Amanda foundation and this is where you can adopt dogs or volunteer you get to find puppies and we filmed a lot of cool content on community channel so make sure to check it out I'll link it below so you can find our Channel and today we're going to talk about how to relieve stress you know and just how to talk about problems yeah how to improve how to improve and be happier for me one way is having my dog and hanging out with my dog actually relieve my stress sometimes it can be stressful and charcoal like digs into the trash can in the end like everything out yeah but I mean after once I clean it I mean like the upside is insane it's like there's so many numerous benefits for me personally but what are some other ways that people can relieve stress and happier there are a bunch of different things I mean when it comes to animals the reason that it does so so good for some reason our body when we're around animals and we pet them like the sensation of petting releases oxytocin which is like that who we don't know why we feel good but when you feel like loving or trusting towards someone it gives you that emotion that even sation so it helps reduce your blood pressure and make you feel better overall that makes so much fun sometimes I like touch people yes and I as a kid I used to love it I had to go to church at the commit oh my grandma would close my hair and it was like the reason I could sit still Kairi like always so nice yeah it just feels amazing yeah and so that actually has like benefits for our mood but also the fact that getting outside for 20 minutes a day imprisonment of vitamin D is really important and walking a dog because they need to be out you need to walk the multiple times a day it gives you that 20 minutes outside and that could help you feel better another tip that something you can do no matter where you are is simple breathing exercises if you feel yourself getting mixed oh yeah it all been in those situations where you're really uncomfortable or you don't know anybody or you just were even like stress about having to perform you can breathe in we call it four by four breathing free them for four hold it for four reach out throw a try we can talk okay you ready I feel like I was wandering the floor it was even get the idea it's something you can do no matter where you are you can do it through your nose - if the worried people are going to notice but overall just knowing that it's okay to feel how you feel we all get stressed we all have downtime depression and anxiety are very common and that's why finding a therapist if you do need help I mean I see a therapist there's you know it she's been super beneficial super helpful for me and just talking things out you don't have to be at the end of your rope to get help yeah the sooner we reach out no sooner we start talking to someone the better I feel like the biggest misconception is that therapy is taboo like you feel like there's something wrong with you and mental illness is like something that's not normal I think it just becomes more painful you know and when I release that video and talked about my problems it's all like this heavy thing just got lifted off my shoulders yeah and I feel like it's always so important for people to talk to you talk about their problems you're not like every day to just like random people but like find a specialist find a therapy other psychiatrist I call you and even friends and family great support like I don't want to discount that at all cuz I know not everybody has access to therapy and it can be hard to find life to be hard to afford it but having someone to talk to because keeping it in it only builds from there we all know trust me with all done like Spiral we're like oh my god is enough oh my and if it works or more versus talking it out and realizing oh I'm just worrying about stuff that isn't actually that big of a deal it'll be okay one thing at a time cause you can just give us some perspective and being super beneficial yeah and the truth is like regarding like therapy being taboo or there's a stigma associated with mental illness we all have a mental health you don't say anything your friends were going to get a check-up at their doctor going to get a physical we should get you know our mental health checked out sometimes too and I think that just goes it's health it's my whole motto on my channel healthy mind healthy body I your because it's fully connected and I'm not feeling like okay and sound mentally I can't get anything done that I want to get done and it's hard for me to connect with people and reach out because I'm so caught in right oh yeah just like if I feel fit physically I can't do anything either I know that it's okay to have to take care of your full self and I feel like another way to relieve your stress is maybe just like writing out what has been bernalillo yeah like that's helped me tremendously like having a blog and in turn are more like all these different social media platforms and being able to share and like share my thoughts has really come alive yeah I mean outlook is wonderful I always tell people if you don't know where to start with journaling just bullet points I'm drawing a thought down here and there it doesn't have to be like dear diary today I got up and shower you don't have to do it that intentionally yeah getting some of it out you know today was a rough day you know I had trouble getting on the bed but I did or whatever it's okay to just start where you are do you meditate in the morning I I haven't done recently I'm going to be honest I could totally pretend that I still was but it's something that I'm trying yeah and I find to be really helpful I don't meditate like I so hard to turn your brain off like a few minutes like is it so hard for what I do every morning and so I have an alarm every morning and I label all my alarm clocks on my iPhone no one would be like five things are grateful for all that wonderful will be like be happy no Shelley that's and what's what you're doing is like what I teach is like PvP fair okay and like CBT cognitive behavioral therapy and it's like just changing our thoughts because our thoughts are so powerful yeah and something that I do try to do is I'm having let's say a bad body thing I gotta feel like a big big turd I'll always tell myself like no thank you that I have all my fingers it works but I can do yeah the computer worked at my job yeah failed my feet get me around my lab work and it's like those five graceful things it could be anything as simple as you know I can ski now that has that ability Thanks thank you body yeah where you know the same like I have these friends and I'm thankful for that or anything it really changes be surprised try it for a week five things a day that you're grateful for to change your life yeah and another thing I do is every day I have like my high end moments you know every single night before I see if I try to think what was a highest thing that happened to me like Maya doesn't like some such thing that happened to me you can always point something that happens during that being no matter how bad of a data is like one that you're really grateful for and then you also think about what's below you know you know that you you become lovable and you can access it you know like in grow so now I need to grow from it you know low moments aren't necessarily bad because without low moments how are you going to appreciate the higher yeah no it's true and it's important to be able to accept all of it are we public with all feelings are ok we can't just be happy is excited about everything we can be upset with any bad we can be angry those are all fine too and if when we shut them down and we don't allow ourselves to recognize the lows yeah I want to get harder and we like explode or not we don't want to add it's like our boyfriend or husband and whatever out of the blue it's because we can't allow ourselves to be like I was angry that was hurtful yeah you know that's so true and I think about it sometimes in relationships let's say you're mad at your significant other and you just keep it as I think that's a better to just talk about and be able to open up and be honest yes communication from usually I'm saying like I felt this play just and like you make me feel I mean I know you guys probably all heard that from the therapy world but it helps make it about you experience versus putting it on them so they don't learn as such to the communication again the been people going to where you're at and maybe why you are chatty that day or if something happened like oh that hurt my feelings in Italy being the right route for the key comments or yeah he is more alarming you have to learn every day thank you so much for watching and make sure to check out Katie's channel out because we filmed something really amazing and thank you so much Amanda foundation for having us today and letting us see

new york fashion week daily vlog and i've been reading every single one of your comments so i want to say thank you so much and as i was reading your guys's comments one of the questions you guys asked the most was how do I get into the fashion industry so in today's new york fashion week vlog since i'm going to show is that i'm surrounded by really influential fashion people that aren't just necessarily fashion bloggers or celebrities or designers but they're different they have different careers and I decided to ask some of my friends and peers how do they get into fashion what was their first job and how do they get to where they are then what was your first ja this is kimbley color she used to be the style director for Phillip Lim and after that she was a creative director of fashion projects at laying Crawford [Music] and then what did you do at BCBG [Applause] [Music] you might recognize Natalie Jews from all the street-style photos she's a casting agent blogger and now has her own fashion line and I always see her impeccable style on the front row of fashion shows [Applause] fashion traffic in at the national [Music] there was one fashions to be your intern and she's like and yeah I studied so Jay this is Jay Eric oh he's a fashion director at nylon magazine he travels all around the world sitting front row my first fashion job was folding sweaters have Benetton on Greenwich Avenue in Greenwich Connecticut like 16 I think as soon as I could drive I got a job in New York City I ran into Patti Wilson moving down the designer department and she came in like a tornado and told me she was pulling clothes for someone she tried to explain what a stylist was and I was like listen just tell me who it is that you're like was where she want to secret they got it out of her and then I was like oh this is gonna be easy I ran through a store pulled all the clothes for her and she said it's all coming back like I'm returning all of this we're not gonna get Commission in care and she said you know you're really good at this if you ever want to leave your job you should come work for me I left like the media baby right after that and my freshman year at NYU I started working for patty it was like I dragged garment bags in the rain up and down on the train yeah I went birth through college and then as soon as I got out of college I got a job at a magazine straight away so when you were well while I was interning I worked at like in doshi and I was a waiter at in du Chien there was great I got good cash - Thank You Kyle Christopher van Lew he's a senior art director of Michael Kors and I've been very very lucky enough to have worked with him for many years through Michael Cordes oh okay what was your very first fashion job like the first fashion thing you've done well over 60 networks of the gap and then I were to ever convey a story retail and where are you from Kansas Kansas and how did you end up in New York what was your first job in New York I moved here to find my way into fashion and I found my way to Michael Kors like right your first job how old were you in hell uh 27 27 you moved into New York at 27 yeah so it was a little bit later like after college after yeah like I did college I worked for an architecture firm and then I was like no I want to work in fashion as I moved here and didn't have a job and I worked for a start-up for like a couple months and then Michael Kors came knocking and I was like this will never work out so Michael Kors the team from Michael Kors approached yeah when you were 27 yeah and then what was that job I started here just like a digital designer and now I'm the senior art director so from a digital designer like what are your job duties that's a digital design or graphic design job like it was kind of when EECOM and social was all just kind of starting and it wasn't no one really knew what digital was everyone was like print based yeah so it was kind of exploring that figuring out what social media would mean to an art director then I was like started doing photo shoots and working with influencers like a woman to Japan but I feel like one thing I've learned I've known you for like five years that was like five or six years of ignorance is you did everything what's so kind of like that but now there's just more people yeah there's more people for somebody who's now starting and who wants to get into fashion cuz like I feel like you've done everything from like what early you're like styling me you're scouting the location you're saying okay like how about we frame it this way when we had the stylist photographer everything I think it is doing all the different things and figure out like what you really would like doing like I liked doing all the things and like that's what an art director is yeah so like a let me like to do art direction but if you like the styling more you might push you to be more of a stylist or if you really like the photography part being a photographer but I do think now you can't just be one like you like you have to be multifaceted as well too right you have to be able to concept you have to build a style edit your own photos like you know there's so many things that yeah you have to build to do now then it never used to be that way so if somebody's just fresh I'm fresh out of they want to be an art direct and do exactly what you do for big company like Michael Kors yeah what are the steps that they should take I would say he needs have experience in photography experience and design you need to have a point of view like Michael Kors really works with my aesthetic and my point of view but you need to find what that is for you so that you're like a grungy er aesthetic then like you're gonna go for like a grungier brand and I would focus on that brand either you want to work for people that align with your creative vision then it feels like it's not work it just feels like you're doing did you ever have to do something you didn't want to do yeah I mean the work is work so like you know there's all kinds of things that we all have to do but then the day it should be out way that the things you love doing oh my gosh interview on the spot everyone should know that artwork it's not gonna happen overnight there's no overnight success stories even though people think that because of the internet yeah yeah you could be a flash in the pan but if you want to have a solid career that lasts a lifetime yeah it's put in the hard work because even at my course for how long for six and a half years so good chunk of time yeah I think we're both very different from one of the what - Joe glad you like long hair yeah you were just like a sweet blogger and now you're like a powerhouse really I study art in college I did I went to art school I did visual communication in art history was that helpful yeah I mean I think it was a good foundation to like build on but school is never gonna teach you how that like work in the real world yeah this girls don't nestle translate that's the thing that no one tells you it's like your drawing class doesn't really work at Michael Kors when you like are really trying to do actual business and I think you have to learn the business when you actually get into the business but then like you can't learn that in school especially for fashion yeah like if you want our confession you're gonna learn the business part and they're actually like when you're in it in it but you need to have like a strong creative foundation I think to get into the business yeah RAF designs are really good one to get into is there's so much direction it can take it can lead you into fashion design it can lead you into our direction advertising yeah like there's so many avenues that can start with graphic design like or you can go work for a magazine well it was your first fashion related job Tommy Todd if you don't know his face you know the name he's a Canadian photographer who was famous for his blog Jack and Jill and also his street style coverage for its telecom and GQ magazine what was my first fashion job it was working in a men's store but I was doing oh like what kind of maintenance when I knew that I wanted to work in fashion I had a plan in mind Sally I knew that when I was in high school I was gonna do an internship for a designer obviously intern you don't make money so I had to work at a men's clothing store to do it the cleaning in the vacuuming and all that and then when that internship was over I got a job there working for designer but then a relationship at the internship but then a few months later I realized Oh being a designer is hard so then I thought oh if I want to be a buyer you need to work at a retail store so while working for designer then I worked for a retail like Canada's biggest retailer so it's just for me at the beginning it was just all about being strategic about making decisions because you know when you want to be a buyer you go to fashion school instead of merchandising if you want to be designer you study fashion design but I just felt like fashion wasn't like brain surgery so like I felt the most valuable experience it was just like you know hands-on experience yeah exactly because that's more valuable I had style calm you know thank me I feel like that's how what made you like games gave you I guess they like solidified you yeah if anything that was the defining moment of my career cause like now since I was in high school like I remember I I wouldn't skip class but like there are times where I'd end up class and I would go print out run maybe just from Stockholm right so when that when I think that happened do they needed to find someone new and a few the editors worth there weren't many photographers but what I was lucky was with Jack and Jill I established a point of view which is very detailed focus and everything so they're like well why don't we bring this guy in because he'll introduce a different point of view but the funny thing is days before they called me I agreed to do em I make the cut and that was already exciting for me so when I get an email about stuck on I'm like oh am i dear long I actually met him probably five or six years ago at the American Music Awards he's a stylist for selling Dion zendaya and now Demi Lovato like you literally changed something that you did and you don't always use big designers no I don't actually I like to work with emerging people because I feel like I'm a merging and the girls I worked with for long periods how were merging girls yeah and we didn't always get a lot of yeses in the beginning so I know you make you do the best as a stylish I try to do the best I can for my clients what I had at the time you know yeah I wasn't really not well known and so you know what's the hardest part right now in your life um when it comes to like your career just figuring out what the next steps yeah yeah I'm always getting encouragement moving for people like you yeah well yeah um I don't know just I just love what I do so much that I kind of forget about me yeah yeah I think the work isn't fun all the time about the outcome and then when I hear see you and other people in the industry and other stylists and designers and they say that my work touches them in some type of way you can have a positive influence on another human being do your work it makes you feel accomplished so you know that's what it is well will be the dream collaboration like when it comes to products products that's like a custard cup I thought that out um I don't know what my name or something I want to be creative behind I'm not a person when a product is there a dream brand lives manifesting that's manifested yeah what's your dream brand I want to do I really wanted like be the creative director for someone who does amazing gowns because I feel like my strength is red carpet so I goes like something like a brand we all know I love but people don't wear that much anymore like we literally just she did her own hair and makeup she throw some chains in a white shirt and I threw that konavle and like let's just go people watch we weren't even glorious eating shows no everyone literally just going people watching it like I'm like let's just go watch two people and be inspired and it went crazy like she's all can you believe they didn't get invited to shows and she went to go people watch and because of the way he dressed her like literally Gabrielle had worthy she's a global fashion director at Porter magazine and the editorial fashion director at net aparte my first custom job [Music] and I used to spend all my money all the shoes that I saw print magazine and then I'm a stylist yeah a sister stylist and then when mark but that would be pretty system and so [Music] if somebody was it's the best thing we can do we can [Music] values hope you guys enjoyed this video and

So Zimmerman it reminded me of Capri like you want to wear those beautiful printed patterns in Capri And they had like beautiful shoes I think my favorite part were like they had like different color patterns, and it was all asymmetrical It was kind of complicated looking, but it looked stunning and then a lot of crop tops high-waisted skirts You know me and my high-waisted skirts And then the other thing that I really liked were the shoes obviously so they look like wedge mules like slip-ons But actually like a really thin ankle strap and some of the ankle strap had embellishments like jewelry So it'll look like anklets which was really nice Gave us the wrong address no I don't think we're going the right way She's like no I know, you just have to make a left, then right turn So I'm just walking in high heels Just now I left rosio suelen the fun thing about Rosie's Presentations is always the setting but this time it was much more simple There wasn't anything crazy going on and it was just all about the clothes She's known for her like oversized silhouettes like quite dramatic But the use of colour and different materials and patterns all mixed together, and she had this like really cool-looking Basket looking back.

It the most masculine way or how do I make this work for work? He took like an idea And it kind of turned it into something really different and something completely the opposite for an example even like work wear How do I make a stuffy suit a very very sporty and not? Just like business casual. How do I make it work for a lake? I don't know you go to work, but then again Okay Maybe she's going to gym me afterwards or she's gonna go hang out with her friends at the flea market kind of that vibe set everything was very unexpected in a way so for runway show do they have style is styling the Cases are due using the designer Usually a lot of runways they have a different stylist maybe they're not in house Because you know sometimes like when a designers designing a collection they're stuck with what they envision but then again a stylist can come in and bring in a fresh perspective and elevate what they have and kind of Just like having a different opinion Oscar de la Renta Fashion people walking now I could spot a crash You can be wearing just like a normal outfit They're definitely going to Oscar girl and look at that lady in the middle Yes That kind of looks like me because similar haircut.

Good night. Bye 
welcome to my kitchen I'm sure you guys have seen these pores these floors are from this amazing store called cement tile shop so they're actually cement floors and when we run a bit at the office the kitchen was the first place we tackled and the kitchen here before was horrible it was so ugly and brown and really depressing and I knew I wanted something that was like very Californian very fun very bohemian that I'm no like embodies like me and the song of style my favorite color is blue so we decided to put blue flooring in the kitchen so we put in these floors first and then we kind of like designed everything around it so we kept this cabinets neutrals like they're gray cabinets and then the countertop so this countertop is absolutely amazing because it looks like marble but it actually is more of one thing is because it's an office kitchen and if you are going to be messy we're going to spill things all the time to dry we decided to go with Caesarstone kind of like a natural marble but it's really isn't because it's non-porous meaning like it's man-made so that when you spill like wine it won't seeing your countertop unlike marble and then the bench was actually originally here but it was covered in this horrendous horrendous like green vinyl I mean is awful it was very awful so I got these fabrics from the Fairfax E market so this is what should a really cheap get over to do it but basically I just got a giant like sponge type of cushion and cut it according to the bench size and then I just brought the fabric over so it's like not permanent we just did it temporarily and then later I'll actually get a full strip these I found from FCS I'll put the links below so that you guys can see where to get them this candle ear I don't know if you guys recognize this from my old old old apartment remember I found this a flea market possibly our passage another broad tool flea market and this has traveled with me throughout all my like adult apartments and now it's here at my office for me it's super important to be positive every single day at following dream so obviously every single day like expression yesterday want to alternate o's and now I'm eating a lot of junk that's why I felt like follow your dreams everything is possible everything is possible the toughest thing that we ever did in this space was getting in this farmer sink because I didn't realize how hard of what to install a carbon sink in my mine already envision what this kitchen was going to look like it was going to have these floors gray cabinets a sexy matte black color faucet and a farm NSYNC and that's what I've always wanted and it was just so hard to get it so this is like our seating area and the office and business I swear it's like super loungy comfortable when I have friends over are like our managers we sit here we chat charter and multi they love staying here because it can lift out the window so they are always taking up all this sofa and if you see my old house you know I love like tufted sofa and tufted upholstery but if I think about my blue tufted couch I feel like it's like very much but for this space I wanted something that was like more like relaxing and like more chilly where you're not afraid to like ask where your shoes and do this but by the way I'll do that I got this one job to me and what I like about it is like the problem you look super sturdy but it might be done it the crazy thing is I actually had a ding this sofa in person I bought it online and I was really scared I knew how big this open needed to me and then I measured the space beforehand but something like a so where you're going to sit on a lot it's always kind of scary to buy online but just really comfortable so I win about the succulence with my sister and Bonita and found this giant guide and I fell in love with it didn't realize how we were going to carry it back I think it it weighs about like 200 or 300 pounds super heavy my trick is don't go to like a plant store and just buy a ready-made plant there's a plant store in West Hollywood they have like the most beautiful like succulents and plan I went there once and I remember seeing one of the class that looked like this and I was accepted all result like I did not pay $700 for that so what I did was just off the cactus by itself he's got his pot and then put it together ourselves we ended up taking like a couple hundred dollars throughout the entire offers you have a bunch of succulent especially because they don't need a lot of attention you don't need to water them too much so they're not like super needy like that's why we have a lot of succulents here a lot of things that don't need too much attention I don't know you probably know I love going to the flea market and that's where I always like find the coolest art picture frames little knickknacks furniture like cool pods I find so many great things at the flea market so if you're decorating your apartment or office wherever I always recommend checking out the flea market first and then work around it and I found all these things from the flea market so this art it was this Armenian guy he was talking in third person and talking about like this artist and I'm like you know a lot about this artist is that what is you and it turns out it's a like oh my gosh like you shouldn't tell me I'm good for me because I would immediately bought it and I it is usually a not proud of this I'm sort of proud of this I suck at it but I like to haggle when I'm at the flea market because people are always going to mark up I don't like the feeling of being ripped off well once he told me that it was his art I felt like I wanted to appreciate and value his artwork because I felt like they were really beautiful so I bought two artworks from him and yet I usually always ask my discount when I'm buying a lot of things but I was like I'm just going to pay whatever you told me to pay actually it wasn't that much and I loved it Oh Michel is telling me the hardest behind this is telling me oriental woman that is me Asian woman we don't show our age I'm telling him he looks young and he complimented me saying you look beautiful and you look lovely I think he's hitting on me this picture of a my god years ago and I actually convert it into a chalkboard actually wrote this years ago I think if you google all chrome you link back to it my old like how to DIY chalkboard this might be in that video the funny thing is well this one too so you see that 2:01 I think it says 2013 for the longest time so this is finally my own desk so for years I've been sitting in a giant conference type of desk because I like that we can you know bounce off ideas but sometimes I just need like me time you know cause like whenever I'm up at the desk with a bunch of other people I can focus because I'm always like talking to them and I'm not like productive and so I decided I need it like my own space so this is my little office I barely work out of here though because I always like to be surrounded by people and you know it's all my desk when Korean version captured style it's in Korean and dourados to talk I have my German Edition out finally okay the dormant style I am so sorry I apologize in advance I apologize I am butchering it actually when I close with rent in German but I forgot to ask her because she hasn't seen discovery yet so she's coming back to wait so I'm going to ask her but I mean you guys can help me out right so excited I mean the funny thing is the captured style in foreign languages other than English are just much better quality why is that you just don't like me in America I mean hello publishers no German is like and hug and while we're at it I also have the Polish Edition chest momma Enya ah okay I think I think I got that right but I don't know there's nobody to like validate or like correct me but I hope it's right so the Polish Edition is like the fanciest cover because it's like hardcover you could actually beat somebody with it it could be used as a weapon it can be used as a great tutorial book obviously and the funny thing is I don't have the English comer I don't know where so I have a bunch of photos of my sister and I on this pin board and a few cards and then this is just like random Instagram photos I've taken sometimes you know like I feel like they look pretty so I print them out it was like a really cheap way to have art in my office and then he are so cool so sometimes like people will come up and give me illustrate and we framed them so this one was from like a sweet girl she Jeremy's sister and me which I thought was so nice these are the dog bed so this set of the office had really really fugly tile floors so I got this rug and just covered this entire room because we didn't want to like spend too much money on the flooring do you guys remember this mirror actually a couple bought it for me for the audience day which I thought was really made so I have this in my office well sorry guys you can't leave my man sweat pants okay so I got a few packages today so I decided to an unboxing to show you guys what I ordered and what was gifted and what's in the package so we'll start first package third one is from Germany oh it's my book in German and I already got this I don't know why they send me a new one but this one I ordered off Amazon and more but so it wasn't obvious I like to read so the three books that I ordered off from Amazon the first one is called how not to die by Michael Greger and then he also told me about this book called the China Study but he said it was going to be hard for me to understand because it's a little bit more intense so it's all about like China like use food to lecture diseases and your body and while I say all that I have a virus oh my god this one actually came like two days ago but I wanted to save it today okay oh it's like a really cute pouch how I think I know it's like a home decor like home decor brand so cute most of the golden details so the reason I always this basket was to put either like my blueprint or I can use them at the planter so we like get a little small pot and how guitars is coming up another giant basket now more pillowcases so cute so pretty and I love that they gave me the cushion - usually when you order pillowcases they only sending the pillowcase not that inside and he's cute because I have like this gold zipper detail okay next thing I got is this giant bag from Jimmy Choo let's see what's in this bag how will we use two pairs of shoes okay so it's like a cute squeeze pump make the pump cute so cute oh so cute about one drawback that I have - there's no zipper I love it with my shoes like I have a lot of buckles and zippers is like easy to like put in and put out I'm not a dirty oh my gosh these are so cute obsessed this is um actually I got this a while back but nobody told me that I got this it's not the nobody Toby its I'd never really been here and sometimes I have like a bunch of mails piled up on my desk and I like to avoid them because they might be billed and I have this thing where if I avoid looking at something I feel like the problems going to go away but it's always going to be there an interest later it's an illustration from Gloria on her Instagram handle is I believe Latin for glory and so beautiful I want to frame this is stunning oh I have Tamar boxes so this one is from Julia inside she's I believe from Taiwan and I met her in Japan absolutely beat on dinner and she was wearing like these really cool a Chinese symbol necklaces and like oh my gosh I really like her necklace even though I don't know what I mean look look how cute I have no idea what that says I think another one from her I still don't know what that what this means but it's so pretty okay thank you so much for watching and good bye so good you 
hey guys it's your favorite song ami and today I'm taking you guys to my day in New York Fashion Week why I haven't done any of the shows so yeah today I went to my fitting with Chloe because I was hosting an event at Saks with Natasha the creative director at Chloe first stop is to the Chloe showroom cuz I have an event with them I get to see my Chloe's family [Music] [Music] so what happened was one my favorite denim brand that I've been wearing non-stop they were celebrating five years and in their insta stories they posted like 50 or 60 photos would not haven't seen one person that wasn't white I'm just saying I guess I'm not the demographic I've been supporting you guys from day one [Music] let's see if my mini protest works are they going to use people in color don't just give me free clothes use girls like me [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] my favorite wanted to see what I eat during Fashion Week [Music] [Music] [Music] can we see your shirt Yacht Club [Music] opening night is sight no I not seen it yet except you so when does it open tonight night so what time oh that's a party yeah it opens at 8:00 so we want to let you so far to go this boys [Music] while I was at such guess who I met I met three sacks buyers from the accessories department and I know you guys have been asking me to interview a buyer cuz you guys were wondering what does a buyer do hey guys it's amy from sangha style and guess what I am with these beautiful women and they actually have amazing jobs you guys have been asking me what do buyers do and I got one of the most elite by a bigger in charge of the accessories of Montana so my first question is how long have you been at Saks Park I'm in it fast I would say on and off for about 14 years 14 years I started my career I fax long time ago and I was there for three years and then I was got Barney's and pleats on I went to Fitz and squall and then I came back to that and then you said you started your major wasn't buying now in Romania was pouring the service I thought I was going to be an ambassador of sorts like political ambassador but alas I'm a fashion buyers like what did you study in school so I actually studied fashion merchandising I knew right away I fashion it's that I loved and I loved how I could do fashion but also have a business approach to it so that is what I wanted to do from the start did you go to a fashion school we didn't I went to Louisiana State University LSU Wow and then that's where you did fashion burgeoning because then you don't really have to be in like the fashion so capital to get into fashion because you're Canadian Oh what about you so I'm school for fashion merchandising I'm from LA but I just go to school there after school in DC that is like a political capital Lex yeah our university so I learned a lot through the business aspect and then I worked in retail locations during college and officials for anyone came up through the Macy's training program so training programs are always great and then ended up at socks five years later so I think it's about three years now and then for you how did you kind love and because joys of my team will definitely coming in their training program is key because you learned everything you need to and the foundation and really just putting in the work and the time to learn your craft and you know not being not being scared to take time to you know really develop and you know get raised by the next role so suddenly you just kind of make your way to the next step take on more opportunities duckling don't say no to anything and eventually did you because when you finish the training program did you first landed buying job or so it's been programs are usually with them with a retailer so we have a great training program at Saks and they place you within an office and from there use to make your way through matriculate through the office so after the training program what was your first job lingerie an assistant buyer in lingerie but not sucking wandering like pain I actually started off my socks as an intern I wasn't shoes and then they hired me full-time and I was in women's contemporary buying on the girly brand so back then all the huge powerhouses like time Furstenberg and million and a poor and he remarried went through the training program and I went back to shoes and went to handbags and Here I am now and the training program is a kind of like an educational typically it is Saks is known like across the world after having the best so with the training program do you have to work at Saks in order to get into the anybody is doing it's a really competitive process for creative applications from all over the country and there's a very rigorous t-they interview process you get selected okay so and then like what do you think they look at in order for somebody to join the training program someone is really passionate about fashion but also someone who's really smart and who is this line yeah and someone who has really good communication skills I think like fashion is so hectic and really crazy but so much fun but the business of buying is a business you know we need to sound we need to be profitable so someone has a combination of both yeah and then I remember earlier you were mentioning that up when you guys are buying especially like you don't always necessarily go to the shows but you have like you do appointments with designers and you didn't mention like I asked you like do you only buy from like known designers when you said you'd like to find an annus designer always I think renewed it's like new designers and what's like the best way to be discovered yeah for like it's helpful definitely do go to some of the trade shows so we always especially in Paris to have a little bit more time I saw it and it's great to work with a showroom best known for accessories because you already have those connections we already have like our chief merchant might walk through a showroom to see you bright and earlier and then if there's a cool new accessories collection she'll tell us about it and we'll check it out but have already been have there been any late brands like handbag designers or shoe designers who maybe don't have the money to be in a showroom or to go into a tradeshow because those quite a lot of money yeah and then your have you guys ever like discovered them like maybe through in disturbia because I clearly answered almost like the way we discover a new band that we're so excited because it's exclusive to Saks is strawberry uh-huh and it will go hold strawberry is as small collection that's design it's common and they just do director Commerce they don't anywhere else except really Crawford and and so they don't have like a ton of funding for that type of thing and one of our fashion office directors found them and instead we went to Stan and the question is blown up and students so well and make it work well for us oh wow so then I just helped the grantees very soon so there are instances like that and we watch your Instagram I should read you what it makes sense because I do get to wear like the new italic and where it goes out yeah so as a buyer what what other skills GED you need to know trend ahead of time obviously because you guys are the ones putting it out of the market for consumers to see and to like to let them know that this is what you yeah they're what you should believe in and then you also need to have a really good business okay why do you need business sense so you need to know how you need to know what not only what to buy but what makes a branch of I before and then how much of each items of ice we've got a really good sell through we sell as many as possible so that your profit is strong mm-hmm and in all this or that's like where art meets science and that's where the math comes in so you do need some some like comfort in math and business yeah and there's somebody mentioned excel sheets yeah you guys be very savvy with X now what are you doing the excel sheets every single formula you can possibly think of we do every that's where we run our eyes is how we process our orders that's how we roll up our budgets for the season so it's an intern came and said I have amazing accelerating skills but I might necessarily not be the most fashion savvy person do you think she has a chance potentially actually you can train somebody new and potentially I mean they're so there's also there's two sides of merchandising than most of the planning side and that is the person who's really good excel really great at math but maybe not being so much into the fashion piece that's a good another way to get sort of a sort of buying experience and be like within the passion so with the planning side what do they do what is their chocolate so they analyze for us how much of each item how much of our family in order to drive the best productivity for our area and put company so they put together like this framework so that when we go into the market we love and the planner is basically told me about this story you really should buy this amount of Chloe or this amount of Shivani whatever man because depending on the states and areas it's all different yeah but when you're buying some years only white hand backs imagine sunglasses sunglasses stuffed accessories stuff accessories like hats gloves and then like how do you discover like happy winners things right it didn't surprise me shaking yeah we're sure yeah like as we see we would like to look to see what celebrity they're waiting for you you've been in the industry for 14 years experience that's why I like on top of your like your like dinners yeah so like so you've been in the industry for 14 years of my shirts like changed drastically yeah so 13 years ago or lay even 10 years ago how did if there wasn't during story that was really worn through networking and connections and word of mouth or maybe knowing that people especially this is before Instagram we relied also a lot some of the magazine editor some really great relationships with the ground to check it out anyway and there was a lot more designers coming tax and just send example okay and cold calling and emailing so we would get boxes of samples do they still do that like said yeah the boxes not as often as they stand but to you guys also discover brands through that as well oh yeah so if you're dissin are definitely more efficient yesterday in the drop off and then like if somebody wanted to like entering for you guys what's like the best way like who do you want on your team as an intern someone who's super passionate hard-working a great communicator positive attitude especially at that level a go canner because I think all of us probably what we were all interns Laura Brown told me I'm better achievement of quartet so she wants to leave interns are actually having the best especially if you can I'm going to be with them whether they like it or any questions leave comments below and we'll answer them okay thank you so much so don't forget to subscribe and comment and oh basically what I wanted to do was I wanted to do something similar to last Fashion Week where I'm interviewing people I wanted the videos to be a little bit more meaningful than just like fashion videos or just like me and outfits I know you guys like my outfit videos and I really appreciate that but if you guys have any other ideas and anything you want to see I am your fashion insider I am that friend that has insider access if there's anybody you guys want me to interview please leave a comment below and I will try my best to interview them if there's any job in fashion that you're curious about leave me a comment below and tell me what kind of job you're interested in and I will find somebody who works in that job or in that department and I will interview them thank you so much for watching and I'll see you tomorrow oh I'm doing a daily blog - bye ciao you you

spot where people just surf in the middle of the city that is so cool oh my gosh I want to give them the water so clearly there's like a service rate and you can deploy days okay we're exiting that was a really quick trip now headed back to the airport curb where we going now a fried by Munich entirely empty flight to Paris so there's only one issue I'm excited of the flight empty but like having some issues so we've been open for like we've been here without court classmen they're trying to figure out what's the problem specifically with them just got to my hotel room in Paris I'm going to show you guys around it's so beautiful I've stayed here once before I'm staying at the Park Hyatt and they gave me the executive suite room okay oh I got a present and closet filled with Movietone goody mmm not bad that's the bathroom situation ciao it's one I am quite tired ooh fruit I haven't had dinner just had I'm actually I did have plain food so this is my airport attire usually I never wear jeans when I'm flying I try not to unless they have like some stretch but since like it was an hour-and-a-half flight from Munich to Paris I'm wearing uh this off him or uneven him denim and has like this really cool detail the cool my favorite detail on these jeans are like the Westmont ask you know like the pocket thing where it's like off-centered it's like the pockets were taken out and then patch on the other side that's what it looks like so that's that the jeans are from Paige and my leather jacket this is so court kind of looks like a blazer and has like these really nice button details they're from Lou Jean t-shirt just like a basic black tee all right are my jeans kind of cool and then my heat my shoes are Prada I wear these all the time because it's so easy to slip and slide in and out in and out in and out okay so that's one room so basically it's two rooms so that's my bedroom situation and then there's another door that takes you to another bathroom which I absolutely don't need I don't know why I will need two bathrooms this one should both of them have shower and a bathtub and then the living area with beautiful peonies so the reason I'm in Paris is for this collaboration that Louie Thorne is doing what jeff koons so for those who don't know who Jeff Koons is he's like a contemporary artist I'm sure you guys know you guys probably seen his like sculptures and cool artwork and if you know who wreaths on they have a history of collaborating with like different artists like firm I remember from Murakami I think there's here that's Morikami when they did that collaboration back in 2003 and now they're doing something with Jeff Koons and so he did these like reproductions of different paintings and sculptures and the one I got to photograph with today in Munich was try that's why I saw going on a little bummed though because I was supposed to shoot with van Gogh's painting not with an NGO the man but with his painting in London but they had moved it to Australia so initially I was supposed to go to London but about a day or two days before they decided that I was headed to Munich but I mean I had an amazing time in Union those are worth is a corset filmic good coffee table book thought I could do some kind of unboxing she wanted what they sent me great so first off let's look at there's a little mini one it's completely shut

another shoe option more simple understated but still still really cool kids look at these white details so it's like black but still not in your average or not your boring black suit ah [Music] good night such a beautiful day in Paris gorgeous and they've blocked off the entire street so there are no cars I don't hear any honking with just kidding there's like a couple of chalk spots so it's so peaceful I love it I love it when Paris is peaceful I'm coming here when it's not Fashion Week because everything is just so much more calm or the white and black that's pretty the language wears on mall you don't like the right at all I plead the rebbe best Xfinity warrior to my normal everyday way which is easy like yeah no spaces which is so cool I love the different materials [Music] taking a

no sense of direction not at all next level isn't it not here okay we're just waiting for our meal it's 2:00 a.m. and the Eiffel Tower is sparkly perfect perfect timing if I can catch it right on time without tripping since fourth grade do you see it sparkling it's perfect it's currently 6 a.m. actually no it's 5 a.m. and I just got back from the vehicle on dinner and I have to pack because my flights at 1:00 p.m. and the car is picking us up at 10 a.m. I have to pack all of this all of this we're in another stuff I can't find it I mean I just have an insane amount of things that I need to pack so like how am I going to pack all of this into two carry-on I didn't check my suitcase so that's my dilemma I have to just fit everything in these two carry ons so that's going to be my dilemma we'll figure out we'll see how well I do it and not to mention I have five pairs of brand new brand spanking you do your sunglasses that I want to show you guys but it's not available yet ah how sick are these I'm going to be wearing them during Coachella so excited they're so cool it's 6:40 a.m. I got sidetracked I'm not done packing but I got sidetracked because it was watching Casey neistat's vlogs about the United Airline incident and then I was answering emails because America is still awake well it's almost nighttime there and actually I set my alarm for seven o'clock or 7:30 because I have breakfast at 8 a.m. with my friend ed LA so I'm just thinking that's like a little less than an hour from now so maybe I should just stay up huh and finish packing probably not I'm going to pack I'm going to finish packing like literally when the car comes to pick me up because I'm that kind of person you guys are not gonna believe this they just gave me another gift huh and instead because yesterday or whatever the few days ago when I was in Munich and I shot this it was a prototype it was their very first sample so obviously I couldn't get it but now I have my own look how cute this is so cute cuz everything like the description it's in boss inside the bag and there's a mini clutch song thank you this is law and of not completely so I could have breakfast with my applause is 8 o'clock and we're like there's like barely anybody and you look so handsome you organized the entire season last night you're running around and here he is you're probably the last person to least you know who didn't take care of everybody else and he's up and early that's dedication that's how you get the job finally courtesan is a little worried because a significant Hormats work then it's Coachella who's immediately headed to Coachella and that's not I think it but it's a week not restful at all Lord because it oh my gosh and I have not slept for about eight hours tired really not really very far we're late 
thank you sir oh this is a cappuccino Wow [Music] Oh [Music] I'll put it to the first show of this week which is parantha schooler I'm trying to use this camera as a mirror a little hard the screen is a little too small I like a big number I think right now this is my favorite lip liner it's not really a lip liner but I got this in Korean [Music] a lot of the streets in Paris here my hotel were closed because there's some kind of like carnival happening so I'm riding my bike I was going to take the Metro but even the metro station was closed I couldn't get to it trying to handle a bike and a camera at the same time it's hard and I dream where the problem is how do we take it back to America to the shape the price everything is [Music] the hardest thing about being a blogger or having my life out there is to always pretend like I'm happy I actually don't feel so happy I think the hardest part is pretending like everything is okay when it's not and trying to still work when I don't feel like it nobody's forcing me I don't have to be everywhere I don't have to be seen everywhere I actually like that about myself that I stopped trying to fit in but because you know a lot of times like whenever I'm not doing things or at certain events or like when I'm invited and like I have to say no turndown job opportunities because of personal reasons or whatnot that's like a missed opportunity I mean I know I'm being really vague and you guys probably have absolutely no idea what I'm talking about but I kind of wanted to say that sometimes I don't feel happy and you know somebody was asking like how do you stay confident and I actually really faked it I faked it all the time not all the time but I faked it a lot of times I don't feel confident and I don't feel happy at all I feel so sad inside and sometimes I feel so sad and so broke inside especially lately I feel even more sad when I'm around people because everybody's life seems so perfect but then again I realize that's probably what you guys think about my life which is why I kind of wanted to share this but it's nothing's perfect I guess everybody goes through things I'm sure everybody has gone through something in their life and so what do I do when I feel sad and like the press I mean I don't want to say I don't want to use the word depress lightly because some people really go through depression and it's really hard for them I understand like when you don't feel though when you don't feel like doing anything or when you don't feel motivated when you can't find a reason to smile sometimes you blame life and think life is very unfair you know but I realize life is unfair to everybody so basically life is fair but I remember that it's going to pass if you don't go through something tough in life how are you going to appreciate the good moments I think because I went through so many ups and downs in my life I'm able to appreciate the little moments I really do appreciate the little moments when my life is so amazing sometimes I forget you know so I think right now God is trying to put me back down to earth so that I could really start appreciating all the little things and really enjoy life you know like actually when I used to live in San Francisco I mean I grew up in LA so I until I had moved to San Francisco I didn't realize how amazing LA was especially the weather and whenever it starts concern Francisco is really windy and foggy and cold so whenever the Sun came out I would be like oh my gosh it's such a beautiful day I'm so grateful for the Sun and when I'm in LA constantly because we have that weather all the time I forget to say those things but now I'm different you know because I've experienced San Francisco weather when I'm back in LA I'm always like such a beautiful day such a beautiful city I am so lucky to live in LA yeah but I wanted to say I think it's okay to be sad it's okay to not feel confident you know had something that I struggle with myself and like right now especially like I'm going through some tough times in life but I know it's going to pass I have hope I think having hope is very important if you don't have hope then it's it's really sad and it's really depressing and but dude when I was little I was bullied so bad I was fully so bad that I wanted to kill myself and I try you I think this is a real-life YouTube makeup tutorial fail I try to look at somebody like pink eye shadow makeup I'm trying to do what she did and her eyes are so much bigger than mine and they're just like much more space to do all this I feel like I look come on this looks ridiculous and literally I have to leave in like 15 minutes shit okay I try to salvage this somehow Eggman is just sort of salvaged the pink eyeshadow and once I like it I like blended it and then put eyeliner mascara so I think that helped [Music] [Music] [Music] so I managed to fix my eye makeup don't know if I super love it but at least I'm trying to be slightly different when I first touched the earlier maker Nick this was like anyone try to be nice smells like be honest like I think it looks good now and I tell her yeah he does tell me if it looks bad he says oh my god that's what I like about him that he's so honest I think it's really important to be honest and I'm really honest with him both of us this morning we're working out because we're working on our sexiness right yeah we're both sweet and cute we should be sexier but we could be 16 yeah so we're really worth less could be our blood can be lifted yeah naturally so we're working on it getting these flowers for someone special so yesterday was a little hard I was going through some things and I felt like it was harder because you know I was out doing Fashion Week meeting people and I had to put up a friend a lot of times when I'm with my friends I forget things and I'm just like so happy and puts me in a really good mood but then again I think about the problems that I have that affect me but anyways I wanted to say today is like a new day I'm so much happier I woke up feeling better I actually worked out this morning which I never really do when I'm traveling and I don't know everything kind of worked out I mean I still have the same issues I know I'm being really vague but it's just something really personal that I don't feel sharing at the moment but when it passes and I hope it passes I will be able to are all share with you guys but I just wanted to say thank you so much for your support I did an Instagram story saying that I wasn't super happy and I had a tough day but I really appreciate you guys every single one of you guys and I I feel so blessed and lucky to have amazing friends I really don't have a lot of friends but the few that I have are just so amazing and so supportive and I I realized self-love is very important and voila I'm wearing my self-love t-shirt yeah and it's really sunny and beautiful in Paris today yesterday was gloomy it got sunnier towards the night towards the evening but to such a beautiful day like I really appreciate this weather and I appreciate my life I appreciate all the blessings I have and even the inconveniences I thank them because they're going to make me stronger and I know I'm going to overcome it anyways I have to go to eat so I'll talk to you guys later exhausted literally falling asleep in over so excited we're going to go to my favorite Vietnamese restaurant here last season randomly found the place and if popular it seems like a place I would be in LA but it's such a fun I think we know what we're going to get right her would have her mind Kevin Baloo and they closed up the shrimp over he never waits for me [Music] the other day I was feeling a little down and you know like I'd go through these moments right but today I'm feeling much better actually so on top of all the things that I was you know experiencing like I lost my vlogging camera I left it in the taxi I like I was just going through these things and I guess I like left my mind somewhere so I wasn't thinking I never really lose things I mean I lose them all the time inside the house but like I don't really like leave things at other places but anyways I left my camera in the taxi my friend ed wah he literally called like the entire taxi company to find my camera and oh my gosh the taxi driver returned my camera so I feel so lucky and very grateful and I feel like the universe is actually helping me usually I'm a very positive person but I mean I realize that it's okay to feel sad but I just wanted to they record this because if I had taken my life when I wanted to back then I really thought that I really didn't feel like the future was going to be amazing I felt like I couldn't picture the future I just felt like it was just going to be depressing and even more horrible than it was going to be and I just didn't want to feel but I think it's important to give it a chance and I know as cliche as it sounds and I know you guys have heard this before but it does get better you must appreciate how special you are because there will never be anyone just like you there's only one you and you can't deny the universe the gift of you or leave the universe you live because things will get better but positive and happy in fact and I just wanted you guys to know that if you're feeling low like it's okay to feel low and it's going to get better and I want you guys to be happy and live the amazing life that you deserve to live love you guys right good night right now I'm getting fitted for the Vogue dinner tonight in moviegoers I'll be putting up every song today will be 110 tonight this is my letter option my second option Oh [Music] basically half-awake is 7:00 a.m. in the morning and guess why Matt doing a mini photo shoot with Nicolas by the Eiffel Tower because why not and the reason I'm here at 7 a.m. in the morning is to avoid the tourists to avoid the crowd and it's already pretty busy it's not packed I see people doing their own photo shoot wedding photo shoot pretty nice so for those who ever want to get a good shot make sure the wake up early before the crowd comes look I'm on a Ledge anything for the shot [Music] you're a fella [Music] you [Music] you you 
so addict car it's on me from song a style Camilla's voice is gone because she's been kissing some like a man surprised barely made of past security I should be running so they're saying that I have a 50/50 chance of my suitcase getting on the plane so I'm just thinking if I get on the plane last minute maybe the suitcase would get there because it has to go through security okay Thailand is off to a rough start I like to live life on the edge [Music] [Applause] [Music] hello from Thailand guess who is here my iacopo muskan he came super late last night and now we're off to the beach we both woke up super early this morning we're both a bit jet-lagged know what we did we worked out like bad motherfuckers you know just kidding about the beach we're gonna eat first and it's but bad my favorite food in Thailand is next-level I love Thai food so much hi [Music] no but ya know figure this is my second outfit of the day no it's not at the third to see you outfit I wear to the beach baby it's a third outfit if you count the pajamas at sports [Music] [Music] but nightmarket [Music] [Music] so cute [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I am right she my wife she has finally arrived after two days of being stung but I'm here here and then also on our hour drive we went through four different weather changes these are probably oh we got a fire I love the overpaid we all right you pay $15 GG Wow $15 yes wow that's a lotta right it's time designer yeah [Music] [Applause] you guys so remember yesterday I was like that probably is a knockoff of something which ones real and which ones face [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] making octopus cream in the water is still in that position for about [Music] I like [Music] what I ordered I always get the same thing Pat time Tom Kha soup just kidding this is green curry Tom Kha soup and then coconut water and my dessert mango and papaya salad Iike we are going to an elephant sanctuary at first I was kind of scared because my first time meeting an elephant outside of the zoo as a kid back in India and back then I didn't know much I was not educated and I was a little bit ignorant of the fact that you're not supposed to ride elephants and we went to this place and saw these like majestic animals and I didn't realize that you're not supposed to write them you're like how horribly they're treated and whatnot so when we've all said we're gonna go meet and see the elephants I made sure to ask them like are we gonna write them or they treat it well and I'm so happy to tell you guys that revolve did their homework so we're going to sanctuary an elephant sanctuary this place they take in the older and retired elephants and let them roam around and whatnot it is a tourist attraction because that's what keeps that sanctuary going the more people like us to visit with good intentions they're able to feed the animals keep the sanctuary from going out of business super excited to go meet these creatures and see what it's like so I'll report back when I'm there okay [Music] [Music] I love bananas to keep yellow if I ever get the chance to eat them this is called an Elfie you see that elephant 37 years old one of her eye is wine we just saw her play in the water and she did come close to me because I had a banana but this is really cool actually it's cool and sad at the same time right because honesty bakery like literally stomp us but they fear us and they're just so friendly you know they're friendly only because the way they were brought up they were probably treated really poorly hopefully people stop mistreating them and they'll just be more to sanctuaries and let them roam around you know [Music] [Music] finishing the tour with some vegetarian food maybe eating immediately your baby by the way Camila spices time because she's been kissing some like a man surprise [Music] [Music] [Music] Wow this is the biggest yacht I've ever seen who's gonna fit all like I don't know how many of us are here maybe like 40 or 50 we came to a private island and on this private island are very only one restaurant that's it there's nothing else we're getting away makeover I'm posing to you that you can do fun hairstyles with short hair okay my hair is so short and I have it in a sleek bun and I just use oil to put it back into a little little bun Wow oh my gosh I could see it Hanyu yeah what's my camera unfortunately this is our last meal in Thailand right before late [Music] layover in South Korea well I'm staying here for three days but my yeah : it's only a four-hour layover for him so he's here eating Korean food waiting at the airport and I just realized that I ordered a little too much because I got really excited the lady next to me was like you guys I'm like no just two of us so this is already kimchi and tuna peeling pop I got a giant bowl of porridge [Music] you

relationship and when I got out of it I kind of have my like mental breakdown you know what you're after now yeah because for me what I need much like love makes me happy I guess I get too emotional types of time having a partner was an amazing thing like he inspires me he motivates me yeah but before when I was in a relationship that did not happen like I was so lazy I don't really work hard sooner overall like much happier now than you were before because I yeah I wake up happy I go to work at me and now I'm working with you but what are you not happy before like ya are done I was I was holding it you know yet it you were pretending to be happy no I think the toughest thing for me was when you were with your previous boyfriend I never got to hang out with you yeah that was another thing like it made me and you would only hang out with him and like Tanya would have do anything on this heat and I think that's fine like when you're in love like what I want you want anymore like he wanted to get seen he wanted to be in the picture all the time like he wanted to have attention wherever I was kind of too much for me how do you differentiate a healthy relationship and a non healthy relationship a healthy relationship is one's when two people can do their own things and when they get together they're happy they're supporting each other they bring the best out of each other and you know if you've always felt like this person completes me I don't really believe in that because I think you yourself have to be a complete person you cannot depend on other people but I think if they're able to bring out the best of you and you're able to act independently but become stronger when you're together I think that's a healthy relationship but if you can't really function without the other I don't think that's healthy when you're always dependent on another person when you feel like you can't do anything without the person so I was I want to find to be honest but my old or ex-boyfriend at the time you couldn't do anything I mean you won't guilt trip me yeah I haven't told them that I are paying for has Airbnb to go like how ship with its diaphragm so I won't have to be with him 24/7 on MySpace the entire like two three years she dated this guy I hung out with ancestor without him maybe twice I could never hang out with her without him and that was like the hardest part wait sometimes I want to just hang out with my sister [Music] I think when that religion should be to understand how unhealthy their relationship can be unless you remove yourself out of that situation yeah so if you guys are a healthy relationship but you're not sure and you're questioning whether it is healthy or not if you're questioning that is a law that is under the relationship most likely if all your friends and family like the most the people that are closest to you are saying things like negative things or maybe maybe not so much negative because they're afraid to hurt your feelings but are concerned about your relationship then it's probably an unhealthy relationship and physical abuse doesn't necessarily always mean it's just an abusive relationship person can be mentally manipulating or mentally abusive and that's an abusive relationship I won't matter I won't my kinship oh yeah that's good that's good honestly 2017 was the hardest year of my life and I went doing a lot but it was just like when everything is good and all of a sudden you're you encounter something like horrible in your life anyway so it was hard but I overcame it so they're coming it so I feel like coming stronger mentally so I'm grateful for that and grateful for the people in my life because I tend to serve myself with really great people thankful for my friends and my family and Bonnie's father's cooking and you guys obviously like it is I'm so grateful and I I'm so happy that I decided to do like be more active on YouTube because the community on YouTube is just different

all the time to work yeah that's so amazing or that's literally the most amazing human being ever when we were in middle school in high school well how old were you when you had your first job 16 Donny was so you got me my first job remember there's the Hollywood and Highland during that time we moved to Glen doe which is like 20 minutes or 30 minutes away from LA it's like the suburbs of LA it's still LA County but it's not in the city of Los Angeles it's in like a next neighborhood so my dad and I would always have to drive Danya all the way to Hollywood to drop her off at her work and my dad would already 6:30 a.m. every morning don't you go to work school work oh oh yeah I worked on the weekdays we are weekend she worked something until she did when she went to work something gosh max level I know you busy spirit friend [Music] [Music] I love what you do with your hair the ribbon such a nature [Music] [Music] from my bathroom so I just came back from the MOCA event with Chloe so MOCA is a Museum of Contemporary Arts in Los Angeles downtown LA where actually grew up born and raised well born and raised up until I was like seven or something in downtown LA anyway so like we had like a private tour of the museum tonight of the new exhibition we had a really really beautiful dinner at the rooftop of the museum pretty major so today I said Maya obviously like every other day I did my own hair makeup my hair I didn't do anything I was too lazy the only thing I did was use dry shampoo because my hair was kind of oily from the coconut oil and all the oils that are used are mainly because of this squalene oil because they put oil on my neck okay sometimes when I'm like so tired I'm even more talkative cuz I'm just like really hyper for some reason and the other thing is I have been reading your guys's direct messages especially when I'm like an uber oh that gives me a headache like looking at my phone so much but honestly I wanted to say thank you so much from the bottom of my heart I say this all the time but I really feel so grateful for all the messages I know it takes so much for you guys to to like send me to have the courage to like write somebody die you've never met and although I want you guys to feel like I'm your friend you know I am your friend I want you guys to feel like I'm your little sister your older sister your best friend because that's how I feel about you guys especially the community I don't know if I've said this before I know I've set this with my team but the YouTube community is so different than the rest of the other social media platforms I have because the comments I get on YouTube they're just different the way you guys take your time to really give me constructive criticism or like give me real notes the fact that you guys take your time to watch my videos that are sometimes even 15-20 minutes long I just I really feel like we're friends in a very interesting way this husband therapy for me and helping me become a better person and also helping me process my thoughts and understand myself better if that makes any sense so you should try it too whether I mean I'm not saying you guys have to like put it on YouTube or anything but just maybe like talk about it cuz I've said this many times if I don't have a lot of friends and I sometimes they feel so shy to talk about like what's going on in my life to like even my closest friends you know when it's just me and a camera in an empty room in my bathroom I just feel like I have the courage even though a lot of people are gonna see this you know I just get the courage and then sometimes I decide to cut it and edit it out and not post it [Music] Jirka how can you be so cute so the last time I worked out was with Amanda who's a personal trainer in New York City you guys saw my yard Fashion Week vlog so it's been about almost a week since I haven't worked out and I don't feel great which is why I worked out this morning and I'm eating lunch at home like an early lunch after workout cuz I need protein but ever since I've been on hold 30 I was cooking more I really enjoyed the whole process it was very very hard the first two weeks and actually want to go more into detail about whole 30 but it's really hard to do especially for somebody like me who travels a lot al has a lot of dietary restrictions because I don't eat meat I eat fish but I don't eat chicken and what else I don't eat nuts I can't eat nuts the only kind of nuts I can eat is like walnuts which isn't that delicious I'm allergic to peanuts I'm allergic to cashews deadly allergic to cashews so if you want to kill me just give me some cashews and pistachios and those are all protein so it was really hard quite domestic we've cheated how can plantains be so delicious girlfriends are over and that's funny thought you guys already know Jenny yeah so I called Jenny and beneath him to come over so they could cook for me and none of them want to cook and they're saying I need a cook as it's my house so we're gonna do Kai Bible which is rock-paper-scissors in Korean okay I don't like going to try like to the max I really don't want to cook so that they can cut for me I don't have anything I don't have eggs oh I do have this any that I've had for a very long time when do eggs expire I've had it since August 29 2007 teen know it says sell by August 20 nights is it good so all me song is cooking for us how is it going over there is it gonna be garlic fried rice Oh are gonna help me at least like cousins or truck but there's nothing much for us to do other than chopped garlic sand you could do that on your own he's chopping this much garlic to put in one that's for like a party of ten I think I'm killing it I think I'm killing it so far I'm very proud of myself so I keep cheap book above which means kimchi fried rice in Korean well kids are so excited so the secret to that whole thing is this sesame oil you want to put sesame oil in your kimchi fried rice go to your Korean market and get that sesame oil and if it's tuna - what kind of tuna is it wild-caught mmm no sodium no salt a solo pursuit how is it got my lunch and a bunch of packages today that's it [Music] we're talking about how can we afford to have a chef living chef this is so good you guys so I first got this out hold food and now I have an entire pack of it they just sent me a bunch of goodies because they saw me eating their stuff on their Minster ground you get if you ask for something an ami gives it to you she'll say you stole it Cardale beauty and this entire drawer is all I browse stuff it's not even actually I just have to boil it okay [Laughter] [Music] so we know at least this room works Lancome buy-bust a face works yeah it actually looks so

[Music] hey guys it's amy from soccer style and welcome to my new series where I take one clothing item and satellites different ways so in today's episode I'm actually taking somewhere favorite swimsuit it's a swimsuit edition and no I'm not going to be on Sports Illustrated and in today's episode I'm taking two pieces of swimsuits so one piece a classic black swimsuit and then another classic black bikini so I feel like if you were to invest in any some suit it should be something that's super classic nothing too crazy that you can wear in many many different ways for me it's super important to be able to wear as many times as possible so I'm going to show you guys how to do that for my first outfit it's definitely an easy Beach slip so let's say you're 15 by the pool or by the ocean or hanging out on the beach and you quickly want to go somewhere I meet your friends and want to get dressed quickly without having to change out of your swimsuit I would wear it with like super easy casual denim shorts and then a pretty embroidered lifejacket I find this outfit very casual and easy to wear outside so for an elevated lunch I'm here in my icy omni's 1/2 which is beautiful within wide legged pants so these aren't super wide legged but they're high-waisted as they're long and something about this so chic and workplace appropriate and this outfit sort of reminds me of like the old Helmut Newton photograph and also like how the legs campaign you may be Alfred for me and styling it with a Gucci logo belt but it doesn't have to be a logo about any thin strap belt will do if you're not into the all-black outfit idea and bringing in some color with beans Rachel Comey red pants so these pants are one of my favorite purchases from the past few months because they're high-waisted of super flattering they elongate my life and then make my lips look smaller and making it even more fun by pairing them with the Stellaluna red lip pump so my next outfit is very cool if you are going to concert it's super perfect I'm pairing my AP online so soup with a coffee shop getting a miniskirt what makes this outfit really cool is by pairing it with a fisherman's cap I find about this hat makes any outfit look cooler I'll pose one statement hearing on one side of my ear and I'm wearing my really cool Tommy Hilfiger collars for this gala bikini is actually slightly trickier to style to wear out because you know in the show more skin so you can make it a little bit more appropriate to wear out in about my first look is just like the easy pool beach look where I'm wearing like high-waisted denim shorts and all aware my Simona has a coverup and just thrown some easy slice and you're ready to go for the next look this is one of my favorite less lifestyle it's a very sexy night out outfit so basically you're wearing your gal bikini inside a V for all and wear a sheer lace top over it and then pairing it with a matching purely skirt the next lift is a more covered up look where you pair it with a simple basic white t-shirt and wearing this gala to me over my t-shirt and wearing it with my fun wild legged pants from Ray down the next outfit is a really fun cocktail party outfit so I'm wearing it with this beautiful fine ruffled high-waisted skirt from Caroline Constance and pairing my sheer H&amp;M shirt over my bikini top and just tucking it in my sister you guys thank you so much for watching and I hope you're enjoying this series so it's pretty new for me so I need more ideas so if you have any Alpha dilemma or if there's something else you would like see me style please leave a comment below and make sure you give me a thumbs up thank you bye you

[Music] yes yes [Music] I actually do like this everywhere I love it every day either wasn't doing good friends makeup fashion [Music] that's air girl laughter but no foundation - one day does makeup make it worse I think because of [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I've got the Anna Wintour seat thing but I lost it oh really I got Gracie show [Music] so my face is still red I'm still having like whatever breakout I'm having right now but today's the first day where I can actually really open my eyes so for the past three days I couldn't open my eyes cuz my eyes were so swollen literally I look like Will Smith and hitch when he had the allergic reaction so the Sun is out I'm extremely happy I'm still sad about my skin but it's okay cuz I've been covering it with concealer the past few days and I'm just in a really good mood and this is my breakfast also I'm always starting with some avocado and this that my dad got me so my dad's an acupuncturist and he made me an herbal medicine because when I'm traveling I usually my immune system gets really low hence I guess the crazy allergy breakout or whatever is happening to my skin and um I feel I don't know like the internally sometimes they feel really sick because of the constant traveling and lack of sleep and I really think this has been helping me not get sick I mean this crazy weather though look how beautiful the skies are today it's insane so if you go on the other side cuz of that wall you can't see but there's the Eiffel Tower so thank you so much dad if you guys want to get this medicine it's an herbal medicine I highly suggest visiting your local acupuncturist and usually they could make this for you so I had to get ready in under 40 minutes dressed makeup and hit my own hair as I was leaving I was looking for things that I probably might have forgotten that I need to add and I looked at the stone it's actually an obsidian crystal and it's no ordinary crystal you know why because it has healing powers it's a bodyguard to your soul and give you the strength also it'll form a shield against the negativity of today's chaotic worlds basically we really didn't know what to wear like I was like oh sure what do I wear then when this was in the envelope in the package that literally arrived this morning ten minutes was where I was supposed to head out I had a different outfit on but I wasn't happy with my outfit I was like okay I'm gonna wear this blue mother shrimps back that I got right before I left her fashion week it's faux fur and then my mom sue yours I'm probably butchering the name sorry I would say perfectly with this pair of blue pops a blue plum so I'm going with the blue theme match my blue settings to [Music] [Music] passionately cardio I hate you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I'm so happy right now so on our way to the show I saw this grocery store and it said natural and we finally found it it's freaking of tumeric they freaking have avocados that are finally ripe they have mangos dried mangoes they have kombucha they have pumpkin seed I'm in heaven and you know what's crazier they freaking have dates dates you guys this is why I've been breaking out because I haven't been getting all the nutrients that I need but join eat this it world are gonna be healthy eating oh you're ready for your date she's kidding he's not going on a date he's going to a business meeting [Music] [Music] Rover is finished I'm going to leave for for his walk I'm a good friend [Music] 
[Music] [Music] my window even coward boxes these things want to come in yeah I agree like the box will be the base yeah he's like the seat as well so basically what the seat is for is to shave my legs oh here - problem I have to let me know that when you cut the marble not to base it on this size because once we put the faucet cover in we're going to see these gaps so if you can make the hole smaller than the soil and also smaller than this cover as well so that we don't see any of the holes thank you it's a really crazy day because my car got broken into I parked on random place and stopped broken into and then just happening its installation dish that's my shower crazy crazy day I'm doing the Rebecca Minkoff runway today look I woke up on time but the crazy thing in what happened is my car got broken into and then yeah I've been to construction and Nicholas's am ia not answering my phone I'm really mad because I can't be a to play with that one yes annoying so just winging it a lot of people are you not the problem Linda is too long a should play tennis because conversions or window necesitas ayuda [Music] you guys are so strong yeah he had worked out a lot yeah you guys know me if you are getting in our good shape this is art it takes about five to six people is to bring it here so we feel a lot of this is everything I imagined but even better then so nice and there's nothing like our others that a gnome we found a really great out of here so I will show you guys with the issues so we're gonna head in some the floor first you should with in fallout 4 it's not one full of Claude because think about it Bob it's flat and then you want the water to drain right in the middle so it has soaked down so to the slop is flat there's no way of sloping down so what they do is back in the day and if you have a lot of time and a lot of time equals money because if you pay people for their labor they grind it completely down in the middle so that outer edges are high up but it slowly soaks down but that's a lot of work so usually the way people do is they just have separate pieces like for supper to sit and the angle in town solid but I am going to be in power here and I was the father you did was write it down right in the middle just compete the perfectionist and he didn't want me to have a seam line but the only issue is just out of our little trade right here is not high enough so the marble when it cooks it kind of comes a little higher so we're going to have to call the plumber again and the woman's gonna have to like spring this up a little higher I don't know if it's harder if so because it'll suck if you have testing like I mean it doesn't bother me but they did such a good job making the floors it'll go suck I was so excited to show you here the almost finished bathroom the master bathroom so tall see your hair do not seem like the fabricators and installers installing the countertop the cabinetry he made the floors being put in and then my favorite spot the shower and thank you guys you guys helped me decide where to put the top builder right now we don't have any mirrors yet I have temporary life installed so the left I really really wanted it so they're having takes 8 to 10 weeks and I'm like yeah we're good maybe lemons are like yes we made it it's really cool man attendant on it has like a nice soft glow and it has a matte black outer edge and then you just change the light bulb please give me I mentioned or in the video it was all off the floor whereas I the draining problem we had a drainage issue which was they wanted to cut the marbles and four pieces so that they sloped downwards in the middle so it goes straight into the drain so my plumber was able to pull up the drain a little bit longer so that we don't have to like cut the marble floor so I can have a temporary drain cover because I want really match the different finishes and the showers comes waiting on that to come but I still need something temporary for just up and be really cheap removal for a few bucks yes but this often is missing is missing glasses so the shower any two glasses on each side like here and there and then what would be the door going to come this right so I don't hit the tub I'm opening it so we ordered that stuff taking awhile and then to get a mirror but other than that it's pretty much done like I just need like art and painting what not I was originally mentioned earlier in the bathroom but I have no skin was very opposed to the idea so any times opinion - yeah the other cool thing is my toilet is really fancy we have to wait on till the toilet door closes but it's just like automatic it's like a good day it is of the day hello okay so basically if you if I placed an imperfect but you see that did you just see that happening exactly so cool now a few of you guys asked what's the best white piece to you so on my wall I think it the entire house different one and white cliffs from fertility so what I like about this white is but it's white it's like white white but it's not like a great white where I feel like the room feels too cold and it's not really a warm white or I feel like the room is like - Yolo I don't know if you know what I mean I'm telling you actually start comparing different ways and I didn't realize that there were like 50 shades of white actually even maybe even more some white paint out there Nicholas and eyewear paint me like 50 different shades of white are you kidding and then your entire life can be decide which white did we like and the guy who has some paint companies are like so sweet because like like I mean I became best friends with my other darkness inner most deepest secrets because I spend so much time within like picking out paint colors and we will talk to each other anymore but you know it's I was pretty cool there was a ton of you thank you so much for watching and being part of my bathroom project and the entire house project I'm definitely going to be sharing more videos of the house and I'll also be sharing like other videos but I also want them to like like a fun video maybe I could do a Q&amp;A I don't know what to do that like maybe it can help me good and fill you up this whole vlogging thing and this YouTube thing but we're going to leave a tag video or you know like look if you want to see media library with any other youtubers I think will be really cool just let me know leave a comment below make sure to give me a thumbs up and linked and leave me a comment below and I'll give it back to you guys thank you [Music] 
you guys so what's happening is Jakob was gonna do my main man and completely for God I have to do it now I'm going to do it for your followers it's not for you for father since they requested and they seem to be nice person so I'll do it for them I'm ready let's do this you have to guide me a little bit with the steps okay so the first thing I do is a good foundation on this one foundation foundation rhymers so I guess it's pride so what do you want to put first I think we should put foundation because this is the SPF and we don't leave now cuz it's nighttime so I think we should do foundation it's a night look so you're supposed to do foundation when you like this that's do you have moisturizer yeah moisturizer goes first before the primary I just put my tricep okay you have my stretch this machine I'm not gonna use it because I hate it the machine they occupy hates is my eyelash curler yeah it's kids me so I don't want to use it this is a brow powder you might need brow powder because you like brows this great wonder what it is I see you everywhere okay we need this one this is blush yes no I don't like it Caze actually I think you could use a better blush I don't like the packaging I mean the color I'm very good with colors this is this is okay I don't like this much to read I like that one on the right we'll use that one anywhere that needs some love well we can we need it's for sure dirty sponge actually I'm not a fan of sponge and I think it's best if I use my fingers I've seen it from any good makeup artists we already got eyeshadow right yeah sometimes like but this is not the colors I like do you have like black eyeshadow you don't do black eyeshadow no why just like brown tones now you like brown tones yeah what are you saw a minor disgust Brown is not my favorite call so we don't have a black collar so we're missing something I'm gonna do I your black eyeshadow if I don't have the black color yes I don't want to use brown shadows we don't much time sorry baby you're gonna use what I use a very dark brown but this is not gonna look amazing with the red lips I think I'd rather do a light I should like light brown eyeshadow that with the red lips I don't I don't think it's gonna work I wanted to look like sexy night like all right whatever man figure it out okay that's all we're ready we're good to go this you can put already there on the lips a little bit of balm why do you have so many Brown things I don't get it okay foundation we saw it a foundation yeah I think we need to mask it no it's for the blush I think we need the heads okay okay I'll show you guys how do we do it that was very tiny let me do it my way exciting don't is the big oh sorry water baby you can be sorry 60 salvation does the foundation take a base okay supposed to do it just covers up in this skin thing makes a more like monotone you know do you think this is covering up my scary yeah yeah it's absolutely when I put it a little bit like here close to there hey yeah because I think it actually helps because close to the hairline it's their skin under the hair this is a very important step this is everything bro powder at first okay what would you use to put the brown I think I wanna use a little brush mm-hmm I don't like these colors too what shit because one thing I learned whatever you do with makeup with the fingers you can always fix it great makeup artists Pat McGrath okay not true however beautiful brows high brow high brow I'll use the powder already why would I use this but let's try no eyebrows are like so important for me I know I know but they're great No like look at that yeah I think we should start with the I do with the eye shadow thing but I won't fall for the sake of the video I shadow I'm gonna use a very dark and not gold tones these are barely Evert I know that's why I'm using them because I think they match more my personality's okay you're doing the makeup it's me giving orders have you ever painted yeah I wasn't particularly good that's why I turned to photography she's pretty all these clothes cuz I want it to be soft and very faded I wanted to be almost like saddled so that doesn't show too much mm it's getting it's getting interesting here I think it's when I clearly fuck it up gosh this is a big problem so good close your eyes I'm gonna fix it I think I need one of those are clean tissue that makeup artists use thank you - thank you yeah q-tips yeah not that bad and apply a little more gear so that you it's more even we're just gonna do a very simple makeup look I think there we are just making me like a little stronger for tonight it's very poor because I think I remember the problem is right here like we need here to be this is where the eye meets the inside of the eye need to be illuminate the inside of that so we're gonna use the illuminator right there okay make it a bit more shiny I think yeah this is kind of like a saddle like you should really learn how to do makeup because like at your photo shoot what happens if the makeup artist doesn't show up we all your style will go for lunch hey I think I need a little bit consider here because this is your skin color base right yeah you're a little red because of his son so we're gonna go for the tone that looks more red yeah you know we want to go for a nature look thank you I think it's good I think it looks good yeah now we have the illuminator ahh illuminator you can tell it's illuminating I want to Luminator just on the edge dum-dum wrinkled face using makeup artis you gotta be bossy a little bit Wow I mean 80 hold on now because I need again deep brush that used for the eyeshadow to just make this area look really cool after this video if anybody wants to make up that I'm ready actually now I'm gonna play we let me enter a little bit more I'm just gonna put a little bit of it I think we're good the eyeshadow is super subtle like it's almost non-existent a little bit of blush but not much in the light on that one has its true saturated is just too saturated I'm not offending a lot eyelash curler but maybe it would help because you put those fake eyelashes on so now I use it to make my straighter straighter like to make them like more like even you know I think I want to put some eyeliner at the bottom where is the eyeliner I need you to go to look up I'm gonna stick the eyeliner in your eyes let's pretend this wasn't a big deal you can fix it later and then you made this okay now I have no idea how to put their big stick okay like this it's hard with the light it's really bad side light oh my god whatever that very piece more do it a lot do it a lot like out ah yes actually do that I'll go out a little yes just because let's remember it's important that the inside is down too yeah dad you're done I think you're ready for the night Oh should I work tonight what color black maybe actually I'm surprised like I look like a forty early overall I don't think you did about chopping me I think you did a good job proud of you mine didn't my best no ha now I told it no that's too much alright bye thank you so much for watching and don't forget to subscribe okay I'm gonna get ready you're gonna put me in all black [Music] you 
Virgil he comes from a music background
he's an American DJ he did some art direction for Kanye before he founded
at the label Off-White I'm doing this new youtube thing Where I'm asking like my favorite inspiring people in fashion And then, a lot of them ask about you No way!
But I don't know what question they want me to ask you But I think it's more about like, you do come a different non-fashion background. And I think that's what they're curious about Because you were always a creative person, you were artsy. making stuff is what I'm into how do you make that jump if you don't have a traditional artsy background What is it about you?
I think just make something. was just making things yeah make it and
then critique it and worry about it out and then but did you like actually study
nah just applied my ideas but you travel around and
getting inspiration from like nontraditional things Is this your first fashion job? Clemens Firmin, she's in charge of the
digital communication at Louis Vuitton and she handles anything influencer related
so if you wanted to get invited to the Fashion Show
she's who you want to talk to from out of college now I when I was studying in
college I worked in the company that was doing search engines I'm more of a web
social media kind of girl then I came up to fashion.
And then how did you get this job? Okay so I had a blog and then I received
a few press releases from time to time and I was very naive. At that time I was
replying to people I think "no I'm not [interested] thank you very much and I'm
looking for a job." And someone replied to me that "oh I know someone at Louis Vuitton hiring a social media intern are you interested yeah sure uh-huh and
then I got hired as an intern and since the social media team was getting bigger
I got hired right afterwards so as an intern, where you paid? Yes. In France of
you have to oh so in France you have to get paid as an intern but it wasn't a lot
it's probably like minimum wage? yeah As soon as you got the internship you got
paid and then what was your role as an intern? at that time I was doing reports
on the social media pages from Louis Vuitton, so Instagram didn't exist yet so I had
Facebook Twitter YouTube to manage Doing reports for the whole company and then
the team expanded and we had to decide which way we wanted to go so I went to
influencers PR yeah and then now what is your roll at Vuitton? Cause, I've known you for...
Four years at least? yeah and you've been growing 
doing more and more coordinating everything influencer related at Louis Vuitton so anything that's like digital
influencer yeah Influencer related, I'd say
At the beginning, it was really digital, But now influencers can be everywhere we we shot you for internal
magazine, for Louis Vuitton magazine yeah and then who comes up with like who
gets to be in the magazine as a you or is it like a group effort
mmm it's a group effort we can send ideas and then then go
through or not and also management comes with ideas and say okay let's make it
and then do you also hire people I did yeah yeah
so and then you became a boss and Edouard Schneider, Clemence's boss, and also the Global PR Director of Louis Vuitton I started at Svarovski, 3 years PR director And then Givenchy womenswear PR director, and then Sonya Rykiel communication director for seven years and then Margiela
two years communication director and I started at LV in 2014
last week of April 2014 as a international PR Director. what were the steps
that you have to take to become a PR director your first PR director job. were
you an intern ever yes? I was at school and I need an internship
at Svarovski because I was studying marketing and communication and
then I started there so you have a degree in marketing and communication in
college in Paris yes in college in Paris high school and and then I started there
as a style assistant but the artistic director really wanted me to do
communication so I said what do you think it was about you like were you
always a person anything your personality do you so when you...
I am very talkative You are very talkative! you were a sales assistant what does the
sales assistant do? You were selling? I'm fluent in Spanish so I was
selling the collection to South Europe and jewelry, handbags, evening bags.
so but you're an intern for the sales yeah
and then after, she asked me, they wanted to hire someone and she said we're gonna
have two positions, one position as a sales assistant and full-time contract and one
position as a PR assistant and I said okay I didn't know and she said you
should try to be PR assistant and I said okay why not and I started like that and
how long ago was that now we're gonna have to expose your age
it's fine I was in 99. 99 right but you did start from the bottom then you
didn't just land up here no you cannot no one can know I can't no you have to
start from the bottom you have to learn the press, you have to learn how it works
the magazine you have to learn how to do shopping you need to have a lot of
contact if you want to be a PR director you need to bring contact to the house
but I still speak with the young interns I think that's very nice of you because
when I first came into the industry people in your position don't talk to
interns assistants they don't care yeah they only talk to me or like or people
they don't even talk to me they talk to celebrities they don't care, but I
think maybe that is why you are where you are because of your personality
how do you hire people to work for you because you hired Clemence, Clemence hired Songe, but you're the one-- I hired Songe! yeah I know why I pushed Clemence for Songe. yeah so how do you hire like what makes you want to hire? She was an intern in the menswear department
and we had a position as a menswear international PR assistant but
I had a long conversation with Songe, she was the intern in the menswear department but I said Songe, could please trust me I'd like you to try the
digital because I think you're really modern and with your energy your
personality I think you will deserve more being digital assistant and
handling influencers and then I'm sure while Songe was an intern there are many
other interns what was Songe's personality or her work desk she was
different than the other her in that she's very hardworking she's crazy
she's a slut of work the way she talks to people she's super kind
now we hire her and sometimes she can be bossy so I'm kicking her ass because
I don't want her to be a dictator but then she was different she was just she
stood out from other interns if everybody's starting as an intern and
you're competing with thousands of interns and how do you stand out
you just have to be the natural you have to be confident but keep you very loyal and
sometimes we are disconnected now with the new generation the new era for
example you have a lot of people and like young students they arrive they are
interns and the first question is can I do the press release can I write the
press release I don't understand people the young people there they always want
to rush for everything so just listen and even if you don't have like a lot of
stuff to do listen the name of the magazine the name
of the journal is working for the magazine all the international
publication how it works look around just don't be concentrate on yourself
and look around look at what's going on how works a company I think you're right
everybody thinks there's an elevator to success but it's not you got to walk up
there When did you move from Korea? Laura Kim, she used to work
directly under oscar de la renta before leaving to start her own brand, MONSE,
with her partner Fernando she and Fernando went back to Oscar de la Renta
as co-creative directors and the designers I moved when I was 9 to Canada, And then I moved to NY when I was 18 So you speak Korean fluently? I think it's so incredible what you're doing as a korean woman And as an immigrant. For like 2 really big brands what what's the toughest thing when
you went to Oscar so my personality I'm very quieted I
actually keep everything to myself kind of Korean thing but I'm learning to express a little more how I feel Like especially the negative part. I usually only talk about positive, how I feel about things, Are you bad at saying "no" or that you don't like this? No that I'm good at. But I just keep my personal feelings to myself. I think that's a very Korean thing, cause I'm the same way. I know what I like and what I don't like, but I keep my negative feelings to myself. I keep those personal feelings hidden cause I just don't want people to find out But it becomes a problem. What are you gonna do in Paris? So in Paris, we're doing a lot of dinners, a lot of parties, and I'm attending markets for Monse and for Oscar for doing one selection or Oh yeah very major fashion house what's like the
advice you could give them like for me internship really taught me what
to do I really learned a lot from internship
so when you are an intern like you didn't get paid and you're doing
everything my intern for four years for free did you guys ever intern for free
where did what was your first internship college credit for college credit
fashion-related watch media media what did you do my
intern graduated okay 13 years ago we're going to rewind
she own attorney she's a fashion editor and stylist and her famous clients
include Solange and remember that Beyonce formation video yep she was part
of that Nike and Dior how did you picture a life with me but did you expect where you're gonna be
now like in my club they don't deal with three but you knew you would make it
yeah like you would have on Korea because you have a strong work ethic
yeah it might be like I'm very like you are very very much like if I don't email
back she texting I know I know it's gonna get very very good you

all the time to work yeah that's so amazing or that's literally the most amazing human being ever when we were in middle school in high school well how old were you when you had your first job 16 Donny was so you got me my first job remember there's the Hollywood and Highland during that time we moved to Glen doe which is like 20 minutes or 30 minutes away from LA it's like the suburbs of LA it's still LA County but it's not in the city of Los Angeles it's in like a next neighborhood so my dad and I would always have to drive Danya all the way to Hollywood to drop her off at her work and my dad would already 6:30 a.m. every morning don't you go to work school work oh oh yeah I worked on the weekdays we are weekend she worked something until she did when she went to work something gosh max level I know you busy spirit friend [Music] [Music] I love what you do with your hair the ribbon such a nature [Music] [Music] from my bathroom so I just came back from the MOCA event with Chloe so MOCA is a Museum of Contemporary Arts in Los Angeles downtown LA where actually grew up born and raised well born and raised up until I was like seven or something in downtown LA anyway so like we had like a private tour of the museum tonight of the new exhibition we had a really really beautiful dinner at the rooftop of the museum pretty major so today I said Maya obviously like every other day I did my own hair makeup my hair I didn't do anything I was too lazy the only thing I did was use dry shampoo because my hair was kind of oily from the coconut oil and all the oils that are used are mainly because of this squalene oil because they put oil on my neck okay sometimes when I'm like so tired I'm even more talkative cuz I'm just like really hyper for some reason and the other thing is I have been reading your guys's direct messages especially when I'm like an uber oh that gives me a headache like looking at my phone so much but honestly I wanted to say thank you so much from the bottom of my heart I say this all the time but I really feel so grateful for all the messages I know it takes so much for you guys to to like send me to have the courage to like write somebody die you've never met and although I want you guys to feel like I'm your friend you know I am your friend I want you guys to feel like I'm your little sister your older sister your best friend because that's how I feel about you guys especially the community I don't know if I've said this before I know I've set this with my team but the YouTube community is so different than the rest of the other social media platforms I have because the comments I get on YouTube they're just different the way you guys take your time to really give me constructive criticism or like give me real notes the fact that you guys take your time to watch my videos that are sometimes even 15-20 minutes long I just I really feel like we're friends in a very interesting way this husband therapy for me and helping me become a better person and also helping me process my thoughts and understand myself better if that makes any sense so you should try it too whether I mean I'm not saying you guys have to like put it on YouTube or anything but just maybe like talk about it cuz I've said this many times if I don't have a lot of friends and I sometimes they feel so shy to talk about like what's going on in my life to like even my closest friends you know when it's just me and a camera in an empty room in my bathroom I just feel like I have the courage even though a lot of people are gonna see this you know I just get the courage and then sometimes I decide to cut it and edit it out and not post it [Music] Jirka how can you be so cute so the last time I worked out was with Amanda who's a personal trainer in New York City you guys saw my yard Fashion Week vlog so it's been about almost a week since I haven't worked out and I don't feel great which is why I worked out this morning and I'm eating lunch at home like an early lunch after workout cuz I need protein but ever since I've been on hold 30 I was cooking more I really enjoyed the whole process it was very very hard the first two weeks and actually want to go more into detail about whole 30 but it's really hard to do especially for somebody like me who travels a lot al has a lot of dietary restrictions because I don't eat meat I eat fish but I don't eat chicken and what else I don't eat nuts I can't eat nuts the only kind of nuts I can eat is like walnuts which isn't that delicious I'm allergic to peanuts I'm allergic to cashews deadly allergic to cashews so if you want to kill me just give me some cashews and pistachios and those are all protein so it was really hard quite domestic we've cheated how can plantains be so delicious girlfriends are over and that's funny thought you guys already know Jenny yeah so I called Jenny and beneath him to come over so they could cook for me and none of them want to cook and they're saying I need a cook as it's my house so we're gonna do Kai Bible which is rock-paper-scissors in Korean okay I don't like going to try like to the max I really don't want to cook so that they can cut for me I don't have anything I don't have eggs oh I do have this any that I've had for a very long time when do eggs expire I've had it since August 29 2007 teen know it says sell by August 20 nights is it good so all me song is cooking for us how is it going over there is it gonna be garlic fried rice Oh are gonna help me at least like cousins or truck but there's nothing much for us to do other than chopped garlic sand you could do that on your own he's chopping this much garlic to put in one that's for like a party of ten I think I'm killing it I think I'm killing it so far I'm very proud of myself so I keep cheap book above which means kimchi fried rice in Korean well kids are so excited so the secret to that whole thing is this sesame oil you want to put sesame oil in your kimchi fried rice go to your Korean market and get that sesame oil and if it's tuna - what kind of tuna is it wild-caught mmm no sodium no salt a solo pursuit how is it got my lunch and a bunch of packages today that's it [Music] we're talking about how can we afford to have a chef living chef this is so good you guys so I first got this out hold food and now I have an entire pack of it they

this is the master bathroom we have a major problem in the chocolate drama is effortless look at my - Kulas contractor this is my mama you know I don't I tend to not use or all the thoughts unintentional we have acute my general contractor and look at me and my Tommy Hilfiger I got the best working on a Saturday this was a current situation working our butts off my master bedroom master closet okay maybe you guys to use the bathroom this is the master bathroom it's because of the closet actually icky before there were like a bunch of little wall but it's a pretty big bathroom all I wanted was a giant bathroom and now I have my time to walk right there a shower just came through the drop side aka Mikasa Mikasa is no subscribe hospital so stressful is McKenna all right let's see the progress people can't use my outfit of the day at the job site so I'm wearing my suede Chloe huh this gal is probably not the best idea to wear in this dusty place in the morning where in my SJ y p7 everything that I write is happening in won't Arizona so let the 2-tone the amount 10 and then ripped jeans and you know how much I love my boyfriend jeans great and you have denims ending can be a little bit boring so I thought I'd add an accent and warm white striped tee for from a more work so then my purse is from Prada I'm obsessed with the color who knew that I liked yellow totally wet so I'm wearing my dress inside my questions go to the dirty install beautiful tiles which looks just like marble these are porcelain tiles which were gilded and marble especially for a clumsy person like Armstrong who spilled water you showing yesterday like I'm going to be over there basically once we open our eyes we come over here and work on the bathroom we need to pass this way because you can't step on the child after you install a friendly signal so that they hold the shape they don't move yeah that's what this herringbone looking see make it stop which a good stock oh good stop make it stop good luck see no beaver Oh see get the Apple good time every day but I don't come here [Music] [Music] screams Nike sneakers Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] now if one of your guys cities of poison is really an icon mr. construction which is very anal about it is very helpful especially room you love this it's Raymond Floyd amazing free yeah Raymond [Music] do you want make sure that all of your connectors good all right so there's a little bit of power what's happening is autopilot is the subcontractor that might not hire shimosawa stories he's really good and then because all you can build a house you can install for us all myself he hired and I named Raymond who is actually better in terms of you know employers in pencil making when they make u tilde perfect sense to thousands on the furniture okay Zalman for the other video since we are happy spirit guide well my dad just told me I well fire agreement because also Brian Raymond so that's the issue really has been fired and my dad has been direct our efforts to mitigate hired auspices like our website I really do know we hired on trial and all level of the one who brought Raymond can we hire them both and then they fish quicker I just my chocolate it's the biggest greatness of fire option continue ask our caliber tournament today is funky this morning so my darling she contacted or indirectly because it was a bunch of workers can we hire them both so you know you can keep hired really doesn't matter you guys are hiring the ladder yeah no I should say also to rehiring because we like them both yeah I mean usually support also out how I'm gonna over here okay and then heaven rejoice in a situation okay I want the herringbone going out this place okay step on the line straight ballerina toes choose an outfit of the day she's a doctor like Leakey the nineties comeback Shirley venom Jack difference one Hilfiger move hurt your sweatshirt this is not quantified on the mill triggers they would ya know even though expert miss yet as they nudity I think the problem with the entire floor was not the bottom of the whore fact isn't even like there is more part I use this machine I like to keep my cool here we don't be Holden is another we have a major problem and a major problem can you spot the major problems that we face what's the major problem right right because if the think is right here that means there I can put a mirror I can't cover the window so we have to put two things in between the two window right that we need the other thing to be here so that has to be moved to the right I would like everything to be centered and even good one of that is okay so this [Music] our chance mailbox is not straight I can just tell so telling my dad and to tell its workers and at the shampoo boxes I love it my dad I can do anything I can do anything in this house but you have to reopen this wall because I wanted to make built-in shelves and quite that aka contractor mr. song is making everything happen and he's not charging me anything for that I mean I pay for the fee by labor but how does a lucky the door anytime Oh oh cool hi so nice to bring me my bathroom toys how beautiful under smile protip I ordered a sample online because I actually got this from this online places called towel bar and I ordered a small sample because it was only five dollars to order like five different samples and then I immediately found that there were like a few other pieces that I really liked but this is my absolute favorite because of all the different colors I'm so excited so beautiful the Jennifer about cabinet I am so excited this took forever because the plumber to come not understanding what I wanted I wanted to put the two things here but he Smith the live with us ticket holders or the plum moment is over there right below the window like you think Sarah now watch my hand I want to be with looking mirror and also window and I had it in a jar I'm sure right here chocolate Justin here he doesn't see my blueprint I drew it right here window sink sink but nope you put the plum you sister right here great now I'm going to meet with wash man stays looking through the window using forever don't you like spread that not symmetrical I'll be in the middle so we're finally on the same page so now we have the cabinet down this is the upper cabinets down we're going to put a beautiful mosaic floor today the marble quality is really nice I like the three different colors I chose it was more like a couple of different tones one two three four five look yes I see what the wall I think it was to all sinners I see maybe one of the scissors yeah I wanted to knock on a window see they never listen to you yes yes yes only is 10 C so I'm I said yes forecast see you look showers in the middle right here no I'm going to hit this we're taking out the bench so it matches the shampoo bottle and I want a floating bench so that's what we're going to do in as well Jorge who do you hate yeah don't hate me everything is the line and that finally got my flow and shampoo block the guys are like you can't sit on it and I'm like I don't need it be so I just need to put my leg on top of it but to shave my legs what is looking much better now I sentence they're testing the bed so gates Hornet hope for me time for yoga all right good job so how do you know if it's good or not well here you get your check you for slope right yeah so what you do is you put here all the way at the bottom and it comes up to a spot right there under water view and then when you put it back in like this you see that it's actually you need to would lower just finish the hot mop in the shower it smells disgusting is it I'm probably going to smell like it all day tall yeah to figure out how I want the slap in the problem we have right here is so we're going to have a lift lift up and like the my turn edge I want like a marble so it looks like full long flat so my problem is the marble itself is extremely heavy so how is this place same going to carry it without it falling off because it's just resting on top so problems like top and front it's going to look like that but from here it's going to look like a giant cloud like sizes 6 inch flap that went on top how is it going to hold because even when we blew it if your gloom will be really hugging on next each other in my fault does that make sense so like that's why I'm here to figure out today a second how high where I was a backsplash should be and the other thing is right now I don't have borders around the window because they just want everything to look really clean in and manage see window but honestly these windows kind of have to be eventually replaced because they do have termite damage on the outside so these are very like normal being for house even though you're always going to have some kind of termite but it's about like how will you keep it in Tallaght how fast you go to places like prevented houses are made out of wood so you can't deny her might damage I wanted to replace the windows but AO is expensive and be I have to get like permit and like bunch of different parts just in the place my bathroom windows because the area I win is in historic neighborhood so they won't even let you just change your windows or even paint your windows you have to get permission and then we're going to do mirror probably up to here like outside because insides too small so I outside and I'm gonna do a mirror outlet cover and then we have to the marble threshold right here I want to check the same marble out of the countertop we saw even more royal marble in a really nice condition here everything is both match all the way in and then I want to do marble molding all throughout so in a big well if mine is no limit all the way I had I was just admiring like the work audience a camp or just going to do it on the European swimmer at least you

[Music] first you'll need sweet potatoes olive oil seasoning and then some garlic so the first thing that we're gonna do is while we wash there are sweet potatoes we're gonna preheat the oven so you want to preheat the oven and then you want to put it up to 400 and then start so it's as preheating and then when this turns to 400 that's when we put in our sweet potatoes so I just cut off like the end part that's not pretty you want the scars like these type of parts cuz I eat the skin and it's super important that you get organic so you potatoes because we're gonna eat the skin the easiest way to wash these is easy you this type of toothbrush for sweet potatoes and vegetables and then we're gonna cut these in half okay mm-hmm so every single time I use this frickin knife I always cut myself stuff to be careful be careful or actually what Jenny taught me is you could have typed a small surface so it's flat and they cut it in half let me try hold on I'm almost there I better see oh my gosh this is how my exactly this is really important you guys you have to wipe the sweet potato because you don't want the sweet potato to be wet so Tony and I switched again okay I just want to make sure the sweet potato is dry so you can either use a paper towel and you can definitely cut your sweet potato it's like smaller if you like sweet potato fries but I just like the bigger sweet fortress-like you can make it into wedges yeah I just like them slightly bigger sometimes I even cook them even in like skinnier house it's all up to you however you want it to be so the next thing you want to do is your parchment paper and line your tray so you use a cooking oil and somebody left me a comment saying that cooking oil can be bad for you and the guy recommended parchment paper so this is the trick to make sweet potatoes you drizzle in and olive oil but you don't drench it in all of it that's important part so like what I do is I like so lately they're all that were a little bit or the inside part is going to be facedown and then you just like rub it that's what makes this slightly crispy and you even it up so here too then we're gonna put it in the oven once it hits 400 so now the oven has been preheated to 400 shove-it it watch your fingers Byam right now it's 5:14 we're gonna put it in for about 20 to 25 minutes and that's when I'm going to check on it meanwhile Tony and I are gonna eat so as you can see it looks pretty good right now is the moment that you flip it and then you're gonna put garlic minced garlic on top of it mm-hmm can you film it for the YouTube people so they can see it while I'm gone can I trust on me probably so ages evenly but this thing and shut the fire off I know it just doesn't alarm button turn it okay so we put a bunch of it meanwhile [Music] okay you guys I'm back let's see how delicious the sweet potatoes like they're roasted to perfection so the other thing that I do is I turn the oven off and I leave the sweet potatoes inside in the heated oven for at least another ten to like maybe 15 minutes max and it makes it even more crispy and delicious so it's been a total of the whole like entire cooking time is about like I would say like 45 minutes max she looks so delicious look at this one oh the Chris penis you see this like crispy juice that's like the best part it's so delicious can't wait we don't know how delicious that's going to be do you see [Music] [Music] oh my god Donny was telling me that some of the over drivers are like super perverted did you report all perverted just creepy what are they saying the whole time one of the guy was talking about Luthor how he's gonna sue all right didn't really feel like talking but I was being nice so I was just like all the way to your house I don't know he was talking  about uber but yeah I was like thank you and me goes are eat Japanese I was like no a nice car mm-hmm who cares if you're Japanese or I know it does China just the buyer mm-hmm that's why I think it's good to take uber black and pay extra $10 mmm and get a professional driver I really hope I don't finish this today the only problem I have is like so the entire bag of sweet potatoes probably feeds about like five people right you're only really supposed to eat like one or two yes Rob it's really cute cuz they all consist of my things I love all right so I'm gonna eat some more sweet potatoes I'm going to try not to kill this today what's that chuckling you can't eat chocolates not for you you need to be eating dog food in December is my least favorite month despite there being my birthday and Christmas holidays parties present for some reason and really just some bird no no I don't feel happy I think I'm just not happy with myself at the moment cuz I've been like eating so bad and the weather I don't know and over though a year always just something about it I don't I'm not excited are you excited for 2018 and like whatevs tribe are you excited for 2018 I know he's so excited to wake up every morning because he can't wait to eat that's how I feel too but it's very important to know that there was once a point of time that I wished to have everything that I have right now so I should feel blessed and happy you know and I know you guys are out there I don't know what you're going through in life what you're struggling but I just want you to know that you can always have more but you could also always have less and the older I get I realize like it's not about money it's all about inner happiness you just want to feel happy and good about yourself and today I didn't wake up feeling great about myself because last night I ate so much the thought of working out doesn't excite me so much but once I'm there and I'm done I never regret the workout that I did never ever I don't think anybody ever regrets working out but it's just it's just the willpower it's just a commitment trying to get yourself to like the gym or somewhere that's like don't knowing part what are your guys's new year's resolution do you guys have any I don't have any yet I just want to be happy I remember every year I always kind of come up with something then try to always remember it and last year it was called go I can't remember if that was 2016 or 2017 New Year's resolution but it was let it go I wanted to let go of things that don't make me happy things that don't matter let's say sometimes like you know how people are quick to like get angry but it doesn't you don't necessarily have to get so mad about that situation just let it go breathe and chill and let that go are there people in your life that are not worth fighting for like maybe there's a friend that you have that you're best friends with but every time you're hanging out with that friend you just feel horrible about yourself maybe you're not excited to see that friend is that what it is let that friend go let that go let it go let it go you know maybe you're in a horrible relationship and you guys are so dependent on each other you think you can't live without him but you can you can't live without this person and that person doesn't inspire you the person doesn't make you happy is there somebody that makes you feel that way let that person go maybe your your job isn't exciting and you're just literally working there because you have to pay the rent I know it's hard to not let it go because you got bills to pay but let that go or change your attitude if we can't let it go couldn't help myself so while the cameras were off just been eating mercy potatoes [Music] I'll soon

bonsoir and Tommy just say Tommy I'm in Paris and welcome to my hotel suite at the Lebanese and you guys were wondering what I packed to Paris I want to do a packing video or unpacking video so it's super late right now it is 12:20 1:00 a.m. but I still want to show you guys what I packed so here we go so first of all I only brought a bag so I brought a lot of leather pieces because I knew Paris was gonna be slightly on the chillier side and I wanted to bring the edge Giambi song out in Paris so I have a really cool leather skirt you saw this from my unboxing video it's from rosie huntington-whiteley and page and this leather skirt I finally have a brown mini leather skirt and this is from arias something Navis collection with Nordstrom and then I brought a pair of longer leather trousers these are from frame and they're high-waisted this one is from Celine I haven't worn it yet I bought it last season while I was visiting but it was too hot but I knew I wanted something that was like really nice and something that was more straight like it I really didn't pack a lot those multi shoes and bags and baby products [Music] so a lot of the shoes that are brought are like mini heels my favorite ones I know that are gonna be on repeat are the Manolo Blahniks and then the Chanel slingbacks that I've worn many many times and then I also brought a lot of flats like pointy flaps like slippers I wasn't really sure what I was gonna wear in Paris so I I brought a lot of like simple heels that would go with a lot of things like now that I look at it I'm realizing that a lot of them are black and red I have my black pumps with red lips on it like the simple summer on my heels that look good on anything and then then you push into your black pumps with the red hearts so in this closet I have all my accessories and handbags and then my clothes for the show you get to see it here first my Dior dress I'm going to watch the show just a my fitting today and then obsessed that's my son Laurent dress I couldn't decide whether I was gonna wear the sweater miniskirt or this dress but I felt like this dress is a little bit more extra inappropriate for a nighttime event and then just all the jackets that I brought I didn't bring that many jacket it's not crazy cool but I would help fornia girl and anything under 70 degrees is freezing for me Blazers are always so easy to wear so I like to pack my Blazers so I have I brought a black one and then I also had like I brought a Timmy blazer that I probably threw somewhere the gray one and then you saw this one from my previous video the rosie huntington-whiteley 4 page and then I run a white blazer and a leather jacket for like if I want to feel like badass or edgy and it's easy to just throw on basically all my jackets or jackets that I can wear with anything and then I brought more shoes I think I brought three pairs of shoes per day and I'm here for ten days so 30 pairs of shoes not being extra at all so the first pair of boots that I want to show you guys are the new Chanel two-tone boots are you wearing this at the Chanel boots yeah I am the capital part is satin and this part is suede and I think it's so perfect for fall and these are also a new addition to my closet I just got these right before I left LA how cool are these these are from Iiro and I'm in love with the ruffles on this side that's so cool so if a girl has her leather boots she also needs her suede boots so these are from Dior and they're thigh high it comes almost up to my crotch and I could literally wear this like underneath a dress or skirt or I can be like really kind of like sexy and cute with a miniskirt because I wasn't sure about the weather really wasn't sure about the weather whenever I'm in Paris I'm always like oh I wish I brought this I wish I brought that because the weather is kind of unpredictable I'm really excited about these so I don't really own any boots that are a camel tone these are John B Taurasi and they're like the perfect shade of camel they're only like three inches high so it's like really comfortable and it has that chunky heel one last one the massive Dior boots I remember seeing these boots during the cruise collection in LA in Malibu the models were walking down wearing really beautiful dresses but with these type of boots so it was it was like pretty and feminine but then again at the same time really badass like I just like that little juxtaposition and this is exactly what I'm going to try to emulate tomorrow for the show so I have like my really pretty dress what's a really cool pattern and then crazy combat boots Chimay what this suck number two mini bags I'm all about stacking rings this one's missing its friend this one's missing its friend this one is missing its friend I'm actually happy that the one earring trend is back and is actually really big right now because these are all missing its partners you

[Music] today was a really crazy day because I woke up with hives all over my body so last night I was so stressed I looked at the mayor and also go look it was like completely covered in eyes and I was like holy holy I was freaking out and that was making it crazier so since I've been in Paris I haven't been really sleeping a lot and right before parents and everything it just I don't know it's been I really need to learn how to manage stress my problem is I think too much I worry too much and I want to do so much but I can't do a lot and then I worry about people around me how they're feeling and then if I sense that they're not feeling well it affects me and their worries become my worries it just gets a little too crazy my face was super block G my eyes were very swollen and the thing is like when I'm stressed it just comes out on my skin so y'all helped me get ice ice Popp my face and then I have breakfast and I was trying to like be all positive if I was like playing Christian music what not talking - yeah Coppola Yakubu is really really so helpful thank you baby I love you so much I took all the vitamins and I took my dad's medicine the herbal medicine and then you have breakfast right after that on came and I was constantly like doing my face with like the ice and then I felt so bad because literally like like on is here to do my hair but also like it's always boring if you do it the same exact hair and he wanted he had so many like this season we were so excited because we wanted to do like really cool crazy hair so he brought all the accessories you know like last season we had so much fun I like doing the crazy here like on was doing the crazy here in my was doing my makeup and you know every single day we did the transformation and like we wanted to do something like that this season I felt really bad because and he he's totally fine and it made me feel even worse because he's like no mommy it's totally fine anything such a good person so like yeah we just did like super straight hair and then thank goodness at the last minute for the Chloe look I was like I don't know if I'm gonna wear the hat or not and then I just grabbed a hat from the showroom and I wore the had to literally cover my face and the entire time I was walking to the show I was walking like this because I don't want people to see my face like because it was like blotchy like it was so bad this morning and I try to cover it up with a concealer and foundation and it was still I mean like people said they didn't notice but I just felt very it's a [Music] first you came secondly the shoes I still said think room to show what did you steal so many just got back from the clothes show honestly and Natasha Ramsey Levi's is so good I'm like so happy that she's in charge or Chloe because the designs the clothes the girls they all looked so good and I remember growing up being a huge fan of Chloe the brand and for me Club reminded me of like the free-spirited girl like somebody was like booking me in free spirit very like flowy feminine at the same time with this collection it was all that but even more it was so strong it's they're like warriors and honestly I could really see the influence of her days at Louboutin and I'm pretty sure she was at Balenciaga when nikolaychuk skin was there and it was so cool to see like Nikolaj like being so supportive of his you know one-time right-hand woman and my favorite pieces are definitely like all the lorax I mean I'm wearing one from their pre Fall collection it's all like The Lorax knitted pieces like the metallic knit there were like some like maxine metallic knits flutter sleeves like other cool pieces were like obviously like the bags and accessories Chloe is definitely known for their backs with the shoes the shoes were so cool like similar to the shoes the boots that I'm wearing where it's kind of like badass boots but the texture of the boots they have like I guess velvety like patterns all of the boots on the runway there were definitely something I mean it was so cool I don't know if it was like the horse motive but do you remember me wearing the Blazer in New York Fashion Week it was like the with the horse pattern they have that I think it was the worst bad and it was like golden patterns with like a black jacket but it wasn't like a fitted blazer it was more of like a jacket like slightly boxy you saw kiya Garber and then they were using like a water different textures in the design like my heart was beating so fast and she's really killing the game and if like I'm I don't want her to change anything that she's doing whatever's in spying her right now I want her to keep on doing it it was really freeing like to see like Chloe woman is a free woman she does whatever she wants to do and I think that's so liberating and amazing at the same time you're like not boxing or defined by one thing you can be so many different things that's so true for a modern-day woman when people say describe one word to like about your style I could never describe it and I felt that about this Chloe collection because I mean if I could really use one word I guess it's the word free or emancipating Sophia what was your favorite I liked all depends all the pants yeah that's fair like the silhouette I like if there weren't like tight pants they're more like lose but bell-bottom all the backs has new patterns on it I'm like beyond honored to be a Chloe girl because it's a brand that I've always always loved I did a blog post on it a long time ago I still remember the very first image I like ripped out of the magazine when I was probably like 13 or 14 it was a campaign that you nezam be nude shot on your Rubik and I had that like ripped up and I had it placed on my wall in my room and you want to know the craziest thing I don't think anybody notices I had a Chloe back since I was 16 but it was a fake I had a fake Chloe bag the one with the lock and then after Chloe I came back to the hotel removed my makeup and decided to use the steam room at the sauna downstairs at the Plaza so I went inside and that was the best decision I made to to hate was using the steam room so it completely removed my makeup I was in the steam room and really because you know people who I back somehow like we suffer from dry skin extreme dry skin so when I was in the steam room it was like super moisturizing and I felt like all did because I was also sweaty because it's hard I was in there for like 15 20 minutes I was sweating out all the toxins and I went into the sauna but then again when I went to the sauna I was like dry heat so I felt like maybe it's not so good for my skin so I went back to the steam room for maybe about five minutes take a cold shower while your cool was really kind enough to bring down my beauty products I asked I texted a really quick baby can you just give me like my cream and my oil and then he like my skincare products since I was gonna take a shower downstairs he attempted to bring some stuff you help me a cleansing oil which I didn't mean let's say I'm from biosigns and then escape to what I really need it was just like regular oil but that was fine and then I tried to take a nap I couldn't take a nap sometimes when I take a nap or sleep and wake up my skin gets a little bit better so that's what I try but I didn't yeah we worked on like editing the video YouTube video by the way of my teams working so hard I'm just so appreciative him Sofia's used to this fast pace because she's been to Paris before and she's so good I love Sofia so much she's gonna be somebody I'm she's already somebody but I'm like she's so dedicated hard-working you guys just don't know like sometimes I see myself in her like my intern days but four blade our intern and then Kathleen who helps us do the video editing it's their first time in Paris and I know they're under a lot of stress because you're not used to this cuz I know Sophia was super stressed last time the very first time she came to Paris but I wanted to say I'm so proud of my team and Jacopo too he's really doing a lot for me even though like I'm barely spending any time with him but I really really appreciate him I'm so grateful for them for everybody and even on like I'm so happy he's here doing my hair because not just because of my hair but like his energy energy is contagious I always say this to everybody but energy is so contagious so that you don't want to surround yourself with negative people I just want to be with people with like good energy and I love on for that reason because his energy is just like next level he has such a pure beautiful aura and energy about him and just the fact that I get to work with him but also call him a good close friend of mine means so much to me and even his team - like the two guys that he has on his team they're really great kids and it's so cool to see like people working so hard and trying to maintain a good energy because that's really hard and that's what I'm trying to do Oh at the east of Omaha sure you know what was amazing so when I was exiting I saw these I saw a few girls and boys waiting outside and I saw these two girls they were telling me that they watched my video my first Paris Fashion Week vlog from day one and day two where I talked about like my struggles with excellent they are like we watch your vlogs and we both of us have eczema so you made us feel better and less insecure so that really meant a lot to me it takes a lot to a make your flaws or your struggles but this is therapy for me talking it out talking to you guys it's definitely therapeutic for me so I really appreciate that and the fact that I'm able to actually help at least one person means a lot and it's obviously I don't do all of this by myself it's only possible because I have I now have a team so thank you to my team thank you to my followers and people who are watching this YouTube video and who follow me on Instagram like your movie comments and messages they really mean so much to me and I really love our community I love that I saw his community this is my leg for tonight are you laughing I mean I just have to put makeup but that's it that's it I've been breaking out so maybe I won't put makeup just connect the dots connect the dots they say about my moles you know who I look like right now back to the future' guy like the old scientist yeah that's his dad right does that is a crazy guy are you saying I look crazy wait wait no I Amy he needs this one that's Chloe there we go that's a look you know yeah really mix it yeah that's very control of eyes mm-hmm gosh sigh Coachella I'm ready oh you came with the gold and silver yeah I'm mixing the gold and silver there's only too much with the earring and bang you don't see it yeah you do on this I'd like all my details are silver fine no to me is the conscious between the the big wide earring circle earrings and the dainty small pieces in the hair that kind of throws me off a little to different things yeah cuz one is so intricate and small treasure those I mean I think I think they work better a better job yeah my original idea if you want to do single just one the red one then it's cooler much better yeah but I yeah it's more like a warrior now like ooh like a pink army warrior okay ankle anywhere cool yeah [Music] it's so good obviously so it was kind of like this western cowboy cowgirl vibe so there are a lot of cowboy boots with cap toe the crazy thing though was you know I always want to wear these like 80s bling circulars earrings like statement earrings from Fallon and then I'm wearing tights with heels the last few looks on the runway that's what it was it was like poofy sleeves asymmetrical shoulders with big earrings tights and heels I'm like I could have been on trend but then again everybody was telling me to go with this earring because my hair my hair is like all gold and it's a lot but I couldn't see the back of my hair you know anyways the collection was so good a lot of lot of wearable PC the pieces I really loved were like the baggy jeans double tail with like baggy tops like the coats are oversized I have I love that she does like a lot of oversized coats all the time and then you either just belt it put it on Tom like whoever she makes great coats and what a lot of people don't know is she makes a lot of great jewelry this is actually Savona Ron and also heels dresses pants denim she makes great denim too she's good on everything I like her spirit he's evolved around like she seems like such a fun chill girl the music was good too [Music] thank you so much for watching I can't say [Music] 
I'm going to show you guys how I remove my makeup today my issue with this short hair is that it's hard to tie because so short so usually I remove my makeup when I'm in the shower and I shower at night because I like to sleep really clean but I just showered earlier so I'm gonna just wash my face I always brush my teeth first before I move my makeup guys want to see what products I use or what products I brought so if you want me to go through them individually that's hundred percent pure Jamaican black castor oil which I put on my lashes apparently helps with the lash growth this is my like moisturizer this is my Ola Henriksen double cleanser so these are like really moisturizing I also have a mask from the hookah collection Hydra clay detox mask I have a foaming cleanser the sk2 essence makeup remover which is like my solar water serum oil BIOS on soil all right I'm just gonna show you guys how I do it so during Fashion Week I usually have more makeup than usual so I'll clean my face with a cleansing oil right now this is my third or fourth bottle I've been using from bioessence it's lab base squalene squalene antioxidant cleansing oil so it's good for removing really tough makeup like mascara foundation all of that lipstick I have no idea what I look like right now you see all that coming out out panda eyes Pina pin pin pin penis so no makeup that's it just kidding so just in case actually cleanse my face really really well cuz you never want to have any kind of makeup residue on your face when you go to bed because that's when your skin cells generally generate themselves and you just want to have like a really clean skin so the next thing I use it depends I would if I'm wearing a lot of makeup I always do the scrub but I did this last night and I don't want to do I usually don't do this like every single day do it like maybe like three times a week during Fashion Week or even four times during the week on a regular basis I only do it like twice a week but here it says rinse thoroughly use two or three times per week this if you have oily skin this is amazing and cleaning your pores probably gonna use the foaming cleanser actually you know what I'm going to use cuz my skin feels really dry today so I'm going to use the older Henriksen wonderful double cleanser as you can see I've been using this a lot I really like doing this field on my face okay you so that's how I'm gonna wash my face today I'm actually gonna do one more thing which is since my skin feels really really dry today I'm going to actually put a mask on and then wash my face again I'm gonna do the Hoover Hydra clay detox mask from Alexa so put a generous amount on your face don't I look like a Geisha and then I wait about ten minutes what should we do for ten minutes okay it's been about 15 minutes so I'm gonna wash my face on the bottle it says leave on for 10 minutes but sometimes I even leave it on for 30 minutes last time when I hung out with Ulla Henriksen yes I hung out with him no big deal he we watched a movie he left it on for two and a half hours or two hours or however long Dirty Dancing is so like he put on the face mask before Dirty Dancing started and then him and I had a dance-off after Dirty Dancing cuz we were like inspired by the movie we're just dancing it and he's still had it on so the man himself who created this leaves it off for more than two hours I think it's safe to leave it on for two hours it's the size you could either rinse off with water or remove with a damp washcloth I always rinse it off with water [Music] and then I carry on with me the rest of my beauty routine so I'm super anal about removing my makeup really well so after just removing my makeup I use some kind of my solar water I'm using the Garnier Garnier skin active micellar cleansing water water and it's 3.4 ounces so it's TSA approved and this is like the makeup test I feel like this and see if there's any makeup left nah that's how you know your makeup remover or whatever you are using like the cleansing stuff works when there's nothing on here you know nada okay next sk2 essence so I first use a skate to when I got to work with them Shu first approached me and then I tried their products really liked it so I got to work with them but ever since I am hooked so I just have my face on my neck I use this every day morning and night I actually don't stop my face that hard I think I was just like being overly dramatic I'm gonna let this sit on my face let my face absorb all the goodness hash hack this is not sponsored I bought this bottle myself although it's Katie if you want to send me more bottles I would happily and gladly take them so I just came back from Costa Rica you all know that so I've unfortunately unfortunately acquired more freckles despite wearing a lot of Suns so now every single day I've been using the truth serum you can see how much I've used this is a new bottle I usually have a smaller bottle when I travel but I upgrade it to the bigger one all right so I put it on my face this is so good for your skin texture it's vitamin C basically if you have really really sensitive skin vitamin C can irritate your skin a little it has a narrow jaded not going with it hasn't irritated my skin yet and I have a very very very sensitive eczema skin so just like rub it in my face okay next I use an eye cream right now I'm going to use the goop perfecting eye cream actually never use this before this is like my first bottle I like it because it's small and it's travel size I'll let you know how it works it just tap it with my ring finger the reason you use your ring finger to apply eye products is because your ring finger is one of the most gentle fingers you don't want to put too much pressure and rub it in you know cuz you don't you want to prevent wrinkles and then whatever's left over it put it on my like laughs line at forehead I use the hoola Henriksen pure truth youth activating oil is orange to makes my face orange a little but I like it it's so gentle okay true story when I was in Sonoma I actually broke out in hives after horseback riding literally there were like giant hives all around my face all around my neck I put this on lift it on my face like I had to wash my face when I went back to my hotel put this on my face literally calmed being down there like massage myself oh yeah baby oh yeah oh yeah then on my body usually after a shower I put BIOS ons 100% squalene oil all over my money and then I massage my shoulders so shoulders hold all the stress and your hips hold your emotions apparently so do you guys know the pigeon pose like I tried always like almost on a daily basis I try to stretch my hips I open up my hips I don't recommend Suellen oil if you have oily skin though I'm dry skin so I use this okay after this you know what I do I put my moisturizer on but I let it sit on my face for a little bit so it's not like product after product after product and it's not just like sitting on top of my face and want it to absorb so let it like sit on my face for like maybe five minutes or so what do I do usually I look at my phone but Sophia has my phone so just gonna talk to myself do you guys have any really good book recommendations if you do leave a comment below psycho check them out I actually can't wait to go back home totally I miss my dogs and I miss my sister so much my dad and my mom but it really was me dogs okay I think it's been like five minutes so as my moisturizer did you hear that I use a Venn motion raising cream it's got the zircon ad bomber relief be dumb then they feed them oh it's a lip lip bitter clinton replenishing and it's anti irritating and it's very very moisturizing hyper allergenic it's good for severe dryness skin prone to a topic dermatitis which is like eczema and skin prone to itching so which is good for me but for those who don't need something such a this is like a very heavy moisturizer so if you don't have like extreme dry skin like me I see go with the normal one I'll link those below in the description box that you guys can check it out and get it that's it that's all I do actually I forgot one thing so I've been using this castor oil from Shea Moisture it's the 100% pure jamaican black castor oil I've only been using it for about a month I see I think I see a difference like my lashes seem like they're slowly growing because I wanted to find a natural way to grow my lashes instead of getting those like I don't use lash extension I don't I don't want to do those serums because I feel like I hear so many horror stories about him like especially since I have sensitive skin I don't want like my eyelids to like turn red so I use something that's more natural which is the Jamaican black castor oil okay that's it thank you so much for watching you guys and if you guys have any beauty questions please leave a comment below make sure to subscribe and give me a thumbs up and if you guys have any other suggestions leave a comment below as well and share your knowledge thank you good night you 
one o'clock the dior shows at 2:30 and I just got in the car most likely not gonna make it on time for the Dior show but just in case I just do my bacon right now I was like they won't make it but I'm going to try and I don't make a it's fine because the real reason is my best friend is walking is closing for one of the shows called every so I just gotta go there to see mark Sophie and I were just talking about out since I posted the woman's margin in one day I lost 25 of your followers but I'm not sure not upset I think it's more important to take a stand and use my platform to talk about things that actually matter there's real  happening outside of fashion and also fashion and politics definitely go hand in hand one thing I love so much about fashion is how progressive it is like these beautiful Muslim women who are like completely covered up walking down the runway I feel like fashion is really working so hard using like models people of color I think that's so important it's going to be a miracle if I make the show it's 2:30 for the show starts at 2:30 but usually they start a little bit later anyway I hope I can make it we're just waiting for the show to start I can't believe I made it [Music] boy we want to send Camilla a message where you're gonna kill it we hope you fall it's gonna be a Carrie Bradshaw moment you're gonna kill it I'll remember you forever we're gonna remember you're gonna be a badass  I'm killing [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] Wow came back to the hotel room and literally we were talking about where's like where to get the best avocado toast and the hotel got us some avocado toast I one time set on the floor for an hour struggle No so I told Sophia that I really want to be healthy while I'm in Paris cuz usually when I'm in Paris even though I try to be healthy it's really hard to be healthy so I ordered room service and I had the guy take he brought bread as well and I had him taken away and I got steamed vegetables which is so much healthier than actual like cooked vegetables because you know when they cook vegetables they put butter or like oil and you got side of veggies I already killed my three avocados and then my salmon and obviously already killed my entire bar blueberries and then the dates are almost gone but I'm gonna eat him almost every morning well I'm here so you guys heard it the Chanel boots since this is Chanel show sunglasses do I wear these or should I go head to toe Chanel wait are these too much [Music] no we're gonna take her shut up they got me speakers the reconstruction [Music] like little bright light so I could I couldn't ask him or anyone better I wish I could really a good friend I know you could try harder I was so nervous so I stayed in this box where I got out 15 minutes until the whole show started and ended I would really have to pee I couldn't do anything I got you know I saw you stop in the first biceps and then I was like okay breathe Camille and then you and yeah but it was great like I felt so many emotions at the same time I got super emotional and then I got so happy so much [Music] yes you're killing it [Music] okay dude I was shaking so bad but I wanted to film this so that we're all aware and I think Ober need to fix their I want this to go viral so it never happens to anybody else again okay so I got in uber I called uber eggs from Plaza Athenee and then to where I'm staying right now I got into the car everything was fine the guy was he was playing French rap so I told him turn up the music louder cuz like it was really good rap and I was listening to music I was like snapping doing my things and then I was like insta snoring so like he heard me speak English and he was like oh you speak English really well and I was like oh thank you I'm from America so we passed our hotel I see the hotel that he's supposed to drop me off and I was like we passing us excuse me I was like you have to that's a hotel and he's like it yeah like oh oh in Austin he doesn't he doesn't speak English and I was like what the and then like he pulls up two streets more and some guy goes like this to him and I'm like okay what's happening and then the guy comes towards my side of the street us of the car like I'm on the back seat on the right side and then the guy tries to open the door I'm like wait what's happening and I think I'm just thinking like this is a random guy on the street trying to get into my car I was like can you lock and can you go can you go can you please drop me off back at the hotel and then the guys like oh it's okay it's okay and he unlocks the door and then I'm like and then the guy just opens the door Sofia wasn't with me so he is just here with me because I'm like so nervous before yeah emotional support and like I just need somebody like so the guy just opens my side of the door and I'm like what's going on like what's going on and then the guys like it's my friend it's okay it's okay so I go into the other side trying to get out of the car cuz the guy is now inside the car and then he shuts the door and he's trying to drive off so I'm like banging on the door like crazy like just let me out I don't care if it's a misunderstanding or whatever I don't care like I don't feel safe at that situation so I'm just banging on the door like crazy like I'm just banging and banging on the door until he unlocks the door and I just ran out I forgot this one point he said don't worry we're gonna take you home so I'm like I don't know if it's a language barrier thing like I don't know if he's talking about my home or his home I don't know but at the moment I just felt unsafe funny I was like shaking the entire time it had to like literally calm my nerves and then Sophia came and I just told her the whole story and the reason being I'm like filming this is because I think it's up whatever just happened I'm just we're just trying to think of all the scenarios maybe I over pulled I just checked my phone I did not uber cool I over xed and then another scenario I was trying to think was maybe he was picking up a guy like a customer but why did you pass my hotel why did you pass my address and I looked I double checked on my phone who that I know cuz we're 5 and he's 2 it's still the same block so that's not the trip no I had entered the right address he went to more streets they knew each other a you passed my hotel which is weird either way it's not I don't think this is safe how do we protect ourselves this is not cool not cool all right that's it so since my suitcase is still not here and I don't have any clothes still wear my Chanel I just switch out my jacket and shoes and I'm gonna go shopping and charge airframes well apparently the only reimburse hundred dollars but at least I'll get like beauty products I can eat like my skin care stuff please I'm wearing my airport outfit because I'm still missing my suitcase and yet God is trying to take my fly Cheri so we're doing the print still Thiago pool so I said hey yoga pool congratulations I'm so happy for you guys you're putting pressure on me doesn't believe me but you probably  inside right you're like oh  this

video everybody's been asking what my lip color is during this Fashion Week and it's this it looks almost like like a normal lip color if I really want it or like pretty lip color oh it's a lip magnet the color is 508 and it's like a slightly dusty pink and I really like this color cuz it's not like bright pink and I love pink shades instead of applying in like a lipstick I just top it like early a little bit and and it stays on all day long [Music] [Music] throw on moisturizing balm super thick no it's good for my skin the glue is amazing so today my inspiration is Christy Turlington and the nineties so much you guys this is one of my favorite things for lip contour I want to see how you use it what do you think this does you like around your eyes and lips so why do people need it air conditioning oh so it's a protection is using color fiber one lip maestro and color 200 lip Maya stroke oh my cheeks you mixed it yes oh wow that's so cool you said this is eyeshadow for yes I love

oh good morning so I'm going to show you guys IET fashion week makeup tutorial go with the basement then with a chillner and then the revitalizer I need to moisturize a lot so you put it everywhere next up Marie oil put some drops if you have oily skin I say do this at night sometimes I put eye cream lately I've been a little lazy and done with my skincare now we're going to go into makeup start with the foundation primer in radiant you see these major dark circles under eye bags so this is a candle glow concealer and highlighter so I put it underneath my eye and then gently tap it what is this remaining I just threw it to my nose underneath my eyes next step it's alarm RCA six kind of rush raising butter edition foundation I was holding my breath and we're never even it's hard step two for my eyebrows is using this brow powder duo from Laura Mercier i set from light to dark I normally use a bigger size I like to think we should but I don't I try not to go to heading to the front towards like the arch right here that's where you want to go heavy so sometimes this is a good trick and the outside of their nose and go it up and that's where your arch should be outside of the nose angle ups and that's where your art should be I feel like more of myself on my browser built it so I'm going to use the eye Basics in wheat and just dab it on my eye you can use a brush you can use a sponge but I like to use my fingers yes baby yeah [Music] using my shadow palette I use a light-colored first gently tap it so it's evenly spread out blending is your and I'm going to move on to my favorite editorial palette so what's great about this is that you can use your fingers sometimes and mix colors either brush there's like this setting powder which is cool so that your eyeshadow instead sometimes I'm I do this do not break in again you set it again I'm going to go back to the metallic rust make sure it was a little bit of black and brown clay so I'm going to add conceal my under eyes I'm going to use the secret concealer dab it under where I want to conceal this is what you want to use for your under eyes because it's creamy you want something that dries your skin is only where I wasn't even so it's a foot is higher oh it's okay it can't be too perfect next up to you but I like to use the not so pretty the French makeup artist taught me how to say this perfectly but I kind of forgot cuz your poor hands oceans eyeliner don't go too crazy because it's really strong then I just don't want contour this is my favorite contour palette I only I forgot my brush my fingers go Comfort dark medium right here and then my nose to you then blended so I start with the cream cheek blush with ceaser like individual ones but I have like the whole palette so you can buy them individually they're smaller which is nice so you can carry them around or you can violate controlled Kate and then pick up the colors that you want then and I start with Holly India ole India a leaner cream Chico Java so I'm using when flush then /not radiant pink powder and run number three so the trick to curling your lashes start on the edge or the root go to the middle and then to the end [Music] Wow I am ready I'm going to get dressed and I shall see you later playfully ready subscribe to my list on and love the shade of coral so pretty [Music] 
hey guys it's amy from song of style and thank you so much for always watching my videos and I read every single one of your comments especially about the beauty makeup suggestions so this time I brought my favorite makeup art is my number no we're not in Paris were in LA in my house and today I'm going to amfAR so he decided we could do a quick tutorial with her so this is a finished look watch it so you can see how she achieved this look and if you have any questions or comments leave them below so my did you eat lunch oh look a magic tip something no they're like whoa you ate it no like I ate it on Monday so I bought like for a week worth I don't want to finish yet Friday now everything's gone you know okay the first thing I used was a moisturizer and really I put that everywhere and then I use a little Elizabeth Arden 8 hour cream on her lips just to moisturize okay so now I'm using some concealer or her eye lid it's like clay to PO so instead of a primer I just use that one savers you call it Oprah do you miss Paris you do me too and so next is a time for a cream shadow it's like a bronzy color what kind of look are we gonna do today we're gonna do a broad eat smoky eye and red light cool so I just apply this shadow the cream shadow from her lash line to her crease and kind of fade up and it doesn't have to be perfect because I'm gonna layer some powder shadows over it so I'm using this bronze shadow like dolce and gabbana I'm not sure if they still make this palette but the reason why I like to layer a cream underneath the powder shadow is for the intensity of the color and also because it makes it stand longer oh also the keys blending so you always want to blend out any edges this is just a clean brush and I always say like the fluffier brush it's better to diffuse any kind of lines and if I wanted to add more shadow this is a great brush to use cuz it picks up less color as opposed to the first brush I applied it's stiffer so it picks up more color okay so now I'm just adding a little bit of a dark brown I'm mixing the brown and this black and I'm gonna run it along her lash line I wet my brush just a little bit is there a reason why you wet your brush with water powder um just to make it more intense minute lasts longer smudge your longer lash line so you you went dark on the lash line gently pressing on what are you doing the dark brown and you start laughing and people know why I do Isis mm-hmm yeah so Maya does eyes first because it's easier to clean up because if I have foundation on then and she accidentally drops like powder whatever or mix in the shadow you know it's harder to blend is it the darker shape yeah this is the black oh the eyeliner yeah the shadow but I'm just liking it like an eyeliner it took an event that's what they're feeding me oh that's always employer smart because if you're really angry if I don't eat and then I am I just need to eat this lightning a bronze shadow underneath try not to use a super dark color like also you want to stay close to the lash line so you know if you useful active hang on your skin color and you know you're really fair anything more contrast will to your skin color is going to be more attacked so which color did you paint like the bronze Charlotte Oh boots yeah I'm just going to add more it's brown blending so now we'll start foundation so I'm using Armani foundation is a luminous silk which shape and some mixing so there's one six two shades six Papa six a pump of six and couple of pumps at eight pumps of eight which is slightly darker yes easy blender did you mix both right now or no yeah I select a little Dada I keep them separate just so I know where I put it usually I don't put the darker one more on the exterior of your face and the later one on the inside so six and the inside dark on the outside yeah but you're kind of mixing mixing so to play anymore Dada Dada Dada oh okay but then when I get to your outside I'll do like eight oh one other questions or people was one comment asking people is that somebody was asking if I got a lip injection it was like oh my god I'm telling you she's your lips a night because people aren't used to you wearing like yeah you're a little bit on the outline but it wasn't like they're there you know your lips exist love it and more consumer yes they'll a concealer just you know in certain areas that like around the nose that can be a little bit harder than you know the foundation won't cover so sometimes it's a little bit pain under the eye sometimes you know around the mouth if you needed it okay so now I'm going to do like a pinky blush Kevin it's called prove Ella is a powder not the cream mm-hmm so I like to start right where this little meaty pieces when you smile that little ball and I just put it there and then I'll fade it and then I'll just take my Beauty Blender and just kind of blend it all together make sure there's no weird lines gives a really nice healthy flush and also a layer of powder blush over it and so it will be a little bit more it will stay on longer this is them I'm just using a light like bronzer that I'll just use I want the contour of it will give a dimension it's super light the color it's not like crazy are you not a fan of contour I just I like it more natural I feel like it's a pendant mm-hmm like if you needed it and then I'd be like okay so I'm just giving her a little mascara are we doing false lashes yeah yeah I think that was another question they wanted to know which one you're using I use our gel natural short black I like them because they're not free I mean if they don't have that ball oh let the at the end of it usually there's like a little mom so I kind of just put them wherever spots that I need and I just used some eyelash glue that's white and then I'll try it clear so sometimes one of the tricks I have it's a line sigh this is a body brown gel liner in black so lying like the top lash line just to make it more intense so this little tickle so look down this is a highlighter I love champagne and I think this is rose and I'll mix both shades to be bigger my nose is so tiny it is but it's so cute but I don't know I just never heard anyone say they can take care I'm just really in around then it will make this anymore but it's just like a waxy pomade and like a light medium brown I'm just using an angle like it's difficult brush so this one is a diva it's by Mac and it's like a really deep like Bordeaux red you're always here cuz I always sing what so amy has amazing full lips but because she always wears these peachy summer colors you probably don't realize how cool they aren't until we put a really bright or bold shade on and yes I do draw a little bit outside but not much to the comedian alley long yeah baby Cobra it's so funny anyway I was working with her earlier and he was a huge fan and she says hi really yeah look comedians I'll let you and I you have to see baby Cobra she's coming out in another Netflix um special she like good friends with Dave Chappelle and yeah she's just awesome and she's a writer she cold like roar created fresh off the boat Oh is she the one in the she's not into me that's constant I we're gonna leave if it's not perfect I'll show you how to get that boy so I'll just do a little concealer on a brush like a stiff brush if you're gonna wear a bold lip I would keep everything else pretty neutral on the face so yeah you can emphasize and have lashes and you know mascara but then I would keep it though like the focus on the lips finish yeah

fashion have a problem we have to figure out like work it out together and I think that growing up to my fondest memories of my mother coming here not speaking a lick of English I'm father he would like knock on a doughnut shop doors and like he didn't do this yeah his kids were started we were all started because we were brought and put in a home and that's a great no we were responsible Church yeah and then earlier and my mom she was a seamstress in China is all she knew was so she would like to start blanket this collection recycle the strips of fabrics nothing he was nothing sort of finished because it was never love but that was good like the most beautiful to provide by the closer and even like the necklaces and the jury it was like shelves and keys what happens is in market systems you use those shells to barter for things and that's your currency and we're on you when you're enough I never knew I could business school dropout I never went to fashion school but I always loved how closely we feel naturally I've done typing my mom I remember when I dropped out of school I secretly snuck into Home Economics Department again it was like closing the window and everything like that and I finished a degree in that we were standing like this and I was like why I tell you a secret I I have a degree I finished was amazing amazing amazing you know like mr. that like but it's in so in here home economics and shouldn't really cry she was like all we want for you is a better life but now you're doing doing what I did I worked in factories and no one ever saw me why do

you are she came she comes to some shows she's like because that's what she did she taught me in a way don't you think your skills and business I really am thankful that I did 3 years of and try the drop down idea of creativity is its intangible I get them out of schools you know no no no we have a lot of internet were like me where's of this and that some of my teams actually have these are second careers I identify because I didn't go to school doing that I found it people who are on the teams that have second careers they can't escape from it it's really about your tribe how much you want it how much you love it and how much you can't give it down to because I always say yes tough but what other choice do you have I try really [Music] you actually show you people how you did and like hey I love it in Psych use like test accessible and people laughing about you crazy [Music] [Music] I'm back in my hotel room eating again so it's only been like three hours since I had lunch I constantly get hungry in New York because when it's cold my body craves food I've been craving tagine hmm it's very delicious I see filled Lim D Phillip Lim walking down the street in New York and his story really warmed my heart I loved his collection you know like purple is obviously a big trend right now and when I was looking at his collection I was thinking about like like a mix-and-match of certain thing it looked undone and he was saying that was what he was going for because of the times right now you know we all come from different places and we live in such a global day and age right now because of social media how I feel that we are so connected and like all of us have like a different back story to tell and I thought like his collection was very powerful in that sense where like the clothes and his story like the window models walking down the runway it kind of had that narrative I still remember the very first pair of Phillip Lim shoes I ever bought I will put in a throwback photo of that those were like one of my favorite shoes I wore them so many times and I still have him he's such a nice guy such a nice guy makes me feel so good makes me want to support him even more I'm extremely happy right now because I have my vegan food might meet loving Italian is becoming almost vegan because of me having my gluten-free vegan snacks these are from bye bye Chloe that cupcake will increase stickers they're so delicious [Music] [Applause] and I love them so much that I got so many cookies look this makes me so happy it's all about moderation although today I'm a little I'm gonna work out tonight so I'm like SHINee does much before I burnt all of it [Music] 
I'm going to show you guys how I remove my makeup today my issue with this short hair is that it's hard to tie because so short so usually I remove my makeup when I'm in the shower and I shower at night because I like to sleep really clean but I just showered earlier so I'm gonna just wash my face I always brush my teeth first before I move my makeup guys want to see what products I use or what products I brought so if you want me to go through them individually that's hundred percent pure Jamaican black castor oil which I put on my lashes apparently helps with the lash growth this is my like moisturizer this is my Ola Henriksen double cleanser so these are like really moisturizing I also have a mask from the hookah collection Hydra clay detox mask I have a foaming cleanser the sk2 essence makeup remover which is like my solar water serum oil BIOS on soil all right I'm just gonna show you guys how I do it so during Fashion Week I usually have more makeup than usual so I'll clean my face with a cleansing oil right now this is my third or fourth bottle I've been using from bioessence it's lab base squalene squalene antioxidant cleansing oil so it's good for removing really tough makeup like mascara foundation all of that lipstick I have no idea what I look like right now you see all that coming out out panda eyes Pina pin pin pin penis so no makeup that's it just kidding so just in case actually cleanse my face really really well cuz you never want to have any kind of makeup residue on your face when you go to bed because that's when your skin cells generally generate themselves and you just want to have like a really clean skin so the next thing I use it depends I would if I'm wearing a lot of makeup I always do the scrub but I did this last night and I don't want to do I usually don't do this like every single day do it like maybe like three times a week during Fashion Week or even four times during the week on a regular basis I only do it like twice a week but here it says rinse thoroughly use two or three times per week this if you have oily skin this is amazing and cleaning your pores probably gonna use the foaming cleanser actually you know what I'm going to use cuz my skin feels really dry today so I'm going to use the older Henriksen wonderful double cleanser as you can see I've been using this a lot I really like doing this field on my face okay you so that's how I'm gonna wash my face today I'm actually gonna do one more thing which is since my skin feels really really dry today I'm going to actually put a mask on and then wash my face again I'm gonna do the Hoover Hydra clay detox mask from Alexa so put a generous amount on your face don't I look like a Geisha and then I wait about ten minutes what should we do for ten minutes okay it's been about 15 minutes so I'm gonna wash my face on the bottle it says leave on for 10 minutes but sometimes I even leave it on for 30 minutes last time when I hung out with Ulla Henriksen yes I hung out with him no big deal he we watched a movie he left it on for two and a half hours or two hours or however long Dirty Dancing is so like he put on the face mask before Dirty Dancing started and then him and I had a dance-off after Dirty Dancing cuz we were like inspired by the movie we're just dancing it and he's still had it on so the man himself who created this leaves it off for more than two hours I think it's safe to leave it on for two hours it's the size you could either rinse off with water or remove with a damp washcloth I always rinse it off with water [Music] and then I carry on with me the rest of my beauty routine so I'm super anal about removing my makeup really well so after just removing my makeup I use some kind of my solar water I'm using the Garnier Garnier skin active micellar cleansing water water and it's 3.4 ounces so it's TSA approved and this is like the makeup test I feel like this and see if there's any makeup left nah that's how you know your makeup remover or whatever you are using like the cleansing stuff works when there's nothing on here you know nada okay next sk2 essence so I first use a skate to when I got to work with them Shu first approached me and then I tried their products really liked it so I got to work with them but ever since I am hooked so I just have my face on my neck I use this every day morning and night I actually don't stop my face that hard I think I was just like being overly dramatic I'm gonna let this sit on my face let my face absorb all the goodness hash hack this is not sponsored I bought this bottle myself although it's Katie if you want to send me more bottles I would happily and gladly take them so I just came back from Costa Rica you all know that so I've unfortunately unfortunately acquired more freckles despite wearing a lot of Suns so now every single day I've been using the truth serum you can see how much I've used this is a new bottle I usually have a smaller bottle when I travel but I upgrade it to the bigger one all right so I put it on my face this is so good for your skin texture it's vitamin C basically if you have really really sensitive skin vitamin C can irritate your skin a little it has a narrow jaded not going with it hasn't irritated my skin yet and I have a very very very sensitive eczema skin so just like rub it in my face okay next I use an eye cream right now I'm going to use the goop perfecting eye cream actually never use this before this is like my first bottle I like it because it's small and it's travel size I'll let you know how it works it just tap it with my ring finger the reason you use your ring finger to apply eye products is because your ring finger is one of the most gentle fingers you don't want to put too much pressure and rub it in you know cuz you don't you want to prevent wrinkles and then whatever's left over it put it on my like laughs line at forehead I use the hoola Henriksen pure truth youth activating oil is orange to makes my face orange a little but I like it it's so gentle okay true story when I was in Sonoma I actually broke out in hives after horseback riding literally there were like giant hives all around my face all around my neck I put this on lift it on my face like I had to wash my face when I went back to my hotel put this on my face literally calmed being down there like massage myself oh yeah baby oh yeah oh yeah then on my body usually after a shower I put BIOS ons 100% squalene oil all over my money and then I massage my shoulders so shoulders hold all the stress and your hips hold your emotions apparently so do you guys know the pigeon pose like I tried always like almost on a daily basis I try to stretch my hips I open up my hips I don't recommend Suellen oil if you have oily skin though I'm dry skin so I use this okay after this you know what I do I put my moisturizer on but I let it sit on my face for a little bit so it's not like product after product after product and it's not just like sitting on top of my face and want it to absorb so let it like sit on my face for like maybe five minutes or so what do I do usually I look at my phone but Sophia has my phone so just gonna talk to myself do you guys have any really good book recommendations if you do leave a comment below psycho check them out I actually can't wait to go back home totally I miss my dogs and I miss my sister so much my dad and my mom but it really was me dogs okay I think it's been like five minutes so as my moisturizer did you hear that I use a Venn motion raising cream it's got the zircon ad bomber relief be dumb then they feed them oh it's a lip lip bitter clinton replenishing and it's anti irritating and it's very very moisturizing hyper allergenic it's good for severe dryness skin prone to a topic dermatitis which is like eczema and skin prone to itching so which is good for me but for those who don't need something such a this is like a very heavy moisturizer so if you don't have like extreme dry skin like me I see go with the normal one I'll link those below in the description box that you guys can check it out and get it that's it that's all I do actually I forgot one thing so I've been using this castor oil from Shea Moisture it's the 100% pure jamaican black castor oil I've only been using it for about a month I see I think I see a difference like my lashes seem like they're slowly growing because I wanted to find a natural way to grow my lashes instead of getting those like I don't use lash extension I don't I don't want to do those serums because I feel like I hear so many horror stories about him like especially since I have sensitive skin I don't want like my eyelids to like turn red so I use something that's more natural which is the Jamaican black castor oil okay that's it thank you so much for watching you guys and if you guys have any beauty questions please leave a comment below make sure to subscribe and

those who don't know Carla's she's also a fashion blogger Carla's started probably a few months before I did Carla she was like the sickest style and what I love about Carla her last MS dead-ass DDoS what I love about her is that she doesn't give a  about what the trend is her style is all about what works for her and what works for her body I honestly feel like Carla was the first one who started this whole like bloggers fashion line I've known her for a few years she's also from LA she does hurt and I find that so inspiring but anyways I got to pick up a few pieces from her life you're gonna

beautiful heels socks are making a big comeback especially because like designers are doing these like sock booth like dumb nefra Balenciaga even the easy Kanye West he did these coolest sock boots you can also get affordable options from like H&amp;M but if you don't want to do sock pose you can wear soft and a pair of heels oh these are so cute okay fishnet tights are still big and they're more like a classic blue metallic tights metallic tights are in so for fall if you want to get tight I highly highly suggest going either with like fishnet tights and metallic types metallic tights

messages so like I'll go through my DMS and emails when I'm in the car like stuck in traffic like right now and sometimes they all like screen shot my favorite ones and then this one I'm not gonna name who cuz it could be personal it's normal that people just randomly cry whenever they're sad or hurt and things they don't know or understand because I think we we happy people like I'm a happy person tend to be so happy even with our friends that we forget to be sad and we forget about our stressful emotions inside but it's a good thing though we have a circle to lean on or to make us happy but still it's nice it's really nice to let it out when you're alone because it feels more satisfying inside and at East and by that you can start your new day right again thank you for inspiring me

mangos and dried fruits like dried apples and mangos at the airport and always pack bananas or get a banana smoothie Airport this is like a chocolate crunchy bite sunflower seed crunchy bite things that I just got in the grocery store a little mini Polaroid camera and then inside my bag I have two other bags one CD bag with all of my airplane approved beauty products and then just like the normal hand bag with my wallet and etc so let me go through those first so I will should we go different beauty products as you know I'm a huge beauty junkie and in the plea I'm on the plane so often that my beauty routine in the plane is like all set and it's all about moisturizing and relaxing and hydrating inside the plane so I'm gonna have a lot of things what should I start with I have my solar water to remove any makeup I have bioessence rose oil it's a vitamin C rose oil it's super super hydrating so I slather this on all around my face my neck my entire body and then I have some more oil this is dark fond of chamomile oil and the scent of chamomile helps me fall asleep and it relaxes me so I use this right before I'm about to sleep I also have another oil this one is the pure truth youth activating oil it has rosehip oil inside and it's from Lula Henriksen and I really really like it it's really calming for my sunset effects on my skin and then for my lips my lips always get dry because I do so much kissing just kidding this is from by Terry and it's like a nourishing smoothing regenerating lip balm and has like a rosy scent to it so I really really like it I also have a bite lip liner I discovered this brand not too long ago honestly probably about like six months ago and never replace all of my lip liners and lip products with their stuff because I really really like the colors it's not drying for me I I just really like this brand and it goes on so smooth this is sometimes I use just a lipstick I have the lipstick somewhere in my bag or just a lip liner and I find it really flattering and actually I think I got all the lip colors because I'm so obsessed then I have an eyelash curler I don't wear makeup when I'm on the flight but when I'm about to exit the flight I always curl my lashes put lips and then do my eyebrows so in here somewhere there is probably an eyebrow pencil yep currently I'm using an Anastasia Beverly Hills eyebrow pencil one side has like the pencil and it's kind of light the color is taupe and the other side has a spool which is very important for me and then in the plan I also like to use an eye serum this one is also from bias on sits a squelen peptide eye gel for my eyes and then I have so many beauty products but everything is under 3.4 ounces this one is also from Lula and Wixon and it's a cooling eye gel so if I feel like my eyes are going to poofy during the flight I'll put this on and then I have a moisturizer this is from a pen I got it from a French pharmacy but they sell it online as well and I'll link the products below so that you guys can shop I also have oh this one is like my eczema cream so sometimes they get like crazy flare-ups so I just have like a tiny little bottle where I put like my eczema it's really bad for you but I have like a steroid cream in those events where it's like really bad flare-ups so this is like my emergency steroid cream and then I have my love mer creme de la minute think that's what it's called the moisturizing soft cream where you I think I'm done using animals yeah basically I finished it I killed it so you scoop it rub it between your fingers or hand heat it up and then gently press it onto your face I love this thing okay so oh and I also have an extra eyebrow pencil because I tend to lose my pencils so often they always just like if I don't completely close this case they always like slip off or fall off so this is from Laura Messier and it's the brunette color but right now I'm liking the lighter color more and then I also have earplugs because I'm plains I just like to cancel out the noise I have mouthwash earrings and jewelry your house currently have my Chloe necklace so this one always beeps when I go through the metal detector so I always take it out I think that's it in my little beauty carry on inside my big Louie bag I always have like a smaller hand purse and right now it's just Chloe bag since I'm going on an adventure needed back packing up and in my Chloe bag I have an allergy medicine basically benadryl I have my vlogging camera this is canon g7x I had a canon before and I lost it so Yakubu surprised me with this camera so sweet of him and I lost it in Paris I don't know if you guys remember my vlogs Paris blog where I was very emotional oh and I lost it but I like found it again but I feel like so the older versions I feel like they're much sturdier this one I haven't used it much but I were to crack the screen which sucks but it still functions really well and then I have a little velvet pouch to protect the camera and then inside my Chloe backpack I have the supreme Movietone collaboration card holder and that oh this is my current new favorite lip color from my beauty as well it's radish so usually you know me for like the pinky coral tones but lately I've been kind of lazy to put makeup on and whenever those days where I don't have any makeup on and I just have my brows on I'll just put a pop of color and I really really like the way it complements my skintone that's all I have in this little mini backpack what else do I have in my bag I love to read when I'm on a plane that's like my moment to read right now I'm reading this book called a little life so my friend charlie the really handsome gay guy that you guys thought was my new boy toy he recommended this but for me and he got it for me so sweet of him and it's about four college classmates it's about their lives their lives went up and down and actually just started reading it but apparently it's a life changing book according to Charlie I also asked my readers on Instagram any books that they recommend for me and I just bought like seven or eight books on Amazon I tried a Kindle a few years ago and I don't know I didn't like it so much so I still buy books and this book is called the subtle art of not giving us and so many of you guys recommended this but so I'm sure I'm really excited to eat this book I haven't read it yet but by the time this video goes up I would have probably finished it or read it half way and this other book is called this is me letting you go and I actually saw a passage of this book like at a bookstore a while ago and I instructor I'm storing it and it was about like how everything is about timing everybody was asking me what the book was called this is a chapter that I screenshot it and then you guys were like going crazy asking me what this book was called and we read the page for you the truth about meeting someone at the wrong time timing is something that none of us can seem to get quite right with relationships we meet the person of our dreams a month before they leave to go study abroad we form an incredibly close relationship or friendship with an attractive person who has already taken one relationship ends because our partner isn't ready to get serious and another end is because they're getting serious to soup it would be perfect we move to our friends if only this we're five years from now or eight years sooner some in distant time in the future where all of our problems would take care of themselves timing seems to be the variable third party in all of our relationships and yet we never stop to consider why we led timing play such a drastic role in our lives timing is a bitch but it's only a bitch if we let it be here's a simple truth that I think we all need to face up to the people we need at the wrong time are actually just the wrong people you never meet the right people at the wrong time because the right people are timeless the right people make you want to throw away the plans you originally had for one and follow them into the hazy unknown future without a glance backwards the right people don't make you whom and how about whether or not you want to be with them you just know you know that any adventure you had we planned out for your future isn't going to be half as incredible as the adventures you could have by their side that no matter what you thought you wanted before this is better everything is better since they came along when you are with the right person time falls away anyway so I'm really excited to finish this book because I only write like few chapters of this book and no I'm not going through a breakup but I heard it's a really good book to read if you're going through a breakup so this is another book that I'm reading and I also have an eye mask this one is from iluminage and it's a silk eye mask and I find it so relaxing on the plane and look what I found found another eyebrow pencil in my purse so basically that's all I have in my bag Oh panty liners girls you know what that is and that's it voila so this is what's in my carry-on if you guys have any questions regarding and you have the beauty products leave your comments below and I'll try to answer them as soon as possible and thanks so much for watching bye you 
hi drivers audiences today I'm doing a video that you guys have been requesting for a while and it's how to do my hair usually I keep my hair really straight because I actually have straight hair and I've always been a rush some lazy but now my hair isn't growing to like add mid to long bob length so I finally get to curl it today I'm going to marry carrying Lionel Richie custard so I'm going to be curling one here preside so first what this is what I use this is a Phillips hair curler I actually got this from Paris because it forgot my hair color no actually I didn't forget my hair really for what happened was I think I didn't bring the right converters I completely blew my hair curlers so I have to go out when I go I went to a snack I think that's what it's called and the cool thing about this is that it has a different control so from 1 to 8 depending on how well your hair responds to girls I usually put it around like five or six one thing I always need like a heat protectant think this one is from care star and it's a thermal it's a miracle my shapeable heat lotions and redefining heat styling like long wear hold and repositionable shape control we activate with heat tools even has low temperatures there more protection up to 230 degrees Celsius control the look of frisk for 96 hours and 80% humidity so the data this is not only this isn't like a heat protectant but it also helps hold my curls in so as you can see this is my a tracker I literally woke up like this so usually it's more straight like this but I slept with my hair in a bun last so it's doing like Eastside website all kinds of site I put the heat protectant thing in my hair while the hair curlers being heated up should really brush my hair I have this bad habit of not brushing my hair so just brush it with my fingers since I got my hair I like literally cut off all the dead ends so my hair's been really smooth and then the thing about my hair is or the thing about me is and they look like a perfectionist but I'm not a perfectionist so this hair tutorial is for those who don't care about having perfect ways it's all about that effort lids like layers look like hey I literally woke up like this although I spend like 20 minutes curling my hair it's for those girls because I really don't like looking all done up I don't like perfect curls perfection is boring need to have some flaws that's what make sure you meet the tool is all heated up you can see the lights right here so the first thing I do is get a small piece like really small paper maybe like I don't know how small this is but like not even half an inch just a little bit of it and then I curl it into one direction and then I don't hold it for too long so this is what happens you see that and then I get another small section this is a trick to my hair I currently the opposite way he did so if I felt this it works I'll curve this word for vice versa so leave it like this this is a trick that I learned for my hairstyle is on forward Ramirez Tran salon so now I curl this outwards again or it works this is that works this is outward in it believe it there like for a few seconds and then I repeat the rest but sometimes I forget which way I curled it takes about like 15 minutes most times it's how long it's going to take please it's 11:40 I was very narcissistic photo of myself as a background there's one mess like that one rope but it's easy to fix get the tips and curl it up I'm going to do that for the rest of my hair so how was everybody's weekend I went to Santa Barbara this weekend without realizing that I was born in Santa Barbara so there wasn't even for Valentino's and he magazine all the way in Santa Barbara Montecito to be exact for some reason I did I didn't read the fine print so it said it was no Montecito only felt something like almonds on the scanner part and this is very original on the song so I bring my friend Charlie and I'm like oh yeah Santa Monica and when we get in the car throw volunteer such a driver when we get the car the dress I asked you driver oh how long is it going to take thinking it completely forty minutes normally with chocolate he goes two hours and twenty minutes only two hours 20 minutes are using wait there's a faster way to get there and he like just amusing ways and he's like it's in Santa Barbara like tango Cara oh my gosh does not really it was in Santa Barbara it's like so typical me I don't like slink into the details and I just say yes yes sure I'm down and then I like invite my friends I'm like hey I didn't wanna go so he had that happen and after that I was supposed to go to Hollywood Cemetery where marathon were always very to watch a movie and her sounds really creepy but there's really cool thing in LA called ten esp√≠a where you can watch movies at this Hollywood Cemetery lon so cold like they do it all up every weekend like on Saturdays so sometimes they go back to at the straight part like the designers and then just curl it sorry I'm probably the worst tutorial and then it le computer needed company because really it's so that my hair is like not per se I don't like perfection and I could do it like the perfect curls but that's just not the type of person I am just like my hair looking messy I'm from LA unlike the go with the flow effortless girl who actually puts a lot of effort into wood but it's just all about looking and like effortless rate although what's wrong with looking like you try hard but I mean I just don't have the skills it so tempting to say see this one I felt it out words this when I pull it in words you see this curls men keep up doing the same thing so my hairstyle is on he causes the lives in hair look because I've listened not to perfect I think not something about us Californian girl people have this misconception of all the helpers and women being so fake so we're not the real ones like me or not fake we make mistakes all the time we don't have to look perfect looking we need to look perfect why does society give so much pressure to girls to a moment to look perfect are we doing this to ourselves actually our reach is raising the standards too high and that's why I like the world want them to be perfect are we doing this ourselves nah okay oh and by the way a lot of you guys are leaving comments thinking that I'm dating this new guy named Charlie he's gave you guys unfortunately for every closest friend you got the voice still in the picture he's just in New York that's the thing about long-distance relationships we talk every day now anybody helps in a long-distance relationship it's tough especially when like both of you guys are so busy but then again there needs to be a lot of understanding of each other schedule thanks for never very understanding girlfriend and think leaves the very understanding boyfriend okay so you see all this not the toughest thing about my hair though with this length of doing the back because so short like I can't turned it all the way but anyways I do that in size now and I completely forgot which way I was doing but it's fine because we're not trying to make our curls perfect it's all about the messy lives in hairless and so excited for more I carry and my RG that's tonight there might be a meeting great moment but I'm really excited to see Mariah Carey and you'll never see her reality show she's such a people I love it during her interview she's literally laying down on like a chaise lounge and doing all her energy she can't be bothered to like set up to do her interviews she Mariah I love it okay so the front is pretty much it does I mean this is a perfect I always go back and do some more curl towards the end but I'm going to do the back now maybe XM will do a hair tutorial on how to style my hair with out and heat I don't know if you guys nervous but I've been doing this new diet called whole 30 and I screwed up a few time so basically the whole 30 night is eliminating soy dairy grains like corn quinoa right so this is a tricky part the back so just do whatever direction but anyway so I'm doing this like mold or anything so it's been really hard in the beginning because honestly I don't really cook with my schedule it's so hard to cook I literally eat up every single day and so I've started doing this because I don't have time to go to the grocery I don't have time to cook at home I'm never home so like when we're going to do it you know anyway so my time Charlie was like oh you want to do this with me and because I'm like a down-ass bitch I'm like hell yeah I'll do it without really putting too much thought into it I thought it was going to be super easy but it's so hard because you're limited and you can't really go without and eat because everywhere you go they put sugar in your food like promptly sugar whatever the ask so many random things like msg I didn't like so I screwed up a few times only because I went to a restaurant Italian restaurant I ordered friends Ino and spinach like vegetable side of spinach turned out as Benjamin deal of cooked in butter who cooks fishes enabled and butter I didn't know that maybe you're supposed to but I didn't know so I screwed up and like it hopping like two or three times so I'm not like hundred percent I've come under as I committed to the whole 30 but the world's not helping me I mean I just knew be more aware but it's been two weeks since I've done it have I lost weight I don't know if I lost weight because I'm eating a lot of sugar I've been like a lot of fruit so I don't think I lost so much weight but I did see a difference I I ain't no online I am losing weight but I'm losing weight on my ass so now I just have to go back into like certain areas and see where I haven't done in the beginning of week one was so hard I felt weak the first week because I just wasn't getting enough carbs because I'm Korean I I just need my rights I love pasta and I'm dating an Italian I love pasta and to not be able to eat carbs was really hard but then again I realized and vegetables you can also get different kinds of cars like from sweet potato so so now it's been very it's been easier but I just the only thing is that I needed find more recipes so I have other options to eat you know what I mean okay see this is pretty good we still need to do this part the bottom part well usually unless I have like a red-carpet event or like cigarette absolute a little better we're getting photographed from behind as well I don't care what my back looks like except for my amp so when I'm doing my hair what do I think about I do you think about what I'm going to eat that day I think they're all my life pretty amazing right now it's all melted down but it's all about how you how you look at things right perfect like perfect doesn't like the way I like it how it's not like super crazy curls so the front is where I always go back so I go back to the front and curl it a little bit more you see what I did right here like here I don't care so much I like to looking messy then you go back again I mean I've got a sign for you satisfy with my hair and then something if you like my hair with because out straight here so what I'll do is I'll just take a few strands in the middle and give it this volume by curling I like this on the top you know I thought have a pretty funny youtube idea which is what I thought was like giving the tutorial and Korean because my Korean is not perfect and also it's because I have a very strong accent which is a Elvis American accent but also my grandma is from this area called Busan which is kind of like the countryside right by the water so she'll Busan accent and they speak differently so what is what if I did that pretty much fun right I curled it too much for this or to do underneath if you look perfect I like the messy look because it's like the California beach waves you know like super chill last day Lake hey am I taking me 20 minutes to

[Music] hey guys I heard Spanish style and today I'm introducing a new series where I'm taking one piece of clothing and styling it in several different ways so first up is this pajama blouse so if you know me you know I have an obsession with silk pajamas and I decided to wear them outside of my bedroom and I wanted to style it in several different ways that's actually wearable and doesn't look like a pajama so the first house they would be actually embracing the pajama Jen and wear your pajama set outside but in order to make it work and make a less loungy although it's nice and brutal a Sheila is pairing it with some Jessy heels whether it's like high-heeled sandals or like partly pumps and game dressing up the pajama look and make it work for during the day or night and whether the second leg is just out and about I like to wear my pajama about this just like any silk blouse pair them up with Dennis you know I love them so for what I chose is a high-waisted frame done with wisconsin' the next look is wearing with the drama's to words I could just wear your pajamas with the makes it is later and trouser and official lookups want to wear them work it in yoga so really easy casual way to work to talk about this is actually more than kind of like an outerwear so I would wear them with maybe like a simple white t-shirt denim shorts and this is the pajama blouse just like a jacket or like a light color where SP for a night out the easiest way to wear the pajamas louse is wearing it with is sexy miniatures my current favorite one is the patent leather skirt from ASOS it's different for everyone has a giant bow in front so it's kind of sexy and cute at the same time and to make the outfit a little bit more fancy I like to pair them up with my summer on top another way I like to wear my pajama shirt is absolutely cover-up so I'll wearing for the beach or swimming pool I could either tie the shirt or just went over my equipment so far variation she's five I like to belt my pajama shirt and I suggest you do like a short result so that you can belt or right around your waist and make your waist look smaller than you I'm taller alright so I hope you guys enjoyed this new series and if you guys have any suggestions or actually have questions regarding on how to wear something multiple ways so thank you guys actually it's a good amount of chakra where leave a comment below and I'll file them next time thank you bye [Music] you 
hi guys it's aria from song of style and in today's episode I'm sure you guys had a style white button-down and seven eight or nine different ways so I'm gonna actually go with the flow and see how many outfits I could come up with so the thing I like about white button-downs is they look dressy so even if you're a hot mess and you only have five minutes you still look somewhat presentable so the first look is my everyday go to you when I go to the office and today I wore my outfit the first leg is a white button-down shirt with my go-to denim right now my favorite pair of denim are these frame jeans that are slightly high-waisted and I also found an affordable version of these pumps so I'll link them below so you guys can check them out and to make the outfit a little bit more fun and have some color in it I'm styling it with a scarf from DVF for the warmer months I love Larry so I'm gonna wear my white button-down with a nice chunky sweater and don't forget to pull out those sweet so for my next outfit I'm making the white button-down into a party outfit so I'm gonna pair with does Caroline constable skirt and these bow sandals from saline I'm making this look a little cleaner if I tied my hair and I'm also wearing these gold earrings or 14-karat gold there were only 50 dollars so I also wear a lot of slip dresses so I thought I'd combine two of my favorites in one outfit I just like the color of the slip dress and then I'm wearing my simple Jimmy Choo high-heeled sandals also a genocide Leone hat and so the next outfit I'm sure you'd see me do this probably I think I did this last year so wearing my shirt backwards I think the fun way to do it is buttoning that asymmetrically but to be honest because I'm doing it backwards and I don't have eyes I'd be like my head actually button it the right way how you're supposed to fit a shirt inside your skirt and the reason I chose this spot long skirt is because I felt like it's all about the fact the back of this denim skirt has like these cool too tall and been going on and I just wanted to focus to do on the back another fun outfit of mine is definitely utilizing them overalls this look is easy because you just wear your white button-down with a pair of overalls but the key to this look is all about the cups so I fold the pants first on the side towards the ankle to make it look a little bit more tapered and then I cuff it so it stays next outfit is basically what I'm wearing right now it's super easy this is like my go-to outfit during the summer so basically you just tie your shirt and that's it the important thing about this outfit because it's a white on white outfit I like to accessorize with layering necklaces I'm also learning these cool clean any part shape sandals and also carrying this mini Chloe backpack so for the next outfit I'm giving you guys two looks using the exact same outfit so the first look I'm making my shirt into a bustier by I'm not putting on the sleeves and then just simply tying the sleeves around my chest another way I like to wear it is slightly asymmetrical and showing one of my shoulders so you just button the shirt asymmetrically thank you so much for watching this video and I hope you enjoyed it because I know I did so if you guys have any other outfit ideas or questions please leave a comment below and don't forget to subscribe don't forget to give me a thumbs up and like and comment and all that and tell me which outfit was your favorite and if you get inspired by this outfit and want to share with me or I have any other ideas to style a white shirt leave a comment below and I'll remember it and I'll try them on - thank you bye you 
[Music] I've been locked out of my room I hear people I went and use this day now baby mm-hmm is it delicious my Italian could never get rid of his ham I think you're gonna be a pescetarian I am no I never I don't eat meat I mean sometimes you got you gotta have b12 b12 is there a natural way to get b12 other than meat eggs I think eggs yeah other animal products are you sure we can't get b12 um maybe I products I'm not like good amounts I guess eat faster let me research that okay okay if like it gets canceled these things I love you [Music] [Music] I am [Music] unintentionally matching again with my girl bosses this is actually really good okay I have a question yes why is it important to be street styled I think it depends on your job your profile and what you want your next job to be because for some people it's not important mm-hmm I truly believe that and then for other people who make a career maybe off having a bigger profile then it's a little bit but I wouldn't say overall I mean for me yeah I would say it's not important yeah then why you always look it so fun because guys this is what she looks like when she manage for old shoes she wakes up like this and I know that she's my roommate this yeah yes I dress like this all the time I just in Bermuda in Morocco like I'm always I used to date a guy he's be like you were always overdressed and he hated it [Music] what's my sign of a Libra cusp of her she wanted me to hurry yeah she wanted me to type giving you good fashion advice what's that pause what was the plan she knows I'm not saying what fat I'm a now today I told you to wear this coat oh yeah she was gonna wear a more like subtle coat go big or go home what does it mean for a street style photographer to shoot like why are they so desperate to shoot Street stuff I think streets town photographers actually have like maybe the hardest job in fashion let's think about how if it's freezing cold at least we get to go inside and let get warm they're standing out there like it's so cold and freezing they're trying to get a great shot I mean they make their living from getting good pictures that these three soffit ographers are literally selling their photos to matching magazines they're looping that like when you open a bazaar a publication like that but when you see the trend pages and with real people wearing clothes like magazines use pickup photos for that see the article on the cut of photographers could being selective on who these shoes why why so much more racial diversity diversity sweet so photographers I read that and I totally understand I totally understand why the writer felt that way and why she said that and I think that little bit of truth but I think that is some for me as a much bigger issue because the argument was at Street South chakras don't shoot black girls but I was like no the real argument is why are magazines hiring laterals why are magazines higher in girls that have at their first bodies but why is it that the people that we see at shows are the exact same look I was at a show today here and then I was like well and there's really only like three black people in attendance of this show the issues always bigger than just kind of that circus well also I understand where the argument comes from why are only the same people being shot I think the bigger issue is that there's not enough diversity attending the show who is gonna get shot and I think that means that the industry from the top has to change because there's a responsibility for the people at the top to hire and mentor whether it's an intern or an assistant diverse candidates you know you have you have to do that because the people at the top one day are going to be those people who are at the bottom now the other issue is that and I've expressed this to a few of the editors who work at the cot is that the cup was the worst offender this season so I just couldn't understand how because I went through and counted how many were in the street style and I think maybe in about 200 images I saw like 500 the cut used to have Nabeel I know like a very amazing street style photographer who had a really great eye and he was diverse yes ooh and he had the best style the other thing was he'd never shot the obvious no no no yeah he always was looking for like new faces but now I don't know who's shooting your stuff well I also I have to say it's not it's so many people's problems cuz I people just want to blame the photographer it's like who is top editing those photos to not notice oh you know what a only a today they're selected white women pictures to put in this slideshow thank there's so many people who participate to the problem that could also be a part of the solution what did you guys think about dessert I always loved that show suits on suits the belt it looks the big sweaters with the rings on the dresses that were like sparkly but I my section was that first suit section I was like I know this new one yeah it's so good when you leave a show and you're you immediately want to dress like the show oh good sign that it's a good show yeah and I kept on thinking what do I have something similar like a Rico yeah and I loved how the floor kind of matched the color palette yeah and I was at the show I was thinking the only thing that could make the show better is if they had food Eva believes strongly in constant posting but like quality not like just  really not great - I just feel like a lot of the time people are like I don't know like I want to grow my following an Instagram where I want to do more on Instagram and I'm like well how often do you post I post once every three days or once every three weeks that I want to be cool everyone Oh algorithm so scary but it's about engagement so the more content you put out there the better how many accounts do you follow follow I mean what like two thousand two thousand Chrissy - I mean it has to follow like 1,800 I follow like 1,500 ami how many do you follow like 900 ok so all of us follow about a thousand accounts in this room if the average person opens Instagram like what 30 times a day ish if you open Instagram 30 times a day and you follow over a thousand accounts if she onna who is looking the other way because she knows she's heard this lecture is 56 times if she owned up posts once every three days you are not gonna see her content right right it's true it's not rocket science it's basically you have to post mine I just think the main thing is like getting into an Instagram have it and like Instagram like everything else is in half as a habit or it's like it's like I have a baby at home I don't feed my baby once every two days once every week like that which I'll deduce but then the baby wouldn't grow an Instagram for many people is their baby so feed your baby I'm literally Bank beginning to sweat thank you we're going to season one of my favorite off about a toast place we are here okay so much actually I'm not like this but I really are saying you're open so cute Kim is taking money it's so good damn Christy I try what it takes take good photos a lot of options [Music] [Applause]
