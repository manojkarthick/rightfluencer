hey everyone I am so honored to have such an incredible guest in our studio today really Bradfield I have been obsessed with him for so long and we did like basically two looks we did half of her face today inspired by Sophia Loren and then I did the other half inspired by Hooda and just basically by minute what she loves and did it - he is just a megastar in the world of beauty he has created some of the most iconic looks of Lady Gaga Kim Kardashian Sharon Stone really has a new collaboration so excited with Golani cosmetics Billy's inspiration for this was just the kind of like that all unique palette all the beautiful eyeshadows beautiful shimmery colors and we use all of them to create both of these looks hope you guys enjoyed this video I'm going to do sort of just the architecture of this stuff or so we're doing a beige waterline I love your clothes well how did you get started I ran away from home this small town in Mississippi to New York City and I had had a job and lied at Macy's and I got a job behind the counter and then discovered my talent like I never aspired to be a makeup artist and then you're just like oh I'm so good at this - no actually I just was a mess I know I didn't even know like when you mess up that you take a q-tip and some makeup remover and take it away I'm just paint over it and somehow it was okay I think I was such a hillbilly and maybe the charming right here I mean is yes got very lucky because I got discovered as a meet Boris what are some of your favorite campaigns or make us any good do you know the magazine French I am NOT analyzing lots of covers with them that's probably one of my favorite like relationship fashion ones and then celebrity wise beyond say oh yeah Missy just they're all such trailblazers when you also created some of the looks and I Gaga off and shoot something coming I feel like huge part of why she was so major so I started working with her and that in the very beginning of that and then bad romance was video and then telephone no that was a gift for me [Music] you [Music] this is my kind of like my finger thing it's a trick when you do line or rifle when it's still a little bit down you just take your finger and drag it so I'm not super crazy about Faced palettes but I love this a palette I feel like the colors the textures and the variety like you get a lot of good choices here you can do so many different things I mean you could do eyeliner you could do brows I just feel like you thought of it really well true story I got in trouble when I have my blog out first it was like the beauty for one one somebody had beautiful end net if we get to change her name and I was like well I want my name to be in there but I don't want to be makeup by this percent and I was like I really like how Billy is just like Billy Dee yes I'm just gonna do that it moves really to the point it's not just make up more than make up I was like it's perfect yeah well I mean I took what was a little bit left of the mascara on the brush and just built in from your arch just this part which is that a little bit of mascara so now I'm gonna jump back over to Sophia so this is at the end the side of hooda yes and they're not that much different I mean they are different but you can certainly see how I was inspired by Goethe for Sophia yeah I like this it's not like orange it falls into a little bit of a grey yeah I don't know but that is the secret to I think a great contours because you're creating an illusion and if the color is too orange you've just created like an orange right and you're creating the illusion of a shadow I love these little peach how I'm dying over this color and the blushers I mean it's just it's so beautiful congratulations Billy and Golani cosmetics this is such an exciting collaboration thank you guys so much for coming out all the way to Dubai to do this is my pleasure Jayden drew in the pre-interview like the questions that you guys were going to ask me I insist on answering it who are some of the biggest celebs you've worked with and what was your I know what was your I've made a moment yeah well we should stop no I'm kidding thank you saw your appreciate it no but this really is my I've made it moment because there's nobody that I would have rather launched this with or faced I'd rather painted like just you're so big this bitch compliments on you make sure you guys check out Billy on Instagram and also Facebook and we'll also put a link down below where you guys can find the palette on the QEP website yes and on gowanni , so thank you guys so much for watching and we'll see you next time bye guys bye [Music] 
hey everyone and so I want to do a quick video on how to pose in a photo so you guys may have seen my selfie video before I am what the South Queen all jokes aside I really did try to put my best tips in there and of course add a little humor this video is going to be kind of the same I get a lot of people asking me how to pose so I've given you all the tips on how to take a great selfie and what do you do with your face and of course your hands so I thought I would put it in a similar video all the things I've learned over the years together and try to make it super easy for everyone out there whether you're a beginner or somebody who just really doesn't care but wants to take your photos you should know how to take a bomb photo I may seem like an expert when I practice a few hours maybe a few hundred hours I like to call the first one t-rex hands because if you zoom out and you do too both hands you look kind of like a t-rex the funny thing about t-rex hands is it looks amazing something just looks really elegant about your hand when it's bent that way so when you put it on your chin on your hair you even put on your forehead and it looks good everywhere you get the picture next side I you know when you're just looking off in the distance to nothing but you look really sexy doing it that's called side eye all you have to do is tilt your face slightly towards the camera and look to the side and pucker your lips boom that's a money shot the trick with this photo is you don't want to look too far you need to look at the camera that's slightly away this will give you the perfect angle if you look too far all you're gonna see is eyeball kind of scary looking down giggle this looks good almost all the time and if you don't know what to do in a photo this is foolproof you can use your two Ric fans if you want to get fancy look down chin up and get go haha and if you're struggling with your smile always remember tongue at the roof your mouth gives you a nice natural smile every single time of course we all want to learn how to make our lips look super big and juicy I like to call this the pucker this one is a little tough because you don't actually want to pucker most people don't like a duckface even though I do and there's really an arch getting the right pucker again tilt your face towards the camera slightly accentuate the upper lip and then drop your bottom lip this also goes really well with a squint and don't squint too much a pucker can definitely go the wrong way if they're not done correctly and of course there's a sexy jawline how does everyone on Instagram have a sexy jawline they don't they simply know how to make it look awesome surprisingly enough the way to make your jawline look amazing is not to stretch it out when you do this your double chin shows stick your neck out to the side not too much and then down along the jawline and let's not forget a smizing set this before in my selfie video and it's so important sometimes I try to imagine that my husband is taking a photo and it makes me smile try to think of someone you love and imagine that they're taking your photo amazing is almost like a funny squint this is not wise this is like you're angry or you're looking at the Sun literally think of someone you love and slightly squint your eyes this works from almost any angle smizing is important hello America's Next Top Model those are some of my favorite poses and if all else fails you can always pretend you're asleep and have people make sexy hearts with your hair and let's not forget phase two let's be honest we all use it myself included and if you use it don't feel bad because there are things that a camera lens picks up that you will never see in person and if you ever feel discouraged just remember everyone starts from somewhere I took so many photos before I got a good one and I still do everyone gets comfortable they learn their pose their angle but again remember it's really important to have fun memorize these tips and then do what you want to do I'm a firm believer in learning the rules than breaking them I think everything should be done at your own pace so have fun with these tips make sure you guys please thumbs this video up if you liked it don't forget check me out on Instagram snapchat and please subscribe I hope you guys enjoy this video bye 
 Hello my friends, I am now in the United States in South Boston   We now live with my husband's family   It was very hard to filming videos here because my son was very upset and I was tired   In today's video, I'm going to have the technique of "strobing" because it's the hoot of the season   In fact, the idea of ​​"strobing" means "heylite" itself   It lights some parts of the face to highlight it and give a glow to the face   I will teach you how to do today and it is very easy   All you have to do is find an amazing cellulite   This is the most important part of this technique   I have some of the hyalater products that I like so much, such as the "Soborb" from Mac   Extra Dimension Skin Finish Superb   Another group called the Magnetique Appel is the same group   They are amazing preparations   I also like the Pica brand   Named after Jacqueline Hill, the "Champaign Bob"   I also like the "opal" hailter from Pekka too, as you see you've consumed it a lot   Last but not least, I have a lot of hyalate remedies   And the first by Laura Geller   Gilded Honey Baked Gelato Swirl illuminator   The other from Dior has long been fired   New Tan Golden Shimmer face and décolleté   This is my favorite at all   The best heliator with the powdered formula is hard to pick up one of them   Today I will use "Guildhani Hani" from Laura Geller   I will put it with a brush like this, you can use any brush you like   I will put the Elite on this area and I will focus it on the top of the cheeks   The best use of the brush consists of a layer of short and long bristles   They give a more natural effect to hailite   For more lighting I will use the luster of the sparrow   I got this sparkle from Gorgeous Cosmetics   Shimmer Dust Sand Shimmer   I'll take a little of it and put it on the top of my cheek   This will greatly increase the severity of the Elite   Always use the sparkle to spray the sparkle because the luster can show open pores and this is very annoying   So I will use the installation spray from Orkin Dykai   Vitamine Infused Complex Spray   I'll shoot the entire face   I feel it dissolves all the lotions inside the skin to look more natural   So this is my way of "strobing"   It is very easy and it gives a lot of glow to your skin   You can put the hyalite on the corner of the inner eye and a little on the eyebrow bone   I will do it now   And a little on the top of the lips also   And on the bridge of the nose   If so, strupping is very easy and everyone can adopt it   I hope you enjoyed this video   Do not forget to follow up on Instagram and meet  
 I can not believe how much 2016 passed quickly! \   I still write 2014 when I spend checks   The last two years have passed very quickly for me   There are many new developments on social networking sites and in the world of make-up   I wanted to show you my favorites for 2016   There are products I found recently and the ones I used to use   My daily favorites and supplies I can not live without   Some of them are old and others are new and they are really wonderful   The first product is ka brow of benifet   About a year ago, she met with a Beneft brand   He told me that the eyebrows would have a big share this year   But I did not expect the lotions to be so great   There are a lot of eyebrow products but I do not mention them all   ka brow is one of them there is also a fine pen for fixing eyebrows as well   Numbers 4 and 3 are my favorites and I use them on a daily basis   What distinguishes this product from others is that the gel formula is ideal   It is not very waxy and does not disappear easily   You get the shape of the eyebrow you want so easily every time   Big thanks to Benifet for launching this product   The following product is very special and I can not live without it   It's a free powder Cinema Secret Ultra Transluscent   They have Colorless, Warm and Soft custard colors that I have always used   It works to fix the base cream nicely without appearing piled on the skin   I asked them about the secret of the composition and they told me that they were doing it in their own lab   This makes it distinctive by making the skin look beautiful and touching   The product for the following has been re-installed and I am very happy to bring it back to the market   It's the freaks of Mike Forever   I love its shape, it is flexible at one end, which facilitates the application process   Also, the brilliant colors have added 25% of the saturation   I became very sharp, I have mixed multiple colors on my lips today   I think the intensity of the color is what makes the promoter distinctive   No one wants to put multiple layers to get the desired result   They have released 45 colors in this group, I recall that I tried them in Paris and I was amazed by the sharpness of color and the wonderful creamy texture   He's my favorite Roger at the moment   MakeForever brand has raised the quality ceiling for the boom   I think it's on other brands working hard to get to this level of quality   I have always been obsessed with Ballet 35O by Murphy Brahms   When they released the 35OS version, it became my favorite   They have a 35OM version which is a copy of the orange colors   The 35OS version is the same colors but in the glossy texture these ballets are fantastic and their color is very saturated   Although this brand is not precious and its cosmetics sold for a very acceptable price   I find that the quality is excellent matching the brands to the universal   I really liked this ballet and I think Murphy's team is doing an excellent job   That's all we want from eye shadow!   The following product became my supplies and I was surprised by this   It is Bronzer Victoria Beckham in collaboration with Estee Lauder   I have two of them here and one in the office   The color is very cool, not too sharp and applied so perfectly that it does not stain and does not look like mud on the face   Its color is brown with a little bronze and a nice bido on the skin   It is the perfect color that will restore harmony to the face   My skin is elegant and suits me personally, and it is also suitable for light skin   If your skin is soft, it may not be right for you   But it is in line with most of the degrees of skin and this is wonderful!   It was noted that it was expensive and 65 per cent expensive but very expensive   It is possible to find an alternative in the brands of dicaster   But the end result that this bronze gives you is unparalleled   And will last for a long time as the quantity is large   I tried other products launched by Victoria Beckham, loved some of them and did not like another   But this is my favorite   Of course it is no longer a secret that I am obsessed with Palette's own eye shadow, Palette Rose Gold from Hoda Beauty   It's the only ballet I've used since we launched it   Of course, I used other wonderful ballets this year, like Palette Murphy, which I just mentioned   Palette Modern Renaissance and other pallets were launched this year   But the pallets I use on a daily basis are these   That's because when we designed it, we tried to put all the basic colors   We discussed whether to include 12 colors, 15 or 18   We decided to put 18 shadows because we wanted to have most of the basic colors present in the pallets   For your sake I find that I do not need to use any other palettes   Most of the time I use the paint colors and sometimes I put the bright shadows to get such a hook   I have put my heart and my passion into this product and loved it too   When we designed these pallets were for a limited time   But because of the high demand for them, we will return them again for a limited period   I hope you try it and you like it   The following product is Palette Highlander Munchild of Anastasia   I love the beauty products that Anastasia launches, I think I'm unique and very beautiful   I liked these ballets precisely because they are distinctive and the colors are wonderful   She's a little shady, Pink Hart is my favorite   I also liked Blue Eyes and Blue Moon,   What makes these palettes wonderful is the element of surprise in them   When you try the white on your hand, you see that it contains a little green   Pink Heart contains a beautiful pink reflection   I think that's what I liked about Ballet, the shady colors make it a special product   The next product shocked me frankly, and I did not think I would like this degree, and I use it daily   It is a body moisturizer Byredo La Tulipe   Its smell is very tasty and wonderful!   It is based on the essence of flowers and is characterized by the softness of fragrance and I think this is what distinguishes its smell   Sometimes when the perfume is based on the essence of flowers, the latter is the tyrant   But the smell of this cream is very harmonious and the touch is very rich on the skin   The skin absorbs quickly and the scent smells around your skin all day long   If the hot weather starts sweating you will keep your scent wonderful   The following product is the set of Lip Contour from Hoda Beauty   Of course we love our products and work hard to make our products a bit different   What distinguishes it from others is its composition   I do not care much for the liquid waves, but I like to keep the Rogers on my lips all day long   When we designed the liquid liquid waves, we put different oils in the formula to keep the lips moist   We have launched this holiday product exclusively for the US Sefora branch   But since it was released from the store very quickly, we decided to expand the group and launch it globally soon   I have always liked Zoeva brand, I think its products are of high quality   Zoe is the founder of this brand and puts a lot of passion into her products   I Love Rose Gold Makeup Set   A lot of their products are worth the experience, such as eye shadow palettes and a brilliant concierge ballet   I advise you to try out their own cosmetics and I already have a special feature   I liked this particular collection and it is made of metal in golden pink   I use the entire group and it is excellent   These brushes are excellent for applying powders and blending lotions   One of my favorites this year is this, I've talked about it a lot in my videos   It is Rainforest Of the Sea from Tarte   It contains a summary of rain and algae, this may not sound great   But I think it is an excellent extract because it makes the skin look very beautiful   The formula is very light and it moisturizes the skin and gives it a wonderful glow   I also like it because at times I put in multiple layers of foundation cream   I do not like McIjie to be piled up and this product gives me this result thanks to its light structure   What I usually do is use a luna for my face, another for an area under the eyes and a dark color for the contour   And I get a natural and beautiful result   My favorite body moisturizer for this year I have used it for a long time and still   It is the "Oil Oil" of Kudali for body, face and hair   But I only use it for the body   Its composition is so thin that it penetrates deep into the skin and gives it a glow   It is ideal for working women or mothers   It is expensive but they have small size containers that last for a long time   If you do not buy the big package, try to see if you like it   The next product that surprised me this year was James Red's Overnight Tan   It is a metaphor for putting it before sleep and nailing the skin   And you put a quantity of it on your legs for example and you go to sleep and when you wake up you get a wonderful tan   You do not have to worry about the clothes you wear on top   Because they thought about this subject and made the nail is not affected by the cloth and does not occur any colors spotted in the skin   It is easy to use and its installation is somewhat creamy   If you do not know who James Reed is, he's a nuisance expert   He had been obsessed with nectar since he was young   He has taken many fashion shows and others   This is what makes it the latest in the field of tanning and has launched a lot of preparations for tanning the skin   I still try a lot of his preparations but this is my favorite so far   The fragrance that surprised me so much this year is My Burberry Black I did not think I would like a perfume from this brand   I have always thought that their fragrances are very mature   But this fragrance is very impressive! I can describe the spirit with the attractive   Whatever mood or occasion you are in, it fits in with everything   I got it in London when I came to a Burberry shop and tried it   I launched this product a long time ago and talked about it a lot   I'm still obsessed with him and I can not give him up   It is the oil of Bamboo Kendi Oil from Alterna   I keep him in the bathroom and when I put the balm to soften my hair, I use it too and leave it for a few minutes   When I wash it, I get silky smooth hair   Every time I dye my hair and expose it to damage   I always come back to him and he helps me to reform it   This is one of my favorite Eleaner pens   It is Ink Liner from Cat von De   It is excellent and easy to use thanks to its fixed blades   Which allows you to draw the line very specifically   It dries quickly and lasts for a long time   It is a bit shiny, I would have been better if it was a matte but I loved it very much   As you know, Kat von De is a brilliant Tatu painter and is the most famous in the world   So it's obvious that ILLINER has given you an accurate and clean fee   This product is great! First I love Jane Atkins a lot   She is a genius in caring for hair   Her dazzling success is due to her perseverance and hard work every day   This woman is expert in hair and cosmetics   She is skilled in hair cutting and hairdressing   No one compares to it is the best in the world!   I have long been inspired to launch a hair care group   So I was not surprised when I did, and I loved the entire group and especially this preparation   I have a lot of it everywhere and I always use it   What I like most about this Sabra is that it does not contain salt and other ingredients dry the hair   The salt was not placed in it and the purpose was to correct the hair   It is based on gel composition, giving you a great result without damaging your hair   When you try its ingredients, you notice that it depends on refreshing tropical odors   It is an excellent preparation to get a great structure for your hair   If these are my favorite lotions for the year 2016   I have played a great aesthetic aesthetic role daily   It made my skin softer and more beautiful   And facilitated the process of applying make-up   I hope you try these lotions and change your life as you changed my life   Please let me know if you have tried any of them   Or share with other lotions you like   Do not forget to subscribe to the channel and keep me posted on Snapshot and Instagram   Good bye

 I have a very special guest with me today, Doris Day!   It is in Dubai and Olay has allowed us to receive it in our offices   She is a skin care expert, she is an approved skin doctor   I have followed your career for a long time   I read a lot of interviews and articles about you   I have the honor to be with us today, you see how beautiful skin!   Tell us today about her secrets to keep young skin healthy   Tell us about the pimples caused by the hormones   It is not true that we get rid of the problem of pimples after adolescence   Blisters differ in puberty than those in adolescence   It is very noticeable on the chin and neck area and is so deep that it is difficult to get rid of it   How does this happen?   This results from the change in hormones   If it is true that hormones play a fundamental role in this matter!   I thought I was the reason and I did not care for my skin well   No, that's not your fault   Sometimes the pills cause pimples   In some cases we have to undergo hormonal treatments   But if we want to reduce the appearance of these pimples on our own, we should begin to peel our skin well   But gently do not cause dryness and inflammation of the skin   You do not want to use very harsh products as they lead to clogged pores   When I reached adulthood, I had a lot of stress on my skin and I thought I was upset   I tried to restore the balance to it, but I went back to cruelty again   Listen to your skin   Peeling is also very important for skin, deep cleaning is also essential   As I said earlier, deep cleansing does not mean to exaggerate to the point of stripping your skin of moisturizing   Cleaning is the most important part of your daily routine   I do not clean my skin deeply!   Cleaning is very important and it is best to use special brushes for cleaning instead of hands only   Deep cleaning helps get rid of the outer layer of the skin   But if you do it incorrectly, you will inevitably damage your skin   If he tells me what to do, I will first tell you what I am doing and know that I am wrong   First use wet tissues to remove makeup   This is not bad   I then use the water-remover remover to remove the remaining sediment   Finally I use the toner   Your routine is not bad but it is not the best   That's what I do when I'm lazy, and I'm on this case every day   How to get rid of the effects of grain?   Your skin protects you from all external factors and has its own immune system   Skin is a member of our members is not it?   It is true that she is one of the most important members and she always renews herself   What is the period of renewal itself?   It is renewed every seven days   seven days!!   Skin cells are in permanent growth, and the process continues within thirty days to complete the course   So we can get rid of the effects of grain if we take care of our skin well   This varies by case, if the effects are deep, it means that the proportion of collagen in the skin has changed   You may need a doctor's assistant to get rid of them   If it is pigmentation or inflammation   We can then promote collagen in the skin to correct these impurities   You can not hide the full names and this will not look nice at all   But you can zoom out of size and prevent it from expanding further   Do you know what the cause of the pores is? Sun rays!   Sun rays develop sebaceous glands under the skin   I did not know that the sun has a role in this matter!   How do I age the right way?   I want to make sure I look better the older   This is what I call premature aging   After a deep reflection on this subject, I conclude this sentence   When Barbara Walters met me, I really loved her. She was a wonderful woman   But she asked me the toughest question at the end of the interview and I did not have the definitive answer   She asked me: Does this mean that we do not have to grow old?   I told her that it's normal to grow older but it does not have to show age on your face   I was thinking about this subject and I made this sentence: old age can not be avoided, but aging is optional   I loved this sentence!   It is our nature to grow up and become more wise, but it does not have to appear on our skin   The old is only a number already   90% of your appearance when you grow up is at your disposal   Only 10% is associated with your genes   If people who say they have good genes do not know that this is not true?   They may have good genes like you, for example   Another person who is as skinny as you do will be very wrinkled   But your skin is not wrinkled and most of it is due to your skin care too   I take care of my skin so much, I use red light therapy   I massage my face a lot   I can see it with your skin, you can not deceive the skin doctor, we know everything   My older sister has a very tight and elegant chin   But my skin began to wobble since I was in my twenties   I began to notice a little sagging in this area   So I try to defy gravity and massage my skin to the top   I see a lot of women pulling their skin down when they put on makeup   I think this is a fatal mistake!   I have a lot of customers where the mother is accompanied by her daughter   I think this is so wonderful that you are studying their faces as an inquiry   That's right, when I looked at the face of the perpetrators I knew she would resemble her mother when she grew up   I can see where it started to falter   When I start treating her with a small tooth, I help her grow old in the right way   I will definitely visit New York!   In my opinion, as far as Botox and Peller are concerned, people always want more   When they become idealistic they seem artificial and this frightens me   I agree with you   When they try to move their faces, they become idiotic   There is a fashion that makes everyone copy about each other   You see people with cheeks, lips, nose and the same features   I think the real beauty is to show the best picture of yourself you are   That day my sister showed me a picture of a pretty famous figure and she wanted to look like her   I told her you did not want it? Did not you choose someone else's picture?   You have to appreciate your beauty   But the challenge is that celebrities have the best experts like you   But you have to choose my advice in this area   It is my intention I know my philosophy and that I do not want to change the person and I do not think that the curves or small lines in the face is very bad   Personally I like some facial creases   You do not have any curls!   I like the lines that appear when you smile and I think it's intuitive   Yes, it's normal to move your face when you talk or smile   I try to keep things simple in my consultations and be moderate   There are people who come to me and say that Botox is the name of the skin   This is not true, it is perfectly sound   It is a very small amount, which drug is considered poisonous if misused   You can find the worst property and get the best out of it   When you want to improve your appearance, this does not mean that you can not use all the means available to you   You do not have to be artificial to improve your appearance   Sometimes you have to pick up some signs of aging   The skeletal structure changes as age progresses, we study skeletons and see enlargement of the eye gap   That is why we see eye changes   Do you know how I will grow old?   You will grow up wonderfully   are you sure? Because I feel that my eye gap expands   I will not come and say to you: Dear I have bad news for you!   Focus on your career and other Huda Beauty's name   But I find favors in everyone and I tell you that you have a good bone composition   This will definitely help you   This is not greatness   It is so and I can distinguish it   Thanks ... I do not know   Do I need Filler?   No   Botox bothers me a lot, especially in this area where most people resort to fill it   I see it a lot on television and on celebrities   That's true. But when it's done the right way, it looks very natural   Anyone who has done the right way can move the face and does not seem artificial at all   A large part of the signs of aging is what you want to highlight   I made my own character which I like to highlight   When I look in the mirror I see myself as Raquel Welch   They really resemble us!   I think that's why I chose her, she's 70 years old and she's my inspiration   She is very beautiful, she grew up very magnificently   But when I mean a party, I see myself as Grace Kelly because she is very elegant and elegant   When I go to work I like to imitate Beyonce   Gosh! I'm doing the proverb!   Both of us can be Beyonce   When someone asks me about something I do not know, I strengthen myself by becoming a Beyonce character,   We love you Beyonce! you are the queen   She is always ready, and rehearses well before her concerts   She owns the theater and offers her best every time   When clients come to me, I know that it's up to them and I do my best to help them   And to answer your question regarding signs of aging   The signs we see are redness of the face, pigmentation of the skin, wrinkles and lines, skin sagging   You do not have any wrinkles on your neck!   My basic rule in life is not to mention Ayubi   So just say thank you and accept the compliments   If it is very important to protect the neck and chest area because it is the fastest flutter and pigmentation   So I extend all the lotions I put on my face to my neck and chest   You can of course use chest cream, but for the time being, just apply face creams down   Is it necessary to use sunscreen?   If your makeup contains sun protection, do you need sunscreen?   Each product contains a sun protection factor that is in the sun visor   Whether it's a face moisturizer or a sunscreen, it's the same thing as long as it contains sun protection   But you have to put enough of it and put it back during the day   So for me, as long as you use enough quantity, then that's all you need   If we have to put it back during the day, otherwise it would be useful if you only benefited from it in the morning   You can, of course, resort to powders containing sunscreen   There is a spray that contains sun protection factor as well   Yes, but be careful not to tease him   You can not get damaged by the sun when you are indoors   This is difficult, but if your skin is prone to high blood pressure   The heat and fluorescent light from the computer screen can damage the skin   Long-wavelength UV rays penetrate the glass   If you are working in an office where lots of windows   Even stained glass?   Colored glass protects you from medium-wave UV rays so that the skin does not burn   Those with long waves break through the skin and eliminate collagen   If these long waves also cause facial flaccidity?   They say the tanning family is sound because it emits ultraviolet rays   But in fact, this type of radiation may cause cancer   You can see that those who turn to them seem older as the skin begins to flutter   Gosh! I will not be able to tan after today!   But when you are 50 and you will know that I was right   I will not ask you how old you are, but I will consider you at the age of 31   I can not guess less because your daughter is 25 years old, unless you've adopted them   In fact my age doubles my daughter's age   What is your skin care routine during travel?   I travel a lot and love traveling   But your skin is wonderful, when I travel my skin becomes very dry   I have a travel bag   They contain cleaning wipes and a moisturizer   Olay has a wonderful moisturizer   And then moisturizing cream and water sprayer   Normal water sprayer?   Not in fact this will dry your skin because it will strip your skin of all moisturizing it   What do you think olive oil to moisturize the skin?   There is nothing wrong with olive oil but I do not like the smell, especially if you leave it for a while on your skin   I love to eat olive oil but I do not put it on my skin so much   I used it once because I did not have a machete   It was really good   I recently resorted to using the humidifier in the pilot and when I did feel that my skin was very healthy   How can I get rid of the dark dab around my mouth?   Dark ding around the mouth may be a form of cost   Or appears due to inflammation or allergies   You can reduce it by peeling skin, retinol, niacinamide and caffeine   These ingredients help to soothe skin infections   I do not know whether licking usually causes this problem   I feel that the corners of the lips are always dark   Yes, this is caused by a lot of wetting in this area, especially in wet climates like Dubai   Yes, the situation worsened when I moved to Dubai   Is sleep really important for skin health?   There is no alternative to sleeping, no pills, no cream, nothing   You have to get enough sleep   When you sleep, put the moisturizer on your face   Do you have a specific routine before sleeping? What if you have an important ceremony, date or wedding?   Are you using a specific routine to prepare for these occasions without exaggerating to the point of causing acne?   The most important thing when you have an important task is to keep your routine as it is   Usually, many resort to salons for skin care and this is very bad because the skin is not ready   If all you have to do is peel your skin and moisturize it and drink plenty of water   Relax and put on a moisturizing and thought-provoking mask with positive things   When I have an important event I do not think this way but resort to various means of skin care   Do not do that, the skin needs time to adjust   Tell us about the need for nutritional supplements and nutrition for healthy skin   I have often heard that carnitine is necessary as well as omega-3   To start with nutrition first, it is very important to have a healthy diet   That means you have to eat and what you do not have to eat   Remember that you do not have to have your food consistently perfect, you can cheat from time to time   Try to eat all your meals within 12 hours a day   If you eat breakfast at 8 am, finish eating all your meals at 8:00   This helps to regulate metabolism and slows the appearance of signs of aging   Routine is very important in human life, and if you can sleep and promote every day in the same hours it is excellent for health   But the most important thing is to eat your food within the 12 hours   I have conducted research on mice where they were divided into three groups   All groups dealt with the same number of calories   But the first group eat high-fat food, and the second is rich in fat and sugar   The third group was a healthy diet   When she had the choice to eat whenever she wanted, she was all sick   They did not exercise   But when she was forced to eat within 12 hours, all remained healthy   Even if they eat unhealthy food   If this topic is very important for health as well as it is for the health of your skin   I learn a lot from you!   These topics are very interesting   I wonder when I learn these things   Who would have thought eating this period of time had such great importance ?!   We can not deny that what we are dealing with is also important   Eating in the 12-hour period will help prevent disease   But it will not help us get perfect health and skin   Beauty stems from human health   Even when we exercise, the skin looks better   It's true, but it's always hard to do   Do you do exercise?   Yup   The foods I recommend are fresh fruits and vegetables   Especially berries   Pineapple fruit is also because it contains bromelain   But they contain a lot of sugar so you have to eat everything moderately   I love eating berries, strawberries, cranberries and pumpkins   Pomegranate is also excellent for skin   It is better to eat the fruit instead of drinking the juice   If berries and pomegranate   Pumpkin contains a lot of antioxidants   As well as ground thorn, you have to eat it do not talk about putting it on the skin   I know that pumpkin is useful if you put it on the skin   That's what they do, they use the foods that benefit the skin to be taken in creams and cosmetic masks   Green tea is also useful   Meat is not very harmful, you need it at times   But do not overdo it   Salmon is very useful for skin as well   As for dietary supplements, I recommend taking resveratrol   Where do you find resveratrol?   I know that wine contains this substance but I do not drink alcohol   But you have to drink a large amount of wine to get enough of it   So it is better to get it by disks   There is also niacinamid, which we usually put on the skin   But it's good to take it too   Niacinamide is completely different from niacin, ie, nicotinic acid   When you visit the store do not buy niacin, the latter will make your skin red and unwanted   But niacinamide accelerates metabolism, increases activity rate, and renews skin cells   If supplemented with food this slows down the appearance of signs of aging and helps to get rid of scars and effects   It is also very effective for treating acne and can replace antibiotics   If we have resveratrol and niacinamide, what about collagen and omega 3   Omega 3 is very useful, I'm still waiting for more scientific data, it is said to be good for joints   Collagen is a protein, and when you eat it the body works to analyze it   I do not know how much the body can absorb   The skin contains hydrochloric acid and when you put it on your skin it does not become part of it   It stimulates moisturization and bloating   This means that it does not help to excrete more of this substance in the skin   This depends on the composition you do not buy and believe that your skin will become perfect   Thank you very much for visiting us today, I learned a lot from you although I know a lot about the skin   But you taught me a lot today and I was really surprised   You are an expert on skin and stressed the importance of small things such as peeling, deep cleansing of skin and the importance of sunscreen   And non-tanning   Eat up to 12 hours   All these small things can change your entire skin   Thank you very much for your time and thanks to Oulai for allowing us to meet you today

hey everyone I have a little under the weather but I want to do a favorites video for the month of March and as you guys know we are launching our how to be lip contours so of course I'm going to go through that and talk about that as our favorite product for the month of March so these are the nine colors that we've launched for the hoodie beauty lip contour and as you know the formula is amazing the reason why these have made it in my top for the month of March is because ever since we've actually had these I haven't worn anything else like that's all I've been wearing I'd even ever been to office that's all they've been wearing so this is why it's my favorite pick for the month of March especially for lips the colors are the bob they last forever and the formula feels so good second favorite product for the month of March is Vaseline intensive spray I think it's got the spray go but it's just continuous spray but I actually started using this in the States like so long ago and I've been so obsessed with it and the reason why it's become of my top favorite products for this month is because it's finally hit the Middle East and it's so awesome you just literally spray it like I'm gonna show you guys right now it's literally that easy that it's my sure how awesome is that it literally feels amazing you're just good smells so good after you use it it's such an easy way to hydrate your skin after the shower make it forever actually just launched this contour palette and I actually have already been using this this I just stole out of our goodie bag from our master class this palette is so awesome the colors are really incredible it has like this really beautiful brown and the swarm color and also this kind of orange color which I like to use to kind of warm the face the colors are just so awesome they have four different colors I have this one this is the Gordy palette and this I have like four of them I love them so much I just think they're so fantastic and the formulation and this actually just blends so well and once you set it it stays in place is so so beautifully so Luna sleeping oil from Sunday Riley is like my favorite sleeping oil in the whole entire world it has a lot of really great ingredients avocado Chia Concord grape seed oil indigo retinol and blue tan so all these ingredients are so amazing only removing your pores but also helping with damaged skin wrinkles or this is my third bottle she's been using this too and even his skin has improved so much can't we just talk about this foundation it's like what I've been wearing it's so awesome it literally looks like you're wearing nothing it looks like skin when you put on it's called tart to rainforest of the sea water foundation that's literally what it's like it's like putting water on your skin goes onto your skin so beautifully literally just mask any imperfections and looks like skin so Ava is a Brandt I just recently started using and I'm pretty much in love with it they have awesome I shot a palette amazing blush palette pretty much everything you do is a grotto they even have brushes that are so beautiful this is their pink spectrum blush palette I actually prefer the coral spectrum but I don't have it in the office I have it at home but this is the pink spectrum and I just love that they have all these beautiful pink colors and the palettes are so small so slim you can literally take them with you everywhere so I love this the consistency is incredible the packaging is awesome everything about this palette is just the best for blush again for cream contouring I love the black up contour stick I have an easy it's for a couple years you guys may have seen this in some might get ready with me the reason why I have this in my March favorites is because it just launched in the state so I was really excited by that because a lot of people couldn't get it and now everybody can so it has two really great colors to be honest the light color I really don't use as much the light color is really nice but the dark color is so amazing and the way it blends onto your skin is just so awesome so I use it number one which i think is perfect for most people even Mona uses it and she's obsessed with it as well you guys may have seen this in my video as well the candy oil which I'm obsessed with if you guys haven't tried this from alterna you need to try this if you have dry hair you're gonna love it if you have oily hair you might want to stick to the spray the spray works just as good as the oil I use both but I literally could not live without this it just really helps to fight frizz and I like that it's paraben free all the alternative brand products I just feel that their products don't damage my hair it actually kind of helps make my hair come back to life I just love alternate I just think their products just have the right ingredients they have the right focus of a brand so I love using this in my hair I love the UH Nastasia glow kit this is the that glow kit this is actually my favorite one she has too but this one has a little bit more of like the warmer colors and I love this gold I love this peachy color this little like champagne colors gorgeous and of course don't forget the bronzy color that is also really beautiful I just love mixing all the colors together and just kind of bring out the cheek and really making it look super glowy super strobe E and super pretty last but not least I cannot get enough of this primer oil this is from Smashbox and they just send it over to me and to be honest I wasn't sure if I was gonna like it started using it and I was like oh my gosh I can't stop using it and I've been using it said it's so awesome now they do have this standard primer which wasn't right for my skin this just works so well so I love it it's just for a dryer skin and I just probably could drop onto my skin and I massage it in and it's definitely oil-based so it hydrates your skin really well your skin is on the drier side you're gonna love this and as soon as you put powder on to your skin it just melts into your skin it looks like skin I'm obsessed with this I even use this over areas I feel like need extra hydration when I'm done this is so good so those are my top 10 favorite products for the month of March up to the creme products mostly these products we reviewed over some times so we really do know that they're awesome hope you guys enjoy this video please send us video ups and make sure you guys subscribe and check us out on snapchat and Instagram

 Hello my friends, I am in Dubai and with my "Nicky Totorials"   Can you believe it here!   I took care of my day and loved it so much   Do not nose Take photos of this wonderful Eleanor and beautiful shadows   I do not want to remove this make-up at all   Nicky will teach you how to get this make-up   I hope you enjoy, I will leave all the information about Nicky in the information box as her accounts on social networking   Follow them   The first product I will use is the post-shaving gel from Nivea   I talked about him in a video we filmed together on my channel   This product contains glycerine, which helps the lotions adhere to the skin and make it last longer   It can be used as a polymer and your makeup pad throughout the day   Nikki is a genius in make-up, she has crazy tricks that no one dares to try   I will put the gel after shaving on my face!   I'm a bit nervous about it   It is a magic formula   In fact, it has a wonderful texture on the skin   Can you make me a brown copy about you?   I will now spray your face with the Premier Water from Smashbox   Smell smart   Now I'm going to go to the foundation cream and I'll use "Born Zeiss Way" from Two Ways   You're painted "Sand" any sand \   J actually a very sandy atmosphere outside   I'll put it on her face with the pewter blender   I like the way you put the foundation cream   Although you reduce the position of the blockers on your face looks very natural   I like to have a face free of impurities but in a beautiful way   It is like Alfotoshob in real life   We like to make fake make-up, not natural   I put one layer first, and then add another layer where needed   In this one layer, you can add more areas that need more coverage   I finished the foundation cream and will go to the Conseller and the Counter   I will use a Klee de Boe colonel to paint a jacket   I will put it under the eye and do not forget to extend it on the corner of the inner eye   I will also extend it out of the eye   At the same time I shook my face by extending the concealer to the sides of the nose   This will help to significantly reduce it   She has a really nice nose and does not need that   I also like the more facial lighting by the concealer, I'll put a little of it on the chin and on top of the lips   And on the bridge of the nose   Finally on the bottom of the forehead   And on the corners of the mouth   I will use the pewter blender to blend it in a plump way   Now I will integrate the conciser under my eyes   Look up   I will combine it in a plump way   Be very nice when you integrate the conceler around the eyes   After the merger, I will "bake" an area under the eyes with powder   Then the counturist's face was lit by the end of the powdered bread under the eyes   I do not publish this powder except in this area   I know that some make-up experts bake all of the heliets   I better show facial features by the contour   Since it is impossible to put the powder directly over cream preparations   So the areas I have provided have been proved with a little bit of powder   I'll start with the middle of the face   Then I will wipe the powder with the nose area   Then a little on the nose because I will also put him down   Think of the areas that you want to sculpt with a crystal and make sure to fix it with powder first   I will be using Palette Kat von der Contour   I will combine the three dark colors and start sculpting an area under my cheek   I like to have a compact and non-specific contour, I use the brush this way   The brush barely touches her face   Then I'll use a thicker brush with number 2 from Tom Ford   I will determine the contour more   I will also specify the chin line   I've finished the contour, still lacking in bronze, balachar and hailite   Now I will remove the powder from under my eyes and turn to my eyebrows   I will use Palet's "Praise Trio" and use the color in the middle   I'll start filling up the blanks   I began by defining the fold of the eyelid by Palette Murphy Brahms   I tell the girls to keep their eyes open during the shadows so that I can see where to focus more color   These two colors were used   Now I will look for a dark brown color   Now I know where I want to focus the dark color   She does not have to open her eyes because I set the painted eye in the previous step   I will now use the "Himalaya" shadow from Nares and place it on the eyelid of the moving eye   Use this color to challenge the eye fold more but in a soft way   Then combine the sides with the same color you used on the eye fold   I finished the upper part of the eye, always moving to the bottom and then going back to complete what the eye lacks   Now I will use the Tatoo Liner from Cat Von Di to draw the Eleanor   The delinquent was first drawn to determine its direction   If you are wondering, you have not changed the color of the lipstick to the color of Nod   That's because I put it on my lips and wanted to feel part of the team   I have developed a synthetic lashes called "Sophia" from the mink group of Hoda Beauty   For the lower lashes, I'll put the mascara on it   Her name is "Aboard Lash" from Mac   I will now put the bronze and then the heliator from Laura Geller   In order to give life to make-up, I will spray it with Mac's "Fix Plus"   As for the lips, I will depend on the color of Nod   I will set her lips first in a soft way and I will just challenge the corners and tip the lower lip to enlarge it more   And then I will put the libstick and integrate everything well   If this is the final Look, I'm really obsessed with this make-up \   Frankly, I was not quite sure of her ability to identify me with the Eleaner because I love the strong Elinner and that's exactly what I did   This is the most beautiful Aliener I have ever seen   I was nervous because Mario made her makeup once   She has wonderful tricks, I hope you have benefited and learned from them   In fact I changed my way in the work of the contour   I hope you enjoyed this video, follow it on youtube, it's very famous   And on other accounts also, I will put it in the information box and to meet  
everyone so I have my eyes done really simply again my face my blemishes and everything is broke out my skin is not the best shape right now but it's okay because I'm going to fix it right now I really wanted to do a quick review on the artist brushes so you guys may have seen these are the artist brushes they come in a box like this this is a five brush set it has the circle one linear oval six over four level three I believe it's like wonderful sellers these are the five brushes that you get to come in like this and then you can just take them out so a lot of people have seen them on Instagram and they've had so many questions are they good are they not good is it just a gimmick and I wanted to answer all those questions right now so should you buy the artist brushes artist brushes essentially started with this wonderful man he created this brush format so he created actually some smaller brushes I believe it was something similar to a little brief and then he also did an eyeliner brush he created both of these essentially for mac cosmetics and they did so well that he was like you know what I want to go and make them even better and bring them for myself so he created these brushes these are the smoked there's a titanium smoke and then you saw the plastic probably collection on Instagram with the silver and white but these are a little darker I bought these because I like to use some darker colors and I thought that'd be a good way to differentiate which ones I'm using for what I love these brushes they're kind of weird to use at first because usually when you take brushes you know you're used to kind of taking it and doing kind of this motion with these you kind of do like more of a dissolution it's almost like brushing your like your teeth but like on your face it's a little funny but the thing that's really nice about these is they're so dense so they actually apply a lot of products for instance if you have days where you have blemishes this will help cover that up and what we'll do is to half my face with artist brush and half my face with a normal brush do you guys can see the difference will do this like this has a little bit more blemishes with artist brush so you can really see the impact and I'm just kind of adding a little bit of perfection here and you can see it's really fine with your dentist another product it advised such a heavy bottle of that and I'm going to correct this too you know this is orange you can see like literally that just covered everything up you don't even even tell it there so what it really does is it kind of almost like Pat's product all over the place so it's really good people who want like super high coverage and with a great part about it is it works I'm really great for cream liquids and also powders so I'm going to use the same corrector on the other side of base using kind of Mormon concealer brush and you can already see the difference and pigmentation this is like so called full coverage my god like this is like not covered that well and this is covered well this is actually a really good brush so now I'm grabbing the concealer you can see my brush literally swallowed up all the concealer and I'm just applying that which area here and I'm using this little stippling action the coverage is so I'm just applying a foundation I actually will produce the big brush but I don't have my full artist kit here just applying this foundation and I'm just going to use a normal brush we are now going to contour we're just blending it in I'm kind of blending this in and I'm using really small circular motions it's really a great tool for PI product but for blending I would say it's not so we're going to five more consider that under I just basically to highlight everything the site is not as blended as this I decided so much better so we're just going to go ahead and start playing powder and you can see that the powder application is going to be super strong bronzing is telling to be a little challenge or just that so I'm just going to go ahead and now come for the nose I do like to use the opal three different vendors of my favorite thing the world views so you can see the difference in my face one side is not blended very well the other one is like much better much more blended and everything products how are they are they good they are amazing I actually love the artists brushes and I totally think they are a necessity to have a term a gift gift you just have to understand they really are for applying heavy amount of product they're not really for blending a lot of people like to use them to contour contouring for cream contouring they are really great but you're going to need something later on to blend just basically the way that you move your hand when you're using this it just doesn't give you the ability to really blend as well but it is really great when you want to apply a lot of product in a very controlled manner like for instance when I was going around my brows fantastic when I was going very specifically around my lips when I was contouring this area it was great but you really do want to use something to blend as well keep that in mind when you're buying these maybe you don't want to buy the whole entire kit for these five I paid around 190 dollars I brought those off the net according so I mean you need to think about that when you're buying that maybe you only want to get like the oval three is a must I think it's really great for contouring the nose and then maybe you want to also get maybe one of these big ones this is a really nice one this is the oval six really great for just applying some contouring here I think that's really important to consider if you're looking at that you know you want to really get the right value for what you're buying because they are expensive even though they are good so if you're going to buy the artist brushes I would recommend to try with these first you're going to go with just one maybe the oval three first and then see how that goes so so this was my full review of the artist brushes really tried half of my face with the artist brush and then half of my face using a normal brush and you can see none of its really done it the way I wanted to but so I am going to go ahead and fix this I just want to show you the difference so you guys can kind of see for yourselves which one this play so hope you guys enjoyed this video please make sure you guys thumbs up this video and you'll see down below the links on where you can file this product

guys I am so go through the town all the way from Texas however you're fighting 15 hours Jesus with 15 hours to be in Dubai and he is a three-time world champion facialist the only one in the world no one's ever wanted more than once you know once is not enough because I think it's an accident but the way now it's definitely not and so I had to go for it a second time but I don't like even numbers hahaha I quit completely and the company that put the competition on and it's the only competition in the world for a facialist wanted me to like get out of the contest so so what have you got a chance let me ask me to tour the country teaching it we're so happy to have you here in Dubai I've heard amazing things from tamanna' dress your face yes honey everybody talks about you so I'm so excited to have you but it's amazing stuff you know and I've been studying the skin now 29 years and it's amazing what you can do with it and what's so incredible is that now products are so amazing technology has come so far that you can do so much with skin care now I saw what you did for tamanna' you gave her like a little facelift I think that's what you're doing for me today yes we're gonna do that in a couple of other things okay alright so let's get so tell me about your skin what you think you have with it I am super acne prone my skin is pretty sensitive I'm always trying new products and always bring makeup on and it's very sensitive because of that do you exfoliate a lot I do i exfoliate quite a bit I try to I saw times that he's just like a peel like a lemon right because I was going to say if you over exfoliate with a granular product or something that you're rubbing the skin it can cause the skin to become reactive because there's so much activity going yeah that the activity is causing your metabolism to speed up yeah that's not like what I get for causes your oil balance to just pump now I use like lemon peels or any fruit enzyme peel like yeah there's a lot you can do without the scrubbing just is good not only just as good but sometimes better really yeah so not only the peels but like this is an ultrasonic skin scrubber it vibrates so fast you don't even see it moving so it has a anything it has of no you don't see it moving but it just scrubs the skin and removes the dead skin oh wow so it's like almost like shaving the dead skin off your skin pity so what are we gonna start with well the first thing is we're gonna do with a cleanser so Brian champion actually has his own products we're not gonna do a real thorough you know cleansing and everything yeah but I just want to go over some tips about cleansing so this is just a gentle cream cleanser know the thing about cleanser you want to move the cleanser and not skin so you don't want to be real rough with your skin you're being so gentle that's how I work on the face like I'm going here and the skin is not pulling what a cleanser does it dissolves oil and makeup so you can remove it from the skin after we wash our makeup off we should be using a cleanser because I just use makeup wipes is it bad well no that's a very handy cleanser that does more of a surface cleaning whereas your cleanser will dissolve and it can stay on the skin so where do you get your cleanser from much sell online I don't yet somebody's a logo I am sad with this logo the climate feels like supernatural I don't feel like your products have too much of a scent than which I like right I hate when skincare products have a lot of time I really well most products that have a smell that's been added they like to say that it's to mask the stinkiness of cheek ingredients oh so when you have a lot of cheap ingredients put into a skincare product you have to mask it so they call that a masking agent oh that's perfume to cover stink okay the next thing we're going to do is we're going to take a little extra virgin olive oil you can do this every night and I start I do not smell though I had a little um okay essential oil - it smells really good yeah so you can see I'm not moving to face because that's important so what the extra virgin olive oil does it's a smaller molecule than a red blood cell so the extra virgin olive oil can penetrate the skin completely it's a natural antioxidant it prevents free radicals from doing the damage on your skin it penetrates the skin creating like a baklava where the outer layer of skin is considered dry and crusty to the lower layer levels which we now will have lubricated because of this then I come back and do any type of exfoliation you're not going to have any irritation and if you'll use this every night let it stay on for about five minutes wash it off or jump in the shower at that point in five days your skin won't look like anything ever recognized the only thing that dissolves oil is oil i cyrus luck brian on youtube before i saw you talking about yeah on motor bob i learned a lot from that video yeah you just have to understand the philosophy behind it and how it works and then you understand what you can and can't do with it i've always felt it was about keeping it balanced it is and working with it gently and you know nothing happens overnight i think consistency is a key you have to take care of it every day what about when you wear so much makeup one trick and i don't know if you've ever done this and you have to use a cleanser you can't just use a makeup wipe okay but you do two cleansing 'he's the first one is a superficial cleansing and it just kind of takes the majority of it off the second one really cleans the skin we talked about exfoliators that were not granular and this is a chemical exfoliator and I called it refined okay and it has in it your any alpha hydroxy acid okay so those are really great but it has a buffering agent in it so you don't have the burning to stinging or anything and so you want to go in circular motions around the eye and in to the nose so this is another one and it's called boost and this goes on before your anti-aging serum that smells good though isn't that good average bioflavonoids which is from plants oh man it smells really very soothing to the skin very hydrating and very calming okay so I just wanted your skin to be wet and now we're going to take the ultrasonic skin scrubber so what I'm going to do I'm going to work up with it so for you I would recommend more of a peel and it has to be gentle if it's turning you red and tearing you up it's something you don't want to do you shouldn't turn right after facials oh no my clients walk out looking better than when they walked in they could make a phone and go to their wedding cuz you know that whole thing we're like after you get a facial your skin looks worse but then it's gonna look better you know what I'm talking about oh yeah I don't believe in that either totally wrong feel your skin you can see how I can actually yeah it feels like lighter so now the main thing also that I like to do with the exfoliation is it removes the outer skin and then you can get things to penetrate better okay so now we're going to use the anti-aging serum and this is hydra Plex it's bad it was so amazing I feel like it went right through my skin so fabulous yeah putting a little of the boost and this will boost the effects of the Hydra place hyaluronic acid can hold over a thousand times its weight in water this now has moisture which magnifies and boosts the effect hyaluronic acid is the most incredible ingredient it's for wrinkles it's for aging it's for acne it's for calming it feels like all the dead skin is gone as well and everything just feels so smooth yeah so this is microcurrent okay it's known as the non-surgical facelift and what it is it's a low level of current and it's less than 400 micro amps of currency it stimulates the adenosine triphosphate in your skin ATP every single thing that happens to you including the metabolism of skin cells and creating new ones is fueled by adenosine triphosphate I totally remember this from biology yeah it's been proven with science and clinicals at the University of Washington that this particular machine increases your adenosine triphosphate level and your facial muscles 500% when you finish the series with it five week twice a week so will I get that benefit from stinky ones you will okay so the first thing I do is right between your brows your prosperous muscles and we're going to stretch them and this is the same amount of currency that runs through your body and the only way you can make a positive change is to match the currency and not over our okay so now we're going to start right here and this tightens the net so the currency goes between the two probes through the muscle and stimulates the adenosine triphosphate so I'm manually manipulating where I want your muscles to tighten and when you do a single treatment you know it'll last maybe a like a week at the most you really have to do it a few times well you'll definitely see a change with one time and this muscle right here is what gives you the cut beneath the cheek and you see it just comes right back it's so beautiful and so this shortens the muscle that goes from the mouth to the eye and just causes the cheek to pop up so what we're doing we're pulling the muscles up and putting them back in place now the difference between this and a surgical facelift is they would cut your face all around the perimeter and kind of pull your face back and then they would take this muscle like and they would cut it in the center and cut a little piece out and then just sew it back together which would make the muscle shorter but it was kind of destructive to the integrity of the muscles and the look of the face so now as I'm looking at your two muscles from here this one is much fuller this one is flattening off mostly that yeah so now we do the eyes we're going to pull right up so your briella mm-hmm no way oh you're gonna die oh my god so fabulous so that's phase one of your brows and you can see they're in a different position from each other now this one is higher so high now this is my favorite movement so I'm pulling it up and holding it from the top and so I do this in a couple of motions all across the eyelid take a look at you oh my god okay so this eyebrow we've done which is obviously so lifted and beautiful and this one is like more on when you smile you can see the cheek is just full and round so we're returning your youthful contours to raise that is incredible because you're going to do this side as well right so on this side of the face the one we didn't do you can see that it's it's got almost a flatness to it where it doesn't have contours and on this side you can see how the contour of the cheek is bad the other thing you're going to notice is your nasal labial folds and your marionette lines are going to be less because when I get the cheek to come up and back look where it comes from uh-huh and so you're going to see the fullness of your lip coming back and then of course your brows you have a very different size on them I'm obsessed so it came up but yet it's all done naturally where you would normally be I just feel like I look so tired on society we are going to do it yeah all right and now we're just doing everything on this side that we did on the other so we're pulling up that neck muscle so we're giving the fullness back to the cheek this is what causes the apple of the cheek to just pop out there relaxing the homie like falling asleep generally you don't do the neck for the first three treatments because the neck muscles are so large they respond instantly so what did these do so I'm going to tighten your neck muscles okay that's enough so the net just tightens oh yeah I can see that right away I feel like my jawline looks better there too on a woman's face it'll be about the seventh treatment that is like really shocking the first one is pretty good that when you do into single treatment and then a man the single treatment you just can't even believe the difference oh my god what do you think the next ELISA neck isn't it fabulous it looks slimmer this is awesome do you love it I love it I can't beat with my makeup on and see how it's gonna look but I already looks great especially here I've been dying to try this face how many people have been telling you about it and I can totally see the lift here and also the tightness in here and the lift here oh my god my cheese I'm gonna let you do something real quick because it'll make such a difference first I'm gonna just have you put some serum on yeah you're going to tap it around first that's just to get it off of your fingers and spread around then now we're going to use a little I cream okay and you're going to use your ring finger oh my god Brian you cannot leave that has the least amount of pressure and you're going to tap it under your eye and this new cream has the newest technology of peptides in ition which reduces wrinkles by 68% this one also know that has the ability to lift and tighten the eye so you can use it on the upper eyelid where normally you would not do that but is this right here this is a face serum it's incredible and this won't break me out no matter what good boy I love how passionate you are about beauty it's so wonderful a lot of people

last master class was a huge success we're really excited to see make this one hopefully even more successful we are so excited to see you guys very soon thank you guys so much for watching and we'll see you guys next time bye guys 
oh yeah this is ready okay ready I thought it was only uh the cameras smell like she hey guys so I am here with my sister alia for you probably notice inaptitude really funny well thank you she's just silly and she's a lot of fun guys you're nervous yeah I don't know where to look oh hi okay so I got these really cool things in Korea and they're basically like these brow tents from this brand called etude house and they were super big in Korea and these are basically like peel-off brows you put him on your brow to peel off and I did one of my brows and I was gonna do the other one but I thought why don't I get all you this video as well cos her brows are bit thinner and she always once we make them thicker yeah and I'm gonna try on her first and then I'm gonna maybe try myself depending on how it turns out I'm sorry your mind you existed she is my guinea pig yeah so I'm gonna go ahead and try this on her okay okay I'm gonna try the medium color and this color is called Brown number one so I'm just gonna go ahead and imma take you out you can see it's like a little weird paste I'm gonna have you look a little bit more straight towards the camera and I'm gonna start coloring her brows and in the beginning her brows gonna look maybe a little scary but the idea is that when I peel it off issue be perfect and it's actually a bit tough to shape out with this brush the brush is really kind of too thick just gonna answer all my columns I don't know we'll see what are your problems my brows I don't know how to draw the minute are they all your problem no see I bet your brows look okay yeah after getting well you just got a nice and lean tattooed on head buried tattooed on I like to her brows a little bit thicker which is why I'm going a thicker it's actually really hard to shape out with this brush oh my gosh you can see like shaping them has not been easy it actually was really really hard I can't tell honey I use the darker colour around the brow I'm gonna use a lighter color in the inner brow now is this like the lip stain yeah so now I'm going to grab this color which is called light brown number two and I'm going to apply it in the front and we're going to see how it works so we're gonna let dry comes on your house yeah you have to like remove all your makeup around the area cuz if you have any makeup actually doesn't set right well then I go holy yeah I'm so excited and I get to be on your video yeah you're so cute by the way thank you baby you're so cute you guys wanna see only on my videos more thumbs up make sure you thumbs up cuz I want to be on the video that I want it to do really well okay okay are actually good on camera oh no I thought I'd you are nervous you're weird I love it is it set oh my god it's taking so long to dry yeah just taking forever to dry I feel like it's a good idea instead of using two different colors to do one color and then wait a little while and then put the same color I'm just gonna take a small q-tip and push up in some areas where it's not perfect because the brush is so thick you really have a hard time shaping the row you know how long this lasts it's supposed to last more than one day okay so we're just going to go ahead and using a q-tip I'm going to start pushing this off of aalia's brows and it's dry that's coming off pretty well and I'm just going to go ahead and brush any extra product out of her brows so it definitely works but you want to use a darker color than you would normally use so if you use a brown you may want to use a black because the color is not very intense we let this dry for a long time kind of straight it does make a difference yeah yeah yeah yeah one other Braille to please okay so I'm gonna go ahead I'm gonna do her either Brown using a darker color and see right apply yeah it's super easy you look gorge anyone right now I like I can do it myself no no you're a try it looks easy no you don't just like put it on there go try well it's so dark yeah it's so dark is that right yeah like that oh my role not really long yeah is it okay if you can on top or the gentleman you are going heavy girl the good thing about this is because it takes time to dry you can make it kind of form it to the shape you want it doing and cool you can form into the right shape guy did a good job you think you're cute yet let me just fix it for you what do you think great but using a q-tip I can just kind of clean up the area where all your plan holders are so right at all all right Jo okay so we're gonna let this dry and we'll peel it off on show everything on Instagram the way it looks before and after that video if you guys want to see more of Ollie and my videos if you don't want to see more volumes not thumbs down the product works really well but you definitely need to use some colors are darker and the color definitely lasts better when you leave the leave it on for a while as far as how long it lasts it lasts okay if you're somebody who wears a lot of makeup it probably wouldn't be the best choice for you because you actually I have to actually put it on bare skin and then you're either gonna cover it up with makeup anyways or you're gonna put it on top of makeup and it's not going to work well so it's really for those people who want like effortless type of beauty they just want their eyebrows ooh perfect and they want it to be just you know ready for them to go this is the right product for you otherwise not really the best product do you like it Lee yes that's me I don't like any effort effortless beauty thank you

 Hello my friends, everyone is talking about clown's technology and whether it works well   I will solve this dilemma in this video   We will find out whether this technique is feasible or unnecessary   Follow me to see for yourself   The first step is to get rid of the horrible dark circles   It is very apparent that I have not slept very well recently   I will use Ballet Patch from Mike Up Forever "Karim Kamovlag"   It has multiple colors, I will use this orange color   I will put it on the dark circles   After finishing drawing the triangle under the eye, I will use a little consler to highlight my progress   I will use a light-colored conseller from Nares named "Ginger"   I will put it under the triangle directly   I will also put it on the bridge of the nose   I will draw three circles on the forehead   And then I will put the red color around my mouth to correct any impurities   I'll put it that way   I do not know if this will work   I'll add a little bit of a pencil to my forehead   And the little here too   Now I will move to the Contour in dark color   To that end, I will use the darker consoner from Sevora, Bright Future,   I will begin by defining my face   I will put it first on both sides of the nose   And then under the cheeks   Since it is the clown technique, I will draw circles on the top of the forehead   Finally on the chin line   The last step to add plachirs   I will use the same red color and draw a circle on the cheek directly   Now it's time to merge and I'll do it with a wet peyote blender   I will squeeze a little and incorporate lotions   As I integrate, I will also provide the foundation for coverage and help me integrate   I look very silly, like Crazy Joker   The eyes area is not bad   Unlike my mouth and cheek   I'll put more consellers here   I look very silly   This technique may succeed if you use the appropriate colors   I will now put a foundation cream from Mike Abu Forever in this area   It's a mess   It can not be said to be useless, but in my opinion it is not the perfect way to work the counter   I'll clean my face and take the counter on my way and I'll come back to you   So that's how I set my face on the counter   As you see my face looks better and its features are more prominent   I did not finish it with my eye makeup so I look a bit weird   But as you see, when you define your face as you need it, the contour looks better   So it's important not to use any strange technique you encounter   But stick to what suits your face and focus on the final result   I hope you enjoyed this video in which I tried to build the clown's technology   I do not think it is absolutely necessary   I have to follow up on Alnstqram and Snabshat and meet  
 Hello my friends, I am very excited because the Cat Von De brand was launched at the Seafura Dubai stores   And will be available throughout the Middle East soon   Today my friend Eric Soodo has been interested in Mkayaji today   We'll show you how to get this   It was supposed to get this make-up but the time went by and we had to hurry   We used many of their distinctive lotions as foundation cream and liquid broth   I advise you to go to Sevora and buy it for your own experience   Thanks for watching and following this video   The first step that Eric will adopt is the face treatment with primer   What will you tell me about the primer?   It is a very light primer and I also like it to incorporate cream creams   It is a great moisturizer for the skin and it does not contain paraben and no oils and is not tested on the animal   A wonderful touch on the skin   The best foundation cream is starting from the center of the face because it is the area that needs the most coverage of most people   I like putting the primer before the foundation cream to get the brilliant glow   Now I will fix your face with the powder and I will start installing the console   I will use light color and it tends to syphilis   I like the color in the center of the pallet, these are my two favorite   They are suitable for an attractive bronze lok   Hello my friends, I will have an interview today with the wonderful woman Cat von De   We are very excited to have come to Dubai and brought our products with them   It has been implemented from all markets since its launch here   I get a lot of comments on the Al-Istakram page about how their products are available in the UAE   They are not fully provided in the United States   I have a lot of complaints about this too   I am very excited to come here   Thanks and I am excited to meet you at last   What is your favorite product in your group?   A product you can not give away and take in your travels and wherever you go   This question always comes to me and frankly I love it all   I use all of my products and this is necessary for me when I launch a product   If I use it myself, what is the purpose of launching it then?   But if you hang on to an island, either I choose the "liner" or "lipstick" in red   I like the red color on the lips   I have a lot of red colors in my collection   For me, it was important to find red tints that fit all skin tones   It makes it easier for people to put this color because some people hesitate to adopt it   Especially people who do not put on makeup as much as I do   I think red is a classic symbol of femininity   It does not look like you're putting a lot of makeup on   I mean, the foundation cream you use is great, it's not right here.   Yes, thanks   In fact I'm surprised by how natural it is on the skin, I have not tried it before   I got it but the color was not right for me   But I had the opportunity to try it today and I feel no weight at all and its coverage is perfect!   We have worked hard to create the best combination, actually modified 12 times   You can use this primer with foundation cream to make it light   The coverage provided by the foundation cream is perfect, when I arrived in Dubai I was shocked by the heat   I thought to myself that the women here would appreciate this foundation   This is because it lasts for a long time   I do not go out very much so I do not get exposed to the sun   They ask me about the secret of the whiteness of my skin   You are very passionate about your products so that you only sell them if you use them yourself   I want to ask you about a Middle Eastern woman, many people find us very ambiguous   How do you see that your brand will fit with women in this region?   I follow the application of Alaststqram many cosmetic experts in the Middle East and I think that our products are very much suited to their style   I am very excited to start using it and mention it on their accounts   Because everyone is about to make up differently and what I have always liked in the Middle East in general is the boldness of eye makeup   So I think my preparations are in line with this view   I think they will love the foundation cream because we need a product that lasts in the midst of moisture and heat   We also love full coverage   In regards to skin and the contour, people find it difficult to get the perfect result   I know you have not received any cream lotions yet   I do not oppose Contour with Cream preparations   I am now working on ballet and this is better for the environment   You can fill it with the colors you want   I also want to make sure that I do not have a decent cream   I usually resort to the cream contour to fix my face but Derek used the powder in a creamy contour way   I think a large part of this technique depends on the brush as well   Do you intend to launch more brushes because they are excellent   Of course, we have launched one high quality brush   Personally, I do not like the use of the feminine brushes because I am always looking for perfection and I am very interested in the shape of the products   We are in the process of designing a full range of our own brushes   None of these palettes are your favorite because you have launched a lot of them   I'm still obsessed with the Shale &amp; Knight ballet, which is my favorite and I use it on a daily basis   It is made up of shades but I organized it according to color   From warm to cold   I liked adding warm colors to it because I travel a lot and it is not practical to take lots of lotions with me   I can only make use of these pallets and use them until I can hide and draw my eyebrows   And I also liked that you put in the black mantle shade   Sometimes I find the perfect ballet but lacks this basic color   This shade is very important to me but at the same time the pallet lacks a lot of bright colors   But we're working on them in the next set   Thank you very much for watching, I advise you to go to Sefura and inspect these special preparations from Cat Von De   Thank you for your presence  
okay guys so we wanted to bring Janaki as you guys know she's been cutting my hair forever she's the only personal I cut my hair other than when it breaks off forever we go back we entrepreneurs yes we business Barbies and it's kind of funny cuz me and Jen are doing very similar things we have our own products we do content she has made addicts which is awesome she also works with some of the most amazing people in the world you guys probably know Gigi Hadid the Kardashians hey J row the generators who else um you everyone I think like everyone of substance she works with I mean she does some of the most amazing haircut she has green hands so when you cut your hair we explain to your American audience what green hands means green hands means when you have so you cut your hair and it grows and I don't understand it everyone four years of said she has green hands I never believed it so you cut my hair like energy what is it I think it's the way you cut the hair it makes it grow my secret is I don't actually cut the hair we're gonna actually do a haircut on hooda later today when my scissors okay so I'm sure a lot of people are wondering how you got started in hair because it's kind of hard to find your passion and you're so passionate by her so how did you actually know that you wanted to do here for a living you know it was in high school and I saw this video it was Natalie Imbruglia the torn video and she it's really cool like short choppy razored I lived in a small town in Utah and so I would go to like the local hair salon and they would not know how to do it they would you're like a bob so I just started getting shaving razors and literally spending like an hour and a half in the bathroom and going to like probably three packs of razors oh my give myself like the haircut I want it and I'm charging yourself yeah you're a small town girl small town that's so funny yeah you're a small town girl I thought you were a big city girl no I grew up in like Alaska I grew up in Hawaii as well so it's like yeah I copan was where did you grow up in Hawaii near North Shore oh my god that's so funny yeah cuz we're small town girls really yeah we grew up in like town so like 20,000 people math game and it's so funny because I really relate to your story a lot yeah sounds like well it's funny going back to Instagram though like I felt the need and especially now or I'm at in my journey I felt like the need to share everything because I really want to inspire that person that I was you know when I first moved to LA in 2000 16 years ago and I isn't I never would have imagined you've been there too though yeah so it's amazing it's weird too because I feel like in your life you always feel like it's a businessperson you feel like okay I'm gonna reach this goal and then I'm good and then you reach that goal you're like okay I have more goals to reach it's like you just keep going and it's funny cuz when people congratulate me about stuff I'm like wait what have I done I didn't feel like I've done anything yet like I know much how I want to do like the more you talk the more I love you okay so tell us a little bit about how you got started with way and why did you actually want to start with a whole haircare line well glad yes I noted why did I want to start it because I am a hairstylist that feel like I've been sent every single product Under the Sun and there were some tweaks I wanted to do here and there just to like make you know the pomade a little different I hated salt spray that made your hair feel like sticky and dry so I did a rice protein instead of any sexual assault so it's like builds up your hair pre blow out it's really good to kind of give you that like natural cold French Groban and I didn't put anything that's gonna dry it out so no salt no I can't live without this I literally use this every single time I shower can you use it on dry hair yeah you can't you can actually just Joy's use of my hair's maybe you want to give your hair a little ba-ba-boom you can actually put it under it what is really curly kinky hair like I do well kinky curly I feel like the finishing cream in them at pomade guys for that because you're gonna like help tame any like crazy better watch your head and the weather here is so unpredictable with it like with hair the smell is unbelievable how did you come up with these scents I personally love like dip teak and Barretto and Jo Malone was I lose my favor I so I like was always obsessed with scents and so I wanted something for me haircare always smelled Bible gone really adolescent or like old lady so I wanted something that felt like modern and cool and just smelled good and also I like this all of my body when I come out of the club and you need to go to work for the next day I wonder like spray dry shampoo and actually feel like I smell good but everything smells good the oil smells really good I mean it's all gardenia yeah laughs jazz and its really soft like I grew up in Hawaii so it's like a lot of Hawaiian scent how does that feel it's been such a short time it's funny you say that because I'm actually very anti like using just one brand and I even say with way like I created what I I think that my followers really asked for but it's not necessary every product isn't for everyone I really like to teach people the other brands that I like as well like how did you actually get started to like growing the Empire like before even way can I tell you who it's probably similar to you I mean I really just kind of like focus I think through social media like again I was one of the early adapters for Instagram and in my field and I just love the idea of being able to like share my work with people would also get inspired by other people and I think that social media just really like drove me to because we can have conversations with so much you do a really good job with that so do you know your snapchat is hilarious it's really cool I feel like I'm with you like when I watch your snapchat cuz you talk to people I dance like no one's watching I love it like no one's watching and I really don't it's weird I would say to Dubai Mall of the day and I got recognized by like four or five people one girl said oh my god I feel like I know you and I'm liking it so do you know you I actually do know I just think like my friends and my like sisters are watching snap and nothing what is like your ultimate goal just do what I'm doing and you have the 80 vitamins you have so many things I just always want to be really authentic about what I do what I put out there what I do for social everything I just want to really make sure that no matter what happens with whey and what happens with you know main addicts I just want everything to be super authentic that's my biggest fear like losing the grasp of like of what we started like I don't want you know anyone to ever come between the connection that we have with our followers I don't think they will I don't think they cuz you're you're pretty picky yeah I like to create solutions to everyone's problems whether that be not feeling inspired needing pictures to like you know figure out what haircut I came out with extensions cuz for girls who don't have naturally amazing thick hair just go by it like it's 2017 go by extensions making gorgeous hair and then you know my hair accessory line of Cloyne Isabella came out with because I felt like you either had ji wushi or in Selene accessory there were five hundred dollars we had that Claire's boutique it was twelve dollars so yeah I wanted to create something that looked expensive and then same thing with wife I just wanted to like help people you know haircare problem so what is your hidden talent oh my god my head and I don't know if I have a hidden talent I see my husband we have to call him later and ask oh I don't know my head you're hilarious my head and talent would be I think probably working on little sleep really that's italic Tracy I probably so much like when I go to bed usually like Karen Dubai Ali is waking up so I like do you enjoy like four or five hours of sleep every day mmm the past couple weeks is in that yeah that's a talent so that's seven working that's a very working on no sleep what is like the weirdest account or the most random Akali fell in this room no joke this is

the go and we don't like take time to properly take care of our hair the way we do our skin so I really wanted to have like a sachets you can just take it with you on the table how did you actually start way cuz this is I remember you were talking about this for a little week would yeah well yeah you knew about it like before anybody really how did you actually get started with it it was just writing down what I wanted to do and I had so many meetings with people and I sounded crazy I would get all I Kanye up in the meetings man I guess what we're gonna do is we my goals and like I know some people were like you're crazy and then I just I now what with amazing people that have helped me just bring it to life and they really believed in the vision it's been really really amazing to watch it go I think it's definitely been one of fastest growing hair lines as well you sell it to for us yeah we say anywhere else you're a cult beauty in the UK we were doing with one brand itself for just for five weeks if I'm insane thank you guys so much you're not happening hair care brands they have in Selfridges I was just there so not the same and so then we're also in cult Beauty we're at Netta portait we're at Basin K I'm gonna forget somebody and it feels so good or at the policy okay below and then yeah and we're talking right now in France and Dubai about how to get away there we need you in Dubai cuz I literally have to stock up every time I'm overseas I had me too I had a heavy who is heavy so like it would be great to be sold here I know to good you're an appearance I like trust me a babies would you do think I got you in my mind feel dude if you're it's right dude appearance I'm here for time yeah I always doing yeah I will for sure I'll be appearances on the regular and do I okay what's the most rewarding part of being genican and doing your job oh my goodness getting to come into these fun videos of you and I love you guys on snapchat I will open every single snap I will stay up till 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning I read every single snap I love seeing people like showing me screen grabs from like Australia from Singapore it's so fun and rewarding to be able to like see people with their healthy hair see the changes that they've made and just hearing good feedback I also love to hear the bad feedback that's like my first name when people are like oh my god I love the smell I love how it works tell me the bad stuff because that's what I one enough so what is the hardest thing that you've kind of had when doing your company because there's always like challenges I mean even logistics and in creating products what's like the hardest thing for you hiring people that's so hard we had such a small family and ways of still such a small group of people but now that we're growing so fast I need to like bring a lot of our staff in-house and that's really hard for me because I feel like getting Finn it's a good opting kids you know that's the hardest part I think in my job is just always even four main addicts it's just finding the right team members for your team and what you do is magical and yeah I can like conquer the world and I have a good strong team okay what's the most surprising beauty tip you've ever learned Oh somebody told me about preparation-h under your oh it's amazing I might cream yeah under you guys but you can't use it to longer I think it thins all your skin and then someone else uses imodium on the face before you do foundation oh really yeah so far Missouri would I go get a skin or something imodium is like anti-diarrhea medication oh I know we just try that that's like something really like what we just did a video we tried lube on one side of the face oh yeah are there any lice we listen you skated my game and what's like the weirdest beauty tip you have for hair I used to be back today before I came out of my oil I have everybody go buy coconut oil at like the health food store alright so love that yeah just to put coconut oil like an almond oil and like really me oil under there the night before you go to get color you guys especially if you're getting highlights or bleach put oil in your hair and sleep with the night before because it help any oil any of those oils yeah we're doing it the way here well the phone app that my survival depends on is aside from social media probably I'd say use post mates for food I use uber too for transportation mates with that and then I use seat guru to find out what the seats are like on planes boom yeah before I book a flight oh my god seat your CC guru it'll show you people take pictures of like what first class in business look like and the food too so see crew is it's been amazing like I look at my phone yes I'll see what I use the most I think for sure I would take uber and oh and title from you Tyus Edney say hey show me through I think there's anything else it says we have a lot of apps on you if I do I know okay all right what is your favorite your most favorite hairstyle your go-to your style for leave at all time what is like your what is your especially what I think looks good on every girl is half-up half-down Oh how'd it like how I got half of it up with like a little cute not up top and then just have it like is it like this right here and then this part yeah I like having like a little bit let me just show you I might have like we're right here no before we company are we really cutting my hair yeah you're really getting but like a half up half down we caught we used to call it like the ditzy but having they were just down and having some of these my doing wrong like how do you that oh that is right ready that is yeah see you like that's cute on everybody how do you do you just like just flirty I know I do like that isn't anyway you do that you've done that looked Chloe yeah like yeah I support the Shih Tzu I really love her she's so kinda picture um I am ji really really really like used to do that a lot and I still I don't know I think it's fun and it's easy for I love you on ourselves I'm gonna use my my on bun cuff and put a little like the white side of the thing and yeah it has a little thing yeah I'm Chloe this about I want to try that okay so last question I'm gonna ask you what is the best piece of business advice one person told me once actually just instagrammed it because I saw it weirdly in my feed but it was I don't stress out too much because nobody knows what they're doing and I love that because I'm like you know what it's so true I feel like as I've grown as a business person I have lost that fear and intimidation from people because I realize no one knows what they're doing like you'll pretend but that's what's fun about being entrepreneur and that's I think why we're successful is because we know what we're doing we don't come with a can ego like I'm still learning as I go like we first started a good digital business I could mean addicts I've launched so much in the past two years with that and with way now I'm learning about the beauty industry and kind of like how ins and outs and what to do and what not to do and I've been really lucky because I ask a lot of questions that's something else I can tell everyone to do so you ask ask questions don't be scared like I reached out Sonia Kashuk Lorraine Schwartz has been amazing and really Berman like just women that I knew in my life that doing great things and I'm really admired and I would literally just ask for like an hour their time and I take them to lunch and just get you know kind of their tips and they've kind of helped me skip the line in many ways that's amazing yeah their advice has been great in Sally Hershberger's been really sweet to me and I feel like I've just really not been fearful about asking for help and asking questions that's really great I feel like people wouldn't do that enough in any - I see well my thing really a hairstylist I want to say this good advice for you is to not be one of those hair stylists it's like the stereotypical you have a lot of clothes in the closet and no money in the bank because I feel like once we start to get success we start to fill ourselves and we start to like buy jewelry and expensive bags and clothes whatever especially the beginning your career put money aside because like you never know it's really important cuz you don't know what you could actually do - or we might need if you want to have money you want to be able do anything do something just have to be smart with your money that's it it is kind of hard because I definitely feel Instagram personalities Beauty personalities makeup artists you do start to want to spend all that money yeah it's really hard time properly yeah it's hard you can't afford it fill yourself in buying things here and there is really good budget oh but you got to create a budget and you got a good smart with money absolutely that's really good piece of Alex hi guys it's the three Katan sectors here okay so we hope you enjoyed this video we'll put all the products down below that Jen brought us here to try today also put links down below to her site so make sure you guys check Jen out she's awesome her social media she's incredible thank she's probably really try to make her back here again guys thank you guys so much bye [Music] 
 Hello Friends Today I will talk about the best ways to lighten the armpit area   Nur sitting in my lap and refusing to leave   You'll have to see it in the video, I hope you do not   I would like to teach you how to lighten the armpit area because I know this is a very difficult subject   It is a very annoying subject for anyone suffering from skin pigmentation   Sometimes the bristles of your body are dark and reflect black on the skin   I'll show you a few steps you can take, each of which is useful on its own   But if you use them all, you will get the best possible result   The first is potatoes   You can make any kind of potatoes   All you have to do is rub the armpit area twice a day, morning and evening   Honestly you will like the garden with your scent   You will smell the dirt   I do not mean that the smell of the earth is ugly but you will not feel the usual recovery   This is the only negative aspect of this method   If I rub the area in the morning, evening and even during the day if you can   Many people do not know this fact, but the potato can act as a bleach for the skin   You can put it around the eyes to lighten the dark circles   You can also use them to lighten the knee and elbow   It is the most natural component whitening the skin from the ground   He has written a lot about beauty blogs and is very effective   I will give it now to Light to carry it   The next ingredient is sour, all you have to do is squeeze a little or even cut off its tip   Mix it with a little sugar or sodium bicarbonate   Mom we can put coffee too   It's disgusting! But it's right you can use coffee   Look at my little beauty blog here   If you can make any material that can peel the skin nicely   The best use of sodium bicarbonate is because I feel it refreshes the area too   If you have seen the video you photographed about peeling the face with lemon peel   You will know that acid is very important and today I know you have another technique   You can cut a few of them and put sodium bicarbonate on it and over the armpit area   The third reason for the appearance of dark pigmentation in this area is hair   If your hair is dark, it is normal to show a little pigmentation   Due to hair follicles that appear a little under the skin   Of course you can resort to laser hair removal sessions   I did this and helped me a lot to get rid of most of the pigmentation   But I also used potatoes and sour   The last resort you can use is Enheep F, a sweating remover   Daily use on the armpit area to fight bacteria and relieve the need for hair removal   They have a lot of decent products such as moisturizing the legs, arms and others   It is supposed to help in the process of hair removal   I did not try it anywhere, but I used it on my armpit and it helped me a lot   You will notice a great difference when using this product   If you use laser hair removal or even waxing   Or you can use this product, find it on the Amazon site   I do not think its price exceeds $ 10   If this is my advice regarding the lightening of the armpit area and everyone can adopt it   Many complain about this and think it can not be remedied   This is not true you can get rid of dark pigmentation   I hope you have benefited from this video and apologize for the light of the quarrel   Subscribe to the channel and click on the icon   If we get enough fans to video we can shoot makeup with Noor   I was often tempted to do this and always postponed it   Do not forget to follow up on Instagram and Realhudabeauty Snaps because someone stole my name   Good bye  
 The thick eyebrows are very popular now   Today I'll show you how to get this wonderful look by synthetic eyelashes   It's a very beautiful view!   I'm joking!   Everyone knows the importance of eyebrow makeup has become a necessity and not just a fashion   Some women can not leave the home without educating their children   I was very impressed with the fashion of thick brows since it started   I will tell you today how to get it if you can form your own   I filled in my blanks as simple as I usually do   Many Serum products are used to grow eyebrows   The recommended serum is Revitabrow   If you live in the United States try to find a Latisse Serum   No matter what you do, try to develop your hobbies and when you do, you can trim it and clean it as you want   And leave the front of the thick to get this hook   I'll take this eyebrow pencil from the Smashbox   It is one of my favorite pens, I like to use it to determine the shape of the eyebrows first   The first step is to make the eyebrows equal   This eyebrow is a bit low, I will adjust it   I do not know if you see the video in which I use the calibration device   Yes indeed I use it from him here and at home   I know this sounds crazy but it helped me a lot in starting to draw my answers right   I do not use it now because I used to paint it properly   But I advise you to use it   I will begin to select the shape I want and fill in any spaces   For this eyebrow, I will not draw it at the center, but at the tip   As you see, I go back and comb my eyebrows after every step   I have not yet identified the inner end   Ka Brow from Benifit, I usually use 3 but only 2 here   I'll take a little of it on the brush and draw the hairs up   I like this product because its texture is a bit dry making it last long   Rotate the brush vertically to draw the front bristles in the shape of a line   Start from bottom to top   The next step to add density to your eyebrows is to use a shadow for your eyebrows or eyes   It will give a more intense effect and look like there are multiple layers of hair   This color is light brown, I will apply it also to the inner part of the eyebrow   As you can see, I push the hairs up   It is important that you do not draw a horizontal line   But vertically to add more density   The following product is optional but I like its use as well   It is a eyebrow fiber that you can find at Smashbox   I got this from the Net-a-porter site   It helps to add dimensions and density of eyebrows   I'll apply it to the front   I like using a darker color at the tip and opening at the front   But I only have light color here so I'll apply it to the whole eyebrow   The last step is to fix the eyebrows, so I'll have a brush for the eyebrows   I will spray it with sabrai and then I will comb my eyebrows up   Best hair spray on the eyebrow gel because its color is transparent   You can use the eyebrow gel in clear color but it may turn white during the day   I only comb the inner part of the eyebrow   Do not comb the capillaries directly upwards, but upwardly upwards   What I do in the end is to look at the eyebrow if its shape changes after combing the capillaries   You may wish to use the Conseller to correct any errors   Make sure to put a very small amount of toner on the brush   For those who need to draw the entire eyebrow   Lots of brands have such liquid alainer   This is new from Mike's father Forever   This eyebrow lacks his hair at the top, so I will draw it   To add more shuffle and dimensions, I'll need a little conceler on this brush   I draw fine lines between the capillaries   Then I will tie him with a little finger   Finally I will comb the eyebrows again   If you love to have the same intensity eyebrow from the inside until the limbs   Use eyeliner, eyebrows and concusser to get the same effect   If so you get thick eyebrows makeup   As I said you can follow the same technique on the entire eyebrow if you want   However, it is noted that very dense eyebrows may give masculine effect   Be sure to decorate it with make-up and the color you use   So it does not seem too harsh   But it is a wonderful and very attractive fashion   I hope you liked this video, do not forget to follow me on snaps and snaps   Click on the icon if you like it   If you want more similar videos, leave me a comment   Thanks for watching and meeting  
hey everyone in case you had a awesome holiday hopefully you did you may have also gained a lot of weight like I did I was in the States for Christmas and New Year's and my husband is Portuguese some of you may know that Portuguese food is super yummy so I gained so much weight over the holidays I was only in the States for ten days and I think I literally gained seven pounds which is allowing for ten days I thought it would be helpful for everyone out there hopefully as well to kind of teach everyone how you can fake a contour to make you look like you've lost ten pounds or even maybe fifteen pounds is the camouflage cream palette number five and I really like this because it has this corrector this orange corrector all these dark colors which are fantastic for contouring usually you can start contouring from the middle of your ear and you can fill your contour your cheekbones and you can just kind of go inwards if you also want you can just kind of do a kissy face and smile at the same time so you're gonna like this which doesn't really look attractive but it's a really great way to kind of see where you should contour now when you're doing a little bit more of an extreme counter you're going to want to start with the foundation first so I'm going to use this is the Kat Von D the latte foundation and this is in 57 medium so I'm just going to go ahead and I'm applying it all over my face I know sometimes you see people apply a contour and then the highlight and these blend everything together that is really great but when you want to do more of an extreme contour it's better to contour later on after you apply the foundation now also because I want the contour to be strong I'm going to highlight first I'm just going to use my concealer you guys know I love the clay to Poe concealer and I'm going to now just highlight areas I want highlighted of course you're supposed to highlight in contour that makes everything look big and the things look small where you want to look small but when you apply the highlighter on the contour you are able to blend the contour a little bit onto the highlighted area as opposed to the highlighted area onto the contour so it really does create the illusion of thinner cheeks and you know better jaw lines so that's why it's really important if you want to make yourself look like you've lost weight to highlight first and then contour I'm just going to go ahead and use a Beauty Blender and start to blend that all out so we've highlighted next we're going to contour I'm just grabbing a little bit of that contour just going to go ahead and place it in my cheeks and the hollows of my cheeks first and first I'm just drawing a more exact line and I'm just going to do it on my forehead and also all along the jaw so this I would normally do anyways right this is what you normally do with a contour now to make it look like you've lost weight you're going to now take this contour upward and show you one here we're taking it upward so it's going to make our cheeks look a lot slimmer and then we're going to take the contour a little more extreme to the middle of the brow right here right and now for the jawline here I'm going to actually draw onto my face here and then even a little bit onto the jawline here and I know this looks like a lot of contouring it is so I'm just going to go ahead and I'm using this brush to start with and now I'm just using the brush I use to apply the foundation with and I'm alternating it between the contour brush to kind of blend everything out you can already see I look a lot slimmer and I actually use this a lot when I was pregnant because some people gain weight in their faces and others don't and I happen to be one of those people who gain every single pound in my face that's just where it goes nothing wrong with that cuz I did another contour don't forget your double chin and after contoured I'm kind of going again and making this line look a little more defined so it was like my cheek is really defined it's really coming out you kind of want to just thin out like the whole wideness of your face so you really do want to contour everything you should definitely apply some foundation to your neck but you want to just kind of take a little bit that dark color and apply right in the middle this really does make you look much more slender and of course if you're showing the rest of your body you can also accentuate your collarbone I'm just going to go ahead and set my face and then I'm going to begin with the powder contour so while I'm actually baking you can see I have some powder on my face and I'm gonna leave it there for a little bit I am now going to start with the contour so if you're somebody who doesn't really like to bake you want more of a simple method you can skip the whole baking process and kind of just apply a little powder on top and get ready to contour so I'm going to grab this is the cocoa contour palette from Too Faced I love this palette and I'm just going to go ahead and mix these two Brown colors I'm now going to go ahead and contour again and you can see when I'm contouring I'm starting again upward rylann so normal contouring I actually just usually keep it along here but when you are trying to make it look like you've lost weight you should definitely go in with a thicker contour and I'm fine only forehead and again a little stronger over the brows so I'm shrinking everything in and I'm just going to go ahead and brush away everything I left there for baking and I'm going to contour my nose and then just apply little highlighter so this is it this is the final contoured shaped look and you can see my face looks a lot slimmer right and it does in fact look like I've lost like five or ten pounds which is awesome so hopefully you guys enjoyed this video and if anybody had a super fun Christmas in New Year's and you guys need to look like you've shed some pounds then this tutorial will hopefully help you out so please make sure you guys thumbs up this video if you liked it and check us out on Instagram it also snapchat and I'll see you next time bye guys 
 Hello my friends, I am excited to announce a very important news today   It is the launch of Palette Eye Shadow from Hoda Beauty!   I can not believe I was announcing this because it was a dream for me   My goal was to launch the most beautiful Palette for the eye shadow at all   I know there are lots of wonderful pallets on the market   But this is special to me because the colors are wonderful and contain the shadows necessary for your makeup   If I had to use only one ballet, I would find in it all that I needed   This is what I tried to do with these pallets   These are palettes and as you can see they contain 18 shadows   We wanted to add a new element   We have the colors of a butterfly and the other pearl I've seen before   But the new and distinctive in the pallets are colors with three dimensions   I loved her a lot since I saw her   It is noted that these shadows are free of talcum which makes them very saturated   I created this ballet based on my view of beauty   If I had chosen the colors for myself, this would be the perfect ballet for me   I will speak quickly about the shadows   The two most important shadows in these ballets are Maneater and Flamingo   These pallets were based on these two colors   Also contains this dark black shadow   It's so sharp it's so hard to remove   When I put it on my hand, you see the line here and the color is still on my finger   As I said, these two shadows were the source of the revelation of the shadows   As for the pearly shadows, Angelic was the source of her revelation   The manicure that I am now putting on is inspired by this color   It is also wonderful on the lips as well   It is a floral shadow and has a lot of golden pearls   When you put it looks iridescent   I try to remove the black color from my hands   As Tren this shadow is very beautiful and saturated   These palettes also contain very sharp shades   We recommend applying it by finger to get the best result   Or you can spray the liquid on the brush and apply it   All you have to do is press a little bit and you will get a great result   When I saw these shadows I learned that I had to put them in pallets   First I began to pick out the colors that inspired the group such as Fling, Rose Gold and Trust Fund, which are warm colors   And then I added other shades that I consider very necessary   Like 24K which is a beautiful golden color   I will also show you the Rose Gold and Trust Fund as they are the main players in this group   I am very proud of the quality of these shadows they are very saturated   For me this pallet is very important because I wanted to launch a great product but different from other products   Some of these shades are different and you may need some time to get used to them   But I am sure you will love her very much   This product part of me has developed all my passion for it   I want you to know that when you get it, it means a lot to me   I hope you will be able to experience it and feel its distinctiveness   I am very excited to share with you   Thank you so much for watching this video because it means a lot to me   I am eager to see your views with these pallets   Bye

 Hello my friends, I received a lot of requests to be photographed but my new way to draw an Eleanor   I have filmed similar videos in the past and am obsessed with the Illiner   I know that there are different techniques and slogans that are discussed on the websites   But I prefer the sharp and thick liquid alaener   Makeup Basics: Winged Eleanor   Draw the Illiner in two phases, first with the liquid eliner to determine the shape   Then use a dark black shade to get the unlined velvet effect   I will use the Perversion Liquid Eyeliner from Urban Decay   This is a favorite of Kato Von D   Sometimes I like using Art Liner from Makeup forever   I will start by drawing the Illiner at the outer corner   I will draw a very small line here   Previously I followed the line of lower eyelashes to draw the delinquent   Now follow the line of upper eyelashes upward to lift the eyelid   I like to have the delinquent hunched off the eyebrow   Make sure the line is clear and clear   I will draw the line on the other eye to make sure they are equal   The color of the eyeliner varies according to the shape of the eye. It may appear straight or crooked when the eyes are closed   You should modify the drawing according to eye shape, so start with a short line   You can tell how your eye looks, and then you can stretch it as needed   If you do not adopt these steps, you may get a folded eyeliner at the fold of the eye   Then the delinquent will reach the top lash line very straight   I will finish the line for more than half the distance and I will stop   So it seemed very straight when my eyes closed   If the Illiner starts at the edge of the pupil   Many people suffer from the problem of printing kohl on the fold of the eye, or do not know how to fill the blanks   To solve these problems, put the mirror at a lower level than you and not parallel to your face   When you look down, you avoid the folds of the eyelid and print the kohl   I will complete the kohl drawing until the angle of the inner eye fills the blanks   As Tren looks, the Illiner is a bit glossy   Often when used as a long-lasting solution, the Urban Decay and Kat Von D eyeliner are shiny   When I use this kind of kohl I want at the same time to be matte velvet   Use the dark black shade and apply it moisturized over the liquid eyeliner   Sprinkle a little spray on the brush   And I will immerse her in this shadow to black   That will remove the luster altogether   Make sure not to wet the brush too much so that the liquid kohl is not accidentally removed   The last step is to use a little cream foundation this course Faux Filter of HUDABEAUTY   I will put a small amount of it on the brush   To clean the line and correct any twisting   And now I will be installing eyelashes and this is my favorite name is "Farah" from Hoda Beauty   I will put it back and go back immediately   If this is the final block you can see the dramatic effect that kohl gives the eyes   My eyes look beautiful and attractive   I hope I have answered all your questions in this video   If I wondered why I did not use the normal kohl pen   This is because liquid kohl helps me draw a more severe line   But if you are more comfortable with the normal pen you can of course use it   But I prefer the liquid eyeliner with the black shadow above it to get this sharp effect   Thanks for watching, if you have any additional questions, put them in the comments box   We also followed the squash where we put a lot of lotions   I will put all links in the info box   Bye  
by the way this is not a hashtag ad this is no has text phone yeah we were just friends this is my girl and I'm here in Dubai I like scream right now because I've been waiting for this moment for so long I'm here too and I was kind of beating but I'm getting really nervous I'm proud I'm probably going to stop on it for the first time ever and here by the hands guys who wants they care when I think gorgeous here guys I can't believe this is actually happening I'm like so excited three years in the making let me show all of them there's three different ones coming for you guys and who not like you're going to be taking all of them obviously good I own it can I mix the dry in the thinning yeah hey first of all can we talk about that guy seriously yeah are using so why the hallways and I even started the haircare line was because I really really really strongly believe that you will not see changes in your hair by just doing external remedies so you need to do internal as well and there was no hair care brands to ever talk about that after years I was spending clients to the health food store to get I attend fish oil pills and so I called my lovely friend dr. Denise who is the prettiest smartest thanks ma really all right all right so I every time I see her get prettier like where she only will do something I love ro to get me on collagen or she gets me on something I get prettiest so true my skin gets more even just something happens like when I got me formulation she was the number one person to call because she understands help more than anybody and so unbelievable years later are they for me I know it's so exciting so right here three different hair types so there's we we are the only hair care brand who's ever ever done supplements and for the past year with an energy change or shampoo conditioners in all of our size array but this is the game changer so there's three different ones spin oily and dry and the ingredients were seriously different I might be looking at them they have like so they really is for the skin care needs are we the hair care needs a unique yeah so basically I wanted to kind of give everybody the power to start really seeing changes in their hair you guys did number one thing that we worked on for so long with most vitamins and supplements you to take two or three a day and for me I mean we just talked about whatever and I'd wash in our hair I don't think remember your vitamins one day so we made it into a one add a pill form and it's like super super cute the I remember you talking about this forever and I knew I know it took you a little while to launch it because you were so picky about everything yes which I love because I appreciate arts and people who like their time to actually do things right yeah so which one do would you recommend for me can I thank you I'm you Natan I think let me actually has a good trick that we can talk about Lisa oh yeah for you I can't even see yours go have to know whether you've got thinning hair or not I think that's how most important thing you need to rule out and if you want to have like a little trick just take a little bit of hair you have a strong diameter and just really pull it okay okay ooh I can feel it breaking tell me I saw one hand okay I just getting bring on okay weird I think he was getting on a break-in so if you have four hairs or less you're okay your hair on your phone this is other class members all right guys so it's going to be available on the wacom April seventh is our drop D let's go sideways so soon I'm going to putting this now I actually also to talk about it yeah it goes away at you a couple they actually dropped it but I'm like I'm in Dubai I had them fresh out of the oven literally we just got these from like I want our laboratory and hood I own an open person so now we're tending here okay so I really don't see what it is here to I would hate for you I hate swimming and dry hair okay also you have to see what is your feet like to eat I mean your is I don't evolve to the county hall I have enough protein in your diet I'm probably not because it's so important they actually eating protein for breakfast and lunch that is critical for hair health doesn't matter what you have for dinner whether you have for dinner or not it's just breakfast and lunch yeah breakfast and lunch yes make sure later on is though you don't need as much protein to know not for your hair about for hair help Oh guys let's wreck fost and much and these have amino acids which are the building blocks of protein and you know that carotene in hair is we always seen it was really important so maybe we can talk about this actually she's so mature you really can see that chance about there so I don't think it's insane we need to talk about what's in it because I want to really hit on this to the note we don't none of us have a lot of time but I wanted to get all the information in yeah so if you can help explain for each one so dry is the first one dry have silica in it and so it is great for silky hair and long lashes yeah they all three hurt no you can either all you want to take that can I take all of them and you look at if you thought come over here yeah just take your spinning hair as well but dry also has vitamin E vitamin E is important for strong hair so your hair is breaking oh yeah so the vitamin E the Omega 3 and 6 in it it's really going to help it has a Megaton like rabbits because this is so important to watch your hair actually as you get older yeah so much and hormones play a huge part in it I have so many clients that come in in their thirties and then their 40s and I've seen my clients in the past ten years their hair change so much yeah after babies yeah yeah and color damage is something we could talk about yeah because people I know my hair change since I colored it every time I color it it loses the curl yeah it's like Falls that you can actually start seeing my scalp so why wouldn't we formulate it it it's not just what's going to feed your hair but also what's going to make your hair stronger to withstand because I mean you can tell people don't style your

that actually have been formulated specifically for pregnancy and breastfeeding and always ask your doctor before all the most women's hair grows so fast while they're pregnant yeah I gotta tend to be very mean and we don't really want to take it out either word when you lose it yeah that's mean I tell you a lot as a man because girls would never do that to one another can you can you take more

 Hello my friends, I would like to evaluate a product that you have recently launched many brands   These pens are shadows   I will expand the picture to see it clearly   It is a flat feather and inside the package is a powder   They are excellent for eye shadowing and are recently adopted by many brands   Help you make a nice Smokey Lock   It is also good for drawing eyebrows   Instead of using a pen and then shadow or gel and shadow   You can use these alone and they meet the purpose   I would like to introduce you how to use it   If you are an expert in drawing eyebrows and love to be very precise, these may not be ideal for you   It is suitable for those who are on a permanent wheel or are not beginners in drawing eyebrows   These can give you a heavy impact to your needs   These pens from Sevora have been newly launched   It is a condensed eyebrow   I have two colors, the first "Medium Brown" with number 02, and the last "Bronte" with the number 03   I will start with the number 2 and set the eyebrow arch first   I filled the gaps completely but I did not make them wide yet   Now I'll put more on the front and show it a bit higher   I will take more product and I will press the Feather more   If these pens are as good as you see, I have added the thickness to my eyebrows but did not show it enough   I could not put him away more with a badminton   If unfortunately you will have to use the pen next to the pen   But I'm glad I tried it before you to see the difference clearly   I can describe it as an eye shadow, its method of use is very easy   They are excellent for beginners   But I can not make it my only tool to draw my eyebrows   Unfortunately, I did not   But it is excellent for beginners, it has recently been launched at multiple brands such as Couver Gillar, Sevora, Baro Bar and others   You can find them wherever you are and at the prices that suit you   It is especially good if your loads are naturally dense   But if it is too light, this tool will not be perfect for you   You will have to go back to the gel or stylus and then use this pen as a last step   I used the product on this eyebrow, but the other eyebrow I did not paint any product   I will draw it now as I usually do and I will take a picture and put it at the end of the video so that I can see the difference   I hope you enjoyed this video, you can try it yourself if you find it suitable for you   Good bye

we bought a juicer for 80 bucks wasn't expensive at all and it was really good so you actually don't need to spend a lot of money on juicers this one was a little more heavy-duty this is a super crazy juicer this is for people who really like to juice I'm gonna turn this bad boy on alright so I'm not a very good assistant I was doing it wrong you should keep your juicer close like the juice apparently this way if it is inside okay and then we started with a cucumber when happening to Kalyan so put to kill it I'm going to what a great assistant I have here I sent some sarcasm yeah so the machine is supposed to sound like it's gonna explode open it hello no green juice thank you just so everyone knows I'm an amazing cook but not a very good juicer apparently okay you fishes are some ginger in there I like ginger gives a bit a bit of that spice no feelings inky throw some lemonade it'd be like his brother likes me and the only reason why he uses Apple because yes it's really good for you but it also kind of helps sweet and everything really goes when it's chilled in the fridge doesn't happily but tastes a lot better well no worries okay this is like the extract that came out electable it is so dry normally if you watch my snaps you see that I go to Spinneys every three or four days by in Vulcan shalash about three or four days I like there's a little communist but I actually hangry juice so much cook and I crave this screen juice like when Chris makes it I would still suck this is amazing look at Rincon is glowing already exactly should we get a little too much ginger for my liking it my mouth is kind of on fire I actually just put like a little tiny bit of ginger usually when I have it with you we don't skip it into complete even if you don't like ginger you can put a little bit but the ginger will definitely add a little bit of like a zestiness and it almost like um like a like a burn and it's nice and it's got me open it as it'll keep you healthy

 Hi friends, I will take a video today a very easy way to put wigs   It became very easy nowadays to get wigs and was hard to find in the past   They were expensive and very rare   I found some websites where you can buy wigs, I will put the links in the description box   On these sites you find a good quality wig and a front bar that gives you a natural look   Today I'll show you how to install it   The first step is to find a brand that you are good at making   This is difficult because you do not know how the hair will actually look if you buy it online   I got this with me, I purchased a number of wigs from different locations   When I arrived, I did not like the quality at all and it was expensive   So, when you try one brand only to try it   I always look for wigs on the bar at the front to get the best result possible   My hair is also dense and this means that it weighs more than 200 g   Always look for hair weighing 250 g or more   Then you have to find the style you like   The last step is to find sites that publish their own photos, with their mark on the image to make sure they have it   If you buy synthetic hair, you can not lay it off   If the hair is natural, you can dye it and cut it and use the turquoise and the floss   You can not do any of these things if the hair is artificial   I bought this wig on the front bar   It is made of natural hair, I will put you the link to buy it in the description box   It is very beautiful and also thick   When I lift my hair, my hair will not look light   The wigs are like to have roots like these to add depth and dimensions to it   This is not very necessary but I think it seems more natural   Even when hair is different, the roots look different   I think it was dyed the way natural hair dyes   As you can see, there is a bar at the front which is not too thick or too long   It is better when they cut it by themselves because we do not know exactly how much we need to be deficient   I think it should be about a centimeter and a half that will make it easier for you to integrate it with the skin   Keep the wigs on these cork heads   I bought it from the China Mart store which is very cheap, priced around $ 1   I have many of them, you may have seen in pictures of my tank   I tied my hair first in the shape of a pony tail   If you are on a wheel, you can hook your hair this way and then lift it into a wide cake shape to be very close to the head   Then tie them with pins and put wigs   But it is not the best way to put it \   The best way is to braid your hair   I will not say my hair in an ideal way, I would like it as easy as possible   I first divided my hair halves at the top   I will only have two wings to keep things from getting complicated   It is not necessary to divide the hair in an ideal way and I will twist both sides   I advise you to use the French braid to be as close to the scalp as possible   I put on my hair a little coconut oil last night   I think it's a good idea to put the oil in your hair when you decide to install the wigs   If I start to turn this side on the French way   I will divide the hair into 3 sections, it does not have to be perfect curl   I will leave the bottom of the hair and work on the top part first   It is very important that the plexus be as tight as possible   Attach new tufts to the curl each time from the bottom   This plexus can take two different shapes, so I put my hands back so that the more plexus sticks to the scalp with the back   I advise you to switch it to the end so that the capillaries do not fly   As I said it does not have to be perfect, but good enough to meet the purpose   I will now move to the other side   I will follow the same steps   I'll take the top part and divide it into 3 parts   It does not look perfect at all but that does not matter   The second step is shaving the lint on the sides of the forehead and this is very important when wearing wigs   If you have a lot of lint here, it will inevitably appear that you are putting the wigs and the result will not look normal   I had to learn how to shave the lint before I bought the wigs   I have a lot of lint in this area and I could not begin to put wigs   I was going to a wig shop in Los Angeles, and the saleswoman told me he had to litter   Although the forehead is wide, the lint reaches down, leaving no room for the wigs   Since then, I have shaved this area and kept it clean   I use the Tinkle code, which is my preference   I have different forms, but this is the best I have in the office   I also like using long blades that come with a casing   Now I will look for small capillaries   Most often they are above the eyebrows and at the top of the middle of the forehead   I return my hair back and shove it with light strokes   I do not lift it to the top too much, only about 2 mm to the top only   I see some lint here and I know it will appear under the wigs   IMPORTANT WARNING: When you shave and brow the forehead, be very careful   I have a very old picture of my sister, Mona, who had her hair on her forehead and reached about 5 centimeters up   It was disastrous, please do not do likewise   This will make your forehead seem wider and your face bigger   As Tren barely flew about 2 mm no more   As you know, I always shave my hair and always ask if the hairs are hardened   If you shave dry without water or oil, do not harden at all   So I started to lift my arms without water   If the hair is wet, the hair grows and becomes very harsh and more intense   I do not know why, but according to my experience, this is what happens   Anyone who tried it told me that I was right and that was what was happening with them   And that dry shaving was the solution to their problem   After I have cleaned my back of the lint and changed my hair, I will lift my hair up   I'll take the plexus and roll it up   This will help to hide any clump of hair under the wigs   If I lift the plexus and tie it with pins until it is firmly fixed on the head   Then I will append the subordinate party to that vertical shape   You also see the hair clip well on the scalp   Make sure to return the hairs of the sideburns behind your ear   I will pinch any volatile filaments   Finally, I will use a toothbrush and spray it with the hairpin and comb the hairs here   This will help me look better and more natural   The toothbrush picks up all the capillaries   If you would like to change your hairstyle after spraying the installer, I recommend you use the Brushable Spray from L'Oreal Elnett   It can be laid off after use   It is available in most stores around the world   As you see this happens a lot of teams   You can also enjoy side effects   I pull my hair up and pull the remaining lint   I do not have much hair here because I've been shaving it for a long time   When I went to the shooting sessions, I took this installer with me, it is excellent for fixing the eyebrows and hairs around the forehead   Now I will use this thing that looks like the tallest of the long socks   You can of course cut and use long socks instead of buying this   This hood is sold in wigs shops and priced from $ 5 to $ 10   I think it's expensive because you can get it to cut your long socks   I regretted buying it when I thought about it!   Now I will open the hood as much as possible   I will put the front part first and then pull it back   I'm tweaking it now   I put it down so I could lift it back   If I set it up I would not be able to adjust its position to the bottom without moving the hair under it   I now insert all the remaining capillaries into the inside   Then I start pulling it back a bit   You can use brushing and fixing again to ensure that any volatile bristles are installed   If you have a lot of lint at the top of the neck, use pins to install   Now I'll put the wigs, it's the hardest part   Use one to help you install it if you want   As you can see, this wig is characterized by a thin ribbon at the front and a clasp at the back   The clamp will help you to fix the wigs firmly on the head   The ribbon at the front gives a more natural appearance. Some small hairs here make it more realistic   To make it easier, hold on to the front end and ask someone to attach it to you at the back   If you want to install it yourself, put it first in front   Put your finger in the middle to secure it and pull it toward the back   Now I will pull it forward a little so that I completely cover the line of hair   Then pull the tape forward   Finally I pull it a bit back   Make sure to modify the wigs so that your natural hair does not appear beneath it   Try to keep your hair moving forward to get more coverage   Now I would like to incorporate a little tape and roots so that they look more realistic   I will use this Lorek label   I will use a light brown shade and put it on the roots with a brush   I can now use a darker shade and I will also put it lightly on the roots   To ensure that the tape looks normal, I will cut the length of the tip   Now I will take a little powder with a dry Beauty Builder   I will put it on top of the forehead to integrate the tape with the skin   Make sure that you do not use any liquid or creams on the tape to prevent it from being absorbed   And now I am finished!, The hair will not fall because it is firmly fixed   The roots were incorporated by shadows to look more natural   If you want to put wigs, you can do it at home   It is a very fun way to change your look and improve your mood   So do not cause damage to your hair as you do dye!

Today we will paint another makeup for Eid al Fitr   We had the date of the feast so we decided to photograph another Locke   It is different from what we adopted the previous time   I will take some optional steps   They are to add more sparkle to make-up   What Nasan will try to do today is to use lots of lotions that are owned by most of you   The previous time she was worried that you find it difficult to imitate make-up   Today, it will be used with Orbine Dikay 1 and 2   She uses the shades of Anastasia's eyebrows   But you can use any shade to suit the color of your eyebrows   Noor here   I decided to leave   You want to be part of the video as it sets the microphone   I will use a Konseller from Nares,   You can use any Consler you want   I like this console, it looks very nice in the pictures   Usually, when I put this console over my eye, I do not use Bremer   I feel that the combination of this console is fantastic and can be used as a polymer for the shadows   I will start with the shadow of Naiked from Palette Naiked   This will be the basic color of the eyelid   For the second shade, you can use any white shade that has some sparkle   You can do the same with Maybelline and Max Factor   Nour also wants his experience   I did not expect this!   It was not that bad right?   I'll fix it   You want to fix it on its own   She's brilliant!   You will become a makeup expert when you grow up   Now I will use the shadow of Buck from Palette Naiked   I like this brown color   Now I'll put a little black on the eye fold   Put the shadows themselves under the eyes   Now I'm going to use Aliener's gel formula from Englott   Lantern has a unique way of putting an Eleaner   I have used it myself since I was introduced to it   It blends the Illiner Gel with Ingol number 77 with Liquid Eyeliner from the brand itself   These mascara of Estee Lauder   Will soon launch new eyelashes called "Scarlett"   Am I the first to test it?   First you are, my sister has not tried it yet   They are beautiful eyelashes and are suitable for strong and soft makeup as well   I am now using an apricot to remove any dark pigmentation of dark circles   I will go to Consuler Radiant Karimi in Castred from Nares   Dior Essence Foundation   This is Studio Fix Powder from Mac with NC30 number   You will put it with a plywood blender   I like putting the powder with this sponge and it gives a more natural look   It puts a sufficient amount of powder on the face without many of them   I think you can stack the powder layers with it   This lip pencil is from Sevora, called Pleasant Plum, No. 09   Lipa Lipstick from Mac   This is the final check with Nazan, I liked a lot   Did you like Nour?   Yup   We will put all the details and names of lotions on my blog   We will put the Nazan account on the index and follow it   I hope you enjoyed this video   Do not forget to subscribe to the channel and meet  
everyone so our henna tattoos are finally launching into form in the east and we are so excited we have six different designs which I'll show you all of them we have named them after different cities that we felt were really inspired by henna designs now in each pack there is a black and gold or just plain black and a white so each one has two designs inside can see the black one in the front and the white one is literally just behind it so we have this is Marrakesh this is really pretty it's one of my favorites this one is called Beirut this one's really cool this was just black and we have a white one that matches it and we also have Bombay which is super gorgeous looks like a lot of lace detailing and then we have Dubai of course because we're in Dubai it seems actually my favorites we have Delhi which i think is really really cool as well and the last one we have is Istanbul and I'll grab this one right here and I'm going to show you guys really quickly how to apply this on your hands are so easy to do and if you love henna design you'll love this it's super easy only takes a couple of minutes and it lasts like a good of three or four days if you take care of your hands that can even last longer I'm super up with my hands so this'll ask me a good four days which is pretty long so I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to open this up and you can see here is the white design it comes on a little blue sheet just behind that the sheet that has the black and gold because in two designs I actually come inside each packet so you get two tattoos inside here so I'm going to first see which design I want to start with I'm going to start with a hand design so I'm going to look at my hand I can see where it will go first I'm just cutting in half cutting the bottom off then I'm just going to cut around and I'm going to keep those lines there just like that the only thing I am doing that's really important is I am cutting right at the end of this so you're going to know exactly where it's going to end and now I'm just going to go ahead and just sit on my hand and I'm going to now lift this plastic right off if you touch it it's a little sticky where the tattoo is you don't want to touch it my hand is completely clean I just washed it you don't want any oils on there if you want to long and if you put it up against the light you can see through the paper a little bit and it really helps the application become a little more precise and I'm literally just pressing it along my hand it will stick a little bit next I'm just going to grab a sponge and some water and now I'm just going to take the sponge it's soaked a little bit this water up and now I'm just going to go ahead and place it on the tattoos so you don't want to apply too much water I'm starting first with the middle and then working outwards and when you lift the paper up the test you'll be there and there's any lifting you can just go ahead and adjust the tattoo with your fingers really lightly and that would be perfect application next what I'll do is I'll go ahead and apply a little bit more of the smaller designs on the rest of my hand so we have all these finger pieces which are really really cool and they look really nice if you want to use them I'm just going to use maybe one or even two maybe I'll use one of these and then one of the simple ones if you want to you can apply it on a full finger like this or if you want to just use one you can do that as well take elastic and I'm just going to place this right on my pointer finger again using a little bit of water and I'm wrapping it around this time and now we have the finger that as well I'm gonna go ahead and do just one more finger here for this one I'm gonna use it's simple design a really cool thing about this is it's so easy to get a beautiful kind of design at home really quickly and if for any reason you don't like it all you need to use is oil makeup remover and it will come right off just going to go ahead and put this here and if you want you can go ahead and you can extend it and put it on the rest of the hand as well you can totally apply the hand right here which looks totally great I usually like just the hand I like it a little bit more simple that's kind of what I love so much about our henna designs as well I feel like it's easy to customize so you don't need to go over the top I love this I love this design actually with all the designs and we also got a lot of help from girly henna she worked with us on some of the designs shut up I've really had nekkid she's awesome so you can see this is super easy you can even wear this to office because you could customize it and make it to where it's not too heavy and it's just looks glamorous so please make sure you guys head to Sephora check out our henna tattoos we have those six designs that I showed you and each one has a black and gold one or just a plain black and a white one in there make sure if you guys do post it on

 Hello my friends, I will teach you today how to identify the lips of the contour and this is very popular now   I started my lips about four years ago and I remember my reaction from the result I got   It is the face contour but the lips   I posted a video on Snape Chat and left someone commenting on a small mouth without makeup   I am not ashamed to say that I am the biggest of the intellectuals   I wanted to show you how to do it in this video   Soft lips now, the first step is to pick any dark lips pencil   This is a pen from Lorak called Marlow, which is very dark   I will begin by identifying the lips from the top and bottom   At the same time I will change the shape of the lips   Then I set it at the corners   The second step is to use a pink color, this pen is from Bobby Brown and I will merge it into fonts   The third step is to use the light color of Node Lightest, this pen from the Lorak   I will focus it on the center of the lips only   I will explain to you what you did   When I set the top and bottom lines of the lips as well as the corners   This lends to your lips size and attractiveness   I will also use the light pen to draw a line directly under the dark baseline to enlarge it further   When you're done you can go back in pink and blend colors well   Now that I'm done, I think it's the easiest way to make your lips come up with makeup   But make sure you do not draw the line too much downwards so as not to look like a jerk   As you can see the two lines here and you can modify it at the bottom if you make a mistake   In this case, I advise you to use the foundation cream instead of the concealer to look more natural   You can use these dark or light colors   This is my easy way to set the lips in the contour and enlarge them to become more attractive   I hope you have enjoyed this video, I have to keep track of my accounts on Instagram and Snab Chat and meet

 Hi I'm from us, Huda's sister   Today, she will do my best for an important party after she dances   This is true I have been very pleased   If I start with the eyebrows, I will use the Ka Brow Gel from BENEFIT by 4   I'll fill the blanks a bit   Enjoy our beautiful and dense eyebrows   But they are not completely equal so I will correct them a bit   I love to comb the eyebrows while correcting them and filling the blanks   Now I will use the light brown shadow of Balp Morphe   12ME digit   After I have finished my eyebrows, I will move to the face   I used this wonderful oil from Farsali   She gave me him and I was obsessed with him   Our skin has many colors   So I'll blend G50 from Cover FX   And a little cream based Rainforest of The Sea in Medium Honey   After I stir it well   I will try it first on her skin   I will add more cream to the second foundation because the first is very golden for the color of her skin   For face contour I will use a few Custom Cover Drops in color G20   It is a color that is lighter than the color of its skin and will be placed under the eye area   This foundation cream is great because it covers so much   But it is best to use a finger or a pewter blender to blend it   Now I will use the Camouflage counter with number 5   I will have a little brown, not too dark   I will begin by defining our face   I will merge it upwards   This area is a bit large so I will combine it up to make her face consistent   I will also determine her brow because we have inherited the broad forehead of the family   Now I will use Ballet Contour from Aesthetica   To add a bronze color to her skin   To determine her chin I will use the Burberry counter pen   I will combine it well with the brush   I like to use Huda's liquid fragrances as a blush   It lasts for a long time and looks very beautiful on the skin because it is also moisturizing and moisturizing   I will mix little of Gossip Girl and Bombshell   You only need a very small amount   Mix well so that there is little left on it   That added warmth to the face   Now I will "bake" her face   By the transparent powder of Laura Mercier   Of us crazy today!   I'm crazy every day   Especially on Thursday   I will put a little transparent powder under our eyes   Look up   She can not look up!   I have a problem with looking up   Do not laugh at me is a serious medical problem!   Sorry I did not know it was a serious medical problem!   Every time you makyaji I can not look up, my eyes are turning in the opposite direction   If you put the powder here and leave it for some time   Now I'll fix the rest of my face   Now I will use MakeupShayla from Tarte   I will begin by identifying other areas of the face   I will use the lighter color on the chin   It's a wonderful ballet!   For the eyes, the Suede shadow was used on the entire eyelid with a little shadow of Sandlewood   Now I will add Shadow Shy to the fold of the eye   I will put a little shadow of Bossy on the eyelid   Starting from the outer corner and I will merge it a little inside   I will use a clean brush to merge all the shadows   I will put Shy shadow on the bottom lashes line   With a small brush, I will have a dark brown color called Coco and put it on the lower eyelashes line as well   The pink shadows are very popular and I love them so much!   Her eyelashes are too flared and I would lighten her reflex   I'll have the eyelashes of my beauty Jane and put a little glue on them   I recommend that you place the amount of glue according to the size and width of the tape   I'll put a little Rose Gold shadow on my eyelid   I will combine it with the brush   I will then use the Angelic shade to incorporate the brilliant shadows I have developed previously   I correct the Eleaner a bit   It's very hard to make makeup from us   Has anyone ever told you this before?   You are the hardest at all!   Her face moves   I will put a little mascara on the lower eyelashes with a flat brush   Because it gives me greater control   I'll set her lips by Trendsetter   This is my favorite mix of lips   I'll add a little Roger Venus in the middle   It promotes liquid fluid   To ensure that the lips remain moist during the day   I will combine it mildly to get a simple ombri effect   I do not identify our nose by habit because it is perfect   But since it will take a lot of pictures, I'd better set it down a bit   I'll have the makeupshayla again   The color is a bit dark I will not put it in a very light way   Now I will put a white eyeliner into the eye   Since the color of her eyes is brown, I think it is nice to highlight them and enlarge them more by white kohl   She asked her to fix it at the corner to make it more almond-shaped   I make small corrections at the end   Now I think it's better to fix the eye fold more   I will use the Bossy shadow and blend it well   The structure of the cheeks is fantastic but I love doing some corrections after finishing the make-up   This is the final make-up, I hope you have liked it   I loved him very much, thanks Huda   she is beautiful!   Can you do this every day?   No   You can watch my videos on YouTube   I have a channel on YouTube I do not know if you've seen it before   No   I know makeup   I forgot to put the heliter!   this is a disaster!   You can not go to the concert without Hellaiter!   I will use the Heater from Palette Sleek   It is usually better to put the heliator first, ie before the bronze and placer   We have finished make-up   Look down   We have used the new Rose Gold from Hoda Beauty   We have been inspired by this makeup and it is my favorite   It is a beautiful floral and golden floral colors   I hope you have enjoyed it, we are on a wheel and will go now   Do not forget to follow me on Snabshat and Nstqram   Good bye  
hey guys so I posted on my Instagram not too long ago about using sellotape on my face to contour so many people who are commenting a lot people were like oh that's crazy doesn't seem necessary and others were like woah your contour was so sure though I want to do a video tutorial for everyone out there who is interested in doing this tutorial I want to show you guys how to do it and if anybody is like maybe a bit concerned maybe they think it's too much you don't have to use it for your whole entire face but for some parts your face it does really give you a sharp beautiful contour so I'm just going to show you really quickly where I place everything so my face has moisturizer on it already I like to kind of loosen up the tape because if you put it directly on your face it's gonna be way too strong I'm just gonna go ahead and put it on my hand I'm gonna remove it I'm gonna do that one more time it still has some stickiness to it but not too much so it's not going to actually remove any of the natural oils from my skin or to many of the natural oils from your skin it's just enough there to keep it really nice and tacky so I'm going to grab some tape and I like to take piece that's a little long it's almost like the whole length of my hand from like my thumb to my hand it's almost the exact same so it does need to be kind of long this one I'm putting on the back of my hand and then whoops removing it one more time and now we're going to go ahead and stick this where it needs to go now this is awesome because it's really going to put it very precisely where it needs to be for your face shape that's gonna make it so symmetrical anybody out there who's suffered from making your contour symmetrical and also putting in the right place to give you the right ideal face shape that you want this is really gonna help so I'm going to go ahead and I'm going from the middle of my ear and then I'm putting it at the corner of my mouth now a lot of times we ask people to do that really weird thing where they suck in you can see it goes exactly where I needs to go I'm gonna do the same thing on the other side and I am just making sure that it is symmetrical the next piece of tape is also very long and this one is not going to actually go from the middle the ear it's actually going to go from where your ear begins on your face and then we're going to connect it to basically the middle of where your eye is assembling there too and you can see there's a triangle space right here that is going to be where I contour and all this tape is making it super difficult to speak right now next we're going to the jaw line we're going to grab a super long piece of tape for this one I'm going to see where my jaw line begins and you can see it begins right there but you can see there it's not sort of farther it's like a little bit of psyche nasir so what I'm gonna do is I'm actually going to take that and I'm just basically putting it where my jaw should begin so you can see are actually going on to my jaw you can see there is tape that is not on my skin right here so that is where I am going to contour and the forehead actually you don't really need to put tape on it's super easy to contour now for the nose I'm actually using really tiny pieces they're only like this big don't make it too big because you don't want to go into your eye and I'm basically putting it from the corner of my eye and I'm going along where my brow is and I'm going super straight this I want to be super straight there we go for the middle of the nose I'm just taking a piece of that tape and I'm cutting in half like straight down the middle and I'm basically just placing this in the middle of the nose there we go now I'm ready to contour this is just from Make Up For Ever this is number 20 and I'm also going to mix that with number 12 you do want to use a really creamy contour because of anything that is too dry is going to set and then by the time you start blending it's not going to blend well so I'm just going to go ahead and I'm just basically putting pressure where the tape is and this really does work I know it seems to leave but does give you such a straight amazing contour and I'm just going here along the jaw on the bottom of that tape for the forehead I'm just going along before for my nose I'm going to use the Anasazi Beverly Hills contour kit in Claire's and I'm just going to go ahead and apply this middle color on the areas on the nose that are open this is going to give you such the straight nose I'm just going to put a little bit here on the tip and now I am just going to go ahead and start taking off these contours so I'm going to take one piece off that time and you can see that contour is like so fierce it's so straight and so fierce the same thing on this side again such a beautiful contour next I'm grabbing a little concealer and I'm just going to go ahead and put it on the areas around the cheeks and to blend everything I'm just going to use a little bit of my cream foundation I'm going to put it on my brush I'm first starting with blending the light colors cleaning my brush off so just there's a little bit of product here I'm going to go ahead and start blending the dark colors and if you want to give yourself a little bit more of a contour you can just take the same product and just blend a little bit upward don't blend downward just upwards you want that nice clean contour on the bottom and that will make it a little stronger you still want that clean contour for the nose I'm just taking a clean brush and I'm just going to go ahead and start blending next I'll take a little bit of that concealer I used before and I'm just drawing a straight line on my nose and now I'm just going to go ahead and blend so you can see how straight and how clean my contour is it's literally so straight so perfectly put and it's so even on both sides this is like the best contour for your notes even if you know how to confer - well this is actually really good for contouring your nose I'm going to go ahead and bake and powder my face and then I'll come right back you guys can see I went ahead and set everything with powder and added a little blush of course some highlighter and the sharpness of this contour it's like really subtle but so clean using a tape method I know a lot of people were giving me a lot of comments about how it seemed to look complicated but it actually does work really well so if anybody's a beginner contour you could try this out it's super easy to do I hope you guys enjoyed this video please stop this video up comment down below if you guys what made you want just specifically on the nose I could really go into detail with that and I will see you guys next time bye

 Hello my friends, I will talk today about my favorites for October   I can not believe that the year 2016 was nearly solved, this year passed very quickly   It was hard to follow the code recently because there was a lot of work to do for my beauty   This is good of course, but this is a kind of challenge for me to keep up blogging amid concerns   We test about 500 products per month   In the busy months we receive about 1,300 products   If a lot of products are sent to us, every time a product is launched in the world it sends us to try it out   I would like to speak today about my top ten products   Some of them new and the other old   The first product is Palette Weiss 2 of Orkney Dykai which is really wonderful   They gave it to me on my birthday, with amazing colors   I think it is one of the nicest pallets that Orbun Dikai has launched   This shade is beautiful black gold color   There are apricot and beige colors   This warm brown color is also wonderful   I know that the ballet of Weiss is bolder but I think these ballets are necessary   The second product is new and I did not know what to expect from it when I saw it   They are the new brushes of the brand name in Maine   You know that I love their products a lot and buy them every season   These brushes are the best at all, but they are expensive and the price of the big brush is $ 40 \   If I had one choice, I would choose the big one because it adds tremendous intensity to the hair   It is soft on the hair and does not clog the hairs during the styling   These brushes made it easier for me to style my hair, I loved it so much   I purchased it from the Net-a-porter site   The latest new product is the ultra-pure foundation cream from Mike Up Forever   Use color 153 usually but today I put 127 because the other is not in my office   And merge it with a darker color   Sometimes I set my face in color 177 and it is not too dark, it's perfect   This foundation is too heavy, if you do not like the full coverage they have Ultra-HD foundation cream but with liquid formula   The other is very light and is suitable for those with semi-perfect skin and light coverage   That day I used this saturated foundation cream but I incorporated it well and then I added a liquid foundation cream with this brush   You know how much I love her, she's also from Mike Up Forever with number 148   If I put these layers and fixtures and my skin looked perfect without impurities and at the same time healthy and beautiful   It is an excellent product, its coverage is perfect and lasts all day long and never gets spotted   The next product is Sasha Joan's Ocean Mist   I lay on my hair after bathing and when I did not do that, I felt my hair was flat and not brown and hard to make   This helps to maintain better wrinkles and easier hair styling   It also gives little intensity and becomes obsessed with it   I used the Pample &amp; Bumble spray in the past and found that this was better   This Contour Duo Contour Duo is a lightweight Medium   The color of the contour is perfect because it does not tend too much to orange   Integrates very easily, I think it is excellent when we are on a wheel   There's nothing wrong with the color of light, it's very light, you can use it if you like but I prefer the console   The following product was launched a while ago but has become popular recently   It's Artest Brushes, I own the whole collection   As you can see there is a huge brush, a big shower and a small mattress as well   I think I bought it with three sets   I do not know if the Mac brand tried to imitate it, but I have this old brush from Mac   I bought it two years ago and it is OK   Artest brushes are fantastic   I hesitated first because I did not know how the result would be but I found it excellent for the Contour   I find that where you want makeup to last, you have to put full coverage   You can use it for liquid or cream powder   I think this brush is the most important in the group and it is the best 3, I use it for the nose contour   If you would like to buy another brush I would advise you to brush the Oval 6, it is excellent for facial contour   I did not have the chance to try it all because I was busy working   But I think these brushes are great and they deserve all the fuss about them   This eye cream is my favorite at all for dark circles   It's Jensenk of Origins brand, I do not know if I've ever valued it because I've been using it for some time   It helps a lot to treat dark circles, its structure is not greasy but it moisturizes a lot at the same time   I loved it very much and used it sometimes before putting makeup   It is the only eye cream that really affected the dark circles   It is mentioned on the packaging that it illuminates the eye area and relieves swelling   The following product is a bit old and I talked about it a lot in the past, it's an Embryolisse brand   It is the center of Lait Crème Concentre   It is a thick cream and center and is the best you can use before makeup   Absorbs skin easily and does not look greasy but moist and healthy   I tried the cream of the combination from the same group and quite a bit   The next product is very basic to me and I talk about it a lot on snaps   I have to follow up there my name is Realhudabeauty   This product of La Mer brand La Mer   It's the best !, I've tried all the moisturizing products from the cheapest to the most expensive   I found that this humidifier was the best at all   It cures all kinds of lips with all their problems   It stays on your lips all the time and I think this is the secret of its success   It lasted on my lips for 10 hours and made my lips soft and full   When I travel my lips puck so much that they hurt me   I was able to avoid this with the help of this humidifier, which was completely cured like magic   The last product is also amazing, I used it in the past and I do not know it did not stop   When I returned to use it I remembered how good it was   It is a Denisevic product from Kirastase I have written about before   He is supposed to develop 13,000 hairs within a few months   He succeeds in doing so and this is the truth of the matter   My hair is very light when this area has improved with the use of this product   I have come back to use it now and many small hairs have grown in this area   I do not know if it is suitable for men too but I use it every morning and evening after washing my hands   I use my scalp well and I can say it's amazing   I hope you try these products because they are already fantastic   These are the products I really like   I hope you have enjoyed this video, follow me on Instagram and Snabshat and do not forget to subscribe to the channel and to meet  
yeah we in here hey everyone so today I want to tell you guys about something that is so important to me something that is very very special and that is our lip contour okay we have been planning to do these lip contour since last year actually I met with Sephora in New York in June or July and I told them that I really wanted to bring back the lip liner I think lip liners are so important and they really are so understated I think lip liners are incredibly important not only for contouring the lips but also just for keeping your lip product on and for really just creating that beautiful pout we created the head of beauty lip contour and as you can see probably seen it buzzing out over Instagram this is a very very important project we worked so hard to make sure it was a formula that goes on super smooth glides on just without any problems and just super easy it also stays on really well after applying this after 10 seconds you will not be able to rub them off which is awesome so you can put it on in the morning maybe have a little lunch and just reapply really simply and just keep one in your bag and this fits in really tiny bags and you're good to go you're good to go all evening long I kind of want to introduce all the colors and talk about why we created these colors and the inspiration behind the name I have to tell you guys they've sold out before we even put them on sale so we don't have really any stock Sephora has basically taken all of our stock cult has taken all of our stock so whatever is available in the retailers is it and then we'll replenish them a little bit later so they may be out of stock for little while so get them while you can and we will hopefully restock them a little bit later I'm really excited about these and hopefully you guys will love them as much as we do I'm going to go ahead and go through all the colors because I really think it's super important talk about how amazing the colors are as well so the first color is actually called trendsetter and as you can see it's kind of like that 90s Brown that color that I kind of would always look for in the 90s and it's just super amazing it's really really beautiful it has a little bit of a brown is too but also a little bit of a redness and the undertone to it so it looks kind of also very alluring so it's super super beautiful it looks great on every skin tone no matter what hair color you have more what skin tone you have this is my favorite color and what I love about this so much is the name of course trendsetter I feel like Browns are super trendy super like fashion-forward you know it's kind of like that 90s revival that we're seeing all over the world and that's really what the name of this color is and as you guys probably seen all over Instagram I'm obsessed with this I'm wearing it right now it's just to me one of the best colors ever so another very pinky new that I love so much as well is called bombshell and this is that super kind of pouty kind of what I would envision brigitte bardot wearing back in the 60s and I'm obsessed with her manage you probably know already this is really that color that kind of is that nude but not so nude kind of pinkish pout and I'm obsessed with this color so much I actually like to use this a lot with trendsetter the whole purpose of creating these was really to kind of just introduce the idea of contouring with the pliner's and what I'll do is I'll take trendsetter I'll line my lips I'll darken areas where I want darken and then I'll put bombshell in the middle and just blend it all together and it looks incredible so this is a great color you can wear all over your lips and if you want to add a darker color as well you can mix some colors in there together and it looks divine it's literally so so so beautiful another really pretty pink color which is kind of a little bit of a coral a little bit of a pink kind of mixed together and this is gossip girl it really does look like that kind of baby girl pink and this is something I imagined a girl wearing in school who like maybe like the gossip I was thinking of Mean Girls and the girl who was always gossiping and this is the color I had imagined her wearing um so it's kind of like that posh very pinky you know she's a little popular kind of color and that's kind of what I imagined this girl wearing um and it's really just like a really pretty babydoll pink and it looks amazing on so many different skin tones I really like this especially people who have yellow or warmer skin tones it is so incredible but I'd also seen on people with cool skin tones and it looks so different we will have swatches to make sure you guys look out for the swatches going to show you how it looks on people with different skin tones the next color is called trophy wife and I love this color so much so this is the color I worked on a lot with Mona actually she really worked with me on the pigmentation and when we developed it we kind of thought of the name what we would call it I really thought trippy wife was the perfect name for this it really brings out this idea to me that I reminds me of one of my friends who is just the epitome of what a trophy wipe is and she always wears pink like this you know it's very beautiful very posh very sexy kind of also like poised and classy like one of Mona's favorites she like lives in this color it's such a beautiful just really deep kind of pink so when we develop trophy wife which had a lot of blue undertones I kind of like more warm undertones so I kind of created something that is a lot warmer and it's called icon for me this color was something that is just super hot super intense this is for that girl who was like those super just luscious sexy lips and I actually use this color a lot sometimes I mix it with trophy wife or I'll mix it with trendsetter and it's a little deeper has like reddish or yellow undertones it's really really beautiful when we actually created this color a lot of times we actually were mixing paints and I mix a little red into this and what I was thinking of is like women when they're really like flushed their lips are flush it just looks so attractive so we took the trophy wife tone we muted down some of the blues and then we added the Reds and it just became super super super just attractive icon is for the girl who wants super gorgeous hot looking lips one of my favorite colors for red is actually cheerleader and what this is it's almost like a red that's been muted and added a little bit of a brown undertone to it it's super beautiful when I see girls wearing this in the office I'm like what are you wearing and there was a cheerleader and cheerleader is that color that I really imagined like girls be wearing in school it's not that that true pop of red it's more like a muted red and it looks like something you could wear a day and night and not look like you're trying too hard you're just like naturally hot and gorgeous and that's what I've always imagined cheerleaders to be especially cuz I want to be one and I look just perfect for any occasion any time of day and that's kind of inspiration behind cheerleader the next color which is a super super hot pink that has a little bit of blue undertone is called video star and video star I kind of imagined would be that person who would be just super super confident would have no problem wearing this really strong pink lip also somebody I saw as like a personality maybe you know just over the top as well so this person could be somebody who is like maybe up-and-coming maybe getting into YouTube and Instagram that's a very strong pink just looks so incredible especially if you have more beige undertones can also wear as well if you have yell out of tones it looks so beautiful amazing beautiful pop of pink famous is a really important color to me because this kind of represents the woman who is ready to kind of take over the world she is somebody who is about to reach the pinnacle of her life and become something incredible we've set all these to so many bloggers around Instagram and this has been a huge favorite for so many people it's definitely like a deep plum with a bit of a blue undertone when I see people wearing it I literally I want to put it on and I put it on a few times and I'm like oh my gosh it's so beautiful I don't wear this color enough it's such a pretty like aubergine and it just looks very strong so it's definitely for that person who wants to be strong it also feel very very confident and they're ready to just be out there and also you know set their mark in the world so that's kind of the inspiration behind famous and then vixen is really such an important color to me because I love that really deep deep just ultimate Brown with a little bit of a reddish tone to it and many of you may have noticed as you use it there's a little bit of a sparkle a little understated but it's there and what it does is it just kind of helps bring out the plumpness of the lip which I love again a very strong color it's super trendy and it's also one of those colors I feel that go beyond the trend as well so this is a classic that you need in your beauty wardrobe this is just a kind of a statement piece this is almost like the accessory to your makeup so maybe you just wear mascara and you have your brows on anywhere vixen and this is one of those colors that you really don't need to pile on the makeup you can or you can wear by itself and this is a statement I really do feel this is one of the most attractive Brown Reds that we've seen out there and I cannot wait for you guys to try this color so those are the lip contours I hope that you guys can try them it's just really incredible the consistency that it is and we hope that you guys love it and you guys enjoy it it's really important to remember just to play with these colors you know mix them together there's no reason why you have to take one color and put it all over your lips play with them contour highlight and bring out the depth over line underline do whatever you want to really create that desired lip shape that you want and just see how much different it's going to change your beauty routine so we hope you guys enjoy the products and hopefully love that as much as we do and we can't wait to see them on you guys on hi guys

Hello! My name is Huda from Hudabeauty and today I am teaching you a very important part of makeup I will show you how to get a flawless skin using foundation and concealer these steps will help you achieve a natural finish without looking heavy and cakey First, I will start with the skin tone it is very important to figure out what your skin tone is first, look at the skin of your arm to see if your veins are blue or green I’m going to use a foundation that is more golden or yellowish beige my veins look so green so if your veins look really green, you should opt for a more yellow foundation People from France and Britain for instance, tend to have more of a beige undertone for me, I use a foundation that has a yellow or golden undertone this is Dior Star number 40 I absolutely love this foundation! Second, I am going to use a corrector to cancel out any dark pigmentation under my eyes I am using an orangey corrector from this Camouflage palette from Makeup Forever number 5 if you want a more affordable corrector, this palette is from CityColor it has many colors in it for correcting and contouring I got this from Amazon for about 10$ and then I’m using this concealer palette from Cinema Secrets there are a lot of colors, I love this one it has a yellow undertone to set the base, I am going to use this powder from Laura Mercier I like a bronzed look, so I am using an awesome bronzer from Victoria Beckham I got it from Net-a-porter.com I will list all the links in the description box below It is called Java Sun number 1, and it is AMAZING! For the highlight, I am using two eye shadow from our beloved Rose Gold palette And lastly, I will be using this beautiful blush from Too Faced it is called Love Lush first, I am a little embarrassed to tell you this but I use Vagisil cream before any makeup I love this product because it’s so soothing and it’s a perfect base for makeup I will use this orange corrector underneath my eyes and around my mouth where I have a little bit of dark pigmentation this brush is perfect for the task, it’s G26 from Morphe Brushes you don’t have to use the exact same brush but find one that is a bit dense I am applying the corrector under my eyes and around my mouth it’s very common to see women with dark pigmentation in this area and it gets so dry so if you have that, don’t worry! so I applied this orange concealer on all the dark areas on my face and then, I’m applying foundation to cover everything up this is Dior Star number 40 and I’m using this foundation brush from RMS which I love I like to blend my foundation using a patting motion to help the foundation to sink in really well Then, I’m using this concealer palette from Cinema Secrets with this brush; I am mixing these two concealers and applying them under my eyes to highlight I then look at my face to see where I need more highlight my chin is a bit small so I highlight it to make it appear a bit taller I laugh a lot, that’s why I have these lines over here so I am using the same foundation brush to blend out the concealer And now it’s time to contour my nose I am using this contour cream from the City Color Palette this color is perfect for nose contouring because it has a grey undertone that mimics the real shadow I am applying a tiny bit of product on this brush Then, I am using the same concealer brush to soften the edge and slim down the nose and now I am mixing these two colors from the Makeup Forever palette to contour my face I love this brush for contouring, it’s from Morphe Brushes G2 I am patting it lightly in the hollows on my cheeks strong contouring is not trendy anymore I am going for a soft and more natural contour I am going back now with the foundation brush to blend out everything seamlessly It’s time for baking! I am sure you have all heard about this technique baking is really important to set the makeup and it also prevents creasing under the eyes when you are applying mascara I am dipping my sponge in this powder and picking up a good amount and now I am patting it under my eyes I am going to leave it like this for now if you leave this on for a few minutes, your skin is going to absorb the makeup and now I am setting the rest of my face lightly with powder to contour and bronze up my face, I am using this product from Victoria Beckham and this brush from Chikuhodo called GSN 4 and I am applying it lightly in the hollows of my cheeks and also on the sides of my nose with a Mac 287 brush I like to use a tiny little bit of this Eye shadow Suede from out Hudabeauty Rose Gold Palette to contour my nose I am now adding more loose powder on the sides of my nose to make it thinner and a little bit on my chin to make it taller While waiting for the powder to bake, I am going to fill in my eyebrows so this powder has been setting for about 10mins I am now going to brush the excess off with this a 114 Zoeva brush I am applying a little bit of bronzer on my cheeks to blend out any harsh lines I am mixing these two eye shadows: Angelic and Moondust from the Hudabeauty Rose Gold palette and with a 288 brush from Mac, I am mixing the two of them and applying it on the top of my cheeks for highlight then I am using this brush again to blend it I am using the same eye shadow mix to highlight my cupid's bow and the brow bone and lastly, my tear ducts finally, I am using this blush on my cheeks and a little bit on the contoured areas And we’re done! I hope that you guys liked this video don’t forget to follow me on Instagram and snapchat I love you so much! See you in my next video Thank you Mona and Maryam for helping me out today if you want to learn Arabic, let me know I am here for you! no don’t do that, I didn’t do a good job today 
 Hi, I wanted to shoot a different video today   I posted an image on my Instagram account and was shocked by the comments   I wanted to share your opinion with the subject because it is very important to me as a woman   This is the picture and you can see my body's normal proportions   Some followers left comments like this   You look fat, Huda   You look short and do not like your skirt as you are fat   You look fat like a cow   You are ugly!   You are fat, you do not lose some weight to make your brain work. Over-eating affects the mind   And then I see a lot of people quarreling and shouting obscene expressions   As a woman, I have always believed that we have to support each other   I am very upset when I see these negative comments and this is not for me   But I worry about people who read these comments   Beauty can be manifested in any size, color or color   There is no reason why everyone should not be beautiful and feel this beauty   Today I turn to everyone who tries hard to be content with himself   You do not have to give someone lipstick, it's a big mistake   We do not have to tell the other that it looks terrible because there is beauty within every human being   We have to focus on positive things   I had a lot of harassment across the net when I started   It affected my psyche a bit but never stopped me   I have told you this in many ways. I know how hard it may be to start your dreams   When you are passionate about something, do not allow anyone to frustrate your resolve and make you stop   My sister Mona always tells me: "The earth is round, when you do good, it will come back to you forever"   It is important to know that the words that come out of the mouth and the way we treat the other come back to you with their results   So it is very important to share love with all people   Beauty transcends outward appearance, it is a feeling   When you feel beautiful you can achieve everything   When I say "sense of beauty" I do not mean that it is your hair to be a designer and your makeup is wonderful   I mean when you feel satisfied with yourself   I think women everywhere should feel beauty   Regardless of your personality or the person you compare yourself with   Beauty stems from the inside and goes beyond the outward appearance   I wanted to talk about it all you know you are not alone   Love is the foundation of beauty   It is the passion that inspires you and makes you happy   I do not condemn those who leave these negative comments, but I invite them to change their view of beauty   For all the weaknesses of trust and since I launched my blog I have increased this contract   But I realized that no one could classify me and know that they can not classify you   Every man is beautiful in his own way and has power within him   Within each human being is a feature he loves so much and can inspire the world through it   It is up to our view of beauty   What I see is a nice person who may not like someone else   But there is certainly an indescribable beauty within us all  
we are heading to Sephora and Times Square for my formula X collaboration to celebrate these polishes I am so excited you we had such a great time at Sephora Times Square was so wonderful to meet everyone I can't wait to see you guys again soon you

hey everyone I am so excited today to show you something so important to me so important to my soul and that is our 3d highlighter palette I've actually teased and talked about all this on Instagram and snapchat talked about the process but I really wanted to kind of lay everything out for you guys for you to see on YouTube and really give you more details on what makes this really really special there are a lot of highlighter palettes out on the market today we see them popping up everywhere and I wanted to find a way to really push the boundaries just a little bit and the way that we did that was by not only creating something that has amazing amount of shimmers but we also want to give you something really special and that is our melted strobe this is a very unique formula it kind of melts when you touch it and you put it on your skin it's so luminous and it really gives you that kind of inner glow so we did decide to launch two pallets so this is a gold stamp this is created for that woman who really has kind of the warmer undertone you can see there's a lot of really gold kind of warm tones and then we also want to offer a lighter shade and so this is pinks and this has a much lighter kind of palette better for baby's skin tones can actually go darker like I can totally use these shades as well but we want to start with something that was kind of more fair and neutral for lighter skin tones inspiration behind this was really kind of like that girl's lips for Sunday's I imagine her vacationing in exotic locations so we got looks a little fun with the name so this is all a good European beaches like Capri Santorini Azores and Ibiza and you can see this one has a little bit more of these golden tones it's a little bit kind of like a tropical vacation so we have Fiji Seychelles see Fiji in Zanzibar I'm going to show you guys exactly how to use this and I'm going to start with the golden sands so what makes this formula really special is it's actually something that I've been using for so long it's a simple technique I used to make oils with powders and what I noticed was that my highlight was popping so much it looks just like a glow from within I love that but we actually makes Chia butter with pearls and that really is what we call the melted strip so when you touch it it just melts and it feels beautiful but when you put on your skin it literally just blends into your skin and looks like that glow from within we just created this to make it foolproof so you know exactly how to use another true in the technique that we like to use it best so in our volunteer direction the first thing I'm going to do is apply the melted strobe some to apply a small amount here just to make sure that I'm getting a nice application of product so I like to kind of stab it and I really am using just a basic highlighting brush this product does work really well with virtually any brush and you can see that even just alone with this melted strop I have a really nice glow but it was super natural it's not over the top if you want to use only the melted stray by itself that's totally fine I'm going to go ahead and do the 3d layering to kind of show you guys next steps I'm going to grab the next shade I'm using the same brush not cleaning it off and I'm going to now set the next color and really start to kind of bring this highlight really forward so I'm literally just applying this right on top of the milk stir up and this is going on my cheekbone look at that you can already start to see how strong the highlight is so what we did is we went ahead and added this third color in here it's kind of like a deeper highlight so I'm going to go ahead and place this underneath the highlight so this is literally just underneath the area where I added the highlight and I'm kind of flying back and forth and blending to highlight in so this does add a little bit of sculpting into the cheekbone so although it's not technically contouring you are adding that dimension and it's adding a little bit of a sculpting effect so we're adding like different shades of contour the last step which is really simple is just to add a little bit of a flush just to kind of melt everything together spend basically just applying it in between the layers to kind of just re-emphasize that 3d factor [Music] [Music] this is the final look as you can see the highlight is pretty amazing so this really is kind of a foolproof highlighting technique that we created at Hutto Beauty to give you the ultimate gorgeous glow and take the process use it how you like you can adopt a however you like and don't be shy make sure you try on different body parts I always like to add a little bit to my shoulders I mean you can see instantly how that kind of comes out and it really just like radiates beautiful glow and that's what this is really about and if you guys do get to try this product make sure that you guys pack us with your photos on Instagram so we can check them out and share the love and we thank you guys so much for watching and we'll see you guys soon bye guys [Music] and

 Hi friends, I will take a personal video today   I'll tell you a little about my career as I get a lot of questions about it   I would like to help anyone trying to open a blog or launch a cosmetic brand   I will tell you today how I succeeded   I will begin with the personal side of the story, many do not know I am from the south   I grew up in Tennessee in the United States   I lived lengths of my life in this area   I spent 12 and a half years with my family there   And the features of the South and its environment were deepened in us   For example, say "sorry" or "thank" and "please"   And then moved to different regions of the United States   First to Massachusetts with my husband   And then to Michigan where she studied   And then moved to Dubai permanently to Dubai in 2008   Take it to Dubai's Diaries now   I studied finance at school but I did not like it at all   But when I realized it was the wrong area it was too late   I loved business management but my sister from me convinced me that funding is the most appropriate   Because I was proficient in mathematics and statistics   If you specialize in finance and hate this area   I decided I would not work there for a long time   But enough to finish the Masters and later turn to specialization in business administration   This has benefited me today   I ended up in finance and I hated it   I realized I was a very passionate person, but my job was what I was passionate about   I told myself that I would do nothing unless I was passionate about it   One night I was dining with my family and my sister told us   "Go and Make Up"   And my parents agreed, and this astonished me!   I went up to my room and booked a ticket to Los Angeles   I enrolled at the Joe Blasco Institute and learned makeup   The people who supported me the most are the women in my life, my mother and my sister   It was difficult at first because I was a new mother   I did not expect to be held and faced great challenges   I had a clear goal and suddenly I could no longer achieve it   I would raise my daughter on my left hand and write on my blog with my right hand   And then he fell asleep from a lot of fatigue   The source of my greatest revelation is Opera   When I discovered that she had struggled amid all the odds she had experienced   Nothing stopped her from achieving her goals   This was very inspiring for me at that time   I've always loved Oprah and she's my inspiration   The first cosmetic product I liked very much was the eyebrow forceps   I know this is strange but I was very fluffy   My favorite product was the Revlon hair clippers   But I later developed it and bought a pair of luxury brands like Twizerman   If you start with the brands of Drextor like Revlon   To remove thick hair between my eyebrows   And Sharabi   And the beard of the goat   Although I did not realize then that makeup would become my profession   I was obsessed with him   When I was fourteen, I drew the eyebrows of my sister and her companions   They were eleven years older than me   So be in college and I'm in high school   Fuld I have a love for make-up, I liked the idea that I can transform my fully configurable   When I was younger I always felt ugly among pretty girls around me   I thought it was nice to be able to transform my makeup   This was very fun and made me feel beautiful   I have always loved makeup even when I was working in other fields   I was getting out of my job and going to make my friends makeup for free   I used to make makeup in fashion shows that were held at the school and the university for free   After a period of exercise on makeup and after I returned from the Institute   I did not know where to start   My sister offered me the idea of ​​creating an electronic blog   Since I know a lot about makeup and beauty   I was surprised by the idea and decided to start it   I created my blog and this was my way with the participation of cosmeticians   My program was very busy   I woke up at 5 am   I go to work as a makeup expert from six o'clock to four or five   So I work on my blog all day   At night I go to parties to socialize   Then I went back to sleep and the program was repeated every day   I remember it was two months and I did not get a day off but I loved it   I was so tired but I felt that I was achieving my dream   I'm happy to let you do that. Many people have known me through my blog   Then I moved to Facebook, YouTube and so on   The blog also helped me to get to know a lot of great brands and people in this area   Some wonderful princesses called me and asked me to make their mugs   I was pregnant at the time but I accepted her offer of course   She worked on her makeup and her sisters for their weddings   The experience was fantastic and at the same time scary   I entered a huge palace and remember when I arrived that the butterflies were filling the place   The experience was great for me   And then moved on to make celebrity makeup   I made a lot of makeup but my favorite was Eva Langoria   Because it represents many of the characteristics of women ideal for me   It is wonderful, smart and powerful   Of course, I encountered some difficulties at first. It was not very easy   The biggest problem was material. I did not make much money   I did not fund my work like other funds   I have accepted to finance the brands I already love   This is the case since the beginning so far   He did not make much money   The first three years were difficult, after which I could help   I was earning about $ 1,500 a month and that's not much   That's why I came back to work as a makeup expert   To make more money and create my own brand   My sister also invested in the project   I invested about $ 6,000 in addition to the amount I saved   The other conflict I have encountered in my career is cyber bullying   I was twice subjected to extreme cases of bullying on the net   The bullying lasted about 3 to 4 months   I can take up this subject and how I beat it in another video   But this has made me stronger. I can say that I am grateful for my experience   Now I do not care about people's words   This experience was good for me at the end   I created the Hudabeauty.com site and initially named it Beauty 411   They would say to me "Hello Beauty 911"   They did not understand that I was referring to the information   We changed the name and became Hudabeauty to let people know that I was from his monastery   They ask me a lot about the reason behind the label and I answer them that I wanted people to know me   My family was very supportive of me and my business   They were the ones who left comments on the blog and were the first fans   My husband was telling me stories about blogs that started and achieved great successes   This encouraged me very much to follow up   I ran into small obstacles with my family because I was always busy and did not have much time to spend with them   I took my work very seriously and it was very important to me   They understood all this now and why I was so upset then   My roots were modest, my father was worried about my work as a blog   He did not think it would do me enough to support myself and my family   Do not blame him because the father instinct protection and care   But I always told him that I would someday succeed   My father was wonderful with me, which made me work harder and organize my life   I wanted to show him that I was strong and that my work was serious and would lead me to my goal   This was a challenge for me at first, you might get support from people you love   But others may worry about you and try to push you away from your destination   But in the end they understood it   The hard job in blogging is that you do not know when your business is booming   I was on trial for 12 months before I noticed progress   I saw a comment from a Japanese girl on my blog   I was very happy to see something of my dream come true   Girls around the world started to leave comments   This is what motivated me to follow up and work more   So I began to see comments from Oman, Africa and America   I've learned since then that my blog is useful and that I'm dealing with real people   I tell bloggers that it takes a lot of time, effort and patience   When I decided to release synthetic lashes I did not want to start it   But I loved to have the eyelashes straightened out and I was spitting it and shaving it   When I put it down I was getting a lot of positive comments   She told me that I could take advantage of this talent to develop my work   I did not get excited at first. I did not think that was what I wanted to do   She forced me to take this step and contacted the manufacturers   When I got a model I was excited about the idea   I did not have much money back then, so I went back to make-up to save money   But that did not stop for the project   She turned high to help and invested her money   I said "Listen, I need money to buy lashes"   "If I can not sell them and make money from them, I'll use them all and I'll give you money"   I said that we would succeed   We organized the project and worked on the theme of the cover and so on   Many do not know that I designed everything and participated in all stages   When we designed the cover, I wanted to be my eyes on it   You want people to see the product and know it right away   I entered my room one day, put on makeup and took a picture   Then I met with the designers and offered them my idea   Our work on the picture, colors and design   It took a lot of time but we finally succeeded   When we released the eyelashes, I wanted to be in Sevora first   My goal was Sevora at the Dubai Mall   We contacted some distributors and received a lot of rejection   I faced some bumps at this stage   Until you get to know another distributor before participating in this project   I was strong during all these stages and I insisted that things happen exactly as I want   We would have pulled out two weeks before the launch ceremony with just a few details   I did not accept to do things just as I imagined   But we worked on these details and were able to launch them at the Dubai Mall   And that happened overnight, it's true that the project requires a lot of time   But our product was the best-selling in the Sephora Middle East   That was wonderful   I was very sure that we would go out and sell our lashes   But many people did not take this seriously   I received a call in the morning that many people in the store were buying lashes   I rushed to the mall and stayed there all day   I was very impressed and I still feel the same gaiety today every time we launch a new product   Every time I see a positive reaction I cry affected   I do not usually cry but I cry a lot in these situations   It is great to see positive feedback towards your product   So I'm affected when I show you the new products on snaps and I'm also very nervous   Because we put all our effort and passion into our products   This is not easy, so we get very excited at first and then we are worried   What if these products are not welcomed by people   That's what I felt from the first day and still feel today   But I feel very happy when you like our products   I can tell you a lot of stories about my career   But the most important lesson is the ability to continue and overcome the difficulties   My sister told me when she started working with me she learned a lot from me   One of these things is patience and although I am not patient in matters of life   I was very patient in my work and struggled no matter what the circumstances and difficulties   I say to anyone who has a dream or a vision of the future to be patient and struggling for his goal   As a brand we always keep our passion and quality of our products   I wanted to share with you today a glimpse of my career not because my approach is optimal   But because I worked hard and missed a lot of obstacles to reach   Being a woman was not easy to prove myself as a business manager   The fact that my work quality is not very acceptable in society   I hope that I have redeemed you today through my experience and my advice   If you have questions, leave them in the comments box   Good bye  
 Hello my friends, I will introduce you today to the trick of spreading your eyelashes without the use of false eyelashes   As I learned, I love synthetic eyelashes   But today I will continue to prolong it without the use of artificial eyelashes or magic mascara   You need 3 items   The mascara   Brush-shaped mascara stick   Cotton   The first step is to use an eyelash moisturizer   My favorite is Dior   The second step is to lay a layer of mascara   This mascara is called the purpergen of Orkin Dykai   They make my eyelashes long and dense   The third step is to use a clean mascara brush   Open the cotton ball and pull a little cotton on the brush   I will begin covering my eyelashes with cotton   Now I will cover it with Balmascara to make sure the cotton is not in my eyes   I'll take the steps back to get a bigger impact   This time I will not let the mascara dry up   Be sure to pluck the cotton well to pick up the eyelashes   As Tren, the difference is very large between the eyes   I was told that I had to return the ball a few times   Make sure to cotton well or you will not be picked up by your lashes   It is a great way to get long eyelashes without having to install synthetic eyelashes   You can wash it with water before sleeping   I hope you enjoyed this video and I hope you will try this trick too   If you do, remind me in Hashtaq to be able to find and republish your video   If you like this trick, click on the icon and follow me on the snaps and snaps   Bye  
 Hello my friends, today's video is very special because I will tell you about the aesthetic characteristics of the products in your kitchen   If you follow my blog for a long time, you know that I was writing about a natural mixture every day   The name HP is named because there are lots of cosmetics in your kitchen cabinet!   It can collect you more than precious lotions   I brought with me my favorite natural products from the kitchen   Such as garlic, sour, potato and apple cider vinegar   Coconut oil, turmeric and aspirin   Today I will show you how to take care of your beauty with these simple products   My favorite treatment when pimples appear on my face is aspirin   This aspirin contains vitamin C and this is great because it will lighten the blemishes   This type of aspirin is not available everywhere so you can use plain aspirin   You can squeeze a little lemon acid with it   I will take one grain of it and I will grind it   I'll keep it in this plastic bag   If you do not have such a container, you can place it in a bag and grind it   I will open it now and it has turned into a powder   I will transfer it to a glass container   If you do not want to use the whole powder, take a little of it on your hand with a drop of water and put it on the blister   I will mix powder with water and mix your soup   I made a little foam but it was okay   I will put a few of them pimples and grains in my face and rub it   After rubbing it I will put a small amount again and leave it during sleep   Aspirin contains salicylic acid   And on a lot of properties that help to dry the pimples and renew the skin   This mixture is very useful for people who suffer from acne   If you do not find aspirin with vitamin C, you can mix it with citric acid instead of water   You know how much I love coconut oil   I recently dyed my hair for one reason or another, my hair never adapts to the dye   My hair is too dry after the dye and for this reason I do not dye my hair much   But since I dyed it, I know how to take good care of it   I learned this recipe from one of my friends she has been using for a long time and said it is very popular in Indian civilization   All you have to do is take a spoonful and place it in the microwave   Or you can put it in a glass container and a little water around it to melt   Then put it on your hair evenly and leave it all night   The next day you wash it and you get very soft and shiny hair   Coconut oil also strengthens the hair   The second natural product is sour   Cut the acid into two halves and put the brown sugar over it   You can use this mixture to lighten and peeling the elbow of the hand and ankle   Or you can use it to peel the face   It helps to peel the skin and remove dead skin cells in a natural way   It also helps to narrow the pores around the nose   I love using them around the nose, cheeks, forehead and chin   I learned from my mother the benefits of garlic for nail care   It's a fantastic antifungal and you always use it to get clean, white nails   Garlic also helps to strengthen the nails to grow faster   I talked about this method in my blog, which is to take a transparent donut and then cut garlic in this shape   Put the small pieces in the paint container   You can use this mixture to strengthen your nails   I usually put half a garlic butt and mix well   You can use it above or below the mask once a week or more   Do not worry about the smell as it completely disappears   Potato is one of the best ways to lighten the skin, I use it every day and leave it beside my bed   I know this is strange but I use it before I go to sleep   It helped me a lot to brighten my skin   You can use it when you wake up or at night before bedtime   Cut the potatoes into halves and all you have to do is rub them on the knees and handcuffs   This will help you lighten these areas   I also use it on the joints of the hand before going to sleep and even under the armpits if there is dark pigmentation   Velveta has extraordinary abilities to whiten the skin and tighten it   You can also cut thin sheets and place them under the eye   And called for 20 minutes and will work to lighten this area   The potato contains a breeze that renews and brightens the skin   If you want to use this mixture daily, instead of cutting it halves   You can cut the top and every day part of it down   So be careful to stay fresh   Apple vinegar is a wonderful cosmetic component, which I use for many things   Put some drops in a large container of water   I wash my hair after washing   If after washing it with shampoo and moisturizing, rinse it with water and apple cider vinegar   This gives my hair a lot of gloss and density   It also removes any residues from the lotions you have used   But be careful, it opens the hair slightly, if you dye your hair recently, avoid using it   You can replace it with sodium bicarbonate   Besides, I think it is a wonderful cosmetic component   It is also excellent for adjusting the level of acidity and alkalinity in your skin   If you have any skin care treatment and you are afraid of the reaction of your skin negatively   Take a little apple vinegar with the same amount of water   And dip in the cotton and wipe your skin   This will adjust your skin if you experience irritation or inflammation   Turmeric is my favorite natural ingredients   I eat Turmeric every day   Turmeric contains anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties   If your skin suffers from inflammation, this is the solution   You can use it as a mask for skin, whitening teeth and many other benefits   If you want turmeric blends, let us know in the comment box   I add that turmeric is not expensive at all, it cost me only about two dollars   Honey has many benefits and is also anti-inflammatory   If I have dry, peeled lips, always go to honey if I do not have another product   It will soothe any irritation, moisturize and remove cracks   I use it a lot during my flight because my lips dry up a lot   I resort to honey because it is easy to get   You can also put it on acne and pimples and will work to relieve them   It is a wonderful gift from the earth to us   You can use it for showers also especially for children because their skin is very sensitive   Honey as I said it is very natural and anti-bacterial   I will now make a blend that helps to enhance the freshness and glow of the skin   And to get rid of acne and skin rejuvenation   I'll take a tablespoon of coconut oil   I will add a little honey   Depend on the same amount of each component   I do not care much about quantities when I make mixtures   And then I will add a little turmeric   The mixture looks a little thick but when you put it on your face become very smooth   I will take a little turmeric, do not overdo it because it is sharp   I will combine the mixture well   It is best to put the quantities gradually   I will add a small amount of turmeric, do not overdo it because it may leave its effect on your skin   I lifted my hair and I will distribute the mixture on my face   I will supply it with my fingers and it is clean   It melts on my face because coconut oil breaks down and melts when I feel my skin   I feel it moisturizes my skin   I know that when I remove the mixture my skin will be fresh and beautiful   These macules work together to radically modify and improve your skin   I will leave the mixture for a while and then wash it with warm water   I hope you liked this video   Do

hey everyone I am here with Lisa Eldridge I can't even believe I'm here in the flesh with her I met her in San Francisco a couple years ago that's right I did we hit you oh yes we did of course how can you not hit it off with her and I was so lucky because I came to London and I was lucky enough to get her to do my makeup oh I've always wanted to do is Sophia Loren inspired makeup look because I love my kind of vintage looks and I hadn't had the right model and I know the hooter was coming to London so I said please come and be my model which I would my son everywhere I was honored that we extended our trip to hear back so I'm just going along with a white gel and this is mixed actually with a beige pencil so I'm getting that really 60s waterline you okay - yeah and then it'd be outer edge I'm going to do exactly the same as you can see I've already done the other eye this is something that was very much part of Sophia's signature look it's all about extending and opening the eyes so she one of your favorites so I love her and then the sixties I know in shoes don't you ever make up his net I'm gonna use actually a gel I was so interested when I was reading her book that she used to mainly do her own makeup I mean she started off when in the 50s when she's doing all the movies having a makeup done by makeup artists and she said she learned a lot from them and she took all the advice she could but actually she much preferred doing her own which a lot of those actresses did and that she particularly this look that we're doing now which is kind of from the mid 60's onwards was very much her own signature look that she did and that she always used to use a liquid makeup for eyes I think she just means like a black liquid and that she used to add a little bit more water to do the actual eyelids and then she'd keep it as it was just to do the liner and that's the reason she did that was because she said she had really really oily eyelids and at the time you know there wasn't primers there wasn't that that was the best way to do it because it really lasts didn't she was able to get this sort of payoff that she wanted so make it real looks like you've done I love Cheryl Cole's makeup oh yeah that was I was a lovely that I love the look that smoky and kind of natural but done as well yeah I feel like it like really created a really beautiful look for her so beautiful thanks so beautiful I tried to redo hit yeah what do you thought you ain't gonna do that next time I couldn't get it what I'm doing here is I'm just buffing over with a Paint Pot I want to get like an underlying shadow here cuz gonna be a lot of makeup going on here but this is like a cloud of a dark shadow just onto the lid I'm kind of building up slowly here so now I'm just gonna I'm still kind of priming with the eyes and thank you so much for not having your base on yet I know it we all feel vulnerable without it I mean you look amazing you're gorgeous I think eyes is a great way to start because you get really clean base then exactly you guys are very lucky to live in London and have some really nice shops I just feel like especially for beauty there's so many things you can buy there's just oh you're gonna have to show me everything you've been buying it's I actually um I went to a few stores and I really like like um I like spacing kay hmm and that's missin the beauty of pocket apothecary yes it inheres yeah but your studio is amazing oh thanks to do is amazing to me inspiration there whenever I'm not on shoots and I'm here I kind of have all my books around me and all my staff and like so ideas and relax here and I feel like it like I would just come here to like escape I'm like yeah girly yeah but very cool so we start doing liner now obviously this is still a mess cuz it's still for me it's prepping still cuz you're perfectionist but I'm gonna start with a liner so just close your eyes for me one second pushing this right into the the lashes to start with because this is going to get quite thick we're talking about 60 so yeah you're going to be I'm using this new liner which dries matte because I want that super high impactful black and I'm just literally massaging into the roots of your lashes so we can't see any skin right down there to get your eyes closed one second my love and then this outer edge here I'm going to be going on top of what we had there which was this white line so I'm just creating this flick out which is quite extreme and I'm just going to fill that gap in now before I go to the underneath and then I'm going to start to do the shadow I should I want to do on top so now I need to go underneath who does this is going to feel a bit weird cuz I need to draw a liquid line which is obviously is going to look a little bit crazy at the moment because there's no blending going on yet but this is to give it that authentic look take also a particular yeah the Queen is so tiny and then here I need to just bring that down and out because we've got this kind of this is the kind of section she used to have it was like a little almost like this white line that was drawn around which looks crazy but once we've got this all blended in and your lashes on you're going to be the full Sophia okay so now I'm going to start finally doing some blending I'm going to start by just lightening up here the little bit of a slightly shinier grey she did have this black line that she used to bring from the top of the liner I'm just going to map that out now I'm going to use a little bit of gel so it came literally from the top there and went along the crease and I love the brushes you use ot the masu cube all of them in the Kevin ik want all of them so how did you get into makeup um I feel like I've always loved makeup but my parents would never let me do it I really as a joke yeah as a job they wanted me to be like something boring like an engineer is the word still offers and you are yeah I study finance really which is funny cuz I'm doing she went to college and did finance yeah Wow yeah I mean personally I'm terrible from a business perspective a bunch of Heather but personally no comment yeah so then I ended up just after the recession my parents were like what do you want to do and I was like I really want to do makeup and they're like go go study this makeup I'm gonna let you then yeah and then just kind of became something yeah how did she get into it oh I started so young with it I got into it when I was about six and oh my gosh into just looking at makeup products not even putting them on I just used to love to kind of I just love the objects like squeezing the tubes and playing with them it's just better than toys you know it is amazing and then when I was 13 someone bought me a book about stage makeup and I oh my god is a real shock because I had no idea you could do it as a job and when I saw this I went oh my god you can do that as a job why didn't anyone tell you and you make up as a job but that's young especially cuz I'm those old those days old on it then cuz now people aren't 13 but like you know like 10 10 15 20 years ago people are not starting ah absolutely not no and it wasn't anyone like there was no information about it or you couldn't like you know you couldn't find out like now you can find out how to be makeup artist you really couldn't but I used to say to people remember saying to like the teachers at school I don't need to do maths anymore because I'm gonna be a makeup off and they'd be like what what is that sit down but I can see I can see the passion in your studio it's just yeah just so yeah it was like it was obviously I feel like I'm a up in my veins I don't know why but it was just there all along that's so awesome if you pop your mascara on okay so which lashes of yours would you like to do what fear oh I don't need it these are your favorites yeah there's my favorite let's see these they're very dramatic Wow they all go super dramatic Wow right I'd love you to put those on what we need to do though is because Sophia Loren used to it rather than glue them right down to this outer corner she used to slightly from about here out lift them so that little bit above the lashes on top designer it's slightly elongated as well they kind of finished there if you can do that so do you wanna do it like um like here yeah just slightly out even tiny bit towards a little bit there right there yeah oh I like that actually that's what she that was had a trick to give her that big eye look I feel like it's lifting my eye as well yeah it does it definitely lives so I always like to apply as much glue as thick as the band I feel like that's kind of like my general rule yeah to get really good yeah and you don't need too much you don't need to new little needs to be really as thick as the band and then just gonna drop in the same place so you said right here yeah I just pull out slightly just a bit I know it feels a bit weird but it was her trick we did that perfectly you wanted Ashley the lash right there is good yeah okay yeah see it just extends a little bit feel like lashes they've changed my life so when did you first discover that you loved false eyelashes so much it was 2004 it was um actually I remember seeing like an ad for mascara and I was like oh my god those lashes are so amazing and the guy was like those are not that's time I scare those are false lashes and I was like what yeah I didn't even know such a thing existed and so then I just started playing around and slowly got into you know creating my ads and then we used to go to like all these really great stores you know very like simple pharmacies to find them mm-hmm and then if you ever been to Japan no not yeah not yeah I really want to go you're gonna love it yeah I think Asia to be honest is like amazing for lashes me too I make sure these are even it look great especially cuz I know you have crazy OCD I when I make sure like normally I'm sure about the lights I actually really appreciate it cuz I've never seen anybody so picky yeah I think it's annoying no you look great okay okay so we're going to come back to eyes and finish eyes in a little bit I just want to start putting on some base now you've been very patient this is out here without your base on no I'm ready to yeh bathe get your base on for you I'm just gonna off this out I feel like base is one thing that whenever I see your work it always looks so natural look sad yeah it's my thing I get very fussy about having this even if there's I've got a lot to cover I want to cover everything that I want to cover but I have it looked like there's nothing on there and I'm you know I'll put on glasses where I can really see this I think it supposed to check that everything is buffed and polished and just so you've got that skin real skin feeling even if I've had to put on you know cover acne or whatever the signature I want that lovely this elder female sir he's cuz I had acne when I was a teenager as you yeah so I started cover I actually had it worse in my early twenties and I did as a teenager says get us a beautiful I was really you know having to cover it and I was just you know working in the industry he's just getting into working in makeup so you can imagine how awful I felt having this acne on my face so I had to get really good at totally covering it without looking like I had any makeup on and I was always spending ages like concealing all my spots in the morning and I think that's kind of what made him he get good really good at it I always feel like it's those things that are personal yeah there are less like I was ugly duckling in my family that's why I became a sense of makeup I swear I'm not sure the rest in look like you're the only duckling god I have very bad photos at a poop that I would you go you go to sis DISA's yeah but I feel like it's sometimes those things that are not so good that actually when you conquer them they're like the best thing for you mmm cuz your skin like I this is what I knew you were gonna do then you're gonna get beautiful skin there you're like no more I love to do them guys let's do concealer now you've mixed up your because you love cuz you already owe me to buy it um why don't do it no I don't wanna play obviously I don't notice a feel the runway it's the feel around my well mine is like very drag it's like Kirker you've got your I'm gonna go highlight the center of your face because really mean you have already got the Sevilla and bone structure but for those you haven't you're not so blessed where you highlight this whole area it does give you a bigger cheekbone look so now I want to finish underneath your eyes so I'm just gonna blend this line that we put on earlier on now I need to do lots and lots of mascara on the lower lashes so this is a really sixties thing that we need that kind of almost not pluggy obviously but really kind of super things I guess yeah that's good I'm just going to brush the end that one all the way along it looks great I just want to buff over a slightly warmer she didn't really do a lot of color on her eyes Saphir I mean it was very much part of the time anyway that people mainly wore black on their eyes but even later on she's still stuck with those grays and occasionally a purple in the 80s but mainly they're kind of neutral shadows so for brows for Sophia's brows I'm going to do yours hers were kind of they were thick but they weren't really dense and she really emphasized that by kind of drawing very very individual lines and almost having them kind of up the whole time so I'm going to do it you've got beautiful brows I'm going to use this pen which will keep those strokes light so we get more of a natural kind of Sophia look and you're drying the lines yeah I'm just drawing lots of really small feel the hairs so we get them kind of filled in but when I'm going to gel them hopefully we'll still get separation which is what I want to achieve if I can yeah I noticed her browser like little lines yeah well she did used to draw that that is the Sophia look was that a sixties thing or that was just her hair it was her thing I mean you see it more on her than anyone else I mean that's just how she liked them it's kind of like what I see on Instagram now there's a tattoo that everybody has separate line yeah see everything comes around again it's still inspiring I think she'll always inspire I think so she had a guy like nobody else and then to get that so fear effect lots of gel I want to kind of separate them and have them go just like Sophia's we're really separating them yeah so I'm actually going to use a liquid highlighter although I'm going to sculpt and things with powder simply because I read that Sophia love to use lipstick on her cheeks because she liked the shine from it so she always used to put a little bit of lip stick high on her cheek to get the shine so I think this will kind of give us that effect I mean I love that I love how you mix everything yeah mixed a plat miracle with opal Becca opal so I think that's a very nice shade for you so I'm to do a little bit of sculpting here for those Sofia cheekbones which you have anyway so now I'm going to do some bronzer everywhere just to warm things up because Sophia does like her tan and she often said that she liked to get a tan and then she didn't have to wear any foundation and then if she did wear foundation she only liked to wear it where she needed it so like not all over so she was very much into that kind of natural tan look fellow Birgit p.m. I'm just going to put a touch of a peachy blush on Sophia didn't really wear a lot of blush but just that little peachy glow hi onto the cheekbones your accessorize lipstick yeah she used to wear the lipstick so it was a shiny blush hmm probably looks great with her tan - mmhmm yeah really highlight of bone structure yeah um now I know I always overlined my lips but you told me I'm not allowed to do that I know how to do because Sophia and did not over line her lips she had very full lips like Ewing radio you can do them a tiny bit but not too much to do a little bit on the Cupid's Otesaga yeah just a little bit yeah oh yeah no she you could definitely see that she lined them I've got in all the shots for sure she just didn't go kind of over the lip so much why I'm going to go quite nudie with the lid obviously cuz 60s and also you always saw of that incredible beige mouth against the really tanned skin which I love I think you're kind of done who do I think you've got your your look or I think you're so feeling this you definitely need some diamonds I can't be so fear without diamond okay let's see the diamond daddy you look beautiful hooter thanks for coming 
 Hello my friends, I am very excited because after a week which is on the 13th of October   We will broadcast directly on the site and I am very excited about it   You may know that we sell our eyelashes in Middle East Sefoura in 41 stores   It is amazing that we are always among the best-selling brands even though we do not only call the lashes   So I'm very excited to launch our brand in Sefura United States   The first step is to launch it on the sevora site and then move gradually to the stores   The first store to launch lashes in November is the New York Times Square   As I will launch it at the store, which is located on Unin Square Square in San Francisco   And in Villaggio in Las Vegas   After that, the expansion will be slow   If these are the stores we will start with and do not feel the joy of coming to this event   I was born and raised in the United States and I always meant a sevura store there   I found this step very appropriate   Since we were deployed in a new place, we decided to change some details   We will launch some designs from the core group and add new designs to this collection   I will start with the first design, it is eyelashes "Gazelle"   I am also excited because we have modified the way of packaging   It includes the same image that was before but became at the backend   This became the front end   It includes lashes and transparent packaging that allows you to see the design   If this is the first design "Gazelle"   Which we launched at the outset, has not changed   The second design is "Claudia" which was also in the core group   The most natural eyelashes in the group are "Gazelle" and "Claudia"   If you want the effect of thick eyelashes without looking artificial, the resort to the design of "Gazelle"   Not too long and their hairs are not tangled   It mimics the shape and length of natural lashes   Claudia's design is also smooth but its bristles are intertwined, giving you the smoky effect on the line of lashes   Now I will start with the most dramatic designs   Samantha's design is a pair of eyelashes stacked with three-dimensional effect   We launched it last year, it's beautiful eyelashes and dense   The capillaries are of varying degrees   It is suitable for those who want their eyelashes to look as if they are using a distinctive sarma or mascara   Or they want to show that they put artificial lashes   It is one of my favorite eyelashes, I can classify them between natural and dramatic lashes   Depending on the shape of your eye, it may look very natural or dramatic   I have already seen the design of "Gazelle" "Claudia" and "Samantha" because it was the first eyelashes launched by Huda Beauty   As for the new eyelashes to be launched   We talked a lot about Scarlett's design, you might have seen it   They are the most dramatic eyelashes in the group   We designed it because so many girls liked the lashes   I thought I liked the lashes and sometimes I do not want to put mascara or artificial lashes   So we launched this design which does not need any addition   We received messages from dramatic lashes, saying they were the most beautiful eyelashes ever   It is suitable for those who love eyelashes, if you are not ready for such intensity and length do not adopt   I saw them put them without any eyeliner or shade and looked very beautiful on their eyes   The following design is called "Carmen", it is very impressive   It is very sharp and dense at the roots but its fluffy limbs   These eyelashes are similar to the mink eyelashes that we previously launched   But its bristles are artificial and so are all the lashes we will be launching soon   If the capillaries are made of artificial fibers as their fringes it is natural cotton   It is very fluffy, I hope you see it well on the camera   Their bristles are not too long, making them suitable for those who do not like super-tall eyelashes like my sister from us   These eyelashes look wonderful on her eyes   The following design is also my favorite and is characterized by long hairline   The name of these eyelashes is "Lina" by number 10   Trane is also shaped round and the whiskers are very long when the center does the limbs   You will look very pretty on who enjoys the very visible eyebrow glands   Its thick bristles give it a lot of density   The last design of this group is probably my favorite   I always describe each design as my favorite because we designed each one individually   The more we launch a new design, the better   Name these beautiful eyelashes "Sasha"   They consist of contrasting bristles but are not very dense   When they see a similar design in other brands they expect this to be very thick   But they really like it not so much as they expected   It is very smooth and fluffy and its whiskers are relatively long   Making it suitable for those who prefer moderate to long lashes   It may not be ideal for those who love short lashes, but they are very beautiful and they are number 11   If this was the last design of the set to be launched in Sefora   I am very excited about their availability in the United States and I hope everyone can experience it   Please go to Sefura to try it out. I've received lots of positive messages from people who tried it   I have read them all and I am very happy to thank you very much   I hope you enjoyed this video about the lashes we will launch very soon   Do not forget to subscribe to the channel and click on the icon   Good bye  
 Hello friends, today's social networking sites are filling a new hymn for poetry   I loved it so much and it was time to try it out   It is a small cake on top of the head   The rest of the hair is coated with light curls   I'll show you how this hairstyle works today   I will begin with my smooth hair, and the first step is to separate the upper part from the rest of the hair   I will divide my hair by following the eyebrow arch and think it is the perfect way   If your eyebrows are straight, you can make hair bands from the back of the eyebrow   Make sure the line is straight, you can use your nails or with a brush   Now I will judge it with the forceps of the hair   Turning now to the other part of the hair, I will use two different radios today   The first one is about 5 centimeters long and the other is two and a half centimeters   Their size does not matter as long as one is wider than the other   Now I'm going to twist my hair, I'll use my turntable alternately   I will start with a thick waistcoat because I want wrinkles to be wide   When I finish I will tie the clipper with a hairpin to the top   This will help me get better wrinkles   Now I'll take another tart and use the smaller turf   To install the thread, I use these pins, it's excellent and I think I bought it from the Amazon site   I will now complete the rest of the hair   If you have two sizes of turquoise this is good   If you only have one, all you have to do is leave some cords tangled up for a longer time   The threads began to fall from this side   I will first start by dropping the knuckle that you left on top of the head   I will begin to peel the tail from the back after it has been cut   Usually I use a comb but at home   So I will use the regular brush   Then I'll split the middle section, but I'll leave the front section without undoing   Then I will comb it backwards   I will use a rubber band to tie the knot   And then I will make up the rest of this tangle as well   In order to make hair denser I will add synthetic hair follicles   It's a Bellamy brand   I will begin to peel off some of them   I will now start to undo the waist that I have wrinkled   Now I will pass my fingers a little bit harder   You can use flat turf and pass on the chisels to alleviate the creases   Now I'll shoot a little of Sabri from Kevin Murphy's Strong Hold Texture Mist   Now I will add the hair follicles   I will escape the knot that I attached to the top of the head   I will pull it in this shape to get some density   The last step is to use a little powder to cover the hair follicles   It's a F-brand and sold in my sister's salon   I will fill the blanks at the front of the hair   I have finished   This hook has been very popular lately   The upper knuckle can be adjusted and made into a cake shape   But I prefer it more   If this is my favorite hairstyle now, you can adopt it in the day or night   Whether at work, in the mall, or in a nightclub   I hope you have enjoyed this video, do not forget to follow up on Instagram and Snabchat and meet  
hey everyone so there has been a new trend that has taken over the internet and I'm not gonna lie I don't like it it's called non touring so it's basically kind of like this really bronzy non contour glow a lot of highlighting it doesn't swim your face which is something that is a little uncomfortable for me I tried it yesterday it's almost like a natural contour and a lot of highlighting but I thought I was a tutorial on it anyways let you guys be the judge so there's two basic ways I like to seen on touring as you can really go completely out natural very little foundation or BB cream and just by a little bit bronzer and a lot of highlights or you can kind of wear makeup a normal way with a lot of makeup but keeping the contour really really really nice and light and going heavy with the highlight I'm going to show you guys the second way which is the version I would do essentially it's the same thing I just like a little more coverage the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna grab a blending palette because this is going to help me kind of control everything and keep it really natural I am gonna do a little bit of color correction because I think no matter what color correction is key it actually keeps you from having to put a lot of product on do you guys watch my masterclass you would probably have seen that other correction just keeps everything really really nice and light it what it does is it cancels out the color without putting on gobs and gobs of makeup so for this I'm going to use this new Tarte it is called the wipeout color correcting palette and I love this I love this these orange colors are actually fantastic for dark areas and pigmentation I'm mixing this orange color as well as this kind of peachy color and I am going to apply a nice about my brush I'm going to put some on my palate kind of get everything off and I am going to just apply it around any areas where I have dark pigmentation so around my mouth this area here and by doing it like this I'm getting a really light melt I'm also going to apply the same color under my eyes for the dark circles if you don't have any consider yourself very lucky I didn't have any before so you may still get them just joking so you can see it's a really small amount but it's gotten rid of everything and if you want to skip concealer because you've applied a corrector it's actually not a bad idea especially if you're going for a very natural look this is the I think it's called wanderer Blender I got this one a deporte I really like it I'm just kind of tapping in all the makeup to make it look very skin-like this is a really great foundation for this type of look where you're going for very very natural skin this is the rainforest of the sea I love this auditions from Tarte and you guys may have you review this on my snapchat I'm just gonna play it really light them out on my skin if you want to use a BB cream you could totally use that I just like something to even out the skin tone I am going to use just a little bit of corrector just to correct some areas as a cinema secrets corrector and if you want to go super natural you can totally skip the corrector okay and as you can see this is my face without any basic contour this is just a natural contour my face I personally feel that when you apply foundation on your skin and it's totally true it actually looks very flat so you need some dimension so I am going to of course add a little bit of contour this is the Anastasia contour kit this is the cream contour kit in light Clair's I actually like this one because it's a little cool and I'm gonna go ahead and start contouring just a light amount in the hollows of my cheeks and I'm just kind of mixing up these dark colors and we're going very light with this contour so I'm literally just taking it applying a small amount and going lightly across the forehead you can do a little bit of correction here but you're really not going strong I'm just gonna blend it out and I do have a little bit of a natural contour but this is just emphasizing it and this is great if you have some cheekbones if you don't have any this trend really sucks like I like to actually slim my face so this for me is not the best okay I'm gonna grab a little bit of contour and put it along my jaw as well just a little bit so awful I hate it I really do hate it so uncomfortable without my contour it's bad trend created by supermodels thanks supermodels for any thinking of us common folk I'm gonna add a little bit of contour to my nose just smell them out I'm gonna blend everything out to almost is non-existent now I'm gonna go ahead and just fit everything really lightly with the powder so I'm just gonna grab a fluffy brush and I have a really small bat powder I am just pressing it into my skin just basically setting it so the makeup doesn't move and the last step of course before we move on to lips is to really kind of make sure that the highlight is on fleek this is the champagne palette from chocolate he'll love this palette and i'm adding some highlighter and this is really like the main focus of the nan tour so you can see the contour is a lot lighter and you just have highlighted your cheeks i am just going to apply a little bit of blush just using a little bit of toothpaste this is the flesh and I love these blushers are so pretty just a really small amount this is the bombshell lip contour from henna beauty and because I didn't bake I'm not going to really apply too much heavy makeup on the bottom of my eye because I don't want to smudge it needs to be something that's wearable for a long time so I'm just going to use a little bit of eyeshadow on the bottom this is the shadow Couture palette from honest as I'm just using Morocco and I didn't get a bake so I can see a little bit of creasing with a concealer so you really want to keep that concealer really light this is the juicy shaker and piece of cake 2:01 so as you can see I finished everything um it's a very light makeup not very comfortable with this I hope this trend goes away really fast and to be honest I'm not going to take part in this trend at all you can see my face just doesn't have a lot of structure I kind of feel like I just want to take my hair and do this this is a trend I think it's great for supermodels it's great for people who have very chiseled jaws and and great cheekbones but if you're a commoner like myself you know you need something that's going to help thin your face contour your face we'll do a split screen afterwards so you guys can see the difference between the non tour and the normal contour and you guys can pick which one you like more and comment down below let us know your feedback I hope you guys enjoy this video please make sure you subscribe check us on Instagram and on snapchat and we'll see you guys next time bye guys you you

 Hello my friends, I am very excited to be the first to unveil the autumn collection of Nares in the Middle East   They include great new products such as Camascara   They have a lot of new and distinctive products to be launched soon   I will speak quickly about it all and see that I try some of it on my face   Because I'm not putting a lot of make-up   I finished the face makeup and put the gels on my lips and it is from the new autumn collection   But I do not put any other product on my eyes   If I complete my mikey by these products I give you a preview of them in addition to quick makeup   The first products are these Glow pens and I have two of them   This is its name "Baby Doll", it is a bright pink color   And the other color is very beautiful and I now put it on my lips and called "Chelsea Girls"   It is a fresh pink color that is shiny but does not contain sparkle   It is very liquid and saturated and I think it is a wonderful color   I am obsessed with them, especially the Chelsea Girls, which I consider necessary in my group   It is the glamor of Turcch Delight, one of the best selling colors in the previous collection   It is a calm apricot color, a color that everyone loves   Now turn to these pens, they look great on the website but when you try them yourself you will love them more and more   It's a velvet eye shadow pencil I've seen on the Sevura website and I think it's available at Seafura stores in the Middle East   It is very beautiful, very stylish packaging and is in the form of a pen   When used, they will be astonished by their versatility and ease of use   They are also very saturated as trek and last for a long time   I loved her as soon as she tried   I will use one of them now, I chose the color of "Gades", some of these colors are necessary for your group and you should acquire them   Other colors may not suit you, but some are essential for every woman   "Gads" and "Hollywood Land" are essential to me, and black is also very impressive   I will mix the two colors first, I will start with "Hollywood Land" and put it on the whole eyelid   I put this shade in the morning and removed it because I wanted to use it in front of you   It runs very smoothly and is very saturated and easily integrated   Now I will use the black shade that can be used to make Smokey eyes   I will draw a winged Illiner by him   I put some points on this area only   Then I will use the brush of the dome of the head and I will merge it outward   This lock is suitable for school, work or any ordinary day   It is very easy, it only takes me moments   I adopted this morning, I was in a hurry because I took my daughter to school   I loved him very much so I decided to show you how he works today as well as a preview of the new Nars group   Usually when I show you a preview of new products, do not express my opinion of them   But I had the opportunity to try it and I was very impressed   You can use your finger to integrate this product because it is very smooth   Can not commit any error because it is easy to use   I will also extend the lower eyelashes line in a light way   And then combine it with the brush itself or even by finger   If you make a mistake you can correct it with the light shade   So you get a quick and easy lock   Last but not least, I am very excited about this mascara, the brush is characterized by rubber limbs   When I see her I think she's working on lengthening her eyelashes   It may also be useful for thickening eyelashes, but in my opinion it works to prolong them further   I have not tried it before and I will do it now   I noticed immediately that the bristles of the brushes pick up the lashes and pull them out, giving the density and length to the lashes   If you look closely you notice that their hairs vary from long and short   What makes it perfect for lengthening eyelashes   Test the composition for a longer time to see how long it lasts   But she liked me and I think it is excellent for lengthening eyelashes   If these mascara is ideal for those who are allowed to lengthen their lashes   For its intensification, I think you should put another layer of it   I liked it a lot, I think it will be a success   May be the best mascara they have launched so far in my opinion   I hope you enjoyed this quick assessment and make-up   I have to follow up on Instagram and Snapchat   Bye  
okay guys I am about to teach you how to change your hair forever a lot of people have been commenting they've been saying oh my god your hair look shiny your hair looks so healthy just keep in mind I never got these comments before my hair used to be so dry and damaged I wouldn't even need to go outside and it would fluff up and by fluff I mean frizz up so I basically start to adapt a new technique and washing my hair which is very unconventional but it does wonders not only does it make your hair super healthy it also just makes it easier to work easier to style everything looks better and it's super shiny one of the PR companies in Dubai reached out to me a long time ago it was around the time when I started highlighting my hair in case any of you went through that period with me not so good it was amazing in the beginning but my hair just became super dry started breaking off brittle lost the such high and didn't even have that much shine to begin with it was a catastrophe they sent me the abundant volume shampoo from alterna and it was just the best thing that I have ever used I didn't know shampoo was that important until I actually tried it and recently I've become a loyal alterna user I told my team to reach out to the team in New York and they sent me a hamper products and asked me just to do a video on how I use them so I'm gonna give you guys some tips on how to wash your hair I am not kidding try this once and you will love me first thing you're gonna do before you take a shower is you're gonna brush your hair I'm just going to go ahead and make sure there's no knots because if you brush your hair in the shower it will break water makes your hair so brittle I actually don't shampoo my hair first I take the conditioner this is the caviar anti-aging replenishing moisture conditioner this is very moisturizing so if you don't like a lot of moisture just go ahead and apply it to your ends I personally don't apply any conditioner here because I need a lot of volume so what I do is I go ahead and I squeeze a nice chunk out and then I just run it through the bottom of my hair and I let it sit there for a couple minutes next while I'm in the shower after my hair has been a little conditioned I will take a little bit of shampoo this is the moisture intense oil cream shampoo the reason why I like it is because the low lather and for very dry hair if you don't want anything dis hydrating you can use their volume abundant shampoo I love that as well so you can start with a conditioner first let it sit for five or ten minutes or even three minutes that when you're in the shower and then just take your shrimp I usually like to fill the palm of my hand and then I put it on my hair and it's really important you don't pick up your hair and just those things that we've saw in commercials we were little but it was like all the hair with shampoo Dover here you don't want to do that first of all it's really bad for you to rub hairs against each other you're gonna cause them to break so you're just gonna go ahead and apply a nice amount of shampoo to your scalp and you're just going to go ahead and work it in a circular motion starting for the front and going to the back what's gonna happen as the lather goes through it's actually going to just remove anything any oils or anything that's in your hair by itself and I'm going to go ahead and do that and then I'm going to show you guys the next step because the next step is really what I do to get in sane shine I have just showered and my hair is completely wet I'm gonna go ahead and grab the alternate anti-aging line and this is the three minutes shine boost and I wrote about this a while back on my blog and ever since I wrote about this I've used this every single time I shower this is incredible it makes your hair so shiny it almost like creates a barrier on your hair that just protects it and makes it so glossy and so beautiful so I can't live without this this is probably my fifth tube since I've written about it so I'm going to grab a small amount just gonna go ahead and put it on the ends this is a really lightweight formula it's not going to weigh your hair down and the next thing I will do is I'm gonna grab the bamboo candy aisle if you have not tried this and you love sleek and shiny hair and maybe if your hair is a little bit more on the curly side or just you want to fight frizz whatever your hair type is this is the best thing you want something lighter I also do like to use a kandi oil mist which does act like a frisbee riyer both of them are really amazing the kandi oil line is one of my favorites it's so so so good I'm gonna get two big globs of it and I'll just go ahead and start to work it into the bottom of my hair again so I'm gonna let this sit for just a couple minutes if you're in a rush you can leave it for even like 30 seconds in a minute and it will make a difference that so I'm gonna let this sit for about five minutes and then I'm gonna rinse it completely okay so I have officially rinsed my hair for the last time I'm just going to go ahead and start applying some products on this I'm gonna take it out so I'm just going to go ahead and again apply some kandi oil and this time I'm only gonna apply one squirt of it on my hair it's really just coating only the ends and I'm just gonna ply a little bit of finishing spray and I actually like to apply this before once I finish I don't actually like to put a spray on it only if I really need it but I found that when I sprayed it my hair before hand it is so much shinier so I'm just gonna go ahead and stop my hair and I'll be back and I'm gonna show you guys how shiny it gets so you can see I went ahead and style my hair and my hair is so shiny these products will make your hair so shiny so gloss and take it from somebody who's never had shiny hair literally my hair is just like hoarse and dark and not shiny this will give you super shiny super sleek and manageable hair guidance as soon as you can try at least one step in the process at least a couple these products and see what happens to your hair I'm sure you will love me so much more once you try this hopefully you guys enjoyed this video on how to shampoo your hair and get the glossiest most beautiful most manageable sleek hair ever and if for any reason you're maybe a little nervous to invest in all these products at once at least start with a kandi oil because this is awesome or the Kandy spray depending on your new hair needs but this is awesome and I'm hopefully later on you can definitely try if you like a lot of volume the abundant volume shampoo is just amazing please make sure you guys subscribe and thumbs up this video follow us

 Hello my friends, Ali suggested to the Working Group to create a special paragraph   "What about Huda's office?"   We get a lot of gifts and products as I buy lots of lotions   The first product I will talk about is the nail polish set that you launched with the Formula X brand   It has been on my desk for about a month   My favorite color is the one I put on my nails now golden pink   This color was a great inspiration to me this year   It was the color of my hair and from it I was inspired by the shadow of the eyes of Huda my beauty   I adore this color, named Baroque Babe   It has very beautiful colors   When you choose paint colors, you are based on golden and pink   It is a golden luster with beautiful pink pearls   The other paint is called Date Night, I wanted the color to be inspired by the autumn   It is purple with a little red   When you put it on your nails it looks different from its color from the outside   It tends to flush more   The last paint, I wanted Metallica black   We used black paint and added to it the luster of black pearls   I wanted to be named like my lifestyle now, since I travel a lot   The Jet Setter is inspired by fuel, oil and black gold   It is a beautiful color and is a wonderful Metallic black   The reason I worked with Formula X was that I loved their products very much   The paint is very thick and dries very quickly   I liked the composition of the paint so I wanted to cooperate with them   As the Tren beautiful container and brush easy to use   You'll know what I'm talking about when you try it   These products will be available from October to December in all Sefura branches   I miss them in the local branches of Sefora but I'm sure they are available in Sefura, USA and Canada   Keep her experience because I am proud of the colors and the composition   For those special place specials on my desk too, I was very impressed by the Telbore Charlotte   She is a wonderful person and a brilliant beauty expert   We have been in our office for some time and have known and loved her more   She is very interested in detail, and she designed the lipstick in a different way to facilitate the application process   This is my favorite Nude Kate   I think then Kate's color is in the previous group and it is also wonderful   This color is light and very smooth   The second Rogue is called Hells Bells, a beautiful purple color   I think violet make up is very popular now   I liked that his color is completely opposite to the Noodles   I turn to this oil from Farsali, I am very impressed by FarahDhukai We are publishing videos on Alastskram   You make wonderful crazy mixes and become famous   She collaborated with her husband to launch this oil   It is a light oil that easily penetrates the skin   Although it is oil it is not greasy   Absorbs skin quickly and leaves no greasy effects on the skin   It is a product that you can mix with anything   You can put it on your lips or mix it with eye shadow. Its makeup is excellent, you've done well!   The following product is Cover FX Custom Enhancer Drops   I loved this collection, this color for its name Candle Light   Frankly my favorite color is Sunset, a beautiful bronze color   This color is very bright and is saturated and its composition is wonderful   It is soft and light and does not appear to be piled on the skin   It's perfect for those who do not want to put a lot of make-up   You can put a little of it on the top of the cheeks and on the middle of the nose and the top of the lips   If you like a lot of makeup, you can drink it   Put a little of it on your hand and then raise it with your finger on the places you want to show more   You know how much I love these ballets, I know they are HD Beauty products   But in my opinion it is very necessary   I dreamed of it!   We have selected all colors very accurately   Her name is Rose Gold, part of the new collection   And of course I put it on my desk and in every corner of my house   I use it all the time and it contains all the basic colors of makeup   Today I used the eyes of my shadow Henna and Sandalwood and then I added the color Rose Gold on the middle of the eyelid   The latest products on my desk are the make-up brushes from Zoeva   These brushes are already excellent but I put them on my desk because their color is wonderful   There are some brushes that I consider necessary   This combination brush is great, it's like a Mac 222 brush   But instead of being as long as a regular butterfly, its shape is slightly round   Which greatly facilitates the integration process   It is also more intense that also helps to merge   As her head is slightly round, this helps to strengthen the color of the shadows   I like these thick brushes to put powder   If you do not like a lot of powders, you can use them to combine the counter or cream   But if you like the accumulation of powder like me this brush is ideal for this purpose   They have multiple versions of them so I like their brushes very much   They have other colored brushes which are also wonderful   If you want me to talk about my favorite brushes, leave me a comment   I will write about this on my blog Hudabeauty.com   If these are the products on my desk this week   I hope you have enjoyed, check out our website Hudabeauty.com   Do not forget to subscribe to the channel and follow up on Instagram and Snabchat and meet  
 Hello my girlfriends, I inspired today's brilliant Angelina Jolie   Sometimes I am told that I am similar and consider this a great compliment   She is one of the women who suits them with light makeup   It looks fantastic all the time, its skin is perfect   If you want today to show you how to get the makeup of Angelina Jolie light and elegant   Its skin always looks natural-looking and flawless and durable glow   I do not think I ever saw a pimple on her face   Her body is very specific and I think her facial makeup is comforted by her strong makeup makeup   Do not put a lot of hyalites or palachars but you love natural and soft skin   She adopts the winged Eleanor in such a wonderful way that she raises her eyes   It starts at a very high angle at the inner corner and becomes wider than the outer corner   This works to raise the eye in a wonderful way \   Her eyebrows are curved and beautiful, and this is appropriate for her square shape   This shape of the eyebrows harmonizes with her face and gives him balance   Of course, Angelina has his lips full and beautiful   You can identify the lips, draw and add the sill and you will get lips similar to their lips   If I start now!   I will not use lot of lotions, I will start with a thin but wonderful foundation cream   Rainforest Of The Sea by Tarte   I do not have the right color for me, so I'll mix two colors   The first is Light Medium and the second is the darkest color in the group   I will blend the colors together and make sure to get the perfect color   I will apply it with this brush from RMS Beaut   I used it in the Hoda school and I loved it very much   Now I will use the Fit Consil from Medium   I do not want to add too much hyalight under my eyes   I will combine it with the brush   Now I will fix my face with a little powder   I will use the Shade and Light from Cat Von De   I will take a little light color and put it lightly under the eyes   And little on the chin   And a little on the chin line also to accentuate this area more   Her forehead is wide and this suits her a lot   Now I will start with my face very lightly   I will use the pallet itself and take the color in the middle   I will start with the nose contour, and I will brush off to get rid of the excess amount   I will select it from the eyebrow   Since my nose is high, I will set it at the extreme and not at the bridge   I will set it down as well to make it shorter as my nose is long   With a large brush I will combine the contour so that the lines do not look clear   Now I will define the chin line more by the same color   I will set the angles well to get the square face effect   Now I turn to determine the bottom of my cheeks, so I'll start from the ear down towards the mouth   Her face is very specific in this area, I usually think this is a bit masculine but fits her!   And then I will use the Plywood Blender and it is dry, it is okay because I will put a lot of powder on it   I will take a good amount of light powder and I will put it along the chin bone to highlight it more   And on the chin as well   Now I will shake the powder   I turn to the lips and I will identify them with the ballet of the ballet itself   I will put the bronze on this area   Then I will set the top lip slightly   This will give a greater effect to the lips   Then I will use the light color to identify these lines in order to highlight them more   I will start with the lips to make sure they are in harmony with the rest of the face   I will use the Trendsetter lipstick from Hoda Beauty   I will begin by identifying the upper lip   I will not set the upper center of the lips because her lips are not very specific in this area   My lips look very big but they will look more natural later when I finish makeup   I will open the color slightly by foundation cream   Finally I will add a little bit of prudence   I will finish the lips later and start with the eyes   I will use Palette Eye Shadow Rose Gold from Hoda Beauty   I will draw a little eyesight   I will use Sandlewood shade, a soft bronze color   I will put it on the whole eyelid   I will combine it well   I will take more of this shade and extend it under the eye   I will then use Tartiest Pro from Tarte   I will put a small amount of it on these pallets   I will use a very small brush from Bobby Brown   I will draw a thinner Illiner   I chose this Eleanner because I want to identify my eyes and at the same time I want to merge it a bit at the outer corner   If ILLINER used liquid, the line would have been very sharp   I would like to merge it a bit into the outer corner to get Aliener a bit smoky   To facilitate this process, you can put small dots along the line of eyelashes and connect them   In order to avoid the sharp line   I put the lotion on the line of the eyelashes with the tip of the brush   And then I will merge it outward   I do not have any preparations on this brush, which helps me to alleviate it   I will extend the Eleaner towards the inner corner to extend the range of the eye   I'll put a little Perversion Mascara from Urban Decay   Now I will use these harmonic eyelashes from Hoda Beauty and are excellent for this look   It is divided into several pieces and is a natural appearance   I will put the glue on the can and immerse the eyelashes by using the forceps   And then apply it to the outer corner of the eye   These eyelashes are easy to use, so you do not have to measure or relax them   It is suitable for everyone as it cuts and works to raise the eye   I'll hit another piece beside her   I would not like to put eyelashes along the line of lashes   I will put one piece after it and I will put it in the middle almost and press it with my finger down   I'll let it dry a little before putting mascara again   I would like to squeeze the inner eyelashes down and outward upwards   Finally, I will teach my answers, Angelina's eyebrows are very curved   I will use the eyebrow pencil from Dior   I will set the bow well to become higher   I will incorporate the rest of the lotion onto the brush   To make the color less sharp at the inside   I'll have the stylus again and draw a line on the center of the lips   Some fonts are also here   Now I will use the Victoria Beckham bronze   I will put a small amount of it on my cheeks   This is a make-up inspired by the beautiful Angelina Jolie   It is a very fine makeup and I did not use many lotions   It is a linear-shaped display in the shape of a cat's eyes   The Contour has a natural appearance   I also worked to highlight the chin line more   And also identify the shape of the lips   I hope you liked this video   Do not forget to subscribe to the channel and leave a comment if you want more of these videos   Bye!

bigger outer lash and you know Venu Venu around present you curl the ribbon any jack curl on the area because right off the be the curl like lash growth you don't have all the lashes and one on the

then you put your face in water for like 30 seconds which by the way I'm something I would suffocate yeah like I don't like I guess I can just do breathing exercise this is like like cold water and cold water and then you stay for 30 seconds then you get up and this isn't whether either six looks I would I might I do I think because it's cold while he's closer to Boris and I think it kind of

okay so you can see here look look look you got a snap it okay so this is a good angle I don't think treating a celebrity is any different than treating anyone else I mean every time that I'm sitting in a chair I'm giving 110% of myself to give them the best possible result how are you as well everything is going this is very good so today I came to app esthetics I've heard a lot of really great things about doctor app' and I'm really hoping you can help me out with my teeth for me when it comes to beauty I mean you can look perfect you know head to toe but as soon as you smile and to me that's one of the most important things being a beauty connoisseur and also somebody who is been involved to be for so long my teeth kind of shifted a few years back and I've just been really paranoid about that and I know it's such a small difference and this is why I'm even more particular about finding the right doctor like my smile is like oh looks like a hillbilly smile no it's not it's not exactly the smile that I needed my selfies I needed my selfies are my business so it definitely something I would like to tell more I don't like how my teeth just look like that ones pushed back she was a case that she had great teeth to begin with there aesthetically very challenging because it's very easy to make them look worse I see what you're talking about and it's a minor thing that we can tweak with just a couple of veneers awesome let's do it absolutely and I immediately loved what he was saying so you just kind of had a quick solution just for a couple of my teeth and I was game are you gonna mess up my lipstick yeah when I finally saw my teeth I was so happy basically my smile was perfect and I was just I felt so good I was able to take pictures again smiling which is really more Who I am I I literally there's nothing that I can put into words to tell dr. app' you know my selfies are so much better so I am forever appreciative towards him actually she wants to come see you Mona no Lia both when I can see you they loved what you did actually the first time I got my veneers I was happy in the very beginning my teeth were white and they were all the same color which was great a little book me an appointment with her dentist to get veneers but I think about a year later down the line I started bleeding so every morning I would wake up and my mouth would actually be full of blood and it actually scared me so much of my issue the reason why I'm besides them looking horrible the other the other thing was they would bleed all the time but I even went for dental cleaning event couple days later they might with my teeth would bleed so I decided to come see dr. Ahmed because my sister Hooda was getting her teeth done with him and when I first met him I just wanted him to have a look and see if he thought that I needed my teeth to be redone he was telling me that I need to get them taken off ASAP because for health reasons they were really thick they were really big and and just and I felt like I look they look like horse teeth no really they were so horrible um honestly I do feel responsible for their having a health problem upper teeth I'm a very probe in your girl like I feel like almost everyone could use veneers you know because I'm obsessed with teeth and I love a perfect smile so for me I still feel like it did look better than her natural teeth but of course you can't compare her work to right now her teeth look amazing ass looks your natural are amazing very happy with them since I've done my teeth with dr. out but I haven't bled at all my gums are super healthy they're pink again and I don't have any pain in my mouth which is just such a huge relief very happy with them getting compliments if people say well they look real you know I don't look like I have veneers or anything they look so real and I'm so happy I'm smiling all the time now I think it's the same with any cosmetic procedure if you're going to do anything cosmetic don't do it unless you get it the best first number because you could make yourself look worse definitely choose the right doctor dr. APA's amazing I think when people probably have teeth are a little bit more dramatic in the difference that they actually go then it's obviously going to be noticeable like my sisters who change their veneers I mean their teeth are okay they're sexy now 
fun oh hi there we go one two hey everyone so today we thought we would try a crazy Beauty hack that we've seen all over the internet and I actually heard about this first from Bella Hadid I saw her a month ago in Dubai and she told me about this and honestly when she first told me I thought she knows like something was wrong or something was crazy about it but she swore by it and we've been seeing all over the internet recently we decided to try it ourselves I'm still not sure how I feel about it it's called gems ooh and it's a Korean beauty hack and basically what it is is submerging your face in water and that's the translation of the actual word jump it means that immersion so basically you put your face in some water you stuck it in once you're baking and apparently you're supposed to have like the most amazing makeup setting possible so we're going to give this a try I'm not sure how it's going to work so the Allison's not really I'm not into this idea I think it's the same I think it's like literally insanity but we're going to give it a try and Santa so it's supposed to be primer foundation concealer baking through cold water and make it perfection so we're going to give this try round so this is really great for people with oily skin if you have dry skin which I do you can do it for 10 to 15 seconds if you have oily skin you can do it for 15 to 30 seconds so it really depends on your skin type so the first time I do is I'm going to go ahead and put a primer on my skin I'm applying a concealer so now I'm just going to use a little bit of this Make Up For Ever foundation this is in one to two three let's go to go ahead and I'm putting it on now I like to cream contour so I'm going to go ahead and do that and I think it's going to be fine because it is a very similar type of feeling to what I've already put on to my face so it's going to match the base of the foundation so I can anything different I'm using the city color palette which is a really good price for this palette super great value at office on Amazon and I'm just using these two colors right here getting a small amount here and working it in and I'm just putting a small amount for the cod - I'm just mixing the two shades so just kind of using a big blending brush to make sure there's no rush marks just going to apply a little bit more concealer if this is the radius one cosmetics I really like there concealer this color is a little bit darker than the one I normally use from them okay just apply another more concealer now we're going to start with the baking and take a powder puff so I'm just going to go ahead and first start by make sure the concealer mark okay guys so I put my hair back so I can do this alright we're going to done ready guys one right up to - I don't want to do this I'm not very good at something it is awesome powder no I am wanted just thinking about you guys one is thinking about too much but all right here we go one two [Music] so this is the finished result and as you can see my skin looks almost like it's illuminated somehow it has like sucked some of the color from the powder and it's almost like scented to my foundation so I don't like that personally I think if I was going to do it again I would prepare for that and maybe I would try to find a powder that is more similar to the color of my skin or really translucent which is really hard to find because I feel like that powder was supposed to be like a yellow base but slightly translucent it kind of became just yellow on my skin and it really sucked in the color and also to get to this point of like really just powder skin it just seems so dramatic to like dunk your face in like ice-cold water every single morning it messes up your hair my brows are like less defined so for me it took a lot to get to this point and I don't know if it was all worth that you can see like this area here just doesn't look fine I have to like brush away a little excess with powder afterwards I didn't like this is like this is like the true definition of cake base to me and it gives you that cake base finish time I don't like it okay guys so I just had a chance to kind of put on more powder and you can see that the yellowness that I had before is kind of subsided and I think that's kind of held in part from the bronzer now that I'm looking at my skin my skin doesn't look as cakey it actually looks pretty flawless it looks airbrushed it looks amazing like it looks so smooth and I actually have like a lot of rough spots in this part of my face and it actually looks so blended it's kind of scary this is actually really good am I going to start dunking my face in cold water in the morning I don't know maybe I have to say one thing though I did have my brows on and I plan to fix them because I usually applied little brow and then fix it and I actually it was so hard for me to apply a brow product onto my skin so it kind of seems like because of the cold water like we're literally sealing the makeup into your skin so I feel like the pores of clothes the makeup is like inside my skin it's actually become part of my skin and that's also why it looks so smooth but in general I mean the application I've never seen my skin so airbrushed I don't know if this is good for your skin because if you think about it you're kind of closing the makeup into your pores essentially we're doing you're putting the makeup on your skin and then I just like close my pores with the cold water cuz cold water if it just basically shrinks your pores and seals everything in so I think the removal has to be better you cannot sleep with a makeup on your skin in general but this is going even worse so you really want to make sure that you're moving it probably with a little bit of hot water getting deep into your pores maybe using a little bit of like a clay based moisturizer so it literally pulls any product because otherwise I think it's going to actually age you and that's going to make you less attractive which is like the whole opposite of makeup this is actually really really really good it's a really good technique definitely I would recommend trying to especially if you have oily skin you're going to love this if you have dry skin you may want to try it as well but then just think about hydrating properly and maybe something that really works for you so yeah hopefully you guys enjoyed this video this is a super fantastic Beauty hack and I hope you guys get try to soften so you guys liked it make sure you comment down below if you guys have tried this if you want to try it what are your thoughts on this and this is there something better that is easier to use please comment down below and let us know because I would love to know it make sure you guys check us on Instagram snapchat and we'll see you guys next time bye guys [Music] 
 Hello my friends, I've been receiving a lot of requests for "make-up without makeup"   I was not excited to shoot this video because I like to put a lot of make-up   But since this is what you want, of course I will ask your request   In fact I was in London and adopted this kind of make-up   I will start correcting impurities and pigmentation   By the Conseller   The problems most women experience are pigmentation around the eye   And acne throughout the face   I recently used the specter of Spectrum from Zoeva   It gives me a lot of coverage with a very small amount of the preparation   Since I want natural coverage, I will use this soft brush   If you have a perfect color pencil holder for you, this is great   I mix some colors to get my perfect class   To get a more natural result, I will use Farsali oil   I'll mix a little of it with the conseller   I'll put a little of this mix around the eye   Every time you want to get a hidden makeup   I recommend you use your finger to incorporate lotions   This will give you the natural skin effect   You can use the plywood blender but I find that the finger temperature helps to better integrate   I will correct some impurities around the mouth as well   This console contains a little orange   I will put in places that I would lighten up more   Now I turn to the foundation cream and put it in a way that looks very natural   This foundation of Anastasia is called Tan Stick Foundation   I will put a little of it and mix it with my hand   I used a lighter color on the top of the cheek to light the area   The dark color of the contour   Most women do not need much coverage at the forehead area   I will take a small amount on my fingers and knees on the bottom of the forehead   As you can see I have a pimple here and a little blackness in this area   I will also use Conceler to correct them   I will use a small brush for this end   For the Contour I will use Ballet Esthetica Contour Series Cream   I will have this light color   I will also put it on the pallet where I have mixed the conseller   I will combine it with the rest of the oil to get a natural contour   So you define your face but in a light and natural way   For the forehead, do not overdo the counter   To add life and supply to the cheeks, I will blend a little of the cream with the bronze   I will mix the colors of Icon and Gossip Girl from Hoda Beauty   I will mix them and use them as a message   I think al-Balashr gives a lot of warmth to the face   I'll put a little of the heliter on top of my cheeks   I will use the Moon Dust shadow from Palette Hoda Beauty   It is very important that you use your fingers for this type of make-up   This will make your makeup blend well with your skin   I will rely on very fine makeup on the eyes   I always liked to put the bronze on the eyelid   When I caught this shadow, I wanted him to resemble the bronze   I think it is the perfect color to fold the eye   You can use Moon Dust on the eyebrow bone for eye lighting   For more warmth you can mix Chromatic Shy and Flamingo   And put them on the fold of the eye also slightly   As for the eyebrows, I'll start combing it   I will not pack it too much   My eyebrows are dense and I do not need much correction   If your luggage is light, you can fill it as needed   I'll have a eyebrow eyebrow from Ka Brow   For eyelashes, I like to look natural and soft   Therefore, I will lift the eyelid slightly to identify inside the eye by kohl   Then I will identify the eyelid with a little dark shadows   I think the shadows give a smoother effect than the Illiner   Now I will put a little mascara, better use the piston eyelashes after the mascara   So that the effect lasts longer   Many women are afraid that their eyelashes will break this way   You can use the hairdryer to clean the plunger   Be careful not to be too hot not to know your eyes   This mascara of Dior is called Iconic Overcurl   When I do not want to prove the concreter powder   Remove any excess mascara residue on the lower eyelashes   Turn to the lips, always resort to the pencil set lips   I think this is a very necessary step   I will put a little of it and merge it with my finger   I will also set it at the top   When combined, the lips look very natural   To finish the lock, I'll add a little bit of clumsy to the lips   This hook is very suitable for durability   If this is the final Look, I hope you have been impressed   Please do not ask me more similar videos in order to stay friends    Do not forget to follow up on Instagram and Snabchat and meet  
 Hello my friends, I will set up for you today the new shadows of Urbain Dickai   Named Smoky, this is the new version of the Orbain Dikay shadow collection   Orbain Dikay has always been at the forefront of the magnificent shadow palettes   They do not call it a lot, but when they do it is very distinctive   Especially these ballets, I was very impressed!   The colors match black, gray and other attractive colors   I also liked the transparent cover   I did not expect a different shape from the previous pallets   The cover of this pallet is made of transparent plastic. Unlike the above, you can see the colors inside   As I said I liked colors including shiny, silver and gray   Also include some cavernous shadows   It can be said to contain many basic colors   It is the most practical pallet of Orbain Dickai   The only thing I might change in this pallet is the shadow of "Blackmarket"   Its texture is as bright as satin, it would have been better if they had put a black matte shade in its place   This would have completed the palettes and made them perfect   But as I said, it's wonderful and I think everyone needs it   Even though you own other Orkney Orbits, I think these are necessary   I used it today to make up my eyes   I have mixed some colors   Such as the "Amor" shadow, a silvery gray color   With the shadow of "Hai", they are beautiful colors   I also added a little shadow of Dagger and Blackmarket,   I had to disguise the Eleanor to become Smokey   I would have liked it if Blackmarket was a matte black color   There are other beautiful colors I have not used for this look but I am excited to use it   The "Slanted" shadow can be described as blue-tinted blue jeans   There is a Desert Sweet radar, which is also very beautiful   I will put pictures of the colors on my blog but I assure you that it is a wonderful ballet   You will be competing to win these pallets on the Facebook page   If you do not yet have a Facebook page, make sure to do so   Because we will be organizing with Orban Dikai a competition to win a number of these pallets   Will be launched next week around the world   If you win this competition you will be the first to own this product in the world   I'm very excited about these ballets, I hope you like it too   If you have tried it, let me know   It has been received by a few people around the world, if you are one of them   You can visit my blog at the link in the information box   Where I will put you pictures and more details   I hope you enjoyed this evaluation, do not forget to subscribe to the channel and click on the icon of admiration   Also visit the link where you will find all the information and details   I hope you have enjoyed and met

Hello, my name is Huda from Huda Beauty and today I am going to show you how I contour my nose I get a lot of questions on how I contour the nose of my models and clients I will show you how to make it slimmer and smaller with makeup I love to use this brush, the bristles are not too long and they’re flat it’s like a concealer or eye shadow brush it’s from the palette Naked 2 from Urban Decay I am going to use a concealer lighter than what I usually use I am mixing the lighter colors and applying the mix on the sides of my nose this will create a pinched effect I am feathering out the concealer towards my under-eye area then, I am going to use the bushy part of the brush to further blend it I am now taking a concealer that is the same tone as my skin and use it to blend this area seamlessly Then, I am using this color from Makeup Forever palette 4 to apply it on the sides of the nose bridge I start from the inner part of my eyebrows and down to my nose this part is very important as it allows to shape your nose If your nose is a little crooked you can correct it with contour when I get to the center of my nose, I don’t apply as much as for the other side, I am drawing a straight line since my nose is a little tall, I am going to shorten it by contouring the tip with what’s left on the brush, I am going to shape it on the sides here If you have wide nostrils you can contour the sides as well I like to use this brush from mac number 287 to blend out the harsh lines I am taking my skin color concealer again, and a little bit from the lighter color to apply it on the bridge on my nose I am taking my concealer again with this fluffy brush to blend it out I am then taking this contour palette from Zoeva it’s called Contour Spectrum 816 I am taking the two highlight shades on a beauty blender to create a curve and make my nose look slimmer Before I blend in the powder, I am taking this contour shade and apply it lightly on the sides of my nose if your nose is already nicely shaped, don’t use the cream contour you can only use a powder contour if you have a lot of corrections to d it is better to both cream and powder contouring I do a lot of contouring to my nose I am then taking this big fluffy brush from Sephora number 57 and take my setting powder to blend out everything seamlessly finally I am taking this highlighter called Sleek and apply a little bit on the tip of my nose If you want to widen your nose, apply the highlighter on a wider part of the bridge and we’re done! This is an easy technique to transform any nose I love correcting noses with makeup I think it’s really easy and anyone can do it I hope you understood everything I said in this video it’s been so long since I made a video in Arabic, but hopefully more of these are coming I hope you liked this video, thumbs up if you did don’t forget to subscribe and I will see you soon

 Chris came in and found me like that   I lift my face my love and I always do this secretly   I'm a very fluffy woman   Hello my friends, Today's video deals with the subject of facial shaving   I do not mean to put shaving cream on and use the razor that men use   Many of the icons of beauty through history have degenerated into their faces such as Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor   The reason they shaved their faces was not just to get rid of the annoying litter   But also to peel off the face and get rid of scars   And to fight aging, and make-up looks better after shaving   I started relying on facial shaving a while ago and I loved it so much, I can not stop   Sometimes the faces of my customers are closed because the make-up is much better then   Today I'll show you the right way to shave your face   I have put a little make-up but I have not yet paid the contour   Because I noticed that I had to shave some hairs on the top of my forehead   I thought I would shoot a video on the subject   The first rule is to have your face completely dry   Your face must be clean, I know there is little makeup on my face but it is completely clean in this area   But make sure your face is not wet   I feel that when you wet your face and fly, the hairs grow more intensely   In fact the laser has been performed in this area   But as for the hairs on my cheeks and other areas, I shave them   To make my makiaji much better   You need to use a special razor blade   Do not go to the regular code you use to shave your legs   And those used by men to shave their chin   Use such blades   I have 3 different blades and purchased them from the Amazon site   You'll also find it on eBay   Now I'll show you how to shave your face   If dry, choose this code   The areas I want to shave are around the cheeks   And on the sides of the forehead   You can see a little lint   I do not like laser procedure on this area because it looks very specific and abnormal   Sometimes it looks like you're putting wigs   So I like the little shaving of the lint here   Without completely cleaning it to look natural and graded   I will start this area here with lots of lint   Do not move the code towards the bottom but upwards   Do not make harsh blows, but very light   If you do this for the first time, press on the forehead and pull it up   So that you can limit the area you want to contact   Because this process may stress you especially around the eyebrows   I lift the lint on my back   So cover your eyebrows with your finger first   After people love the capillaries that exist here, but I think it's a bit weird   Be very careful, take very light strokes so that you do not cut your skin   I have a little lint here but it never bothers me   If so, close the sides of the forehead   If you want to shave the tips of your cheeks, tighten your skin and hair this way   You have removed the sideburns with the laser   It was like Salafis Alves Presley but I got rid of it   But what I was doing before was pulling the hair up and doing the same light strokes   If shaving the face is very easy and very basic   Always leave this code in the make-up bag because you do not know which client you will need   So it is very important to be cleaned or replaced every period   If you use it on your face, just clean it, but if you use it on your customers, replace it after each use.   Or you can sterilize it well   If shaving is a very easy process and not a crazy idea as everyone thinks   If you have a sticky litter you can cut it but you will see it after putting makeup   Or you can treat him as I do Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor   I hope you have benefited from this video   Do not forget to subscribe to the channel and follow up on Instagram and Snabchat and meet  
 Hello I have just returned from Hong Kong and I want to show you the lotions you bought   You know how much I like to buy cosmetics   I will start with a product I loved for a long time and I am happy because I finally got it   It's the coolest product ever, you know how much I like red light therapy   This product is a mask that works for you within 10 minutes   This treatment promotes the collagen in the skin and tighten it   The next product of a Korean brand named Chosungah22 has been launched on the site of Sevura and they have many special products   Among these ballets are creamy shades that turn into powder   Its composition is a little strange, it is like sponges, but its colors are amazing!   I also bought lots of multi-brands skin care masks   Including the Karuna brand, I have tried for a while and know it is a favorite of make-up experts   I also bought somewhat strange masks, you know how much I love the snail grip   I talked about him in a previous video I have tried and liked very much   It is a 24 karat gold mask, which works to moisturize the skin to become luminous and fresh   I also bought nasal patches to remove black heads   You have tried it before and it is effective   I do not know what this is but I think it is a cure for acne   These are also for acne but I do not know whether they are good yet   I love Tolly Molly, so I got these moisturizers   And its smell is identical to the purpose it represents except the pandas and its smell is very nice   These have been sold to the staff as small packages of fragrance   This is theodont toothpaste with chocolate and mint flavor   I'm not sure what this product is from Tully Molly, whose name is Kiss Kiss Lovely Lip Patch   She also bought this lip balm   It is good but not distinctive   The following product is adhesive for cheeks   I'll try it, of course. You're supposed to put it on your cheeks to become pink and glowing   But should not you put the foundation cream? I think it is for girls who have perfect skin and do not wear the foundation cream   Then I have this product I do not know what it is but funny   His name is Mr. Smile Patch   You should put it on the wrinkles caused by the smile   Finally I have a eye mask and I think it will be very moisturizing   If you laugh as much as I do, you probably have thin lines on the sides   So I'll try this catcher to see if it's useful   In Asia, you find the best blackheads ever   This tool works with round head to peeling and purifying all impurities, pores and blackheads   When you visit the spa you may see that they use such tools after using steam on the face   I liked it very much, consisting of a needle on one side and a circular head on the other   But you have to be very careful when using it   I do not recommend you try it yourself but I know how to use it so I bought it   If I saw a previous video about my purchases from Hong Kong, I mentioned a head massager in the form of an octopus   This time I started a kind of massager   I like scalp massage tools because they promote hair growth significantly   The following products of Palma are radiant   Hair spray and dry shampoo and mousse   I have seen a lot of great brands like Lernberger Stafsing   And she bought a dry shampoo set, installation sprays and another soap   I used the glossy spray and it gave me a remarkable result as you see   I am very excited to use this Sabra because its packaging is very luxurious   It is supposed to fix the hair and give the gloss at the same time   I bought a huge amount of face masks, this is named Black Borel   Asians like pearls a lot and are inspired by their products   In Thailand they often resort to pearls in skin care sessions   This mask is named Panda and I do not know if it was good, we'll see   This catcher handles dark pigmentation around the eyes   It contains hazelnuts, green tea extract and licorice   It is known that green tea is excellent for treating dark circles   This mask is special for tightening the skin around the eye area called Q10   Contains Chinese Ginkgo Extract, Chamomile and others   When you visit Hong Kong you have to stop at Sasa's shop and buy all your products   I also have a herbivore, and an aloe vera   I went to a shop called Joyce Beauty, which is very similar to Space NK in London   This Perricone MD product is a dietary supplement with mushroom extract   It is supposed to be anti-aging   I also bought this food supplement that contains the basil   Basi fruit is the richest ingredient in antioxidants at all   The brand of Maybelline is available all over the world as well as L'Oreal and other brands   But I like it more in Asia and I consider it a product of my favorites for a long time   It has been valuable on my blog for a long time, it is the most liquid and everlasting liquid liner   Its name is Hyper Sharp Laser Precision Liquid Liner   I bought a lot of special hair preparations such as intense prawns and other great products   But the product that caught my attention so much and I consider it the best of my purchases is this Suavecito gel   It is one of the best products I bought for volatile hair   Its composition is very sticky but it touches all volatile capillaries   I use it a lot when I lift my hair but I think it is a product for men frankly   These are the most products you have bought from Asia   I did not see all the lotions I usually bought, such as nail polish and soaking up these gentle oils   I think everything in Asia is Zarif   This was my fourth trip to Asia in the past few years and I came to areas like Taiwan, Singapore and Thailand   I love this area, I love exploring it more and more   I hope you can visit Asia as well, so check out my shop Sasa's and Lane Crawford   And also my shop Harvey Nichols and Joyce Beauty   If you have visited Asia and have favorite products from there, let me know in the comments box   Do not forget to follow up on Instagram and Snabshat and meet  
 Hello my friends, I will talk today about my favorite products for September   I can not believe that October has resolved and approached the Halloween, I am very enthusiastic   I'll start with cosmetics   This Eleanor is my favorite and I have bought it for the fourth time so far   His name is "Tartest Liner" from Tartar   What I like about it is that it is very dark and its composition is very strange   It is in the clay structure used for drawing   The gel does not resemble Edda because it is very thick and looks like a paste that we use to paint paintings   It is also very saturated, spatially and domestically   It's my favorite Alienware   Leave him in the office and at home   He has a brush, but I do not use it because I always lose it   Here's a fact about me that I'm not organized at all   So I have to buy at least three units of each product because I do not know where to put my things   I think I have a surplus of products and purposes   The second product is the Rogers I put on my lips now   Me and my sister Mahoestan in this brothel, it is one of Orban Dikai's favorite group of fans   It is very impressive, I will evaluate it fully on my blog   This 1993 Roger is a beautiful brown color   Reminds me of the lips that were very popular in the nineties   These waves are excellent and it is enough to put one layer and you will get full coverage   The following product was recently launched in the United States but I bought it from Paris   They sent me lots of lotions and I hope I can try them all but I had this product and I loved it very much   It is a blackboard for the "Blackberry" brand number 1   Figure 2 is very dark, but this is excellent   Its texture is creamy, I'm putting it down now and you see its color as perfect   You can identify your face with it and then blend it well   You find a heliater on the other side but I do not use it very much but I liked the color of the lot much   Its texture is very saturated, I find in some other preparations that its colors tend to orange or beige but this is excellent for most skin colors   I also borrowed the Lorek Pro for the Contour   It's fantastic, I loved it because it includes multiple colors for the contour   From light to medium and thin   They also contain light colors for hailight   My sister also bought me and loved her a lot   Unfortunately I can not find them in many places or locations   I had to search for them on e-shopping sites and found them on the site "Alta"   The next hair product I wrote on my blog is the Extra Body Sculpting Foam   It is excellent and I use it after every shower   I put a quantity of it on my hand and put it on my hair   Start from the top up to the parties   I do this before I see myself and I feel that his style has become easier since I started using it   My hair became more lively and the wrinkles were nicer   I liked his way of keeping the creases and fixing them and the structure that he gives to my hair   The following preparation for hair also and its price is very low   The price is only $ 3 in the United States   It is a smooth and shine hair spray on polisher   I do not know if it is really good for the hair but it smells very good and gives you instant shine   It smells like delicious biscuits   Just sprinkle once on my hair and get a wonderful shine   This product also for hair, its price is a bit expensive   It is from Paul Rodin of the "Resin" brand of oil for hair   It is so wonderful and effective that you need only one drop   Does not make your hair look fat, but healthy and shiny   You can use it on wet or dry hair   It gives an exceptional result and I like it more than argan oil   I still use argan oil and try to mix them together   This amazing product, called the "Drank Elephant" is a night syringe   Contains glycolic acid which works on skin peeling   To get rid of any stains or dead cells and thus unite the skin color significantly   And BIDO like you put a light layer of foundation cream and so I liked a lot   Helps you get rid of dead skin cells and works to narrow the pores   I bought it from the Sefura site and want to buy more of it for all of my family   The next product is amazing and I think I wrote about it in my blog   It is a night oil called Luna Sleeping Night Oil   Its color is very dark purple   It works to unify the color of your skin to look healthy and young   It also helps to narrow pores dramatically   If you are bothered to choose one product between these two   I will probably choose this on a daily basis   And the other intermittently when my skin needs extra care   What I like about this oil is that it tightens the skin, and I've noticed it on the cheek area and the pores have disappeared   My skin looked more tight and beautiful   It contains avocado, chia, grape seed and lots of wonderful ingredients   The last product was nailed and I did not think it would be good but I discovered it was the best at all   It's the one from James Reed   All you have to do is put fat on your body before you go to sleep   To wake up in the best color bronze at all   Lots of other products leave visible scars if you commit an error while placing it   This nail is the best, spread on the skin easily and soft creamy composition   It is noted that its color is slightly orange so do not overdo the layers   I put it now and you see the color of my skin is soft bronze   You can put two layers of it, but I prefer light light   It is very convenient to use before going to the beach for sunbathing   I hope you enjoyed this

hey everyone so the other day in the hood of you the offices here somebody had an idea to do a coffee scrum DIY and I know I've done a lot of easy DIY scrubs but I thought I would bring it back to the basic coffee scrubs are super easy to do is so good for cellulite and it really helps boost circulation because of all the caffeine inside of it it actually decreases the size of cellulite by 17% that's crazy so I thought I would show you guys the easiest most delicious coffee scrub ever it smells so good you probably have all three of these ingredients at home already making it super affordable we just popped by a convenience store that we saw you know randomly and we found all those ingredients there the first ingredient is coconut oil in case you don't have coconut oil you can also use olive oil coconut oil just makes it smell so much more delicious the second ingredient of course is coffee and these are coffee grounds you shouldn't use instant coffee that's just gonna blend away and you're not going to get the right amount of caffeine and also the exfoliation you want without coffee grounds so these are just coffee grounds this is optional you don't even need this but I just like to use granules of brown sugar and I just think this adds a little bit more to exfoliation just these three ingredients that's all you need so we're going to go ahead and mix everything together I have a bowl here and a spatula so the first thing I'm going to start with is the coconut oil coconut oil is really great but you guys know also that it becomes a little duds just squeezing a nice can see it's pretty hard and this is actually cooking coconut oil if you can find regular cooking oil or raw coconut oil that's really great you can used to find that organic food store this one doesn't have as much of an aroma of the coconut but it's totally fine and I'm just going to pour a little bit of coffee in there these are coffee grounds and so my basic way that I like to do this is I like to put two parts coconut oil one part coffee grounds and a little bit less than one part of a brown sugar you can see I'm just blending this in together it smells so good now this will totally wake you up in the morning if you want to use this with your morning scrub you'll totally wake you up and for the brown sugar I'm just pouring a little bit in here the brown sugar is a little more rigid so that's why I like to mix the two it is optional if you like more of a light exfoliation you can use the coffee but the brown sugar adds a little bit more exploration this is such a beautiful scrub if I show this to you and if you guys can tell but it's such a beautiful luxurious looking scrub and having the coconut is such a great way to also hydrate the skin it will kind of stick to your skin as well really nicely and then you can see the granules of coffee and the granules of sugar which work so well together and this smells so delicious so I'm just going to go ahead and put on my hand try it out and you can see the coconut like immediately kind of melts when you put it onto your hand this is such an amazing scrub like it feels so amazing like an it did create a little bit of a mess and you can see I'm just going to go ahead and wipe this off I would normally rinse this in the bath and here the sugar dropping everywhere I hope we don't get ants the coconut leaves your skin so hydrated and so soft and so plump it's literally amazing the coffee and the sugar is just the most amazing mixture together it really does give your skin such an amazing exfoliation because you have like the small beads and you have the bigger beads this is one of the easiest most awesomest body scrubs you can use and if you want to store it you can just buy one of these really awesome mushi I got this from Muji it's just kind of like a little jar just make sure you don't keep it anywhere that's hot like on a windowsill or anything but you can refrigerate it what I probably better just leave it out like in the kitchen where it's cool the mixture will become really dense and really thick but as soon as you start lathering your body with it it's going to feel so soft and so Mae's extremely really just wanted the easiest DIY you probably have the ingredients down your kitchen right now great for cellulite great for exfoliation great for brightening up an evening skin so hopefully you guys enjoy this quick video make sure you guys thumbs up this video if you liked it and please subscribe check me on Instagram and snapchat and I'll see you guys next time bye guys 
 Hello my friends, I received a lot of demand to shoot my daily video   As I have learned, my miyaji changes every time according to the shouts, moods or even the lotions I use   So I wanted to make a video about my daily makyaji right now   Recently I like makeup with thick eyebrows, eyeliner and lots of eyelashes   I would love to have perfect, carved skin and wonderful hailight   It's like a hidden makeup even though I'll put a lot of lotions on it   But I will incorporate it so well that it looks very natural on the face   If I ask you to get this hook   I have painted my eyebrows because they require a lot of time and patience   If you would like to see a video about eyebrow education, I'll leave you a link in the description box   The next step is eye shadow, better to put shadows before cream foundation so get a cleaner result   I will use Ballet Rose Gold from Hoda Beauty   I like the combination of "henna" and "sandlood" as my favorite for my daily makayaje   I will put them on the entire eyelid even if I have not used the primer   You do not necessarily need Primer   If you have black halos, the latter can enhance the intensity of the shadows   Use this brush number 4 from "Wayne Goose"   These brushes are super smooth!   I bought it from beautyly.com   It is not cheap at all but I like it and deserve every penny   As you see, put the shadows on the entire eyelid to get the effect of the Smokey   I will combine it a little towards the bone of the eyebrow   I will incorporate it better later, but it is important to put an equal amount of shadows on the eyes   Sometimes I like to add more shadows and sometimes just enough   I will add today the shadow of "Anjelik" and "Mondast"   I will put them on the eyelid of the mobile eye with this brush from the Mac number 239   It is excellent for accumulating shadows on the eyelid   If I draw the color on the eyelid and mix it a little like this   Since I only put it on the eyelid, it is the cleanest shade I've ever put in   Not Chris Chris makeup, I do not like this type of makeup personally   You can consider this as a "Chris Cut" makeup in a soft and natural way   Now I will put the liquid aliner because its application is fast   This is the new Liquid Eliner liquid from Louboutin,   I love this Eleanner because it is very dark   I'll start with the outer corner where I draw the line a bit thick   I will draw the delinquent later   This Eleaner is very liquid so you have to adjust during its application   The badminton is a bit long so you should watch and tell   Feather is not high, you can not enter the corner of the eye   But they move perfectly with hand movement   Now I will paint the delinquent and follow the line of my eyelids   I love to be delinquent thick   Many people love the natural-looking skywalker Elaine and I think it is very beautiful   But since I am from the Middle East, our eyes tend to be round   I like to correct this rotation to make it look more drawn   So the best winged Eleanor graphic   But of course you can adjust it to your taste   Many also pull the eye by finger to draw the Illiner and this is a big mistake   The skin around the eye is very thin and prone to sagging   I did it and noticed a little sagging, so I would not recommend this at all   Now I will put the mascara from Orbain Dekay,   I love their brushes as they are very black   I will use these eyelashes called "Farah" number 12, I love it so much !!   I remember when I designed it, it was 12 pm when I finished   I could not sleep all night with a lot of enthusiasm   I'll put the glue now   I like putting the glue on as thick as the lash bar   Wait for the mascara to dry and glue   Better put the mascara before the eyelashes in case the eyelashes fall on any shades   I remove them by mascara   The glue has dried, I will put it directly on my natural lash line   And then press it to confirm its place   I will clear any shadows that may have been scattered under the eyes   Now I'll put Smashbox Primer Oil on my skin   I already put a light layer of it and now I put more   My skin is very dry   If you do not like putting a lot of powder, you do not need to put that much oil   I prefer to lay multiple layers of powders to keep my makaji throughout the day   I do not have time to rearrange Mikyaji and re-put the powder   I put a large amount of oil before make-up and when the powder layers merge with the oil, I get a great result   Now I will use our foundation cream   This is the secret foundation cream that we were concerned about   This is not the final casing it is still a secret   I will put it on his face with this round brush   I'll put it on my face but you can put it the way you want it according to the brush you choose   Integrates very easily   I like to start from the center of the face down   And then the rest I put on the forehead   If I have a lot of dark circles especially after traveling   Best debugger mode before foundation cream   Under the eyes and around the mouth where some lions may appear   Then I move to the foundation cream and then the conseller   You can use the Plywood Blender in the end to incorporate the product but I prefer to use the brushes   Because the sponge absorbs a lot of lotion   But it is excellent if you want to get a very natural effect   Because it will absorb any excess product on the skin   I'm just brushing myself but it's up to you   Now I will use the Sephora Bright future gel   This number is 11   I will put it under my eyes to light this area   I'll put a little on the chin as well   If your chin is great, do not do this   I will merge the conseller with the brush itself   I will now use Cover FX Enhancer Drops   It is painted "Sunset" and can be used as a color for the contour   By brushing herself, I will put it under the cheekbone   I will merge it upward   I will put a little on the forehead too   Some people prefer Contour Powder   I prefer the cream contour and then prove it with powder   What remains on the brush, I will identify the line of the chin   If your chin is large you can put the contour down to minimize it   Now I will fix the liquid preparations with this powder from Nares number 4   I will apply it to the skin with this round brush   I will put it on the Counter area first   Because this powder is a bit dark   I will use lighter powder Guerlain Beige pale   I will put it under the eyes of Aziz Hailait   I did not put much powder under the eye   Sometimes, depending on the makeup of the eyes, the technique of paking is adopted   Paking helps you to avoid the appearance of lines under the eye   If I wanted to adopt this technique, I put a lot of free powder under the eyes and left it fixed   For a few minutes and then remove the excess brushing   Since this is my everyday mazaji, I do not want to exaggerate   I'll just put a little powder under my eyes   Now I'll go to the hellite after I've fixed my face with the powder   I would like to put the Hellite before the Bronzer   I'll start with Melted Strobe   Put it lightly on the cheekbone   If you want a light, smooth glow, just do it   But usually I like lots of lighting and hailight   I turn to the lighter heliator named Seychelles   Then I will use this for the dark color as a brunzer   You do not have to use all the colors in these palettes, it's up to you   But this is my favorite way   The best use of the brush itself is to ensure better color combinations   Before going to the Bronzer, I will take this lighthearted conqueror again   I will put it on the eyelid of the moving eye   Now I will use this bronze from the Lorek   I also love the famous Bronze bronze from Bennett   Or Bronzer Victoria Beckham   I will put it in the contour areas and on the nose a bit   I will leave Contour nose until the end   I prefer to fix my nose with powder instead of cream   Because there is some warp in my nose   When I just powder it looks better in my eyes   I will put a few plashers on my back   I love Balashir, I think it gives warmth to the face   So I also put it on the forehead and nose lightly   I'll finish makeup now   I will have the shadow of "Sandlood"   I will put it on the bottom line of lashes   This brush is a bit thick and is the brush for the creamy shades of Sevora   I think it is excellent for extending the shadows under the eye   Then I will use a little "henna" shade with this brilliant brush from Wayne Goose,   It is number 20   Use it to blend the shadows well under the eyelashes   I will put a little mascara on the lower and upper lashes   To give more drama   Turning to the lips, I will use the Hudabeauty Trendsetter lipstick   After wiping the humidifier that I had placed on my lips   I will start with the lips first   I will correct my oral form   I will integrate the font a little so it does not seem too specific   Now I'm going to use two new Noodles from our range   I love the colors of the nudos very much and have always been a big part of makyaji and stailey   The first Rogue named Girlfriend   It is more like a complexion   This is my favorite color   You can make do with this color   But I will add a little bit of Crush color and it's a very light nude color   I will put it on the middle of the lips   And merge it with my finger   To add more dimensions to my lips   I will use the same brush from Wayn Goss   Has wiped out the rest of the shadows   I will merge Chromatic Sandalwood, Suede and a little beige to get the perfect color for the contour   I will put it on the tips of the nose   I'll have the rest on the brush to put after the shadow under the lips to look bigger   Then I will take a little of the heliater and put it on top of the lips   You can also put a little heliter on your nose   I do not usually do this because my nose is long   But if I wanted to put the heliter on it, I'd put it in the middle here   But you can put it along your nose if you want   I will also put a little in the corner of the inner eye   And here I am! e   This is my daily favorite mike   It's simple and not overpriced   Not very natural but not exaggerated   Although I put several layers of make-up on my face   It seems calm and beautiful and enhances your natural beauty   That's what I like to adopt every day   I hope you liked this video   Notify me in the comments box for any suggestions for future videos   Do not forget to click on the icon of admiration

 Hello my friends, I was in school today with my daughter and had her first induction day   When we returned to the office we came up with a great idea   It is an attempt to make full-scale makeup with school tools   I know there are similar videos on YouTube   But we wanted to develop this challenge and use more tools   From ruler and glue to other tools   If I show you today how to turn your face with stationery tools!   I will first have sticky blogging papers   I will put it on the tip of the eye   I will put paper on the other eye to get a perfect eye makeup   These sheets are better than adhesive tape because they are not very sticky   If you are serious about the subject, place the paper according to the lower eyelashes line   We discovered that the crayons we bought from the Natalez Outlet store   Is that you can soak any pen coloring with water and this makes it similar to eye shadows and pens Elainer   I have different colors here and I will begin with the white pen as the basis   As you see it has become very saturated   I will now put it on the eyelid   Make sure that you drink enough water to become soft   I make light strokes and try to blend it at the same time with the pen   If you merge it with your finger it will go away   If it looks untidy it's okay because I'll put the cow over it   Now I will put brown on the outside corner   I will use the coloring brush to merge it   Now I will have a black pen to draw the Illiner   It is very saturated!   These pens are saturated colors but when they touch them quickly disappear   If you want to use it seriously, make sure you never hear it   Now I'm going to shake the sticky papers and here's the result!   Now I will use the sparkle   I will blend the golden and silver colors   that's cool! I think I'll come out with this makeup   Now I will move to my eyebrows   Take the brown pen and fill the blanks   To make sure they are equal, I will use the ruler   This is the best pen to teach your eyebrows at all   To fix my eyebrows, I'll serve a little glue on a clean mascara brush   Now is the time for fun because I will paint my face   I will use these paint colors with their brushes   I will use the adhesive tape because it is excellent for the contour as you know   For the contour I will use brown and combine it with orange   It looks very Portuguese so I will add a little blue to modify it   I turn to setting the cheeks in the same brown color   Coverage is very unsuccessful   Now I will set my nose in thecontour as well   It's time to mix colors to get a foundation cream   This is not easy but I like to mix the pellets of the foundation   I will draw a lot of oily color to yellow \ because my skin is very oily   I will add a little white color   And a little orange   I take this seriously, I would like to look pretty by the end of the video   If you are impressed with someone in the school and do not carry makeup you can use stationery   I was impressed by the music professor when I was little   So I clapped my body to the ground   Now I will combine everything with the foundation cream I invented   It's a bit yellow but it does   I look like a girl with pearls   Do not I look like a painting? No?   Now I turn to the palachars, I will blend a little pink and orange   I would like to add the Smoky effect to the lower eyelashes line   I will put a little brown under the eye   I turn to the lips, so I'll use the pens   I chose this beautiful red color   There is a shadow on the other side   Now I will put the red color on my lips   It works as a dye on the lips   It's shiny, you're the best matfaya   Finally, I will use the tweezers to make my hairstyle   And here I am! In my opinion, this is not okay. We used only school tools   My face is awesome! In fact I feel a strong desire to wash my face   But if I were in school and my mother would not let me put on make-up, I would definitely use these tools   Click on the icon if you like this video and give me your feedback   Do not forget to subscribe to my channel and follow up on Instagram and Snabchat   Bye  
 Hello my friends, I would like to inform you today how to get Kirley's hair   I had a lot of questions about my hair coloring, so I wanted to make a video about it   This is my natural hair, so be it when I bathe   I put some mousse on it and this product is Caviar Clinical Daily Defensifying Foam   It helps fight hair loss   I do not know if it's effective yet, but I still like it   I also sprayed my hair with Bumble and bumble surf spray   You know that I like a lot and talk about it in my blog   If my hair became slightly wet   If your hair is too soft, you should wrap it completely   But if he is withering like me, you can wrap the number of chisms that you want   For today's video, I'll wrap all the strings to see the result   But usually I roll the front part and some of the tendons at the bottom   As you can see there are many ripples in my hair   I will begin by dividing my hair at the top   I will start with this aspect and I will use a very high-end brand of Chi   I think I bought it from the Amazon site   Ah did not actually get it from Dubai dubai   It is up to you to choose the size of the chisel, if you want tight ripples tightly and my thighs are slender   If you want light ripples, my thighs are larger   I'll have a very fine thread like this   I will wrap it and hold it down for a few seconds   Then I let her down   You can shape the tufts and make some thin and wide   If you want to structure your hair, you can wrap 4 hairs in the opposite direction to your face   You also know how to wrap the chalk in the opposite direction   When you reach the fifth ring you can wrap it towards your face   I wrapped two knuckles in the opposite direction and my third thighs will be facing my face   This will ensure that the tangles will blend together beautifully and will increase the texture of your hair   I will complete the same way on all hair   You can see the difference between the two sides, this is not arranged   The other side is beautiful and fun   This will not be the final check, I'll show you what I'll do in the end to improve its appearance   I will complete now   If I have finished the lower part I will move to the top part   I'll start from the back   I will divide it with my fingers, as I noticed I did not use the brush at all   That's because when I use high-fidelity and brush my hair first   The ripples are very specific   I will later pass my fingers to pick it up   However it looks very specific and I do not want to further sharpen the ripples   I'll take this tail from the back and follow the same steps   When I reach this part I will twist the tail back   I'll put the turf and a thousand strings around it that way   When you reach the front, in all the veins in the opposite direction of your face   There is nothing wrong with my tendency to roll the bottom   But when you reach the front, you should wrap them all in the opposite direction of your face   I have finished   I'll leave it for a few minutes in this way to cool the front knuckles   I'll shoot it again with the Spurvey Surf Infusion   This step is not necessary, but I like the structure it adds to my hair   I will wait for a few minutes and come back   I have now cooled my hair, and in fact I have added so much of this Sabra to him   Now I will begin to pass my fingers between the chisels   Do not overdo it so that your hair does not explode   If this is my easy way to get curly hair, you can easily follow them all   You need only the right tools   If you do not own this Sabrai and do not want to buy it   You can make it yourself, mix a little salt with the water and this is enough   If you want to buy it, I advise you a lot   I hope you have enjoyed this video, follow me on InstagramMy name: @hudabeauty   And at the expense of Snacks: Realhudabeauty   I see you in the next video, goodbye  
 Chris came in and found me like that   I lift my face my love and I always do this secretly   I'm a very fluffy woman   Hello my friends, Today's video deals with the subject of facial shaving   I do not mean to put shaving cream on and use the razor that men use   Many of the icons of beauty through history have degenerated into their faces such as Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor   The reason they shaved their faces was not just to get rid of the annoying litter   But also to peel off the face and get rid of scars   And to fight aging, and make-up looks better after shaving   I started relying on facial shaving a while ago and I loved it so much, I can not stop   Sometimes the faces of my customers are closed because the make-up is much better then   Today I'll show you the right way to shave your face   I have put a little make-up but I have not yet paid the contour   Because I noticed that I had to shave some hairs on the top of my forehead   I thought I would shoot a video on the subject   The first rule is to have your face completely dry   Your face must be clean, I know there is little makeup on my face but it is completely clean in this area   But make sure your face is not wet   I feel that when you wet your face and fly, the hairs grow more intensely   In fact the laser has been performed in this area   But as for the hairs on my cheeks and other areas, I shave them   To make my makiaji much better   You need to use a special razor blade   Do not go to the regular code you use to shave your legs   And those used by men to shave their chin   Use such blades   I have 3 different blades and purchased them from the Amazon site   You'll also find it on eBay   Now I'll show you how to shave your face   If dry, choose this code   The areas I want to shave are around the cheeks   And on the sides of the forehead   You can see a little lint   I do not like laser procedure on this area because it looks very specific and abnormal   Sometimes it looks like you're putting wigs   So I like the little shaving of the lint here   Without completely cleaning it to look natural and graded   I will start this area here with lots of lint   Do not move the code towards the bottom but upwards   Do not make harsh blows, but very light   If you do this for the first time, press on the forehead and pull it up   So that you can limit the area you want to contact   Because this process may stress you especially around the eyebrows   I lift the lint on my back   So cover your eyebrows with your finger first   After people love the capillaries that exist here, but I think it's a bit weird   Be very careful, take very light strokes so that you do not cut your skin   I have a little lint here but it never bothers me   If so, close the sides of the forehead   If you want to shave the tips of your cheeks, tighten your skin and hair this way   You have removed the sideburns with the laser   It was like Salafis Alves Presley but I got rid of it   But what I was doing before was pulling the hair up and doing the same light strokes   If shaving the face is very easy and very basic   Always leave this code in the make-up bag because you do not know which client you will need   So it is very important to be cleaned or replaced every period   If you use it on your face, just clean it, but if you use it on your customers, replace it after each use.   Or you can sterilize it well   If shaving is a very easy process and not a crazy idea as everyone thinks   If you have a sticky litter you can cut it but you will see it after putting makeup   Or you can treat him as I do Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor   I hope you have benefited from this video   Do not forget to subscribe to the channel and follow up on Instagram and Snabchat and meet

 Hello my friends, we have a very special guest in the office today   She is my protector !!   My favorite daughter is Hoda My Beauty! I love you so much   My relationship with Chris started 16 years ago and Roda has always called me "   She is the only person I allow him to call me that way   She is an amazing woman who gave birth to my husband, "Christopher"   She is a beautiful human being and she allowed me to put her make-up on the camera   She has very beautiful features, she has made her make-up before and she looks wonderful   We will adopt a smooth and feminine texture today   The focus will be on the skin   Her skin is a bit mature   They have some dark circles and we will correct them of course   I will improve her eyebrows because eyebrows are very important makeup   They make you look younger, more glow and beauty   They are characterized by these qualities from the inside because they are very energetic and enjoy a cheerful spirit   All I'm going to do is consolidate the beauty and femininity you already have   I will start by moistening her skin first   I will use this rose oil   I will put a small amount on my hands and then on her skin   Her skin is very beautiful   thank you dear   She is always busy and interested in others, so I want to pay attention to her today   Was "Chris" the son of Shikia?   Both were good boys   For more moisturizing around the eyes, I will use Abeille Royale Gold Eyetech   I use this product in the days when I need more hydration   This area of ​​the face needs constant hydration because it is very thin skin   you are a very beautiful woman   How many times have you come to Dubai yet?   three times   I love Dubai   Chris grew up in a Portuguese complex in the United States called New Bedford,   We moved to Dubai for 8 years   The color of her lips is very beautiful   When a woman grows older, the color of her lips changes and becomes darker   But the color of her lips has not changed and it is a very beautiful pink   First, I'll start with the skin   I will not over make-up on her skin, I would keep her normal appearance   There is a little dark pigmentation around her eyes and this is very normal   So I'll first fix it, this debugger from Mac has debuggers   One in orange and the other in yellow   I will merge the two colors to get the color I want   I'll teach you how to do this so you can do it yourself   You will be my teacher today   Yup!   You know how to cook Portuguese recipes   Your cooking is not very tasty   I am very happy to hear this from you!   She cooks all the dishes   I will add more yellow color because the mix is ​​very orange   This corrector will help me get rid of any darkening of the skin   She had made her make-up before and looked like beauty queens   Do you remember the day you put makeup?   You look beautiful anyway, but with make-up you become more beautiful   I will put a little debugger around the mouth as well   I'll have a big misty brush and put the rest of the debugger on the eyelid   For a cream based foundation with its skin   He mixed two different colors from Mike Up Forever   I, No. 153 and 117   I will put a little cream foundation on her skin   I do not want more than make-up she does not need it   I want a little coverage in some areas   I will use my finger to incorporate the foundation cream   As you can see, her skin became healthier and more uniform   I love you so much my son, you and my daughter, "Rudy"   And the "light" also beautiful   I have a wonderful family thank God   I love my family so much   "Noor" looks like "Chris"   Yup   You can see the difference between the two sides   You can use the pewter blender to soften the foundation cream   I did not put the console yet but the difference is clear   So it is important not to overdo the base cream on the mature skin   I chose Mike Fever's foundation cream because it's very saturated but you can control it   Full coverage can be obtained or merged well and obtained a light coat   It contains a little oil that helps to merge   It is excellent for all skin types   Now I will put Cover FX under my eyes   Thus lighting the area and hide the dark circles at the same time   I use a thick hair brush which gives me greater coverage   I will merge the conseller with the bioti blender   Now I'll put a little bronze   We usually use the Contour technology to add depth and dimensions to the face   In this case, the contour will help me lift her cheeks   I use this technology myself and now I will apply it to her face as well   I will mix two colors of the contour, the first Teint de Soleil of Chanel   Then I'll add a little creamy contour from Sleek   I like Sleek and recommend it   The composition of Teint De Soleil is very distinctive and is suitable for all skin types   It is fatty, dry or even mature   I think it contains a primer that makes its application perfect   I will add the contour on the chin line also to select it more   Cream combines the foundation within the wrinkles but it is fine   I will merge it and then fix it with powder   I will use the compact powder instead of the free as it is less dry   This powder is from Guerlain, Blanc De Perle, number 01   I feel it contains a little moisturizing   Before the installation I will use a brush to combine the preparation that is collected inside the wrinkles   I will put the powder under the eye by the peyote blender   Then I'll take a powder-colored powder from Nars with 4   I will fix the rest of the face with a light-bristled brush   In order to avoid placing too much lotion on mature or dry skin   Her skin is not very mature but I use it on my face too when I feel dry   I used a powder with two different colors to add the heliant to some areas I wanted to highlight   So the dimensions were added to her face   Do I look beautiful?   you look great!   Thank   Tell me stories about Chris, who was his first sweetheart   First? you are my dear   No! You had a sweetheart before me!   I was his first true love   Chris has the best woman in the universe   I was your first sweetheart?   Yup   You are my first love   I will use Shade And Light from Cat Von De   I will put the bronze in the middle under her cheeks in a light way   It is very important to remove make-up before bed, do not forget!   I will not use much of the hyaliter on her face   This hotter is named Champagne Pop of Becca Cosmestics   I will put a very simple amount on the top of the cheek   If she had a lot of wrinkles, she would not be able to put the heliter   I will put a few balachars, which will add beauty, health and delivery to the face   This is a lot of Too Faced, I use it all the time   It may seem like I'm putting a lot of make-up, but the layers are very thin and well compacted   Do you feel the weight of makeup on your face?   Both   I also like to put light powder in this area \   I think this technique makes the face appear more tight   The last step before moving to the eyebrows is to apply the contour to the nose   I will use Natural Matte from Too Faced   I think these ballets are so basic that they include a lot of jobs   Contour the nose and teach the eyebrows   I will use this light color with a little color of Cashmere Bunny   This brush is great for nose contour and is designed by beauty expert Rae Morris   Brush number 10   I will add a small amount of light powder under the eyes   I will leave the powder for some time to prove and I will move to my eyebrows   The eyebrows are very important makeup because they make a huge difference   It makes the pain brighter and more beautiful   I will combine two colors of Ka Brow Gel from Benifet with numbers 3 and 4   I will start with 3 and add 4 if needed   Her eyebrows moved away from each other   So I'm going to zoom the distance between them   Since the distance between the eyebrows is wide, her nose looks wider   I will begin by extending the eyebrow at the inside   I would also like to raise her eyebrows at the outer corner   Its eyebrow tilts downward, as you see, I did not draw any line at the top, but at the bottom of the interior of it   In order to appear more rigid   To install the gel, I will use the same pallet from Too Faced   I will mix Sexpresso and Chocololate Cookie   I used the colonizer to erase the last eyebrow to correct it   Now I will finish her eyebrows with the brush and gel used by Ka Brow   For the eyes, there is a little dark color around them   But I will use this as a shade for the eyes   So I will not put too much eye shadow   I will use this Tarteist Palette from Tart   I will use one of these warm colors   I will not correct the pigmentation on her eyes, but I will benefit from it   I will paint the entire eyelid   And now I will lash her eyelashes with this Japanese piston   I used the Japanese piston because I did not want to scare it with the traditional piston   It raises tension if you are not used to it   Instead of drawing an Eleaner, I will use this dark shadow Punk of the Palette itself   I will put it in a light way to give a smoke effect   Apply it to the outer corner only to raise the eye shape   In order to ensure that the lotions do not accumulate in the wrinkles, place them firmly on the powder   This is delicate in dry or wrinkled skin   But you can minimize the amount of lotions that will help you a bit   Now I will use Harmony eyelashes, which are lashes divided into 4 parts   It is ideal for people who are not used to synthetic lashes   I will not use them all, but the second part of the north   Not too long   I'll put a little glue on the tape   Usually I paste it immediately but I will wait a little but dry completely and do not bother   As he waited for me to dry, I would put the mascara on her eyelashes   It's a full Fat Lashes from Charlotte Tilbury   Always push artificial eyelashes upward when fitted   I have only used one piece and that's enough for it   I will now move to the lips which is the last step of this soft make-up   I will use my favorite lip set and I put it today Trendsetter   I will begin to teach her lips according to natural painting   Then I will enlarge it slightly in the middle   I will add a little bit of liquid Gossip Girl   The pink color is cheerful and feminine   I will put a little of it on my hand and then put it on my lips   To add more cheeks to her cheeks, I will use the same liquid racer Gossip Girl   I will put it back on my hands and I will put it well on my cheeks   To get a soft and feminine effect   I like to use liquid broth on the cheeks because it lasts all day long   Since it is matte, it looks very nice   This is the final Look!   Did you like Mama?   it is very beautiful   What do you think Dad?   She looks 20 years old   Do you feel beautiful?   So I look very beautiful   I hope you liked this video   And leave us your comment and do not forget to follow me on Instagram and Snabchat   Bye  
 Hello my friends, today's video is inspired by Ariana Grande   I recently attended the WMI concert and she looked very beautifull   I like her style recently and she used the thick grouse on her forehead   And the ponytail that was famous for it   But the surprise is new to its usual ruins   She also wore a "chuckle" on her neck and a beautiful blouse featuring her shoulders   Her ruins were very beautiful skin moisturizing health   It has adopted the technique of "nontorning" ie light contour   In addition to strong eyeliner, thick eyelashes and beautiful eyebrows   I will start with makeup first, I have attended my skin with a Porefessional cream of benif   I turn to cream foundation so I will blend colors because I am very brown for the time being   I will use the Tarte Rainforest of the Sea foundation cream   I do not know the number of this cream because it was hidden from it but it is dark   I will blend it with a lighter color called Light Medium Honey   Before putting the foundation cream I will use the debugger   This ballet is very affordable price of City Color   I will put a little orange under the eye   Then I will take a small amount of green   I will put it over the blisters directly   As you see my nose exposed to some sunburn so I will put the debugger also   Now I will put the foundation foundation above the debugger in a normal way so that the debugger is not removed   Best foundation cream starting from the center of the face because you do not need a large amount of it on the forehead   Most people have clear skin at the forehead area   This helps me to get more coverage in places where there are more impurities   When I get to the top I have the rest of the product on the brush   I will use the pewter blender to squeeze the product into the skin   As Tren barely developed a little cream foundation on this area   I will also put a little of it on my eyelids to get rid of the appearance of the veins   I did not use much of the contour, so I'll use a little consler to get rid of the eye pockets   I will use the Cinema Secret in italics   Now I will fix an area under the eye with a little powder   Named Secret Brightening Powder by Laura Mercier   I will take a simple amount and put it under the eye and on the nose \ and a little on the chin   I will not rely on Contour at all   As I mentioned earlier, the best technique for nontorning is on people who enjoy the perfect face   But if you are like other people like me, Falconting is very necessary   I'll fix the rest of the face with another powder, Pro Finish 153 from Makeup Forever   It is a foundation cream but I also like it as a powder   It is very suitable for Reed Carpet party because it is very beautiful on the skin and its coverage is excellent   To add more hilayat, I will use the Sweets from Glast Kit from Anastasia   Hilater Pater Skatch will take over   I will put a little of it on the cheekbone   Now I turn to the powder of the Cheekathon of Benifet   I chose the famous Hula Bronzer and put it very lightly under my cheek   A little of it on the forehead also borders the chin   Then I will take Balashir Meshmachi, whose name is Corallista from the Ballet itself   I will incorporate it over the regions of the contour   I will reduce the nose a little bit with the contour because Ariana's nose is perfect   With a soft fluffy brush, I will take a little of Bronzer Hula again and put it lightly on the tips of the nose   Now I will use Ballet Rose Gold from Hoda My Beauty   I will start with a sandalwood shade, a light brown color   I will put it on the eye fracture very lightly   Now I will take this light beige color called Bae   I will put it on the whole eyelid mobile   I will incorporate it a bit above the brown to soften it more   Now I will take this pink color to the golden name Angelic   I will put it lightly on the eyelid   These palettes are beautifully colored in gold   When you put this shadow it looks pink but it also contains a golden color   I will also take a little of it and place it on the eyebrow bone   Now turn to the Eleaner and draw a very thick line   Ariana is famous for her cat's eyes and wide Eliner   The same hook was adopted for that concert   I will start from the middle of the eyelid and pull it out   Then I will follow the line of lower eyelashes and draw a small wing at the end of the eye   Turning to the lips, I will put a little cream foundation I used previously   On the tips of the outer lips to change the shape of the lips slightly   Then I will use the Trendsetter lipstick set from Hoda Beauty   It will not be much bigger because Ariana's lips are medium in size   I will adopt a brownish-gray color   So I'll put Flirt lipstick from my beauty Huda on the lips   As for eyelashes, Ariana adopted very dramatic eyelashes   So I will use the Scarlet of Hoda My Beauty because it is very dense and bold   But first I will put mascara   Now I will take a little of the brown shade I used earlier   I will put a little of it in the lower eyelashes line   Then I will take this black lanyard and I will identify the line of lower eyelashes very light   I will not draw the line straight, but I will put some points sporadically   So as to add more depth without getting a strong lock   I'll put the mascara on the bottom line of lashes   Turning to my eyebrows, I'll use Ka Brow from Benifet by number 4   I like this product because it is a little dry and does not move   I'll fill in the blanks   Ariana's eyebrows are dense and straight   But it does not matter because jealousy will hide it   Now I will use a lighter color than the Ka Brow eyebrow to give the Ombre effect to the eyebrows   I will apply it to the front of the eyebrows   I'll put a little gloss on the lips as she did   This is the Gallus of the Blondy name of Charlotte Telbury   I will put a little of it on the middle of the lips and merge it with my finger   I'll go and change my clothes and come back   She changed the blouse to resemble that worn by Ariana   I'll put a little make-up on this area   When you show your complexion it is best to put on a little makeup   I will use Brownzer Hula from Palette Benifet   I will identify these areas   I usually move my neck to see where I put the counter   Now I will take the heliter again and I will put it on the bones of the neck and shoulders to highlight it   Then I'll take the darker heliler and put a little of it on my shoulders   Then I'll put a black hooker contract, I think I bought it from Amazon   Turning to the hairstyle, Ariana adopted the ponytail with the thick furrow on her forehead   The first step is hair lifting   I'll use the brush to get a neat hairdo   After tying my hair I wrapped him in the shape of a small cake   To do the ponytail, I will use this artificial hair   They are cheap and I think they are from Bellamy   This is not a natural hair, but artificial   But he fulfills the purpose of this hairstyle   I'll wrap it around the cake   You can squeeze it around with clamps and you can use the hairpin to twist it around the ponytails   Now I'm going to install the jealousy, as you see it is different from Ariana's   It has a longer trunk at the sides so I will cut it   Sabine will help me with her beautiful hands to carry the jealousy   I will begin by cutting the long cords   And now I will call you jealous   Still long   Sabine I need you again   Now Sabine's hand goes back to the screen   I'll cut it again   I will try to put it back   I have finished   This was inspired by the nineties I liked very much   I hate short gusts but I loved this lock   I wish I had artificial hair in Ariana's hair   If this is the final block it is not difficult to get it   You can buy cheap wigs from Bellamy or other brands and will do the trick   It is excellent for this type of layoffs for a day, for example, or if you try a short surprise to see if it suits you   I loved

 Hello my friends, I am getting ready to sleep and I wanted to make a very important aesthetic protein for me   I thought I was going to share it with him   I previously told you about facial massage, it's a yoga for the skin   Works to extend the facial muscle and determine its features more   I noticed a big difference in Contour's chin line and the greatness of the cheeks   I feel that this technique helps me tighten my face and improve its shape   I have some comments asking if you have had any surgery   Because they noticed a big difference in my face   I tell you now that the makeup contour helps a lot but facial massage is also very important to identify and lift facial features   I will start with a completely clean skin, I washed my face and put the toner   Now I will use my favorite Serum Good Genes from Sanday Riley   I have been using it for about 6 months and I liked it very much   I'll put a little of it on my hand, I do not need much of it   I'll put it all over my face   I will start with the massage of the skin and this is very important because the technology is pressing on certain areas to get the result   Be careful not to use a very greasy serum, this serum is not fat at all   Which makes your skin sticky after the thing and allows you to pick it up and massage it better   The first step is to press my fingers on the chin area   When I reach the area under my cheeks, press firmly with my fingers   And then press upwards as such   You may feel some cramping after you have finished   I received a great deal for Guerlain in Paris   They use the best technology in the world   She told me she stimulated muscle in the area with this technique   You feel like you've been doing a bit of exercise for your face   You can do this movement for 20 or 30 times   Do not forget to walk along the chin too   And push the skin upwards   I also love the eyebrow area massage towards the outside   By one finger   Then print down this shape without pressing hard   Thereby stimulating blood circulation   For the chin line, you can use your thumb and massage the area towards your ears   If you can do this every day, even for a minute, you will notice a marked improvement   If your time is tight   You can adopt this technique when you watch TV as I do   I do this movement for example and my husband thinks I'm crazy, but that's also useful   You are thus defying gravity   You may have seen this in my previous videos when I talked about changing the position of fat in our body as we age   At the age of youth the face is shaped like a triangle like this and the fat accumulates at the top   As we age, the triangle is reflected and the fat accumulates at the bottom   The skin begins to flutter and accumulate in this area   Many women resort to face-lift   Where they cut the skin here and pull it up   But this is a little scary, I think this technique helps to lift the skin and identify the chin line better   To get the face of a young and more specific   I believe in the effectiveness of this technique and saw a remarkable result thanks to it   I think she can change the way women look   I hope you have benefited from this fast video and will prepare you to improve and define the features of your face more   This is my way of facial massage or facial yoga   Facial yoga technology involves extending the skin through these exercises   You are not an expert but this step can be part of a facial yoga routine   Please click the Like icon if you like this video   Do not forget to subscribe to the channel and meet  
keep hearing like you which I want to say I don't know it's wrong with me called as we called it definiteness on that in the bloopers it's hard I know I was feeling with this I'm not a good kid I could do this yeah like so what you are hey guys so today this would be offices we thought we would try a different thing we want to try different kinds of makeup primers some very strange ones like lubricant um vagisil aftershave balm milk of magnesium olive oil so I know some of those seem really really strange but as you guys know there are so many different types of ingredients inside these products that really actually work so well with makeup and just kind of make it all perfect on your skin it can also actually make your makeup last really well throughout the day so we're going to try a few of those as you guys know already I love the Navy aftershave balm in olive oil I swear by the Nivea aftershave balm is so great it has glycerin in it which kind of just sucks your makeup onto your skin and really just kind of melts with your makeup throughout the day olive oil is so awesome it has basically all the ingredients at your skin really needs to be nourished we're going to give the other three tries this is the typical KY jelly Lube actually similar to a lot of the like silicone based primers that you might see out there it does have glycerin in there um I don't really know how to say describe this next one it's called vagisil this has de my pecan in it really great for oil control and the last thing we're actually going to put milk of magnesia we're going to try this and she's going to see if it really does control the oil so we're going to put all these different ingredients on different parts of face put makeup on and see how it comes back I'm going to start first with a KY lubricant and I'm putting it on one side of my face and it feels really soothing but not very hydrating it definitely feels like it's water-based it's going to be great for oily type skin the reason why milk amount of magnesium is really great is because just kind of has like different types of qualities inside there that break down oils will quietly fingertips it's actually kind of it it actually is a lot more hydrogen than I thought so this would be a really great first in typesetter oily I'm noticing as I'm putting on my skin it's kind of setting so it felt originally hydrating and now it's kind of getting a little tacky okay now we're gonna grab the fattest if you do want to use one of these creams that are you know for stopping aging and for women down the hair it has to have the methadone in it otherwise it actually will not be the right one this actually feels really good going on it feels really creamy feels really soothing I actually like this cream as everything has set in I can feel my head feels so weird it almost feels like it's been sealed feels like my skin has a little bit of a film on top a little bit powdery this side actually feels really great where we apply the lubricant feels hydrated doesn't really feel strange other side where I've applied the vagisil feels probably the most hydrated feels really good so we'll go ahead now we'll do a little makeup application and we'll come back and see how everything's that okay guys I've been applying my makeup and I can already see the side with the lube there's like these little pieces almost looks like dead skin this is not good like literally it's just like peeling right off the side where the vagisil actually feels so great my makeup looks really great too looks like everything study in there really well they've milk of magnesium also really great a little bit on the drier side so I can't really fight with powder oh this is just like a disaster so weird I'm going to continue my makeup and hopefully it gets better we'll see so it's been a few hours since I actually plant the makeup been wearing it around and there's definitely a difference as far as which ones I like I can definitely see the loo it was a little confusing like I wasn't really sure if it went to stay on my skin I did a stubble motions completely fine but if I did any brushing like this even after I applied powder even just with a cream it kind of like would rub off into like a little like almost like dead skin it really didn't work very well the vagisil on the other hand worked really well I feel like my makeup is sitting really properly it's kind of hydrated and I feel it's also controlling the oil the milk of magnesium on the other hand super dry I feel like it's almost like a mask and I could just like fluff it off and it would just fall into a perfect mask probably amazing if you have really oily skin but if you have dry skin like myself not really the most perfect thing for me the vagisil is the best option I mean I guess it kind of makes sense too because it soothes skin so this is definitely the winner unfortunately the Lube I was thinking it might work really well when I first applied it cuz it felt like I'd make a primer but that did not work well at all are these primers better than normal primers i mean i really think it depends on your skin also the makeup use i would totally use a vaginal I just think carrying it around is going to be a little awkward otherwise I would stick to typical your normal primer and a plug-in fuzz option so hope you guys like this
