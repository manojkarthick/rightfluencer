On the edge of the Boteti River in Botswana lies Meno a Kwena  a simple safari camp. This was the perfect place to disconnect from the online world and reconnect with the natural world.

Cruising the river on a raft and watching elephants cross in front of us was one of my favorite moments of my trip to Botswana. Read more about my experience below:. Check out the incredible traditions of wine making in Croatia!. Old world glamour meets African safari at Natural Selection's Jack's Camp! I had the pleasure of staying at this luxury camp on my recent trip to Botswana and it seriously blew me away.

The rooms reminded me of the Quidditch World Cup tents from Harry Potter (so you know I was excited) and the personalized service was amazing. Plus there were so many adventures to be had and wildlife to explore.

One of the best parts of our trip to Botswana was being completely disconnected for a week. It might sound silly  but I don‚Äôt often find time to do ‚Äúnothing.‚Äù We were so remote at Sable Alley that we spent our days watching hippos from the lodge  and falling asleep in the afternoons reading books as light rain fell from the heavens. This was truly one of the most perfect places I have ever been.

I spent the majority of my 20s single. I traveled solo. I was the third wheel. I was the ‚Äúsingle‚Äù friend.

For years before meeting Meyer  I would have people feel genuinely sorry for me when they found out I didn‚Äôt have a boyfriend.

I could have just spent an hour talking about the success of my business  having traveled to over 50 countries on my own  displaying self-confidence and wisdom beyond my years‚Äî but the second I said I was single  I instantly became a crazy cat lady  loudly displaying a countdown timer to infertility.

The conversation would literally go from ‚ÄúWOW! You‚Äôve done so much at such a young age!‚Äù to ‚ÄúYou better lock it down before you‚Äôre too old to have kids.‚Äù (*insert a real LOL here*) I spent my 20s seeing the world  learning about what I truly wanted out of life  growing a business and selfishly focusing on becoming an awesome human.

Some people meet their soul mates in their teens  and others might find love where they least expect it. There is no ‚Äúhow-to‚Äù guide for life OR love. So  don‚Äôt compare your life to others‚Äî especially on Instagram.

Love yourself first. Accept yourself. Truly. Flaws and all. It‚Äôs one of the most cliche things to say on a day like Valentine's Day. But  self-love isn‚Äôt important. It‚Äôs necessary.

Believe in yourself and do what you want in life. Appreciate the journey. Surround yourself with friends  family  and people that bring out the best in you. THAT is the true secret to happiness.. Add Bali to your travel list this year!. Happy Chinese New Year!. Looking back on some of my favorite experiences in this wonderful country in honor of the Chinese New Year today!.

Meet the meerkats of the Kalahari! At Jack‚Äôs Camp in Botswana  I got to hang out with these little cuties! As a tourist  I am very cautious about human interaction with wild animals. These animals are completely wild‚Äî as they should be‚Äî but have been habituated  meaning their behavior is not affected by the presence of humans. They have come to see us as part of their normal habitat‚Äî not as a threat. While you should never touch them  they might not respect the same of you lol! With the guidance of a game ranger and meerkat researcher  I simply sat down and these guys ran right up to the top of my head as if I were no different than a termite mound!

hey everyone and welcome to travel talk with the blonde abroad I'm Kirsten and today I'm going to be sharing my travel beauty hacks for every budget these tips are great for any type of trip so that you don't have to break your normal beauty routine from home while you're on the road one of my favorite beauty hacks is a silk pillowcase I bring a silk pillowcase on every trip not only because it's a nice little luxury when you're sleeping in an unfamiliar bed also this silky smooth surface keeps your hair and your skin gliding across the surface so you won't wake up with Bed Head and it also prevents wrinkles another cool little tip is to use contact lens cases as daily sort of liquids containers so I just mark the tops at each with a nail polish so that I can differentiate between the little substances in each one and I'll put anything from hand sanitizer to sunscreen to you know face moisturizer and these are great to put in your carry-on on a flight or just to throw in your purse for the day this way you don't have to even bring travel sized containers and their perfect amount of liquids that you'll need umm yeah for any day out or on your flight coconut oil is one of the ultimate all-natural beauty secrets I use this stuff for everything I first heard of it on a trip to Focus del Toro in Panama some of the local women would prepare it over an open fire and then they bottle it and sell it to you know tourists and even the locals really inexpensive and all-natural and you can use this for body moisturizer you can make your own all-natural deodorant with it I use it for cuticle oil and I use it as a deep conditioning treatment and you can also cook with it I mean this does great so I just take a little bit in travel containers on every trip so one of the easiest and free travel hacks our sample perfumes you can get sample perfumes from Nordstrom and Sephora you just simply have to ask they come in a little vial in like a cardboard box normally um these came in like a little travel kit that I got for a gift one year either way it's a great trick so that when you're traveling you can try a bunch of different perfumes and when you get home if you like one of them you can buy the full size and it'll always remind you of that special somewhere one trick I use for packing light is I always pack basics like blacks and whites and simple pieces and then I bring statement jewelry so um you know right now I have a simple black top on and I'll go to forever 21 or H&amp;M and buy you know a ten dollar chunky bulb necklace or some earrings and it completely transforms my outfit so for example you know I could be wearing this out for the day put on a nice necklace and I'm ready to go out for the evening I love smiling smiling my favorite and so you know it's nice to always keep my smile nice and light note I haven't had professional whitening I used Crest Whitestrips so these are a really affordable option I buy them at the local drugstore and they're they come in a top and bottom row strip and you simply leave them on for 30 minutes they're still tight so you can drink and talk with them on so you can put them on while you're getting ready or you can wear them while you're out exploring for the day so Crest Whitestrips by secret to a white smile I have really fine hair and me and saltwater our worst enemies because my hair gets really tingly and meet with wet hair it's just it's an impossibility to brush through it I found a wet brush it was like an infomercial product a while back and I mean it just glide through your hair I don't know what it is there's just like magic in these bristles but especially when your hair is wet it glides right through your hair no tangles or anything so the wet brush is a great travel solution on any trip but more specifically Beach trips you know snorkeling that sort of thing I always pack dry shampoo on every trip because there's definitely trips where I don't have the luxury to wash my hair every day so what I do is I make my own all-natural dry shampoo and I put it in a little travel container and I bring a kabuki like makeup brush and I basically brush it on my roots every night before bed and then when I wake up in the morning my hair isn't oily it's nice and clean it smells nice and I get an extra couple days out of every wash so I always pack a sock bun on my travels you can make one with a traditional tube sock preferably a new one you just cut the toe off and roll it so you get this doughnut shape or you can actually buy one in your hair color this you can get online like on Amazon you just take a high pony and you roll it into a bun and it's a super easy way to get an elegant and sleek looking high bun or you can like pull the butt apart a little bit to get like a messy everyday bun but it's just as easy to do as a ponytail and it gives you a little bit more versatility on the road with your hair one of my favorite things to do on every trip is to bring a bunch of fun lipsticks instead of over packing and clothes again I like to keep it really simple and bring basic outfits and then dress up my outfits with jewelry and fun lipsticks so I always always bring a really nice classic red lipstick this is because I think every woman looks confident in it you can step out from a hostel and into a five-star resort looking and feeling like a million bucks and I also always bring you know like bright oranges and bold pinks just because I think it's fun and why not you know you're in another country and it's just a simple and easy way to you know dress up any outfit and have some fun with your makeup and finally my last travel beauty hack is the cordless curling iron I have naturally straight hair so it is fun to bring something with me that I can curl my hair with this is the ultimate solution I swear it's just amazing it's cordless it works just like a lighter does it has some detail fluid here and you just flick it like a lighter and it gets hot in a few seconds and it works just like a normal curling iron so if you have curly hair and you need to you know kind of maintain it on the road or if you just want to bring something so that you can have the ability to curl your hair I definitely recommend this it's big con air thermos l curling iron so those are my travel beauty hacks for every budget do you have a travel beauty hack because comment below and let me know if you have any questions or want more information on the products and tips I used in this video click the link below it'll take you to my blog post where I cover all of these products in depth thank you guys for watching and we'll see you next time 
hey everyone so this is a first for me I'm doing a makeup tutorial but I think it is very relevant to travel indeed so I am a travel blogger blogger I think that term is now coined so we're gonna go through bloggers today and I'm gonna show you that how to create a fresh off the plane look and it's inspired by my upcoming trip to the Middle East I'm gonna be on a plane for well flying in New York from California six-hour layover in New York and then an overnight flight into Amman Jordan so needless to say I'll most likely end up looking like a complete train wreck when I land I can't sleep on planes so I'm gonna show you guys a lot of tips that I've learned from other beauty bloggers and how I've kind of put a twist on it to show you how easy it is to create a really really simple and travel friendly makeup routine now always have you looking like you've just had like ten hours of sleep so everything is gonna fit inside of a really small makeup bag because has to be travel friendly of course um but I'll show you guys my tips and I hope you guys enjoy it and you know if you guys like my makeup and fashion tips from now on we'll keep it going and so hitting the ground running with fresh off the plane makeup hope you guys enjoy so I like to travel light and I keep everything in a small bag the first thing I start with is a face primer and I use L'Oreal magic perfecting base and I apply it using a flat makeup brush you can pick this up at any drugstore really it's pretty inexpensive so start by dabbing the tip of the brush in the primer and then you're going to go ahead and just blot it all over your face and then blend it in in a circular motion be sure to apply the primer all over including your jawline your neck and your eyelids is this is gonna serve as a base for all of your makeup and it's gonna set it for the day the next thing I'm going to apply is foundation I use makeup forever high definition foundation and I'm gonna use it with the flat brush again and just as we had applied the primer we're gonna do the same with the foundation I just squeezed a little bit of the foundation onto the tip of the brush and blot it all over and once I feel like I've got enough to cover my face I'll start blending it in a circular motion make sure that while you're blending you pay attention to your jaw line because you don't want to look like you're wearing a mask so be sure to blend it into your neck and also up into your hairline when I'm tired I get really dark circles under my eyes so I use Maybelline Dream Lumi camouflage stick it's in the color radiant which is almost like an orangish pink color and when you apply it under your eyes it really helps hide the dark circles and gives you a really refreshed look so just blend it in starting with the inside of your eye and then work it in with your finger until it's completely blended in I pay extra close attention to the underneath of my eyes so that I look well-rested I use Laura Mercier secret camouflage concealer and I use a Mac foundation brush to apply it underneath my eyes just to give it a little bit more brightness there's a triangle formation sort of from the inside of your eye to the outside of your eye and down to the base of your nose fill that area in with this camouflage concealer it's gonna brighten your face a lot and make your eyes look really well rested so now I'm going to go in and fill in the other eye blending it in that triangle sort of shape on my face from either side of my eye down to the base of my nose I'm also going to use the camouflage concealer as a highlighter so basically just go down the bridge of your nose up through between your eyebrows blending it into your forehead and also take it and go around your smile line it's gonna add highlight and definition to your face now I'm gonna take my flat foundation brush and just blend it a little bit and make sure it's all very subtle now that I have my foundation and concealer done I'm going to go in with a finishing powder this is makeup Forever's High Definition powder and I'm gonna apply it using a Mac multi layer brush they also make this powder in a travel size 1 but I buy in bulk for a little bit of the powder into the lid take the brush and kind of roll it around a bit tap it to have the powder come to the tip of the brush and then in circular motions blend it all over your face to set your foundation now we're gonna go in in contour our face this is the Too Faced glamour to go kit I got this at Sephora it has a a tie shadow makeup palette and then the bottom slides out and there's a blush lip gloss and bronzer so it's great because it has everything you kind of need for when you're traveling where he needs a contouring brush this one is from Mac and use the bronzer so whatever bronze are you like I'm using the Lynette's with my kit contouring is basically just adding definition and highlighting and shadowing where you need to so right now there's no definition in my cheek I'm use the bronzer to go in and sort of create a shadow in my cheekbone work your way up into the hairline and blend up into your cheek bone once we've accented our cheekbones we're gonna go in and add a little bit of bronzer to the outside of our foreheads naturally where we would get more Sun and therefore more color a little bit on our chin and then rowing to go in and make sure that we put the bronzer on our jaw line and blend it down into our neck so that everything looks as natural as possible I'm gonna apply blush with this same contouring brush that I used to contour just dab a little bit on the apples of your cheekbones smiling helps you can see exactly where it should go it's just on the apples and blend upward and for the last bit of contouring you just need a shadow brush and a blending brush these two are from MEC I'm gonna go in with my same Too Faced makeup kit using the bronzer that I'd previously used for my contouring I'm gonna get a little bit of the bronzer on the shadow brush and this may sound weird but I'm gonna draw two lines just on the outside of my nose and this is basically to make your nose if you're smaller it's gonna create that natural definition that you would have make sure you bring it all the way up into your eyebrow and all the way down to the tip of your nose then taking your blending brush just go ahead and blend it in down onto the sides of your nose leaving the bridge of your nose highlighted and that's all there is to it I fresh off the plane makeup tutorial to look natural and rested even after a long plane ride you

hi everyone and thanks for watching I'm Kirsten the blonde abroad and I'm going to be sharing my travel tips on how to pack the perfect carry-on bag the first thing you're going to need is a bag my favorite bag for traveling is the low-end Suns overnight and gym bag also known as the OG bag the material is really lightweight it has a couple of different options for straps it has a ton of compartments and zippers for everything from your laptop to pens to your passport and it also has a really handy dandy opening in the back so you can slide the bag securely onto your rolling luggage so you don't even have to carry it if you're in the airport or traveling with another piece of luggage the first thing I pack on every trip is something that's going to help me sleep so I always bring a travel pillow and I mask and earplugs that way if I'm tired I can get a little bit of Z's on my flight the next thing I pack on every trip are some healthy snacks I like to bring things like dried nuts and fruits maybe a health bar and some potato chip alternatives these are kale chips they're just a salty snack that are easy to pack and delicious now depending on how long your flight is you're likely going to want to refresh at some point so there are a few items I bring on every flight so that I can feel a little bit more like a human again especially on long-haul flights and that's eyedrops because you know it's really dry in the air and these help with red-eye I packed some organic mints I prefer mints over gum when I'm flying just because gum you swallow a little bit more air and it can cause um tummy aches I always bring some wisps which are disposable toothbrushes they just offer a little bit of you know oral cleanliness on a long flight and I bring some deodorant just for a quick reapplication during or just before I land I also like to bring a couple of things that can help me feel a little bit clean so that includes wipes a facial wipe is always nice if you are doing a long-haul flight or just want a quick refresh before you land and I always always always bring some form of hand sanitizer airplanes are basically you know metal boxes of germs so this spray pens are really nice because they don't take up much room and they provide the same you know antibacterial benefits as any other hand sanitizer whether you wear makeup or not before or after a flight it's always nice to bring a couple of the items that can help brighten your face before you land I always bring some mascara with me I don't like traveling with it on and I always like to apply it fresh just before I land and then I also like to bring an under eye concealer and that's just because I get really tired eyes and it helps me look wide awake even if I couldn't sleep on that 12-hour flight one of the most important things you're going to do on any flight is make sure that you pack a few things to keep you hydrated I bring a clap scible water bottle on every trip and it folds up really small when it's empty yet it fills to a full liter so you can have an empty bottle when you go through security and then after you're through Security fill it all the way up so you have a full water bottle for that flight other things I like to pack are lip balm just to keep my lips moisturized a nice hand cream and then I always like to bring a tinted BB cream and that's going to provide a little bit of tinted coverage while making my face nice and moisturized remember the three one one rule when packing liquids they need to be in containers that are 3.4 ounces or smaller in a one quart size bag and you're allowed one bag per person you're also going to want to bring something to keep yourself entertained and whether that's a laptop and iPad or just your phone maybe it's a book if you're old-fashioned these things are going to keep you entertained busy throughout the flight and you want to make sure you also pack all of the cords that go with them I can't tell you how many times I used to forget to pack the chargers for these things and you're super bummed when you get on the flight and don't have them so make sure your headphones and any chargers you're going to need for that flight and lastly and most importantly I want you to remember that all of these things can be replaced if you forget them when you get to your final destination sure a laptop might be more expensive but these are all material things that are a lot less painful to replace then let's say your passport so my last and final recommendation is to make sure that you triple check that you've packed your passport if you're traveling internationally any medical documents you might need also make sure you make copies of his important documents and store them in different bags in case the bag is lost stolen hopefully that doesn't happen and if you're also traveling with any valuables those should also go in your carry-on so any photography equipment jewelry anything that you can't replace this easily needs to go in that carry-on and that's everything there's really not much to it it's just a quick little checklist of things that I bring on every trip and this is the same whether I'm taking a weekend trip or a three month long trip you know the carry-on is pretty standard so you can definitely use my packing tips for every trip for your carry-on bag for the complete list of all of the items I pack in my carry-on be sure to visit my blog the link is provided below in the detail section thank you guys so much for watching and be sure to subscribe for future updates and weekly

hi everyone and thanks for watching I'm Kirsten the blonde abroad I'm going to be sharing my tips on how to style three complete travel outfits for springtime in California for under $100 so when you're packing first bring trip to a destination such as California you want to go through what you already own so you probably have some essentials like flip-flops jean shorts and sunglasses and then I like to shop at places where I can get things that extreme discounts like Burlington where you can find designer products for up to 65 percent off so I went to Burlington to style out outfits for San Diego San Francisco and Los Angeles three of the most popular tourism destinations in all of California so my first challenge when I got to Burlington was to find an outfit for San Diego I immediately went to the dress department because what's the easiest beachy outfit I could find a white linen maxi dress so I got this dress for only 16.99 and then I styled it with this leather French handbag that I also found at Burlington for only $29.99 and it normally retails at 159 dollars then I just went through my wardrobe and I styled it with some gladiator sandals a pair of cute sunglasses and just some simple accessories so I had a complete outfit for San Diego the next outfit I wanted to find was something for San Francisco and weather in San Francisco it can be a little bit unpredictable even in the spring so you you're sure bet is to find something with pants that you can easily throw a jacket over I found this amazing place suit it's a designer brand and it was only $19.99 normally retailing at $69 I then paired it with that same leather fringe bag that I could wear in San Diego again retail I cut in $59 that I got for only 99 and for my ally look I wanted to find something that was a little bit unique this top was perfect its sheer but has a pattern I could easily wear a tank top or bra let underneath it or you can used it as a swimsuit cover-up and I found this amazing leather designer clutch that shockingly was only $25.99 and normally a hundred and fifty nine dollars to complete the look so for all three outfits and my finds at Burlington I spent just over $100 and that's it three complete springtime travel outfits for California do you guys want more information on the outfits mentioned and the items I got from Burlington go ahead and click that little information box up there it'll take you to my blog where I outline everything in more detail be sure to subscribe to my channel for future updates and videos by yours truly thanks again for watching and see you next time

for the past six years I've been the blonde a bride I never knew that hair could be such a big part of your identity but I also didn't know that it could empower me the way that it has I aim to inspire women in many ways how they travel and how they let life in so I made it to China I grew up with a lot of stereotypes about what it is to be blonde but since pushing myself to me abound rates building a business online and setting out on a journey to do something different and impact other people's lives I've worked relentlessly to redefine these stereotypes and what it means to be blonde and I know that feeling good in your own skin is the first step to allowing yourself to be inspired Herbal Essences is on the same mission to help women take what life throws at them can continue to grow sharing your life on social media comes in a lot of pressure to look put together even when most of the time travel isn't as glamorous of a team I've flown nearly 700,000 miles around the globe and spent over $2,000 on planes over the past six years I've encountered some of the most amazing sights in the world and for the most part have only shared the highlight most people see me through a camera lens and they don't see the whole story we all know that travel isn't always easy it puts a strain on your relationships your body and your hair but for me the best part of travel is that it's not perfect the best trips are often messy when nothing goes to plan and when something as simple as sitting alone at a cafe in a foreign city reminds you just how beautiful this life truly is if there's anything I've learned through my experiences it's that you've got to keep moving growing and thriving even on bad hair days seek moments that make you feel more alive let life in pairs my the second hardest part about diving I'm gonna shave my head what do you think of me shaving my head yeah I've shaved my head exactly we can be triplets

hey everyone and greetings from Hama nasi Resort in Belize command Ozzie is an award-winning eco resort that supports responsible ecotourism they're doing their part to help control the local lionfish population that's devastating the Caribbean hominis a resort offers guests countless adventure activities from waterfall repelling to scuba diving one of the activities I was most excited about was the opportunity to learn more about the invasive lionfish species and to get the chance to catch cook and eat some for myself the red lionfish is rapidly destroying the ecosystem of the Caribbean though beautiful they are highly venomous and have few predators hence their ability to reproduce like crazy here in Belize lionfish can consume up to 80% of a small reefs juvenile fish population in just five weeks without fish like the parrot fish which graze on toxic algae that poisons the reef coral is dying and the entire ecosystem is compromised Jimenez has taken steps to control the local population and offers guests the chance to learn more about the problem and try their own hands at spearfishing I was really bad at spearfishing so I left most of the spear fishing up to the master diver we took a break midday to clean and prep the lionfish to bring back to the kitchen at Hama nasi after a second dive we had nearly 20 lionfish [Music] the kitchen staff prepared the lionfish in a few different ways for other guests to taste while conservationists give us more information on the invasive species and what home and Ozzy is doing to help alright Wow time [Music] [Music]

hi everyone Kirsten the blonde abroad here and I'm with my friend Amy Kaminski of nourished balance calm hi I'm Amy I'm a nutritionist and a natural chef and I'm happy to be here so food is a big part of why I travel and here in Southern California during the holidays Mexican food plays a really big role in what we need so today I'm going to teach you how to make a traditional tamale recipe but with a healthy twist can't wait okay so we have all of our ingredients pre-measured remember you can get the full recipe by clicking the link below all right so we're going to get started so the first step is to soak the corn husks and you can find the corn husks at any grocery store in the ethnic food section and you have to soak those for about 30 minutes in warm water second step is we are going to add some water to the blender and i'm using a Blendtec today but you can use a right mix or any other high speed blender okay next we're going to add we have some melted butter and we have some onion nice flavor in there I'm most important reading writing but it is the rewards horn right and for this thing for this recipe we use non-gmo organic corn so we just chose a little bit of healthier version so our next ingredient is going to be a one hold of garlic you can crack that I don't know what it is ever since I was little as much cracking leg I've gotten better at it all you should always get the shells in there probably remind you of baking when you're young yet walk back in here first yeah that's kind of a good technique so you know get in at shell dinner look ma no shells so one egg right and now add all the yummy spices so right now we just have some sea salt and pepper and cumin really the cumin is a really traditional Spanish spice and some lime juice lime juice you just give a little bit and then we have our masa which is our cornmeal and that is going to be our flower that's going to pull everything together alright so now we have all of your ingredients for the masa flour or the corn filling and these are going to be our toppings afterwards we'll get back to those two to be continued so now we just won this yeah you get our facts just blend it and then we'll roll our tamales okay so we just finished mixing our bus of flour we have our fillings of manchego cheese and some roasted red peppers and we have our soaked corn husks so now we can get to forming our young age male are you ready I don't know it's kind of a little bit of an art but it is really fun and once you get the hang of it it's pretty easy so first we're going to start make sure that the corn husk is in palm of your hand and we're going to take about just a big tablespoon of horvath in Italy place it right in the middle not to post at the top or the bottom just be copying me my first tamale guys so just like that and then we're going to take some of the munch a goat cheese you want to put quite a bit nice and healthy inside and then we're gonna add some of the roasted red peppers and then we're going to actually top our fillings again a little bit of a blanket good night all right so our next step is rolling the tamale so it's kind of a nice little technique what you want to do is take one side and kind of capture all the flour in there or all the mixture and then you're going to take the other side brake job and I just wrap wrap over exactly and then you take the bottom and you're going to fold it up we're going to wrap so that we get the bottom of it all nice and tough so you have to do I don't want any tamales filling up Adam so one tie to tuck it okay all right yeah so that's first tie hi all right and then we're going to tie the top just like a little present again part of the experience of its molly is the presentation we did that is easier than you might think I can do it you can do it all right so we're going to do the rest of them and pop them in the steamer cool so let's get rapid all right so we are going to pop into the steamer basket and we're going to steam them for 30 to 40 minutes just until the dough is nice and set nice and cooked all right we have our sting away all right so we pulled the tamales out of the steamer and we let them set for about five minutes and now they're ready to eat so typically after cooking these you get more than you actually eat but today we will be sampling some of course so thank you Amy so much for being here if you have a pleasure and so much for having me all right we'll see you next time happy holidays everyone the leaf stem dad you

the reason I started diving in the first place was to conquer my fear of the deep unknown Ocean now I have been fortunate enough to have dived all over the world and I've been able to experience the magic that lies beneath the surface but there was one type of dive that I had yet to do so I set up to Hawaii to once again face my fears and experienced the most incredible dive of my life what's scarier than the deep ocean the deep ocean at night the largest manta rays can grow up to 20 feet wide and weigh over 2,500 pounds seeing these gentle giants of clothes with a once-in-a-lifetime experience and one I'll never forget 
while we were gone for the day a stranger had saved our drifting boat from the path of a fairy in this act kindness however a stray road was sucked into the starboard crop disabling our engines we were immediately sucked into rock by a freak lightning storm with a disabled engine we were also unable to lift or let out our anchor so he had no choice consideration a team of its how you even cut our anger and fought to save our boat amidst the pouring rain wind and even hail you

hey everyone my friends over at tech 21 sent me a few of their new iPhone products to review and I'm actually super excited about this iPhone case it's one of the slimmest cases with impact protection I think I've ever seen so I'm going to give you guys a little look at their evil elite iPhone case along with their evo glass screen protector so I mentioned the evo elite case is really thin which is a big bonus for me I hate having a massive phone it's already big it's the sixth plus we all know it's huge what's really great about their products is that they're integrated with Flex shop so it's an impact protection material that absorbs impact when dropped so not only do you get the benefit of a slim phone but you're not going to worry about it cracking the other thing I really love about this case is that it's flexible and it has a really good feel in your hands it's got a nice grip to it so you don't feel like you're going to drop it it also has a really nice color around the edge it complements the phone completely I actually have the rose color around my gold phone and I really like it it also has these really nice buttons they're actually buttons and not just a rubber addition to it so they haven't meant to quickly press them the evo glass is amazing I always always always keep a glass screen protector on my phone this is gonna help to prevent the screen cracking if you drop it and also it protects your phone from scratches and smudges thanks for watching everyone you can grab links to the products mention in the video below be sure to give this video a thumbs up and subscribe for more videos from around the world

hey everyone and thanks for watching I'm Kirsten the blonde abroad and today we're gonna be talking about airbrush makeup for travel you might be thinking airbrush makeup for travel I know I thought the same thing before I thought it was only for makeup professionals who had taken a bunch of classes and you know it required something really technical or advanced to use and I also thought that the machines were really really big so how on earth could I possibly travel with it as it turns out airbrush makeup is perfectly travel friendly and here's a few reasons why one of the biggest benefits to switching to airbrush makeup for travel is that the machine itself is much smaller than you've probably imagined I use a dinair airbrush kit and this is the compressor it is a little it truly smaller than the palm of my hand and the airbrush tool itself is about the size of a pen aside from the machine being way smaller than I thought I actually carry less makeup with me now than I ever have this is everything I travel with now these tiny little bottles that are no bigger than my pinky I bring two bottles for foundations so I can blend to get the perfect match I bring a flush to add some color to my cheeks and I travel with one eyeshadow you can always bring more but I don't really wear a lot of eyeshadow and this is just a bronze color that I use to make my eyes pop but that's it and I swear if someone had told me about this years ago and this is all I would ever have to travel with I would have done this a lot sooner another amazing benefit of airbrush makeup is that you can finish your entire face in just a few minutes it goes on seamlessly and effortlessly as you do your entire face with foundation and then you can go in with the exact same tool and a blush or bronzer and then you can do your eyeshadow you can even do your eyeliner and you can tip your eyebrows if you want a lot of the times when we're using makeup brushes those brushes carry germs and oils and you're continuously putting those on your faces so the great thing about airbrush makeup is that you never actually touch your face your makeup goes from the bottle into the machine and onto your face through the air without ever being in contact with any germs or allergens so I've actually noticed that my skin has cleared up as I started using airbrush makeup and I have to say the best part of traveling with airbrush makeup for me is that you don't need to do a single touch-up you literally apply in the morning and you don't need to do anything to your face for the rest of the day all I bring with me in my day bag are these oil blotting sheets you can just take one and then you just dab it on your face to get any oil off that you acquired through the day very easy just a simple oil blotting sheet is all you need to bring in your bag while you're out for the day exploring so there you have it airbrush makeup is actually travel friendly indeed with a quick application small size you can bring it with you on any trip and have a flawless beauty routine in less than a few minutes for a limited time you guys can get 20% off a dinair makeup kit just follow the link below if you have any questions or comments also comment below and I'll be sure to reply to them thanks for watching see you next time
