WHO IS IN?. 13 lbs GONE!!!! Meet Claudia- Now  I had been a client of Claudia's for YEARS and she surprised me when I went in to see her for an appointment and she had lost 13 lbs!!! Remember  everyone has different goals! Let‚Äôs encourage and empower each other to work hard to be their best self possible. Let‚Äôs be the positive person in someone‚Äôs day!

She looks SO GOOD and is making such amazing progress!

In Claudia's words: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve lost 13 lbs since I started the 7 Day Jump Start  which was almost 2 months ago. I'm back to the weight I was when I got married 8 years ago! It was so easy and I was shocked at how much bloat I lost.

I took my time and read the whole program and found all of the exercises very motivating. I've basically carried on the eating habits I learned in those 7 days. I try to eat clean and unprocessed at least 90% of the time.

I also did the Rev-4 workouts  which I love! I do the DVD 5 days a week. Its challenging yet I know I can push through it. My family  friends and clients have all noticed the change.

‚ÄòI'm happier  I feel healthier and I‚Äôm so excited for this new chapter!!‚Äù

GO CLAUDIA!!!

WHO is next?

Get started on your OWN transformation and get the SAME program Claudia found success at: www.NatalieJillFitness.com/7-day-jump-start. Any goal is "possible" The struggle lies between our ears. 

It's the negative self talk  the self imposed stops and all the living in our heads that  we do that talks ourself out of taking actions towards our goals.

We have the power to fix this. 

BELIEVE you can first   DECIDE failure will not be an option and then COMMIT to being consistent working on your goals. 

No matter what. 

Drop the excuses- they do not serve you. 

Validating them may make you temporarily feel better but they will not change you üòê 

Ask for help  find solutions  find examples of others overcame same excuses that you have. Those people are out there! I promise. 

Stop comparing- instead question and learn from others. 

Stop analyzing- take action. 

Believe  decide  ask for support  commit and take consistent action. 

You've got this!. 3 minute FULL BODY - WORK IT!!!

Things don't just happen  you make them happen :) 

Make them happen! Here is what to do:

1. Tricep bridge sit throughs 
2. Raised Flutter kicks 
3. Leg open close scissors

In Nancy‚Äôs words:

"I had tried several different ways to lose weight  but I have found a way to keep it off thanks to you! I lost 21 pounds and 16 inches on your 4 week Jump Start plan  of which I followed for 10 weeks  but continued to eat healthy and exercise. 

I have four kids  which keep me busy  but now I feel great and I am full of energy. I have given everybody that asks how I did it your information!

REPEAT!. 8 lbs GONE and continuing to progress! Meet 28 year old Bianca! Everyone has different goals! Let‚Äôs encourage and empower each other to work hard to be their best self possible. Let‚Äôs be the positive person in someone‚Äôs day!

In Bianca‚Äôs words: 
‚ÄúPrevious diets did not work for me because I never knew how important nutrition was!  Before I had my son I loved to go to our local track to run and cross train  but I hit a major plateau and never really saw any more progress after I hit a certain weight. Low-Carb was my diet of choice  but I was still making unhealthy choices when the opportunity arose (THE CRAVINGS WERE STILL THERE).

I had my son via c-Section at 29 weeks!!! He needed me so I committed to breastfeed him for 10 months exclusively. As I breastfed him I could not diet because my milk supply would drop so I decided to stay committed to him. After his 1 year birthday  I decided it was time to work on me! I maintained a majority of the weight I gained with my son for the entire year. 

Prior to starting Natalie's programs  I lost 18 lbs and within the last 30 days  I lost 8 lbs - with more drastic results! (The 8 lb lost felt better than the 18 lbs lost  if that makes any sense).

I started with Natalie's program and I did well with it and really started to get motivated. One of the most important things I have learned is preparation! This program truly works!  I cannot wait to see my progress! Her positive emails and intense workouts really work!!!! Thank you Natalie!‚Äù

I lost 20 pounds gradually on my own and the last 20-25 with your program. It was not a diet  or a quick fix  but it was a lifestyle change which is realistic!!

I've also done your YouTube workouts (which less than 10 minutes is enough with your workouts!!) and I've learned that you don't need to do endless amounts of cardio to get results.

You all KNOW how amazing it feels when others encourage you and congratulate you on your commitment:)!!

In Shana's words:  
‚ÄúUntil the past few very emotional and stressful years  to cope with life I made unhealthy eating choices and didn't exercise. Before that I hadn't ever gained weight so this is the first time I have had to change my habits to healthy eating. I tried cutting back and restricting calories  but just kept gaining until I started Natalie Jill's 4 week Jump Start program.  

Life can throw you curve balls and in order to survive and help those you love survive...you sometimes let go of yourself. I have learned that as caregivers we must first take care of and love ourselves in order to properly take care of those we love. Thanks again for the kick in the pants that I so needed to find myself again."

In Jenna‚Äôs words: "I have two children and haven't been able to get back to the pre pregnant weight until now. I started Natalie Jill's workouts and then her Rev 4 program. I also started eating according to Natalie Jill's recommendations.

The combination of healthy eating in proper  unprocessed & balanced proportions with her functional fitness workouts  made a big difference. At 5‚Äô1‚Äù I started at 124 pounds and now weigh 110 with more muscle tone. It's amazing how your body can change using your own body weight for muscle building.

I have tried several "diets" and exercise programs in the past that left me feeling hopeless. With two little ones  I don't have time and resources for a gym. In only two months  this change is amazing and so healthy.

Real unprocessed food  the way it was intended and I feel so much better. The great thing is that you can do the workouts anywhere and it doesn't take much time. I'm continuing to build muscle with Natalie Jill's workouts  but I couldn't be happier with the results in such a short time!"

In honor of that  a workout in new Victoria Sport with my buddy Nicole üí™üèª AND her cutie human weight üë∂. 14 lbs GONE!!! Meet Erin  down 14 pounds and 14 inches! I am about to share Erin‚Äôs story- If you have something encouraging to say please comment away! Empowering and encouraging others and recognizing others accomplishments publicly is a great way to keep happiness and positivity contagious :) 

In Erin‚Äôs words: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm 43 years old  I have three children; ages 9  12 and 15. I have tried MANY different diets over the past 10 years. Frustrated  I gave up. It did not seem worth all the cost and effort it took.   

I felt better  but was stuck in my weight loss journey. I remember desperately trying to figure out what I was doing wrong. Was I not eating enough with all the exercise? Was I in starvation mode?  I went to the doctor for the third time and had my thyroid tested  it was normal. Was I not eating the right combination?  There were so many possibilities that could have contributed  but i felt lost as to where to find the answers.

After learning about Natalie Jill  I started her 4 Week Jump Start program. I feel that through Natalie Jill  I learned about macronutrients and how different body types need different amounts of macronutrients as well as the importance of the amount of each (protein  carb  fat) we should be eating. I looked at my protein intake in 2013 and was only getting 40 grams of protein at the most.  I looked at my protein intake while i was doing the NJ 4 Week and 7 Day Jump Start and I was getting between 115g and 140g of protein.  

Once I did that  the weight started coming off. I have eaten healthy foods for a very long time  but I would eat a serving of nuts instead of just 8 nuts with a carb and a protein.  I still have a long way to go  but I am getting healthier and losing the weight.  I feel that she made finding the answers affordable and available.  

She and her team are AWESOME!!  They respond quickly to questions and guide you in the direction that will help you. It is not a one size fits all organization. Natalie Jill's programs work for all shapes  sizes  ages and fitness levels.

I feel like Natalie Jill and her team are completely committed to helping everyone figure out what will work for them or what changes/additions they could make to help become successful in being " Happy  Healthy and Fit."  I love how "real" she is and how willing her team is to respond with suggestions to those struggling in their journey.‚Äù

Repeat the sequence! ARE YOU IN?. 8 months ago I was in a pretty bad place. At 46  I found myself in emergency surgery for a ruptured disc between L5 S1

The disc had ruptured and the material was wrapped around my spinal chord and I had lost most of the use of my right leg. 

My foot was dragging as I walked and I was in excruciating pain every move I made. I was warned that If I did not have the surgery quickly I would risk permanent nerve damage and could lose control of my bladder (uhhhh not an option)

I wanted out of pain. 
I wanted my leg to work again. 
I thought my career was over. 

Anxiety and worry went through the roof. 

I felt like a fake- a fraud- how could I as a ‚Äúfitness and nutrition expert‚Äù let this happen to me? 

I had so many SELF IMPOSED STOPS - I believed I was doomed and I started to give up on so much. 

 My business tanked  my relationships started to crumble- everything went wrong. 

And then I shifted. Again. 

You see  I had been here before- in that world of doubt and limiting beliefs where you think you‚Äôve failed and want to hide in a cave. And I shifted then and I could again. 

Sooooo.....
I shifted. I moved forward one day at a time. 

So my workouts are not what they used to be. Nor are my abs (yet) 

My nutrition got to get more evolved and my mindset and emotional intelligence got to grow up a LOT. 

I‚Äôm grateful for the journey for it‚Äôs in the JOURNEY that the breakthroughs happen. 

I take this pic post rehearsal this morning - putting the finishing touches on a new 4 workouts.

Recognizing others' accomplishments publicly is contagious...so read her story  and if you have something encouraging or positive to say  please comment away! 

In Michelle's words: "I have been struggling with losing weight for years. I have tried all diet pills & plans possible.

I chose Natalie Jill's 7 Day Jump Start because of the simpleness of it. I followed that for two weeks. After that  I purchased her 4 Week Program and continued to follow that.

I have had people tell me I needed to eat so much protein and so many carbs  but Natalie laid it out for me and told me what to eat and then gave a substitution list if I didn't like it. This is what I needed; someone to lay it out for me until my mind got it.

My mind finally got it and now I make conscious decisions on what I eat. It is ingrained in me  to make those decisions on my own and I have kept my 34 lbs off.

People have asked me what diet I am on  and I respond by saying I am not on a diet- I made a lifestyle change.
It is so easy to follow and I am so HAPPY with this program. The exercise videos on YouTube and Facebook are so easy to follow and they do not take hours to do.

I have not felt this good about myself since before the birth of my 14 year old son. Thank you Natalie for helping to inspire me and so many people."

There you have it! She made good choices that became ingrained and part of her LIFESTYLE...and look at her now!

3. Lean backs (1 minute). Meet Ellie! She went from hitting ‚Äúrock bottom on the inside‚Äù to making a lifestyle change. She lost the weight and got stronger inside and out! Before commenting remember this is an actual person who worked very hard‚Ä¶ positive  supportive  encouraging comments welcome! :) 

In Ellie‚Äôs words: ‚ÄúI am 41 and have been on a diet since I was probably 12. I tried a variety of methods ‚Äì vegan  carb cycling  fasting  etc.  I could do it for a week or so then I‚Äôd fall off the wagon again.  I let myself believe I was a victim and I was pretty much my own worst enemy ‚Äì physically and psychologically.

Needless to say  the emotional eating took a toll.  I felt horrible.  I looked terrible.  For the first time I was not meeting the standards I was supposed to uphold for my job.  I had lost control and could not find ‚Äúme.‚Äù

Just get used to this older body ‚Äì you‚Äôll never be the way you once were. Just buy the bigger clothes and be done with it.‚Äù That was pretty much the most depressing thing a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù had ever said to me. Around this time I came across Natalie Jill‚Äô‚Äôs story; she was a phoenix that rose from the ashes.  She was also about the same age as I am - what excuse do I have? Plus she was a woman who was more interested in being a good role model and wholeheartedly building the confidence of women ‚Äì someone who I can relate to and inspire me to be better.

I started just doing the 7-day Jump Start‚Ä¶for 4 weeks. NJ spoke to weight loss being 80% related to eating ‚Äì and that‚Äôs truly what I needed the most help with (obviously ‚Äì my track record is not stellar).  Working out was not the issue per se ‚Äì I workout every morning without fail.  However  learning to incorporate weights and functional fitness I think also rebalanced my addiction to pure cardio.

I think one of the aspects that helped me the most was understanding the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind everything.  Perhaps it is just the way I‚Äôm wired ‚Äì I just like to know ‚Äúwhy.‚Äù   

So what I have learned is that previous diets did not work because they are just that ‚Äì diets ‚Äì NOT lifestyle changes.  Diets are temporary; lifestyle changes are lifelong habits. And don‚Äôt settle.  You can be so much more with a little heart and courage. 

I am not perfect ‚Äì I‚Äôm human ‚Äì but I‚Äôm at least back on my feet and getting stronger inside and out every day.  I might not have been rock bottom financially  but I was pretty much rock bottom on the inside from those ‚Äúlife experiences‚Äù which I think at times is almost worse. I‚Äôm proof that anyone can do this.‚Äù

Before commenting remember this is an actual person who worked very hard‚Ä¶ positive  supportive  encouraging comments welcome! :) 

In Kady‚Äôs worrds: ‚ÄúI have tried so many weight loss plans  diet pills etc.  and nothing was working for me. I couldn‚Äôt stay committed to working out at all. Mostly because I didn‚Äôt know what I was doing. I finally hit a point where none of my jeans were fitting and I wasn‚Äôt comfortable in any of my clothes anymore. 

I was eating out every night and not working out at all. I finally decided I didn‚Äôt want to feel ‚Äúgross‚Äù anymore. I got a gym membership and went a few times over a 4 month time period. It was too boring for me to motivate myself to go. When I came across Natalie‚Äôs Facebook page I was very inspired by her story and the many other success stories. I have been doing this for 6 weeks and I am only halfway through the 12 weeks  but I have seen amazing results! I have lost 20 pounds! 

I went from a 29 to a 27. I honestly feel great! I don‚Äôt have to ‚Äúsuck it in‚Äù for pictures anymore and I am comfortable in regular clothes again. I have followed the workout plan almost exact. I really enjoy the workouts and the videos have helped me a lot. I did really well with the meal plan the first 3 weeks  but that has been more of a struggle for me to stick to. 

I do find when I eat bad foods I feel sick and regret it. I look forward to my workout every day & I have learned to enjoy healthy foods. I have learned so much. I would recommend it to anyone trying to lose weight  gain strength  and get toned. I am very excited to see what results I have in 6 more weeks!‚Äù

What many of you may not know is the story behind WHY I originally created 7DayJumpStart.com and NatalieJillFitness.

This was me a while back ...Now I realize to many of you I look just fine before (smiling!) But I want you to know that was not.

I was so sad in that picture on the left.  A newly single mom  a lot heavier than today  tired all of the time  depressed  hungry  grumpy  hormone fluctuations  the whole bit. I was also working full time  newly divorced   struggling financially big time and didn't have any extra time in my schedule.  Feeling so down.

I had/have an autoimmune disease (celiac) and could have accepted a lot of excuses which was very tempting but I didn't. Wallowed for a while and then one day I had had enough. I DECIDED to fix things. Did not starve myself  didn't do dangerous pills  and didn't do unhealthy calorie restrictions. Instead  figured out the formula. The same formula that now is outlined in my programs that years later has now helped tens of thousands like you.

You don't have to struggle through this.  You don't have to do this alone and you CAN create a whole new possibility for yourself! The formula in your 7 Day Jump Start program will work for you and it will help you!

Meet Anita and learn how she regained her energy and positive attitude! She is from the Netherlands  so let's show her the world supports her with positive comments from all over!

In Anita‚Äôs words: ‚ÄúI'm really bad at selfies so my photos do no justice at all to the changes that have been happening to me.

First of all I have my energy and positivity back! I'm enjoying working out and I'm enjoying cooking and eating healthy food. I've always focused on labels and eating clean but over the last year or so I've been eating for emotional reasons and that is always sweet things.

So my basic diet was very similar to the eating plan but with bigger portions and more carbs. The 3 major changes for me have been adding snacks  eating more healthy fats and water water water!

In the past previous diets has worked in the short term only. The Jump Start feels like a more sustainable way of eating and I like the fact that I don‚Äôt have to measure and weigh anything.

I am 65 and have still managed to lose inches and adapt the workouts to fit my own capabilities. It‚Äôs definitely a good program for everyone and I highly recommend it.‚Äù

Empowering and encouraging others and recognizing others accomplishments publicly is a great way to keep happiness and positivity contagious :) 

In Jacqueline‚Äôs words: ‚ÄúFor years  I had tried different programs and different products. It wasn't until I tried Natalie Jill's 7 Day Jump Start that something really made an impact in my life. By unprocessing my diet  my weight loss really started to show. The basic  key fundamentals really work. I felt I had the concept down and it taught me what I needed to know to keep doing it on my own. 

The workout programs are also a great key to success. No more hours on the treadmill or elliptical  just quick and targeted workouts to enhance the weight loss and make me stronger. 

Now  I am and stronger than ever. My core feels amazing. It was the 'unprocess my diet' and 'realistic' workouts that really made this impact. I am very grateful for finding NJ fitness.

In Elizabeth‚Äôs words: ‚ÄúI've always been an active gal. My favorite activity was the gym and anything that was fitness. I lived on the run and loved to eat but my active lifestyle and attempts at diets kept the pounds somewhat in control and me in the sexy clothes we all like to fit into.

Then it happened!! The first shoe dropped  I turned 40 and it seems like overnight none of the old remedies worked. I was still just as active  teaching a strength aerobics class in the morning  working full time in a physically demanding job  hitting the gym whenever time allowed.

I started to exercise harder and watched what i ate (ok maybe just a little) I slowed the weight gain down and thought I would be ok  when the second shoe fell! I turned 41!! And things were about to get harder! Now nothing was working and as I looked back at my vacation pictures I had to admit  (the bikini doesn't lie  does it?) it hadn't been working for a while.

Over the years I've tried every diet there was and never stayed on one more than a week and was at a loss as to where to turn. I needed a savior and when I found Natalie's website. I devoured everything I could about Natalie.

She made sense to me but I didn't become a true believer until I started the program and it worked. I lost weight I and I was able to fit into clothes I hadn't been into for some time  don't get me wrong it wasn't easy but it worked.

Now  I'm headed to Jamaica and want to see the "me" that dared to get into any bikini no matter how small. Not the one that was afraid that it was time to retire the bikini for a one piece.‚Äù

I‚Äôm about to share her story...If you have something nice and positive to say please comment! You all KNOW how amazing it feels when others encourage you and congratulate you on your commitment:)!!

In Beth‚Äôs words: 
‚ÄúFor year   I was an avid runner & really didn't struggle with my weight that much; but after a knee injury requiring surgery  I was never able to run at the level I did before.  

I tried Other diets/ programs but they really didn't work for me b/c I always felt deprived  hungry & irritable.  I also hate long  boring workouts in the gym & just could  not stay committed.  

NJs programs were simple  easy to follow  quick  & you didn't have to have any special equipment.   I weighed in at 165.  I followed the the 7 day Jump start eating & exercise plan & immediately began to see results.  I felt better  had more energy  felt less bloated & in just a few days my clothes began to feel less constricting!  

I also used NJ‚Äôs Rev 4 DVD for workouts as well.  The videos were awesome  only 10 minutes each.... Who doesn't have 10 minutes to work out?  Because you follow along with Natalie  on the videos  it's like she's right there working out beside you.  She's constantly encouraging you throughout the entire video. 

Before long I could tell that I was not only losing weight but I was becoming stronger & more toned as well.  Friends & coworkers were constantly complimenting me & asking what I was doing to get in shape.  I did have a couple of setbacks  my son was hospitalized for a few days & then I had a pretty bad car accident... Both incidents momentarily slowed my progress; but each time I got right back on track & quickly rebounded finding my "groove".  

I can honestly say that this has become a lifestyle change.  I no longer crave the sweets  fast foods  or junk food anymore.  Nor do I feel deprived when someone eats a donut in front of me.  I've learned that healthy food is good food & it is very satisfying.  I now weigh 139 & I am able to wear all my favorite clothes again...all size 8!!!   I know that I never could've done this without NJ  her programs & all the wonderful supporters I met!  The entire NJ team rocks!‚Äù

Don‚Äôt you LOVE IT when people recognize your efforts and compliment you on your achievement...let's hear it for Dana! Read her story  as I know MANY of you can relate!

In Dana's Words:"I was tired of being fat. Plain and simple. I never had to diet until I hit my 40's. I went through many diet fads. I‚Äôd always gain the weight back. I came across Natalie's page on FB. I decided to buy the Jump Start program to learn what I should be eating.

I wasn't sure I could do it because I had a neuroma removed from my foot and I figured if I couldn't do it now  I never would. I started slow. Couldn't finish all the exercises  but I was trying. Wish I had gotten before pics when I started  but I was ashamed of the way I looked. After 4 weeks I felt better so decided to do a 2nd round.

That's when I started realizing I was getting somewhere  and when I took before pictures. 

I'm a very picky eater. Veggies? Are you crazy? I read the program and kept saying no way. I finally figured out that I had nothing to lose and everything to gain. Do what you can  as you can.

I'm surprised that I am eating some veggies and more fruit and salad. I've lost 20 lbs and a ton of inches. I have definition in my arms and legs and abs. 

So thank you Natalie Jill for encouraging me and empowering women to make smart choices. You are right  there are NO excuses. Only solutions!

Don‚Äôt believe me? Imagine that your ‚Äúidol‚Äù called and wanted to meet you? Or your dream job had an opening for you? Or that crush you have called and asked you out? Or that you had an opportunity to go ‚Äúcollect‚Äù a milllion dollars. What would your energy be like then? 

Tired is not just a choice. It‚Äôs also not just factual based on sleep and food. It‚Äôs also a huge matter or PASSION and PURPOSE.. Upper Body Challenge- Are you IN? 
Here is the plan: 

Wall Pushups
Pushups on Knees

Meet Claudia- Now  I had been a client of Claudia's for YEARS and she surprised me when I went in to see her for an appointment and she had lost 13 lbs!!! Remember  everyone has different goals! Let‚Äôs encourage and empower each other to work hard to be their best self possible. Let‚Äôs be the positive person in someone‚Äôs day!

She looks SO GOOD and is making such amazing progress!

In Claudia's words: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve lost 13 lbs since I started the 7 Day Jump Start  almost 2 months ago. I'm back to the weight I was when I got married 8 years ago! It was so easy and I was shocked at how much bloat I lost.

I took my time and read the whole program and found all of the exercises very motivating. I've basically carried on the eating habits I learned in those 7 days. I try to eat clean and unprocessed at least 90% of the time.

I also did the Rev-4 workouts  which I love! I do the DVD 5 days a week. Its challenging yet I know I can push through it. My family  friends and clients have all noticed the change.

I'm happier  I feel healthier and I‚Äôm so excited for this new chapter!!‚Äù

guys family Jill here today we're talking about food prep to help you lose weight system number one is to make your healthy foods marketable let me explain I like to keep everything in my refrigerator already washed ready to go and organized and glass containers and I'm really picky I like the square glass containers but everything's ready to grow so when I'm hungry or having cravings I'm ready to eat it's already easy to grab so I'm less likely to go and grab processed foods or junk food or run out to a restaurant because I got simple easy to grab snacks ready to eat and it's very appealing and marketing wise it's great even my daughter when she opens the fridge this is what she sees to work more likely to grab those healthy foods tip number two is to plan out the staples and the go-to meals for infants I always have already ready grilled chicken breast eggs Granville I've even got suits I'm a big fan of soup so I'll do this one is my egg drop soup with chicken in it but it's already ready to go so it's super easy to grab it heat it up and have a complete meal really quick same with salad already ready to go in a container so I'm less likely to want to go out to the restaurant or the store it's already right here tip number three is don't even bring the junk into your home leave it at the store my thing is if I'm going to have something that is considered junk if I want ice cream or I want to cook here I want a special treat instead of keeping it in the house which is always an iSight and ready to grab you know it's there I'll make a special trip out just to get that one item and have it that way you're just having your one portion and you're done with it as soon as you bring it into your house it gets super tricky because you're going to know it's there you're going to crave it you're going to think about it you're going to likely overeat it to number four always have things in your freezer adds back up on hand for instance I always got chicken here and I do a lot of frozen fruits and vegetables so although I like the fresh I have the backup plans ready to go in my freezer protein balls that I've made even my dragon fruit already plan in the freezer that way if I want to make a full meal it's already here ready to peel out and cook tip number five prepare your food as soon as you get home from the store instead of just stuffing in a drawer when you just take vegetables like this in a bag and you stuff as where like this intend to not only forget about it and we're ready to have it it's bad it's unappealing and it takes work you think oh I have to clean it I have to cut it and you're less likely to want to grab it but if you take the time to prepare it get it ready as soon as you get home put it in individual bags or containers you're more likely to grab the healthy food and eat it I hope you found that helpful for more videos from me more workout nutrition recipes make sure you check out my channel below and hit that subscribe button 
hi guys today I want to jump on and share with you my back surgery rehabilitation repeal those of you new to my page what had happened and what I'm doing to get back to where I was and how it may help you so first of all I was just a little refresher on what I went to for those of you know my page it's the story before I want to share exactly what happened how I got injured and what I'm doing to fix it so hi okay so first of all what I just had recently had done was called a laser and a scopic spine surgery and the reason I had that was I had for a long time of holding death slightly bulging slightly bulging a lot of them get a slightly bulging disc and I was able to fully manage that through my workout my trainings do a lot of core training through all of that but what happened was over time as I age I'm 45 years old of them 45 things start to change and what I was doing started to not work as well even though I would get flared up flare-ups and able to master pain temporarily it just kept escalating and then about we'll see about five or six weeks ago now I was really pushing things and my back started hurting like I've never felt my life like crazy back pain it was worse than late with names and for those of you given labor you know what I'm talking about it was seriously Ward from labor pains and I didn't know what was wrong I didn't know why my back hurts so bad and everything I need to do press up complain I'll discuss to help fix that was not working so I went and had an MRI and what it happened was my disc had not only just bulged it had now herniated and it is actually ruptured and when it ruptured there was this material everywhere and it was severely and hinging my spine and it was brought round sooner so what happened was not my back pain stopped hurting but all of a sudden my brain wasn't working at all it was all of a sudden from my piriformis because you don't hear well right here all the way down to my voice it's like it was turned off and whenever my brain was telling to do it was not doing so if any of you know what sciatica is I would guess sciatica which means that the nerve passed down that leg so if I was sitting I would go to standing I would get this shooting electrical pain cell like an electrical shock and would throb but even worse than that my leg was not working right it wasn't work is right and when I was going to walk just normal walk I was riding my foot and boys drop is when your foot actually drops and I start dragging my foot so he was escalating every day my back is stopped hurting that the leg pain was getting worse and worse and I was basically dragging my foot as I walked so it was with super scary I know natural remedies would have fixed that and Lin explained yes so you get disc matter and maybe dudes all on its own eventually of Norman to your body could you get the size of my variation if you don't believe me I've got an MRI and you can look at but the size annoying on the in herniation was so huge and a rupture was so severe the longer I was going to wait for surgery the more I was going to risk losing permanent use of that those nerves and permanent nerve damage did not be able to use my leg and I don't know about you in your opinions but for me it was not an option anymore I wanted surgery and I wanted it fast so my options for surgery were really Tuesday once something called a microdiscectomy and a microdiscectomy is when they go in it's minimally invasive and they remove that this matter in two thousand four to six weeks healing time and then you've got to start of physical therapy and rehabbing and it regenerates very very slowly like four to six months so depending on when you have your injury and how long you wait it can delay how long that regenerates I know a lot of people have met I have that happen it took me two years to get my legs feeling back or it took them a few a few months a few years they still don't feel it and uh scared me so that was option one option two was have something called a left le FF this is a laser and if topic buying surgery and I chose that because it's a newer procedure it is definitely riskier without the right surgeon but with the right surgeon it is amazing and it's super minimally invasive it's two days two days recovery time today so you're up and out injuries it doesn't mean your lasers better your so don't want to just give you an operation here is unless you've on each other's heels I wanna show you this scar site revering the camera down can you see this little right there that is far too about the size of a quarter a little line that's they do for the for the bigger endoscopic fine degree they go and up very gonna leave agent and remove all that disc matter when y'all cutting through tissue without kind of your muscle without putting your bones and take it away from the spine which is phenomenal so when I woke up I'm a little sore than surgery psych but within two days I had no back pain at all and no leg pain which is just outstanding it's outstanding however my right leg my right way here is still not working fully it's working at about 75% so for those of you dealing with it or notice somebody that is I want to show you something guys like for starters if I don't have shoes on I can't stand well at all I'm going to show you opening with cameras down here see my feet here okay that was shoe my foot came bit if severe okey ponies keep it and it could if I walk it doesn't swing thing it kind of swings in so my big toe is completely stuff right now and it's not working right so what I've done is I had to buy special answer earth that for shoes that will help with pronation so it's basically straining out my foots instead of being here it's been here and I'm wearing running shoes pretty much 24/7 there's no heels in my future at least now I'm not ready to give them up forever but at least four or five months I won't be wearing heels at all so when I think I'm wearing those one immatures every day and I'm wearing those inserts now that allowed me to be to be bold to be completely mobile however I have to train my brain again and that nerve path to be able to walk right without you - so I'm doing a little both my ankle stability is completely shot so so what I'm doing and again I'm a doctor you guys not a physical therapist I'm just somebody with a fitness nutrition background I'm a licensed Manticore nutritionist and functional fitness trainer and I'm just sharing my journey and what happened with me I do not want you to take my advice over your doctors or your own physical therapist I'm just sharing what I went through so for me what I'm doing daily is although my job or my surgeon is given me no restrictions that you can do anything you want I really can't do anything because if I were to run it's all over if I kind of balance on one leg I'll fall over so I can do things but I am limited because of that mobility so some things I'm doing upper body training I am doing like I always did to differences and I want you to watch this purely anything I'm doing anything flip it down to show do anything I'm doing is a teacher four times since I'm a whole different definition of it now I have pretended this from here to here is one thing I'm pretending that a students together so anytime you it moves as a unit it was no more to my back more at all this date as unit let me show you her name if I were doing a footbridge watch series as a unit everything through those diskette ever since date as a unit always when I'm doing any exercises my boobs are tight my ribs are down and it stays here so there's no park and swimming it's just fabled razor I'm keeping that completely as one unit all together now subscrip delay strength which I go to go to push down there you can see I'm doing a lot of cat freezes okay I have to work on the bracelet so I'll do the work on the left and then I go to the right I have to put onto something so I'm forcing it slowly but you can see I'm completely wobbly but I force it everyday I'll pull it on to something if I need to forcing it it does not move like this but I have to force through itself or through it with a shoe on and I will take a shoe off and forth right another thing I'm doing is I'm doing a lot of glute bridges because I'm trying to activate this glue but I'm keeping ribs down keeping everything the Vans doing it really trying to activate this fruit those goons and as soon as I feel anything in my lower back not doing anyone I'm taking that totally out so every day is calf raises it's doing Buddhist bridges to strengthen them salute keeping everything impudent I'm not seeing a lot of eight a goal we need an angel my surgeon said write an alphabet who would you're quite so I'm doing that a lot of ankle circles a lot of grazing and then something I got from a physical therapist with Talib wrap where I put a calendar for and using my toes I'll pull it through me because I don't have use of all of my toes right now except for my big toe so those the things that's I am doing I'm also walking but right now I'm walking maybe a mile and a half a day as soon as I go past to the three miles a day everything's recurring again I'm not trying to push it doing just enough to retrain my legs and not enough to overdo it now some of you saw that I did  can pull up the other day and everyone like freaking out and saying what are you doing well it's fine because I'm taking my lower back out of the equation I'm keeping it stable I'm using my alpha body that I can do swinging and kicking I would not do right now so that's the type of thing that I'm doing and I hope that helps help you some out and then really important I got a sandwich down so then we're sitting so see this right here stand up get this right then the soup can moving up my monitor because the thing that people don't realize is hand up yes if you can get a on a test and you're keeping your head down to look that's creating another thumb in your neck you want something you're looking up so you're here so we're I was working on not having any additional any additional process of that so anyway that was my story on what I did for my bathroom my bathroom rehab when I'm continuing to do I'm post-surgery not even three weeks right now can I didn't have a my food discectomy I had a laser endoscopic spine surgery which is I feel a better procedure if it's an option for you it's between you in your surgeon but because it's a super quick recovery time and because it's so minimally invasive and did not go through my muscle or bone or anything so definitely one to share thanks guys bye 
hi guys I've got a good topic for you today today I'm here with my good friend James that's cool and from evolution fitness and what we're going to talk about is the whole concept of why some areas people live to 100 and I've always said I don't know why you I've always said I would love to live to 100 if I still had my mind about me and I can be healthy but I didn't I don't want to be in that position if I've got chronic illness and I'm not feeling good and being somebody that's really into to health nutrition and fitness and staying healthy you know I've always wondered you know why some areas to people stay healthy for so long and in some areas it seems that everything starts to fall apart even at age 40 so you guys for you those of you that have followed my lives before if you like my information please share this video so others can join in because I'm going to introduce you to some great stuff with James and for those of you new to my page I'm Natalie Jill am a licensed master sports nutritionist and a functional fitness trainer and what I do is I simplify fitness and nutrition for people like you to help you guys get happy healthy and fit and become your best you possible and I love bringing new people on to interview them so you can learn more so it's not just coming for me but you can learn from some great people that I have brought into my life so I wanted to introduce James Maskell to you who i met not too long ago but he has done he did some fantastic did a fantastic TED talk and this guy is so innovative and he's got some great information and I'm gonna stop rambling because I got a lot that I want him to share but I wanted to start with this whole concept of those blue zones and what that means and why some communities live long and healthy absolutely so there's this guy called dr. he's in a lot of Dan Buettner who was working with the National Geographic and he went around to find way called centenarians people where there was this group places around the world where people living to 100 consistently and there's one in Loma Linda California just up the way here there's also one in in Costa Rica as one in Greece is one in Japan and what he found was that there are a lot of things that they had in common there are a lot of things that were different but the one thing that I took away from reading his book was that they all had a really strong sense of community and you know that's one of the things I think that you know certainly in American culture sort of lacking we you know sort of become a little isolated and so you know I've been interested in what can we learn from that how can we reproduce that because what's really interesting is none of those places have a very advanced medical system yeah it's not the stuff is being done to them it's just a part of their culture to move a lot to eat healthy and to have a strong sense of community and support them and so we've been looking at ways to sort of reproduce that and create you know in our business the evolution of medicine how do we inspire patients and doctors to work together to recreate the kind of situation where people can link to us when you give like an ideal community when you talk about the idea of community what is the definition of that look I know you said there's some areas but explain what a good community would mean and why that affects help you know I think it's it's all the things that happen that provide support so you think of like in the old days yet the extended family right everyone knows everyone supports everyone you know the majority of times when you're you know you're in sort of IH group it's it's it's the support of someone who's bringing you chicken soup when you're sick or someone who's helping you to get to the see the doctor or you know partners that you do you know you cook with you play together you pray together you're connecting with other people or time there's something just inherently healthy about a strong interactive community and so you know what we've what we've looked at is you know what are the things that they are doing and we see it's these social bonds now what's really interesting is this sounds a little like woo woo and you don't really know what it is but there's some amazing new research coming from the UCLA stress lab and these guys have a they're doing some research called human social genomics and what they're doing is actually testing people's genes and seeing how their gene expression changes when they have you no good personal relations personal relationships or not so to give you an example if you and I and our friends and we will work at a company and we all get laid off right on the same day we all get laid off we will get fired there's a we have a two-time risk of depression so our risk of depression goes up two times whereas if I just get fired and I'm the only one and I'm singled out the social bond between me and you is cut and I'm specific it's just me the risk of depression goes up 20 times wow so it's it's like if there's a if there's a moment if there's been moments in your life where there's been an intention from someone to sever a social bond like you know a divorce or you know friendships breaking up otherwise at that moment has a real deep physiological effect on your body and you know one of the things that if that happens over and over again it can lead to depression it can lead to inflammation it can lead to all number of chronic diseases and so you know one of the things we're looking at all the time is how can we create structures and encourage structures that give people a strong sense of relationship someone to talk to so I want to exercise with so I want to pray with someone to eat with you know eating is a big part of the social bond and so you see the kind of cultures like you know in Italy eating is a family affair you know in you know in Loma Linda California where they have this blue zone it's it's the seventh-day Adventists and they don't eat one day and they walk together as a community the whole time you've been to loma linda it's pretty polluted place it's not the hell it's not like Costa Rica where everything's beautiful and whatever but they've the the things that they do together Trump the pollution in the bowl of LA so this is really interesting because I think community really gets left out of the equation a lot like we talked about people are educated on I need to work out I need to eat healthy food I need to see my doctor I need but people are isolated why have you think what has changed that is it is it internet is that what what has made us feel what has made this community sense because I remember just as a kid even I think back to and this is I'm 44 so just being a kid I'm were just walking outside and playing with the kids in my neighborhood and you only I didn't have I didn't stay in touch with people all over the country i had my neighborhood we were friends within that's even changed what what do you think on targets ease of communication you know with other people I think you know it's it's a part of the success of capitalism in a certain way it's like the dark side of that way look if everyone has their own home and everyone needs their own lawn mower whereas if you know if you're in a community maybe you could share a lawnmower you know so it's like everyone it's that but it's also like you know it's the upward mobility of society we are at record comfort levels right where people live in amazing homes and you know everyone society's generally got you know change astronomically in 100 years you go back a hundred years to 1916 and see what life was like in America there it's almost unrecognizable and that's come with an amazing benefits I mean you've seen throughout 20th century the life expectancy has gone up now they just actually said in the last couple of weeks there was a report that came out but for the first time life expectancy is not only stopped growing but it's actually starting to come down which is really scary but there are the you know that the sort of the negative side to our prosperity has been more social isolation you used to have extended families all living together you had multi generations of families living in the same house now everyone lives in separate houses you know you used to have kids all living you know sleeping in the same bed now it's all separation and so the same thing you know my TED talk I spoke about the similar similarity of that and say you know our reaction with our interaction with germs we used to have a lot of germs around and then we started like killing all the germs and then suddenly we're isolated and you know we don't have the same support these germs that keep us healthy so all of these things are you know our leading towards a situation where chronic candy disease can thrive and what we see in America and all over the industrial industrialized world is an increase in crime disease and it's partly to do with the food it's partly to do with the social conditions it's partly to do with the lack of exercise and the you know sitting in front of the computer and not living the way that we are you know adapted to live but I think that one of the things that's exciting is that this the social component if you can get that right and you can do other healthy behaviors like working now eating right whatever in a group environment then you get sort of like a synergistic better than where you have accountability partner support partners I've seen on your videos you've talked a lot about a lot about accountability so what what two people i'm sure there's getting we're going to question about this but what what would somebody do if they feel like they don't have this community and their their feel because even if you're if you're feeling isolated then you probably really are isolated so what do you suggest that someone would do well what I think is that you know there's a double-edged sword of the internet right here we are learning in front of a whole group here and it's been isolating but what I have found is that you know before the internet you didn't really know who is interested in the same stuff as you right in the street you can really tell who was interested now you might see the same person at the farmers market there weren't as many farmers market you might see the same people around in the gym but now what you have is you can use these online tools to be able to create offline connections so what more and more people I see doing is is going to find communities online then I see a lot of community leaders like yourself you know finding ways for people to find each other locally so to find accountability parts to find support partners to you know to be able to build local connections so you things like look at the company meet up like meet up there you can find a meetup in your community for almost anything Scrabble you know as it there's everything and so you know I think those kind of solutions are good you know you have on craigslist yell activity partners you know different social organizations I mean if you look at where is the biggest impact in chronic disease be made it's been made when you infuse health into an already existing community so mark hyman and Daniel Amon did this thing at the Saddleback Church where they had they had 200 and that 20,000 people who were a part of the church but these 20,000 people get together on Sunday but on Wednesday night they'd have a group of five a Bible study group so they infuse some education about health and that between all these people they lost like 250,000 pounds and it was because they already had a you know a social group so when I see church groups walking together or there you know it's belonging to different social organizations church has played a big role in that you've seen you know that you know that religion is sort of like fall away in certain parts is strong in other parts and so I think that there's new social organizations that have to that are emerging to either replace that or add value to that so is there something happen because I think people do long to be part of something and that's why people get attracted to their specific church or their group or their whatever it is um do how does that affect people help like what actually happens that something happened chemically when you're part of a group or what is it just because you're around them there's more behavior that you start wanting to emulate what is it that's happening well the cool thing is about this you know human social genomics no one really knew what the sort of the biochemistry was but it's obviously a lot of you know very it can affect so deeply like you can affect have a cellular level but it can also affect the systemic level so what we're seeing is that stress social this is social stressors one area of stress and as you know stress is like one of the leading causes of chronic disease but people thought that stress was about like the job or money or otherwise but it's this social stress that's the most powerful and so you know the mechanisms are becoming more clear now as we can actually you know the only reason why human social genomics actually exists right now is ten years ago you couldn't afford to do genomic panels on everyone now with 23andme it costs $99 right to do your genomic panel and so scientists can do a genomic panel every month or six month and trace the you know trace what's actually happening so we don't know exactly the mechanism but it's definitely something to do with the autonomic nervous system and the and the parasympathetic sympathetic balance and that's a you know it's an area that needs probably more things to you know more research but it's very exciting to see at least we're understanding what's at the cause of office now well Brooks what Brooks is behind the camera from what are we getting any questions that we're not addressing yet people are just loving it you know some of our chiming in like the Rose she's like my dad lived like almost a hundred with no chronic disease the exercise daily did tai chi sao ma really time I think that functional aspect of being a healthy events a lot I think this community set fascinated because it is something we tend to all over look and I think people are becoming more and more isolating and nobody's aware of how that's actually how affecting their health absolutely yes it is happening but I think as we start to learn we can start to take you know and that's the beauty of the internet you're double edged sword is now you're finding out about it you can realize okay this is potentially something that I can do something it's not something that cost me anything it's not something so our work up until now has really been focusing on helping doctors to create structures around their practice so you know one cool thing and I think you're your fans might like this so I've got a couple of doctors now that are doing something like this people say guess what it takes me hours each day to cook all my food right I don't have time right I'm to cook so some of our doctors are getting groups of people together imagine 20 people coming together you rent a commercial kitchen and you cook 20 meals all together so rather than cooking one meal for three people you're cooking one meal for 20 people and then you everyone's cooking at the same time you have a meal together at the end and then you put all your stuff in Tupperware and you've got all your food for the whole week in 90 minutes hey RNAs that community so you're doing your community your meeting new people you're making healthy food you're controlling all of the ingredients you're eating unprocessed right yeah exactly just like the book says and you're creating real food in community that's the kind of thing that hits all of those areas and that's what we're trying to help dr. sachin patel is a guy in Mississauga Ontario and that was his idea he started doing it and through our business through our functional forum and we speak to all of the progressive doctors out there doing functional integrative medicine trying to help them to recreate these structures of scale I love the whole idea of the progressive functional doctors that you mentioned a few times too can you i would i'm just going to just touch on the real what that means yeah so look most doctors are trained in reducing symptoms getting rid of your symptoms but what that's that really works well and acute disease if you get hit by a truck if you have an infection otherwise you want someone who with those skill sets if you have chronic disease you want someone who's going to improve the function of your Systems chronic disease especially those diseases that have a lifestyle component heart disease type 2 diabetes and more and more autoimmune disease we're sealing that you know lifestyle played a role in it and so you can't unwind that with drugs it has to be a lifestyle shift and what you're seeing is you know more and more examples of people reversing their type 2 diabetes reversing their autoimmune disease reversing heart disease by by working with doctors who can help to implement these kind of lifestyle changes is going to be changes in diet it's going to be changes in the way you deal with stress and what's really exciting is that this business is called the evolution of medicine because it's medicine adapting to its new environment well the new environment is chronic disease the old environment was acute disease when everyone was dying of typhoid and that kind of thing we did well with that through you know social programs and nutrition and and sanitation you know we did really well with with dealing that now we have a new you know we have a new environment the medicine is having to adapt to its environment and what we're helping to do through the evolution of medicine is helping doctors to create structures that work for chronic disease oh this is that's a pretty innovative cool concept too because I think this is what is missing in so many places and I know you guys can relate to about feeling look when you when you don't feel well or something's going wrong you're being diagnosed something then you go to the doctor you're just given a prescription and it's a quick five or ten minute appointment and you're not nobody's talking about community or the whole everything else that's going on you know dr. that modern medicine was created in an environment with acute disease and so they were trained in that and it's really not the doctors fault you know they were training that they're just in a system where they can only see people for seven minutes so let me give you an example in another way the doctors doing this imagine instead of imagine instead of you know seeing a doctor for five minutes you and 16 other people with type 2 diabetes could be in a group so you know rather than the doctor trying to say the same thing that they're trying to say in 30 minutes in two minutes which is impossible they give a 30 minute lecture they tell everyone like they can operate with the same question yeah and then then the necklace oh that's 30 minutes and then the next 60 minutes the doctor takes each person one by one for like a semi-private visit where they might work on your medication or diet and a health coach is actually facilitating a conversation with the other people because some people are introverts they're not going to ask the question some people extraverts they can ask then accountability buddies my mother-in-law last year lost 100 pounds and the only thing that she did differently was that she had to she had to call someone at the end of every day and tell him what she that's I was just being accountable well and she didn't want to call him and say hey I had like four Big Macs no I she say any I did what I said and that and it was just that accountability now is there anything to change so look the thing is about that kind of thing doesn't cost anything the biggest problem we have here medicine is that everything costs a lot there's like a significant amount of cast on medicine whether it's the patient paying or the company paying or the government pain it's going to run out of money and so what we need to do is find ways to recreate this community recreate this peer-to-peer support because that didn't cost her anything and guess what the person who was that accountability partner it didn't cost them anything and you know what it's like there's value to the teacher too they get value from like just being a supportive person you see a a you know alcoholics anonymous those kind of things you know your sponsor this is not a financial transaction right this is just people helping each other through and that's I think what we really need to do so that thus far we've really been coming at it from the doctor angles and helping medicine to evolve but in our next iteration we're really going to bring it straight to the patients and say hey let's get together in groups let's work together and some other structures that we've set up for you no insurance or other things have been looked to see how we can work together to bring down costs and make it talk a little bit more about that about um yeah solar I grew up in England and in England um you don't have health insurance everyone's is covered by the government now people think that that might be a solution in America the single-payer but actually a map England's and even worse trouble than than the u.s. right now all the doctors are quitting there's a strike of doctors in the UK right now and is the same problem chronic disease costs a lot more and there's not enough money to go around to pay all the doctors we tell you say and go into those Crichton's these costs I don't think people understand it because it's like they only pay hundred hours a month I don't think they understand like those numbers you were talking about earlier because I don't think people really grasp like yeah the drugs that you take for type 2 diabetes metformin like humera an autoimmune disease drug this cost tens of thousands of dollars a year it's just that your insurance company is paying for us so your cost blind that's the other thing is you're not seeing the cost that actually it costs the medical system your insurance companies pay for it why do you think your health insurance is going up thirty forty percent every year it's because dad paying those costs and they're passing them on team what are some of those annual costs just I don't think people really know that the highest patients could be 50 to 250 thousand dollars a year you know we're working with some companies where they're paying the cost their self-insured these companies and they're having to reinsure themselves against the potential that 10 of their employees get type 2 diabetes and that costs 250 thousand dollars a year that's 2.5 million dollars for 10 employees and now everyone get off and there's no way because 10 employees they're not even making their gross salaries not 2.5 million years so that's where it's like that's where you know like you said doesn't matter who's paying for it bt's yeah so like you know so that this is a huge problem and what these functional doctors that we're working with doing it like how do you reverse that how do you get people off the drugs and that's the that's the new game in town is like how do you reduce costs because in America there's not the incentives to reduce costs because everyone's in on making a ton of money insurance insurance is the one everyone thinks like your insurance company wants to save you money I want to save costs but they don't because it's cost plus if you read the Obamacare legislation they have this 8020 rule so if your health insurance is a thousand dollars a month they take 200 and 800 goes towards payment of services if it's you know a hundred dollars a month that would only be twenty dollars so there's an incentive to keep the numbers going up same with farmer same with hospitals when I found this out I was shocked yeah wasn't that shots but I was a little bit shot but that's why we're working to try and create systems that really work so yeah you know these people there's certain people that they cost a lot and it's not their fault you know they're just doing they go to the doctor and the doctor tells them what to do but that's the standard of care and these heroic doctors have gone outside of the standard of care to learn about how you reverse chronic disease and I was telling you earlier it hasn't come to America yet but it's going to come on BBC america check out my main man dr. Rankin taronga chatterjee six foot seven indian doctor on BBC TV reversing type 2 diabetes in 30 days reversing chronic pain and opioid addiction in 30 days because it was like dr. oz mean Supernanny where he goes to live in your house high quality days and so you're seeing more and more examples of people reversing their crime disease and so people like oh you can do that yeah that's a possibility as your doctor didn't tell that they're like you're on that form in forever that's what they tell you sorry and so you're getting more and more examples and so these heroic doctors have learned things like functional and integrative medicine learning how to help patients adapt and change their lifestyle so then get well up until now this has been on people like you and you know to empower people to work out better to do things and that's why I think you know people like yourself have a really important role to play in changing healthcare but we need the medical system do you need the matter because I mean I can share nutrition and fitness and how and mindset it but I'm not a doctor so I don't have that credential so you know what I always tell people this is my opinion this is what I know this is what I shared it people is with help but I'm not you still have to check with your doctor but then it's who's that doctor and what are they telling out absolutely and so you know what with the first thing we're trying to do in our business is improve the supply of these doctors because there's a demand for functional medicine but hasn't been the supply and just to go back to what you saying before so you know one of the things that we started last year was a company called Liberty direct its Liberty direct org and it's an affordable alternative to health insurance and what this means is basic like you me and 35,000 of our healthy friends decide that we're going to share our costs okay so if you get hit by a bus and it costs 35 grand we'll all chip in a dollar for you that's eventually a voice doesn't work exactly like that but that's the premise of it and the cool thing is is that because everybody's sort of doing the same thing stay healthier there are green tea you agreed to be healthy you agree not to abuse drugs you agree not to no abuse alcohol you agree you know you have to be kind of healthy to get in it's not health insurance as an alternative to health insurance but the key thing that's valuable about liberty direct if you're a member you're exempt from the Obamacare mandate so you don't have to and you can see you can look up health cost sharing if you google it you'll see there's been articles in The Wall Street Journal recently saying guess what all the healthy people are going to health cost sharing because guess what it cost half of half the amount and so if you go to liberty direct org check it out see if it's a fit for you I put myself and my family on it we feel like it's a it's a solution for healthy people to be able to not essentially have to pay everyone else's course and you know if you do have a chronic condition that's what Obamacare legislation was designed for it's very downside to doing something like that I know that's pretty scary for people if they've been it's a rely on insurance and they're relying on what they've had or they're on a lot like what would be the downside to something like that look if you're a person where your costs like the cost of your drugs plus your doctors plus everything plus if you add up all the costs if that's more than you're playing in your premiums then you've got a good deal with Obamacare and you should stay there if you're the kind of person that's healthy and fit and is not use if you're just paying your money every month and it's just going out and you're not using it all you're not going to the doctor and you're paying for all the stuff that keep you healthy out of pocket like your seven-day jumpstart by Natalie jail or your you know your your you know your gym membership or your supplements or otherwise I think this is a much better okay so just as good information that's what questions well a couple people are asking about the doctor's name from the UK dr. rangan aan gan Chatterjee chatter CH ATT ERJ double e I'm actually going to see him tonight because he's flying for the conference that I'm going to in sandy go but this is going to come on BBC America just launched in BBC Asia and because he's a very good-looking Indian six-foot-seven guy I think he's going to be a megastar and it's because he's showing you know the point of the show he goes in and he lives with you for 30 days so he sees you know how you sit at your office test everything he sees what's in your pantry and he sees how you work out you can't see what you can't shit he sees all of it and it was amazing to see people being inspired to take the changes to have an accountability support so forth now we can all say that that's that plan doesn't scale yeah be wary so we have to find ways to scale it and what we're seeing is that like doctors and health coaches working together doctors using technologies that help them like we've got a technology right now where instead of writing down your food diary you take a picture of everything you eat and your doctor conceiving all right so your doctors say hey um you know looks like you're doing well or you know like when I did it I forgot to do it after the first day and so I got a nice text message when your coach saying like you didn't need anything today I forgot yeah I was back on and then I was accountable and did it look right and it only works accountability work since I figuring out how to make yourself accountable that's the power of community yeah that's the power of community and the other thing about communities vulnerability it's being able to be like vulnerable in front of someone to say like I don't know how to eat healthy can you help me people want to have a like a very you know they know what's going on they got everything together but to be able to be vulnerable in front of someone and say look I really don't know what to do let's help each other out the most powerful mutually beneficial relationships that we see that really you know contribute to the health of communities and people are those kind of really honest relationships and I find that you know when people can find things that they have in common you know that are based around especially when they get together to do healthy behaviors I think that's that's that's a sort of a structure that we can build things one it doesn't cost anyone anything well their questions birth I mean I think that's pretty much any a lot of people really like really like the topic awesome where can you find your TED talk you want to hear that because if you just go James Maskull Ted if you just Google that you'll find it and it was on this tiny island called Guernsey which is a tiny island between England and France and they have a goal to be the healthiest place in the world by 2020 okay so I sort of laid out my vision for what it would take and it's all about using technology using peer-to-peer community support to create healthy communities and that guy Dan Buettner who was mentioning in the beginning he's tried to bring the ideas from from Blue Zones into America and he did it he's from Minnesota's they brought it to Minnesota and the results are staggering forty-one percent reduction in costs you know p communities deciding for themselves what's going to make them healthier not like us telling you well patriarchal do this do that no it's like hey what do you guys need to be healthy people know Yeah right they knew already and it's just about bringing it out of them and so you know that's that's what I see the future is is like communities coming together deciding what they want there's more than enough money to go around it's just the money's been used in the wrong places okay and then where can they find out more about the health install the chart the health insurance alternative that yeah it's a Liberty direct org check that out it's a you know it's we typically get the most numbers of people coming in during open enrollment which starts November first and so we see a big spike but I could tell you this and not many people know this you can sign up for liberty direct any time and you can also just stop paying your insurance premium anytime you can just stop paying and so you know i would if you check out liberty direct if it looks like a fit for your family but you look like work right why you see if you're brought in if you have a chronic disease already you'll either get accepted as a provisional member where you pay a little bit extra but you get access to an ongoing health coach or you know you just be accepted or you'll be rejected they only reject three percent of people but this is you know the whole plan is like how do we dock you know the incentives of the opposite in insurance is like how do we create as much cost as possible because we're prob we're we're we're a publicly traded company with a food dish iary responsibility to our shareholders to maximize profit and we will do that this is not this is like hey we're all going to come together we're going to keep ourselves healthy that's the model and I think that's the model for the future and where I think what we are at the beginning of here is an amazing test to see what are the models that really help to control chronic disease and I think that Liberty direct plus functional medicine plus the work of people like yourself who are inspiring people at scale through this kind of thing that's a structure that we can build on any our final takeaways you want to let them know to help help move towards what about an awesome quote okay I like it oh my favorite quote technakhan Buddhist monk he says community is the Guru of the future community is the Guru of the future I like it and it's that was the guru of the past two so that's that's amazing thanks you guys for chiming in listen this you give you missed the beginning of it you can always go back and rewind and please feel free to share this I also tagged where to find James and we're fine his company and we'll make sure we put links below so they can find some of the stuff

hi Natalie Julie here and today we're talking about five tips to lose weight fast on happy healthy and fit alright five of them so we can all implement right away and we're going to get that weight off that's the goal right tip number one eliminate processed foods might sound very general but let me explain anything that has more than one ingredients is a processed food typically so if it comes in a box or comes in a bag it is likely a processed food but by eliminating processed foods and thinking did it once grow is it a basic food does it have one ingredient by saying you can eat anything that is unprocessed and eliminating all the processed junk you are automatically going to lose weight because as soon as you're adding all those ingredients preservatives artificial sweeteners artificial colors and all those fillers in junk were messing with our cravings we're messing with our entire body and we are holding ourselves up from weight loss to just by eliminating processed foods and sticking to foods you can pronounce simple single ingredient foods you're going to lose weight to think meats chicken fish vegetables fruits nuts seeds even oils with sticking with an unprocessed natural food diet is tip number one number two up the water dramatically drink water as much as you can all day long we've all heard about drinking those eight glasses day but I'm going to say drink even more most of us are walking around chronically dehydrated we think that we're hungry we think that we have cravings we think that we're tired we may even feel bloated but a lot of it is because we are just very dehydrated in fact the more dehydrated we are the more we're going to hold on to water which is which is affecting our weight because bloat also is it going to affect that weight we're going to feel more lethargic we're going to feel heavier and it's affecting things so by drinking more water we're going to stay full we're not going to be as tired we're going to have more energy it's going to help move everything along tip number three stop snacking just stop stick to your main meals with those unprocessed natural foods drink water and stop snacking now one of the things I do to stop I'll brush my teeth a lot so after every meal brushed my teeth when you have that minty taste in your mouth and you know that feeling you are very unlikely to want to keep snacking so just stop the sack smacking stained nose to that have your complete meals and stop the snacking which will drop extra calories and all that extra stuff that you don't need it will help you lose that weight fast tip number four stop sitting we're all sitting so much throughout the day and that's not a healthy state to be in not only is it affecting our back but also affecting our weight you may have heard this sitting is that new smoking it is so bad for us to be sitting hunched over it's affecting our posture but it's also affecting our weight move more get outside park farther stand if you can just stop sitting as much instead of a sitting meeting try having a walking meeting if you're talking on the phone try walking just as much more movement you can add throughout the day it's going to help drastically change your weight situation tip number five find a support network whether that's new friends or the friends that you have that are supportive or finding groups on social media or podcasters you can listen to or YouTube videos that you want to follow find a support network of people all on a mission to be healthier and lose weight if you surround yourself with people not trying to lose weight or accepting that it's okay to be overweight or whatever it is that you're not feeling good about you're going to tend to stay in that situation the more you surround yourself with people on that same path with that same goal the more you're going to realize it's a possibility and that starts to wear off on you and you start to go in that direction to find a new squad or a new group find a tribe of people that support what you're working towards for more tips for more of my workouts and my nutrition make sure you subscribe to my channels below 
hey guys Natalie Jill welcome back to unprocess your diet I'm here with Rachel Mathur from clean food crush now what I love about Rachel is not just her amazing social media and her pictures and her recipes and just how creative and amazing she is but this girl is not only I'm a lot mama for but I met her through her fabulous transformation on my seven-day jumpstart several years ago yeah one of my first one and not only did she transform her body at that time but she ended up launching an entire business creating the most amazing clean food crush meal and how cute is that name clean your crush healthier food that's still delicious a lot of your meals actually all of them are based on my seven-day jumpstart in principle so anyone that's following my Sunday jumpstart your meals would work on these all of us we thought that was initially what I learned from and that's what we've kept as shown it's so creative it is so creative so we had a little cook-off today and it was hard to come up with more than four because we would have probably wanted to eat them all then because they're good they're good but each one is really a complete meal on itself because it has the protein the carbs in the past because these things are super cute they're like giant sushis without the sushi that was the idea I I made these one Friday afternoon for some girlfriends who are coming over all my girlfriends love sushi so we threw the salmon and you could also use tuna if you want to use tuna instead of the salmon just some chopped red onion the fresh dill and we stuffed avocado down in the middle of those English cucumbers find the biggest cucumber you can find we squeezed the fresh lemon which just it makes it delicious so pretty these are almost afraid to yeah really eat two to three of it because about four ounces of salmon fits in two to three and you're just you're so satisfied they're delicious mines I wanted to show her purse was my crab cakes because I love I don't know if you like her I've got a crab and usually at a restaurant or a friend's house and they make crab cakes they have bread and mayonnaise and stuff that's not healthy I was at the grocery store within the past few days and I flipped the bread come around to the back and the ingredients are terrible there was there was probably a hundred ingredients so don't put bread crumbs in there and it's all chemicals like it's crazy so my little trick with this was I used rain free crackers so it made from seeds nuts and I ground them up a little bit of almond meal in them typically I have a few favourite brands of crackers and how that you can do it just some almond meal and some seeds and nut and you get the fat you get the protein and then if you pair it with some vegetables or some fruit you've got a complete meal right there and then talk to me about these because these have that like tangy spicy spicy sweet the chicken is actually marinated in a honey sriracha sauce so the long you could marinate your chicken overnight and the longer it has to marinate is so except those flavors we add the avocado and the tomatoes and it's all about making a pretty if it's pretty that people want to dive in and so you can you could make prepare ahead of time an entire platter or you could serve it family buffet taco style and get the kids in here the kids will grab and make their own and what they put on their plate they're more likely to eat I've got the protein and the carbon the fat here I get a protein for the chicken you got the avocado adding with that and then we've got vegetables for the carbs you can add some extra carbs if you want to do that and then my surprise one was my dessert that's actually basically a meal this dessert is amazing because it looks like and it tastes like chocolate pudding but it's made from picado and it tastes really good I was digging in the blender with my spoon and I like what is the sweetener because it's really sweet it tastes like chocolate pudding but it's the date it's amazing so clean eating could be super fun it can be tasty it's easy it's like yeah it's simple so it's just because you are eating clean and healthy and natural does not mean you have to give up the taste at all and you definitely don't have to get it up the presentation because you have some serious Instagram and Pinterest worthy cause right here I think I hope you guys liked these recipes from clean food crush and from me we're gonna put all the information below on where you can find these exact recipes and if you want more I've got a link below on where you can get my unprocessed your diet cookbook and I'm putting information below on where you can find all of Rachel's clean foods crush amazing stuff make sure you follow her on Facebook Pinterest Twitter in everywhere everyone is lose nap chat because her stuff is amazing this drawer thee and it's not gonna add anything cushion to the coach our stuff is helping me and it's all jump-started proof - so my 
so I I looked into doing multiple programs and I I was a little bit hesitant because I had been brainwashed I feel like with all of the marketing and the media on only eating protein only eating fat doing ketogenic diet all of these friends of mine have done so many different programs and at 49 years old getting ready to be the big five oh I was like I am tired of feeling sluggish I'm tired of accepting the fact that I'm chubby I am tired of society saying it's my hormones and I'm tired of gimmicks and so when I read Natalie's book and we started talking online about her program I realized that it was so simple and it was just so healthy that I thought I can do this and but there was still some self-doubt I I doubted myself because I've tried a lot of different things I used to work out all the time and now I talk myself out of it I've I've grown tremendously in so many areas of my life but the one area that I didn't feel like I had grown was in my self-care my body my body image my mindset was I'm chubby that's who I am and I joked about it because it was like oh you know if I laugh at myself nobody else can do it so my experience of Natalie has been this not just this amazing fitness guru but she really she really got me and she was like okay you've got to decide do you want this and it was like this weird mindset change that I was able to throw away this self-doubting feelings that you know what this is just another diet because it's not another diet it's a lifestyle and I'm ready to make that switch and Natalie helped me realize the things that were really holding me back and and I'm pretty excited about it so next video you're gonna see me a whole lot smaller I feel empowered that would probably be the best word I feel like she gave me um hope that I didn't have before I feel like I got my power back welcome and thank you for joining me I'm excited to spend the next hour with you we've got exactly an hour and I want to cover all that we can during this time and I'm gonna be introducing the concept of the transformation triangle and it's gonna be three steps to a totally new you and in this hour you're gonna discover the missing piece you're gonna lose weight on any diet it we're gonna really lose weight on anything you're gonna be doing moving forward and you're gonna learn some tips about working out smarter not longer so we have more time in our lives now before we begin I want to ask you to give me your full attention on this you know I'm typically a fan of multitasking but I also am very aware that multitasking is not the best way to truly learn and absorb so if you can be fully present during this you're gonna really get the most from it so shut out any other browsers or windows I'll shut off your social media and other places silence your phone so you don't have any distractions and if you're a writer like me I always learned by writing grab a pen a piece of paper I have that nearby so you can capture anything that really resonates with you and I'm just gonna ask you to be calm focused because that way you can be truly present and you're not wasting the hour then cuz you'll take away some really great tools that could truly change or even save your life for a lot of you so the reason I wanted to do this is because there's just so much misunderstanding and miscibility misconceptions out there and I hear from so many people that are trying to lose weight and are frustrated with trying to lose weight that they just feel so super confused and just totally overwhelmed by all of the information overload out there it's just there's so much like you don't know where to start what to do and then you start wondering you know is there something wrong with me it seems like it's working for everyone else there must be something wrong with me and then you might go down that that rabbit hole is it just me you know maybe it's my hormones is it my thyroid you know what is going on and then when you think you know what you need to do it's what do we do it and how do I do it with the limited time that I have and you just want to get back to you and I and I get that you might know what I'm talking about right now that you just want to feel like me again the way that you felt at your best self and it's just you don't know where to start so I'm gonna be introducing this idea of changing your state before you can plan your plate and then ultimately lose and even more importantly begin to love your weight so Before we jump into this our you're probably wondering well does this work and I want to just share just a few brief stories so you can see that this really absolutely does work and then I want to ask you to truly hang on till the end of this because I'm gonna share a secret missing piece and I'm gonna show you a way to truly stop counting calories and those fat grams and stop killing yourself at the gym and I've also got a surprise bonus and gift for you if you hang in till the end okay so and I want to share some of these success stories first because this will get you excited for what you're about to learn but this is my friend Nicole and what I love about Nicole and you can tell even her in her before picture she's just this beautiful girl always smiling on the outside she always looks so happy but on the inside she truly felt like as she would describe a miserable person she shared with me that she hated herself in every single way she didn't want to look in the mirror she was incredibly depressed she felt phony because she was smiling on the outside but she was so sad and depressed on the inside and she even didn't want to get out of bed many days because she was just struggling daily with what she was even gonna wear to feel confident I mean have you ever been there I know that I've been there before were you just nothing makes you feel confident and to make matters worse her only comfort was turning to food so she would just constantly turned to food to help her deal with that anger and loneliness and once she learned what I'm about to show you with his transformation triangle she dropped 28 pounds which is just incredible and she's just amazing her whole energy has changed and she's finding success in so many other areas of her life now she also share with me she went from wearing a size 14 to 16 all the way down to a size 6 so it's just incredible she's still going she doesn't see a looking back because she feels so amazing right now then there's Michelle and I just loved this one because this is somebody who did not want to take the before picture I had no interest in it and she's so glad she has it now she lost 34 pounds I mean look at the difference in her and then a Terry another one of my just absolute favourites I had the pleasure of meeting Terry are recently Terry is a totally different person when I first started talking with Terry before she learned what you're about to learn she was as she would describe sluggish depressed had no energy she said she felt totally hopeless and she literally felt sick to her stomach like she could vomit at any time and she was truly unable to focus she was grouchy she had absolutely no mental clarity and she just would describe her day and everything in her life as a big fog and she even said she was bitchy and she hated herself which makes me so sad it's the opposite of loving herself she hated herself and she also didn't want to go out in public I will tell you Terry is a new person a new person she went from a size 16 to a size 8 she doesn't care how much she lost because she feels so good - her clothes fit great she's now wearing makeup she never wanted to wear makeup before she just wanted to hide she's doing her hair she's buying cute clothes she's getting active making friends she's just a whole new person right now because of what she learned and and I want this for you too so if you're listening and you can relate to any of this I want you to know that this is all possible for you and and how do I personally know and and this is kind of embarrassing and if you're new to meeting me this is new for you to hear but you know this was me ten years ago I was going through a divorce I had a house in foreclosure this is when the housing market had crashed I was in insane debt and I mean insane debt and I had never had debt in my life and I had a new baby to care for I was depressed and I had gained so much weight I didn't even recognize myself and in fact I remember walking and looking at myself and catching my reflection saying this isn't even me I'm gonna recognize what I'm looking at right now have you ever felt that way it's just this just terrible place to be so I remember what that felt like just to hate myself and I just want to fast-forward that I lost 50 pounds you know on even 60 pounds to where I am now I'm just a whole different person and I would have never imagined that I would have been somebody teaching you right now sharing this information with you on the cover of magazines teaching people how to lose weight and to keep it off so I know what that was like to be in that place and I also know what it's like to come out on the other side no matter what age you are no matter where you are I'll tell you I'm in my mid-40s and I've never felt better and I have witnessed so many transformations through what you're going to learn with this transformation triangle so fast-forwarding you know I'm in my mid-40s I'm 46 as I talk to you right now I'm now a master sports nutritionist because of what I learned I've got a community of over three million strong I've become a best-selling author and what I teach works and it's simple and you're gonna learn a lot of this because I want you to have that successful feeling I want you to feel confident again I want you to be your best you and it's a lot easier than you have been led to believe no me personally I am committed I'm committed to radical lasting fat loss transformations and I say radical because diets typical diet out there do not work I want radical lasting fat loss transformation so you learn these principles you lose the weight it is off for good this works I've been featured on national TV shows including the doctors I was recognized by Forbes and greatest two years in a row as being a big influencer in this space and you're gonna learn some of these things because I know you you're ready you're ready you're tired of that information overload and another thing aside from the wait you know cuz I could go on countless stories of wait that people lose but I want you to notice the smile here this I see all the time if you look at her before after picture before picture here you know that's a feel for fake you know I don't want my picture taken can you relate to that like I'm hiding don't take my picture I'm just gonna look happy it's fake and then look at I just love looking at people's faces after they feel confident if their whole energy shifts they are confident they are focused their energy becomes contagious I use that expression contagious energy because that's what I know is possible and this is what happens when you use the idea of a transformation triangle okay so let's get right into it because we only have this hour and I and I want to give you some things that you can actually implement right now and I want to talk about the top of the triangle and I want you to look at this triangle as a visual because the top of it is the most important part and it has to absolutely happen before anything else I can teach you before I give you any workouts before I give you the meal plans you have to change your state it's where you begin not with the diet not with the exercise so I'm gonna repeat that because this is so important you have to change your state before you can just follow a workout plan or do any exercises because this is the missing link if you just follow a diet or workout plan and you have not changed your state you do not get those lasting results you'll cave to deprivation or cravings or feeling like this is too hard you'll all get messages that I've lost my motivation I don't have any willpower that's because you haven't changed your state and that's why at the top of the triangle is changing your state no how do we decide this how do we do that how do we change that state so you want to write these down if you're taking notes the number one very first thing is you have to decide you have to make a decision you have to decide that you are ready to do this and that it is possible I list that first and I make it a bullet because the commonality and every single transformation I've ever worked with I've ever witnessed is they made a decision now if you think about your life right now take it away from weight loss fitness nutrition for a minute anything you've done in your life whether you got married got a divorce had a child change the job moved across country anything you've done the first thing that happened was not the action it was the decision you decided right you made that decision and then it happened so with weight loss and fitness it's and nutrition it's not any different it's not any different you have to make that decision into it's possible sometimes I get messages from people and they say you know I've tried everything and nothing works nothing works you know whatever all I guess I'll try this you know let's see there tell well they haven't decided and I know it's not gonna work for them because they haven't decided it but as soon as they say I'm ready to do this I've decided that failure is not an option I'm making this happen your decisions been made and that is the number one thing and changing your state and that has to happen first number to committing versus trying now do you know the difference with that because that this is important trying is like I'm gonna try to pick up a pencil imagine if you were to try to pick up a pencil right now what would happen you would try to do it but you wouldn't actually do it you would just try it when you commit to something it is happening so I'm gonna ask you whether you end up doing one of my programs later working with me or anything else make sure you are committed you're not just trying because trying something is very different than committing when you commit you are dedicated you were in and it goes along with that decision process and results happen you have to commit the next big one is you've got to find your why your why is the true reason the real reason that deep reason why you want to make a change if it's just to fit in a different size for a weekend or because your boyfriend your husband wants you to that's not enough of a reason to stand up against willpower or cravings or when you're tired and you don't feel like it your why is something bigger than you if you want to do it because you want to have evidence and have your energy back you want to be social again you want to be around for your kids you want to be able to play with your kids your why is a bigger purpose I'll tell you that my why change is over time my why has been very different at different points in my life my why right now is really you and you guys if I don't stay true to fat loss and eating well and doing the workouts and changing my state then I let a lot of you down right so my why is that now my why has become that so everybody has that deep why and figuring out that why I'm going deep with those questions has to happen because that's gonna triumph any kind of willpower or craving or anything else so decide commit versus try and then find that why now we only have this hour so I'm just giving you a taste here now when you when you work with me am I in my programs then we go a lot deeper and I teach you something called deciding core motivator which is even deeper than your why how to put this all into place and how it really ties together but I wanted to give you these three things because these are three things you can do on your own right now and get you started but this is just a taste so when you change your state that's number one but then there also comes apart we've got a plan your plate so you can lose and love your weight right so the change in your seat is the most important top part but then these are these other two parts here so let's talk a little bit about planning your plate because that's the nutrition aspect the recipes the meals what are you putting in your body not just in your mind and what I want to share is I'm not a fan of counting calories or cutting fat I'm a fan of planning your plate and why aren't I a fan of counting calories are cutting fat well I want you to be really in touch with listening to your body and giving your body what it needs and more filling our minds with the right things and our bodies with the right foods and we're eliminating all the bad things for us we start to crave and want to eat the right things in and it works out that way the other problem is with calorie counting it's near impossible we tend to constantly over estimate how many we are burning and underestimate how many we are eating so it's very very hard to track calories and it leads to failure and I am NOT a fan of anything that is just setting you up for failure so I'm not a fan of that so planning your plates is critical so with any program that you ever decide to do or follow you want to make sure you have a very clear understanding menu plans how to do that and more importantly why you're eating certain foods it's not about just opening a book or a chart and just following a meal plan you've got to understand why certain foods do things to you otherwise it's very difficult to make that change and stick to it but when you understand what happens when you eat a certain food what does that do to your blood to your insulin to your hormones what happens it changes everything so with planning your plate also it means you need to really understand why certain foods do things to you okay so I want to cover just a few of the key things you can take away right now with the planning your plate that you could you could apply this really to anything that you're doing so one I want you to really think about and write this down so you can come back to this later what does clean eating mean to you what does it mean to you because it means different things to different people now when people message me or ask me and they say Natalie I eat clean and I'm not losing weight my question back is always what is eating clean meets you because it means very different things to people just eating a fat-free or sugar-free diet for instance does not necessarily mean eating clean just eating a high grain diet doesn't mean eating clean just eating a vegan diet doesn't mean eating clean so I want to understand what does that mean to you because I'm gonna share that eating a clean diet to me means eating your means that you're eating natural real unprocessed foods for the most part on process that once grew so Foods in their most natural state so think of like an apple a piece of chicken nuts seeds vegetables foods with one ingredient or if they are processed very minimally processed so foods that are you can pronounce anything on a label so very simple foods clean eating to me means that and then the right balance so you're not giving up entire food groups like you're not giving up entire food groups of carbs or proteins or fats clean eating is eating real natural foods at once crew not eliminating any nutrients so you know protein carbs and fats are all important the second thing I want you to be really aware of is the dangers of free food so what's a free food so there's free foods I think are great there's free foods that I think are very dangerous a free food that is very dangerous would be something that is just sugar free and fat free because then it's all just chemicals and junk and artificial colors and sweeteners and that can wreak havoc on you to give you an example let's say you drink a diet soda and you're thinking I drink diet soda I eat clean but why am I always hungry why am I always having cravings well what you might not be aware of is when you're eating a diet soda even though there's zero calories in it maybe or one calorie there's nothing really in there your body thinks it's getting those calories but it's not getting those calories Woods thinks it's getting them it's not so you are drinking a soda and you're just constantly hungry because your body is looking for those calories you didn't consume so it's dangerous you end up eating more you end up eating more now an idea of a free food that I think is safe is eating like vegetables because you would have to eat a massive amount of vegetables to have a problem with them so that's a great free food but a free food like a diet soda is not so much a good food so I would say look at what those free foods are that you're eating and if they're just the fat-free sugar-free packaged junk or soda that's a problem and that's creating havoc on your hormones and your hunger and your cravings and your weight the next thing is looking at process vs. Whole Foods now a whole food is what I mentioned in the clean eating it's a food that once grew something that is in its natural form that once pronounced when you eat a processed food they think of a bag of chips that you pick up or a frozen dinner and you read and there's 50 ingredients on there that you can't pronounce that is a highly processed food so so there's a lot of things that happen there and I'm not going to go into too much detail right now but I want to share that artificial sweeteners are in there and you that danger of overeating them because your body keeps getting those foods you've also got things like high fructose corn syrup which your body can't handle in mass doses so it doesn't know what to do with it so you start storing more fat or you've got high amounts of sugar in your processed foods your body is constantly secreting insulin and when you're constantly secreting insulin you're not losing weight you can't be in fat-burning mode also some processed foods a lot of them actually have so many artificial sweeteners and added sugars and junk that you just wreak havoc on your cravings and you keep eating more and more and more and more how often do you overeat a salad or how often do you overeat a piece of fish or fresh vegetables or an apple it's very unlikely but it's very likely that you'll overeat process junk like crackers or chips or frozen dinners when you switch to processed foods your taste buds go crazy and you can't regulate what you're eating and it does get really hard and complicated and that's why we end up falling off that wagon and saying we have no willpower it's because of those processed foods when you're eating a whole real natural foods we're not gonna have that problem and then a big rule this is my favorite rule and it's my only massive role is that to look at addition vs. subtraction if you can look at how much of the good can I add in you make less room for the bad so instead of saying I'm not gonna have all these things instead say how many good things can I add in my day can I add in more vegetables more water more healthy proteins more great for me fats can I add in more of the good because that makes less room for the bad now I know I've given you a lot of information right here but those four things are those four things you could walk away with right now and and start to make some changes but what I get into later with with a lot of my programs and especially my my newest program which I'm going to be sharing with you is my concept of v3 and I'll get deeper into that later but that's really the point of adding a lot of volume to your meals adding a lot of value to your meals and then using the idea behind vegetables the phytonutrients and that makes a big difference I'm gonna give you taeseop of where you can learn more about that in a little bit okay so there's more to the transformation triangle we've got change your state plan your plate and then we've got to get to a point where we can love our weight now we want to lose the weight I get that but you want to love your weight too it's not just about losing it you want to love it so how do we do that how do we get to a point of loving our weight well the first thing I'm gonna ask is don't go into something hating yourself because once you do that state part and you decide and you're ready to do this and you're committed and you're no longer trying if we go into our new program or plan with I hate myself I hate my arms I hate my body I hate the way I look you are setting yourself up for disappointment because there's not going to be this crazy overnight change right but if you can start focusing on something you like about yourself it gets a lot easier to start looking at the progress you're making every day so you go into you know what I love the way I have great calves or I love the way I seem to have energy when I get up a little earlier I love anything I love my eyes I love my smile I anything what do you love go into it with that attitude and then you're ready to start focusing on what you love about yourself and then you'll start seeing the positives how you're getting strong or how you're getting better every single day you know you can use this example with everything if you're having a bad day at any time if you just switch to that gratitude side of what do you appreciate what do you love it shifts your whole mood so that's number one you've got to start to look for what do you like about yourself it could be something very basic I have legs that work I can breathe any I like my ears it doesn't matter just what do you love about yourself then you're ready to start focusing on what we're gonna do exercise wise to change ourselves now I also want to share that you don't have to beat yourself up with expensive gyms or trainers or fancy gear and long long hours for your workout you don't have to do any that when you start to love your weights and start to do some of the right things so here are some of the tips I want to give you that are the right things that you could do without spending a penny at the gym or on a trainer on equipment or any of that one focus on stronger I say that because when we focus on I want to be skinnier it can be very discouraging it can be very unempowered and it can be very subjective but when we focus on getting a little bit stronger every day it is empowering it's motivating it's measurable it's encouraging so every day you can get a little bit stronger and that's a win so instead of focusing on a size or a number on the scale or being skinny which is subjective and disappointing I want you to focus on how can I work a little bit every day towards being stronger it is life changing when you start to do that the next thing is what can you like versus what can't I do and what do I hate and that's what we just talked about a little bit earlier but you've got to start focusing on what do you like about yourself what are you doing well what are you proud even if it's ten minutes a day I walked that's amazing I walked for 10 minutes today maybe it's I tried a new exercise that's amazing you did that anything you can do to focus on what you can do is amazing don't force yourself to do things you hate and get stuck in that mindset of I hate this or that will never shift so focus on what you can do and what you like the next thing is it's not about the time it doesn't matter that you worked out for an hour it doesn't matter that you worked out for five hours it doesn't matter they worked out for 20 minutes it's not about the time because when we just go with us number on that time then we're not really in touch with our bodies it's really about progression and intensity and what does that mean well progression means that you are improving a little bit every day so you're challenging yourself a little bit more every day now if you were to bend down and pick up a plastic bag off the ground think of the force it would take to pick up plastic bag not really require much at all right that's nothing now if instead you were to bend down and pick up a big cement block imagine what it would feel like to bed now to pick up that big cement block you would have your you know your probably your core tight you'd have your glutes squeezed you'd brace yourself it would you would have your arms ready to lift something heavy it would take a lot more force right that's the progression that's the attitude I want you to go into with anything you're doing so no matter what you're doing workout wise it could be a very simple thing how can you make it more challenging for yourself so you are progressing progression is key it's not the time it's how are you doing it the progression the second word is intensity now intensity for you might be very different than intensity for your spouse or for your friend or for me so we're not comparing intensity intensity just means you're challenging yourself and you're making it challenging for you let's look at the example of a chin-up okay many of you listening can't do a chin-up yet and that's fine the force it would take for you to try to do one chin up that's intense right now you might look at somebody that's a Navy SEAL and they're knocking out 50 chin-ups and that's intense for them it's still intense for both of you I want you focusing on that intensity and whatever you're doing how do you make it challenging for yourself because that's what's gonna change your weight and then the fourth thing that we don't have too much time to get into right now and that's what I will be covering and I always do cover am I in my detailed programs but it's the right exercises because we spent a lot of time doing the wrong exercises so the right exercises it's key to know what right exercises to do so that you can truly challenge progress and have that intensity an example of one right exercise is a plank I'm a huge fan of planks however if you when I say that if you're cringing going my back hurts my wrists hurt whatever when I do a plank it's because you're doing it wrong and that's something I teach exactly how to do them so you're targeting that right area and getting that fat burning I teach that at my programs okay so that's just three simple steps change your state plan your plate and then lose and love your weight it's those three steps that you did have to be in place now just a quick recap got a change your you've got to change your seat you're going to decide you're gonna commit and stop trying you're gonna figure out that deep why you're gonna go deep on there what is that real reason that's holding me back from making things happen what is that why the second thing is you're gonna plan your plate you're gonna be really key on understanding why am i eating certain foods why am I being told to do this or not that you have to understand that so you don't keep to willpower you're gonna focus on addition versus subtraction you're gonna focus on eating on real natural unprocessed foods and we're gonna forget the calorie counting and the fat gram counting instead we're gonna really look at portions and how we feel in eating the right foods and then we're gonna look at loving our weights being kind to ourselves and looking at what we can do how we're progressing each day and then focus on intensity progression and doing the right things with our body weight not just spending more money or spending more time on some expensive trainer or a fancy gym or a piece of equipment it's doing the right easy to do exercises that you could do at home or do anywhere like what I'm about to show you in my programs so you can really dial this in and it make it happen and really have that full transformation triangle so it's your turn it's your turn what is possible for you let's let's talk about that no earlier I showed you some transformations of and a lot of these people were right where you are right now before they started they were depressed they were feeling information overload confused they didn't want to leave their house they weren't feeling confident and it's your turn to have what's actually possible because you can have that confidence you can feel good in your own skin you could be happy again you can have that energy and that focus and you could feel amazing and you can do that when you have this right winning formula you can you can have all that so you can change your state and learn to plan your plate love your weight and have that winning formula there's just a few things that you're gonna want to make sure you add to that because it's really easy to sit here and listen to me right now and have this hour with me and be pumped up and go again and I get it okay I got to change my state I'm ready to do that I gotta understand the foods I'm eating but here's what happens we become the sum of what we surround ourselves with whatever we're around and listening to and surrounding ourselves with we become that right so you're with me for one hour right now but what happens tonight or tomorrow when you're not with me or you're with a friend that's you know putting a cheeseburger and fries in front of you or you know you're you're at the office and there's the candy bowl or you're at home on your couch and you're comfortable what happens then right you need that accountability and you need that constant in your ear and you need these check-ins and you need that motivation and you need to understand what's happening because that's what really makes this winning formula know nothing you can't do it without all that some people do it's just a lot harder so you need that winning formula and that's how you can get to that that high achieving level that that I know is in you and I know it's possible for you and that's where I want to invite you I promise I had

questions in the box below I won't see them real time they will go to my support so I will make sure I answer them but I'm gonna go ahead and answer some questions that I know that I'm getting because my support team has told me these have come in and these are questions that I know so let's go through some of these questions right here and make sure you type in any questions that I'm not answering one do I need any special equipment absolutely not you can do everything at home with your own body weight you're not gonna need any special equipment I'm gonna teach you everything you need to do in the full body reset it's simple it's easy to follow doesn't matter what level you are a beginner intermediate advanced you only need your own body weight I'm gonna show you the right exercises so you'll want to join the full body reset because these are things you have not seen before and if you have seen them you have not learned him the way that I'm going to teach you because you're gonna start to love things like planks that you think you hate I'm gonna show you how to love them and how they can change your body so you need no equipment - how long does it take to see results that depends on you but I will tell you absolutely a hundred percent feel and start to notice results within a few days because everything is gonna shift for you you're gonna feel and see results within a few days you're gonna see dramatic results in a few and by the end of the program they're gonna be a whole new person so it will not take you long at all most people lose 5 to 7 pounds their first week of starting and the reason is not only are we losing fat we're losing excess water and bloat which is a good thing because we're cleaning up things we're losing excess water on bloat and we're losing fat and then we're gonna lose an about two pounds of fat per week on average so this is people I can expect to lose depending on we're starting from but most people lose about 10 pounds throughout this program if you have a lot more to lose you'll lose more but you will absolutely notice and feel things and see things right away mom what if I can't start on the date you are starting the challenge what happens then I would say that's okay you can still do it because the the nice thing about being part of this challenge right now is you get lifetime access you get the program you have access I'm gonna take you through at a pace I know works but it doesn't matter you can start it anytime you want it doesn't go away so I would get it now while you get it at this discount while you'll have all these resources and you'll always have access to it so don't let that stop you what if I have dietary restrictions I love that question you know why I have a million dietary restrictions I'm a celiac I cannot gluten my daughter can't have nuts she's got a nut allergy I don't like a lot of foods and it doesn't matter if you have any dietary restriction we are good the reason is there's swap out options for everything so I bought options for everything and the best part is already took a lot of allergens out of this I took a lot of allergens out of this already so you're not gonna have to worry so and we're happy to help you with swap outs on anything that you are questioning about because that's the nice part about having a full accountability and a full group within the full body reset and within our group is any question you have gets answered so you're not gonna have any issues there okay how much weight can I expect to lose it depends on where you're starting from but most people lose five to seven pounds week one because you're losing fat and you're also losing excess water and bloat and then most people lose about two weeks of fat to follow and it stays off that's the difference between fat loss and just weight loss we're gonna tap into fat we want so it all depends on where you're starting from if you have a lot less to lose you would lose less because your body's already near its goal if you have a lot more to lose I've seen much more drastic results so it really depends on where you're starting from but what I will tell you is you'll lose more weight doing the program they're not doing the program so definitely do the program because that's how you're gonna get the results will this help women get through menopause well I can't stop the menopause but what I can share is that when you start to eat the way you're gonna learn in the full body reset everything starts to shift now I as I talked to you I'm in perimenopause and I've helped countless women in menopause we have a lot of hormonal shifts that happen through Parian and menopause a lot and it changes our cravings and how we process food everything changes and when you start to eat the way that you learn the simple way that you learn in the full body reset everything starts to balance you don't have those dramatic hormone swings you don't have those dramatic insulin up announce insulin is a hormone by the way so you start to get less moody less foggy headed less cravings and so yes it absolutely helps with those symptoms of menopause what if I'm dealing with back pain perfect you definitely want to do this then why because I many of you don't know this about me but I had a rupture actually between l4 and l5 couldn't use my right leg I had emergency surgery I am super familiar with what needs to happen with disc issues back pain and the best part is everything I teach you is going to help with this why one everything you're going to learn to eat is very anti-inflammatory so it's amazing what that diet is gonna do to help you with pain and getting rid of it the second part is the exercises I'm gonna teach you are really targeted to help develop the muscles around the issue so when you have issues with your back and those discs in your spine wherever it is we're not worrying about that that's not what we're targeting I'm gonna teach you how to build and fix the muscles around it the right way so you learn the right way to develop your core their right way to sit the right way to to fix things so you don't feel the pain in your back that's the key so I can't fix your back problem but I can help it say you don't feel the problem and you can do my exercises because it's back friendly and I'm in there to guide you along the way to make sure we're doing everything right what do I do if I have a sweet tooth or craving you won't that's all I can say you're gonna be eating so well on the full-body reset that you're gonna forget that you ever had a sweet craving sure it's it's crazy how that happens you're gonna forget because you're gonna be eating so well that it's gonna change you're not gonna have those cravings so the full body reset changes how you look at food how you feel about it and you get to get rid of that willpower problem alright here's another one I always get Natalie I don't have time to cook how will this work for me you don't have to cook you don't have to cook you can cook I'm gonna have some great recipes for you but you don't have to I'm gonna show you how to break down a meal so if you want to literally eat the same few things every day but just sit in your frigerator you can do it you might not like to do it that way so I'm gonna give you some great options but you don't have to cook I can make it very simple for you and I will make it simple for you and for the meals you do choose to cook they're very simple to follow these are easy to follow recipes that you can make quickly and you're gonna enjoy them so you'll start to like that so whether you have time or not isn't a variable when you do the full body reset you're gonna be able to you build a crush test it's easy for you how is this different from your other programs great question so here's the best part I didn't scrap anything that really worked well on my other programs if I have something in my previous programs that I felt would be really helpful in here I included it and if you already saw it before that's not an issue because I'm it's something that I feel is worth repeating but what's different about this program is the amount of stuff you're getting and the way it's organized and the new information that's being added to it every single day you're getting something to address state plate and we so every day we're doing something for the mindset and for that state to keep you in that right momentum every single day you're gay menus and meal plans and education on why you're eating a certain way and every single day you're getting a workout sometimes more than one and you're on as an option so if you don't like one you can do the other and you're also getting an education on why we're working out a certain way so it's different from what other programs where you're getting everything every day plus accountability the group and the live video calls with me but I did not scrap anything that I feel is really really relevant so I took the best parts of some other programs but you've never seen it organized this way and you've not seen any of the new information that I'm including so it is different it does not matter if you've done any of my previous programs you've not seen anything like this that gets results as fast as this one does all right it's time to make a decision and I really hope I'm gonna see you inside this challenge we do close this challenge off it's not open indefinitely we do close it off at a certain number of people by a certain time so I hope I'm gonna see you inside it if you were ready to do this this is the time to make that decision so make sure you click that link below and join me in that full body reset challenge so you know back 690 years ago I didn't have any weight to lose and now I'm looking in the mirror I don't recognize myself and for like oh my gosh how did this happen and I knew how it happened it's all the junk food I'd eaten and all the things that I've done to deal with the stress of my life and their work and just having the pressure to build a build which thank goodness I did but at the expense of myself and it's really losing who I was and the confidence that I had had years ago and I just you know won it hand it felt like it just happened so quickly but on the other hand it's been a long time since I really felt good and since I really had the confidence that I used to have I'm 46 and I had gotten to a place where you know do I really want to go to this weight three hundred pounds or am I gonna turn around and just lose I don't have to do it like it's one or the other because I'm obviously not even maintaining I'm just feeling worse and worse every day my big question was how do I really implement this all and know that it's gonna work sometimes you look at cookbooks you think okay there this is a lot of work there's a lot of things I'm not familiar with or even seasonings or things like how long isn't really going to take and you think that it's gonna be a big ordeal and now I know the food is too good like also you'd want to do all that work and then it'd not be good you know just say okay but the food is amazing and my whole family is gonna love it and I can shop on Wednesdays and I can prepare a lot of it on Sundays and I just think it's worth it knowing I can do the food knowing that I don't have to spend an hour working out I can spend 30 to 40 minutes I think now in my seven eight thirty I can do my workout I can have my breakfast I can you know pray and read and be off on my day at 8:30 and I didn't believe that before so if you are feeling like it's impossible and there's too much in your day too much in your life that maybe you've gained too much I have a lot to lose and I almost didn't even realize that you know it's easy to just avoid it until you look and you're like oh my gosh that's really me in the reflection but if you think that you can't you need to know you can and now is the perfect time and so I just you know beg you to try it and to see if it doesn't work for you because I really believe it will and I'm gonna show you in time that it will and so um don't wait don't put it off don't think oh it's just another person that's trying to you know sell me something realized that she cares and she's genuine and loving and I'm just really encouraging and you don't get that from everybody sometimes it's just about you know honestly making a buck with Nally it doesn't feel like that at all it feels like she even though she's doing this for a living really wants to see life change and really wants to help you reach your goals and so I just beg you to do it and go for it and let's lose the ways together before I met and found out about her program I was 177 pounds I was depressed I was I I had the worst self image of myself so I would walk by in the mirror and I couldn't even look at myself because of what would come up what I would think about I when I saw my image and so in the past I have done Atkins I've done paleo I've done literally everything and I never found it sustainable for more than two weeks I felt like it was too hard I travel for work I you know I'm an airport so I don't have time to do this and when I first read a Natalie's book about her hitting rock bottom that was the exact point that I was in my life and so it was another reiteration of hey this is this is what you're supposed to be doing natalie is strong about the why and that is what makes her plan different as well don't only being simple but bringing that value to that to to the weight loss what is it it's greater than yourself it is greater it's it's freeing I can do the business I've always wanted to since I've started the plan six weeks ago I've lost 20 pounds so that since so as of today I am 20 pounds lighter about 30 more pounds that I get to release and become and step into the the me that I've always envisioned and I couldn't have done that without her I love my body right now and I'm gonna love it 30 pounds lighter I love it and that's you know that is the biggest change that I've seen because if I love it how can anyone else than my body if I don't love my body it is possible to lose the weight forever and feel great and accomplish your goals you

hey guys and today I want to share how I do a pull-up or chin up because I get a lot of questions about should I use fans to have somebody assist me should I use ways what do I do to learn one I want to share that you can teach yourself using your own body weight without assistance and progress up to it I'm going to show you what I do so first I start with a low bar now you can use the squat rack I like usually prefer I use this right here and what I do is I start with my own body weight and I don't go and I'm right here and it lifts up this way and that's to hard drink always start with your knees bent a little bit just like that simple now with no magic number on this I start with whatever the challenging for you it was even just working towards one not lines and the still pressing your own body weight but I like serving with a low squat rack - goodbye Silvana part for the beaver bar that I'm showing here that's step number one once you map to that and can do several of them and you're ready to attempt this being Fargo don't worry I'm going to show you how to progress good super simple and not a dividend ain't ready come with me [Music] okay so any for our might be the balance or school to get out from this going to climb on up the first step step number one is literally going to be just to hang and use your own bodyweight to slowly work your way up now just ask is working towards one is going to start getting stronger to be able to accomplish it once you are able to be strong enough to pull yourself up into the first one working as frequently as you can every day.i possible working towards that first one you'll eventually be able to pull yourself totally up if you're struggling you can't get there yet what I would suggest is while you're working at it put a badge jumping in front of you rest your legs off watch this start here put my legs here like that so I'm working support yet here been working down until you see master just like that but it's the progression using your own violence or even just hanging holding working towards that first one and progressing toward that where you know it will be able to do a lot of [Music]

hi I'm Natalie Joe welcome back to happy healthy and fit I'm back with my friend Kim my yogi my yoga guru Kim because we're talking about the question is yoga a waste of time I know you get this all the time zero waste of time and the myths about yoga because I know I hear and I actually am guilty of believing and you have heard this a lot that either it's too boring it takes too much time to get a benefit or it just really doesn't do anything exactly what do you say that because you're the one who actually turned my mind around on it and have me including it in my regimen now so what do you say to people when they say those things well I would just say that there's a myth that Yoga is a waste of time because people think that although all that you do is just sit on your mat and do a couple moves and that's pretty much it and then because of the sitting on the mat people think that yoga is probably boring and so they're therefore a waste of time well I know for someone like me who is definitely a type-a personality the thought of yoga before to me was I'm just quiet hardly not hardly doing anything and my mind starts to wander so to me it was the watching in the clock and thinking oh my gosh I have an hour oh yeah exactly and I don't find it boring anymore and I don't even know how that changed how that didn't grab how that shifted what do you think there is there are certain moves or a certain way of instructing or what do you think makes a difference on making it boring or interesting for people well I think that for sure that that like anything in life that you might have resistance to that you don't really know the doctor what your experience is gonna be until you actually dive in and do it and then I think when people start to do yoga they are surprised at how much it makes them feel good in in the mind and in the body so it's not just a physical aspect that they start to realize that they've become a little bit softer in the head or calmer in the mind and feel more balanced and then that's what also lends to them wanting to come back to their mat okay and do you find that learning the wrong methods or doing the wrong way could take away from that good I know for me before I knew the proper way to do things I was so focus on this doesn't feel right or I don't like this that's not doing anything of that contributed to the boredom I think a lot of times it's just so easy to get sidetracked by being intimidated by Yoga Yoga is a very intimidating activity and and people think they have to be a little bit more flexible to try it on they don't embarrass themselves in class or things of that nature and so I think it's just a matter of allowing you to find what works for you maybe it's a group class maybe it's personal instruction so everyone has their own way of learning and if diving into something and it's finding what works best for your way I'll say your method what you taught me is definitely what has changed for me because now I know I actually I look forward to it which I thought I would never say before but I do I look forward to it I love it so that's the big myth about it just doesn't do much I mean what are some of the benefits of yoga because from for me I'll tell you I feel personally more flexible and it's an escape for me now it truly is an escape I understand what people meant about you can shut off your mind so I'm getting into it and I'm not thinking about my to do listen my word right it's dressing it it's just what I've done I have a new sense of clearing not that's what I've experienced I am so excited when you say that because that's definitely like as a yoga teacher that's definitely a goal and it's so exciting to see people like get that from their yoga practice as far as benefits it really depends on the person but I would say overall what's most common is that it lends to a sense of centeredness and in yoga we call it a work in like people come to yoga class for a work in versus a work out because it's your ability to work inside of it like that and a lot of people call yoga their church or their therapy and it's really just a way of connecting to who you are as a person and that's why people come back for more because they realize it's more than just a physical practice but they're gaining so much more for themselves to take with them out into their life got it now what about the time because do you do you have to send an hour or I know some yoga classes are an hour and 30 minutes or do you have to do that to get the benefit and do you have to do it every day absolutely not I know for its as far as video go it's like do what you can with what you have for time and just get something in and it'll definitely benefit you no matter what even if you only have 5 or 10 minutes a day just like meditation that could be your your form of meditation then it's going to make a huge difference on the rest of your day if you do something small for yourself even if there's just a couple a couple of moments okay so if if you have 5 minutes or 10 minutes or 5 5 or 10 minutes and I'm gonna just do one thing and I want to learn one move or one series what would you say do I would say definitely mmm the number one go-to is in my mind would be Sun Salutations okay Namaskar a what does that mean what is that a Sun Salutation is essentially a series of postures that are linked together and that you flow together which I'll show you in a moment but they're they're linked together in a special way and they're designed to to strengthen and to give flexibility to the body they're also rhythmic and so the rhythm of moving through that same series of postures state two to five times is meditational we get a thrifter the next and then you repeat that series again and normally Sun Salutations are done in the beginning of the day because they're they're like a way to greet your new day and is there a magic number out of how many times through you would do this I would say normally five but anywhere from like two to three is completely what and can anyone do this beginner advanced anyone absolutely all right what do we do okay so let's start out with variation one which should be it's called a half Sun a so start towards the top of your mat and move into a forward fold feet touching and just fold forward so in your forward fold the weight of your body moves into the Front's of your feet stop to bend at your knees and then just allow your body to drape forward drop your head as well and on your next inhale breath we'll move into a halfway lift press your palms to your shin bones arms stay strong and grab your shoulder caps together behind you to flatten your back so you can feel your back lateral muscles tracking towards your spine in this posture pull your belly in nice and tight continue to wrap your shoulder blades back behind you yeah perfect good take one more breath in exhale fold forward with your next inhale rise up to Tadasana Mountain Pose take your arms straight overhead we use your legs together pull your belly in tight and soften at your shoulders nice full breath in exhale fold forward palms through the heart center and back to the mat and so this is called our Hasani it's a really just these simple postures here we'll move one more time through this come to a halfway left as you breathe in and exhale bow forward inhale rise up to Mountain Pose send your arms high next how palms move for your heart center fold forward I don't think I do that the first time so bad me that's okay does it matter if it's not perfect oh my god not at all you can you can even take your arms out wide and they don't have to touch it also inhale halfway lift watch to do that exhale fold inhale rise to Mountain send your arms high and this time take a swan dive forward open your arms out to your sides as you fold forward yeah and then hands back to the mat perfect so there's really you can definitely customize to fit your your body at the time and now we're going to move into the full story Namaskar so the full Sun Salutation a on your next inhale take a halfway lift press your palms your shin bones exhale plant your palms step back to a high plank pose posture called bend Oksana in Sanskrit you know what if I what if somebody can't do a plank what could they do right here so what you want to do to customize is to take your knees down to the mat but so keep your tailbone tucked in your belly pulled in tight you're lifting up in the space between your two shoulder blades but not so much that you're puffing just enough that you're not sinking into your shoulder blades and then it's really important in a plank posture to have your your joint stuck so you will always want to have your wrists your elbows and your shoulder straightline it's gonna protect your joints so we'll now move into a chaturanga dandasana which is really essentially a tricep pushup different from a wide arm push-up lower just a third of the way down so not quite that low or probably more like that low and elbow say tight to your sides and then inhale to upward facing dog so press into the tops of your feet I don't wanna make you hold there too long and shoulder blades pull back look straight ahead squeeze your thigh muscles strong and also squeeze your heels inward keep a soft bend in your arms and see if you can glide your sternum forward in front of your biceps a little bit more go take one more breath in exhale roll over your toes downward facing dog Auto mukha svanasana and then once you get to downward facing dog you take three breaths here inhale exhale big breath in slow breath out and one more time inhale exhale inhale look ahead exhale walk your feet to the top of your space forward fold now we're flowing through SNA inhale halfway lift exhale fold inhale rise to Mountain Pose send your arms tall exhale palms to the heart fold forward inhale look up and lengthen halfway lift exhale plant your palms step back on or off of your knees chaturanga bend your elbows straight back good inhale upward facing dog just send the crown of your head high exhale downward facing dog so that's the full Sun Salutation a and that's what you would move through anywhere from two to five times you can choose half or you can choose the full Sun a by by adding the tricep the arm workout so they would repeat it and whether beginner or advanced you can change if you're on your knees right now so okay any of that I love it so so with the yoga's not a waste of time you don't need a lot of time you can do it even if you don't have the live Kim guru you can learn more about her ten minute Yugi down below see you next time bye bye thank you

hi you guys oh my gosh this is a record according I've done this is my third wife are today today I don't normally use three live broadcast in a day but I feel like I have an idea I want to jump on and say hi so you guys have your online now awesome if you are catching the replay welcome to our Facebook live again today this one is we were literally to talking about this and I like we have a jump on tomorrow is live because this is my friend Courtney by the way hi for me you guys will get to know her because this girl has some creepy breadth of use she's been teaching me and I love them I love them meet earlier today I was on live broadcast and one question I got was about sweet cravings they always get questions about sweet cravings and what to do about them and what I want to share and I promise or something or even i'm going to show you some tips but i'm going to show you luck check because i can you see that what is going on here looks a little bit what is going on look young these are like completely healthy i'm going to show you how to make them they're super simple bitch I got a lot of kissing with you the way watch look how pretty like Pinterest worthy can you see if I keep it over they'll fall but they're seriously this picture for the right into round square it already they're making me hungry so here's the deal with sweet cakes and i'm not talking about like the time of month but we all have like that pretty nice to be pretty but generally craving typically come from a few things one of the big ones that they come from our when we're not eating about side we're not eating the right nutrients we tend to crave things and sometimes it sounds funny but if you're not eating enough fat or protein you might start to crave sweet yes your body is looking for those calories net energy and that energy so i wanna say to me creddies are normal but by balancing your diet and a big thing is to use super foods now what are superfoods superfoods how would you do my dear food for me there anything that packs a really powerful flavor punch and gives me energy and I know has antioxidants is healthy for me and just a great flavor yeah flavor so okay gambling super foods can really be anything but like I'm going to show you like nuts nuts are in superfood these are wanna obviously I didn't make these walnuts but what are super food because they've got fast they've got proteins they got five hours got a lot so you're getting a lot of nutrients for the whites and then um disease oh yeah it's like I love dates dates are another super food fiber lots of new trans yummy good sweet taste without spiking your sugar and so I think the original term about what the power or an energy bar was really meant to be a small amount of food they could pack a huge college but somehow things have gotten lost that a lot of the energy bars out there and protein more and health bars a really gel and loaded with who knows what and as they actually don't taste very good yeah I like I and there's a few brands that I'm a fan but I like to make my own things and Courtney's introduced me to some really cool things that I wanted to show you today these power bars

the seven-day jumpstart in your question the question I was a question okay 7-day jumpstart the plant is my original seven a jumpstart which is a seven day meal plan and it gives you some recipe ideas that's my basic plan that has helped many many people over the last few years lose the way it keep it off it's awesome the seven-day jumpstart the book is the newer version it goes you can do them together you can do this ever but it's all new information it's a new updated diet it's 77 brand new recipes it's seven brand new guilt free desserts and it's 77 minute bodyweight workout so there are different programs they're complimentary so you can't go wrong with you have both you can totally do both if you already have this effing a jumpstart plan the book is a great next step so I can't say either or they're both good I know with the plan with hope you really want a hard copy book so this is like my my pride and joy this full-color copy hardcover book that's going to be on door so you

founding the Korean events a green leave you back got a scar / China so instead of eating tons of spinach I mean that's great too but there's some already in here and it ain't like the chocolate is

yummy whole fruits and vegetables so and we got a surprise for them at the end - hey Jule why was the odd tomato bluffing - okay what what let's are about juice and when people do wrong first but that's the big one all right what do people do wrong so I think the biggest thing people do wrong is they'll do like one of these cleanses but they're not getting enough right there just juicing and then they start their hair starts thinning falling out they get tired and then they just do what's called a bounce-back so you do a diet for a short period of time then you get the worse than you were before you started it so that's a big problem you don't want to do a throwing away you juiced a lot of fruit did you wire it bananas ever lonely they hang out in bunches so if you're juicing a lot of fruit it actually spikes your insulin up as you know and if your insulin spiked the analogy I like to use so as a kid I remember my mom coming into my room and she would always tell me to clean up everything right put your clothes away like do this do that that was a messy little kid so you were - well that's kind of what insulins like insulin comes in your body and whatever you've eaten with something that spikes your insulin up like in to prove it stores it it puts it away so like into your mom coming in and telling you to do that you have to really minimize how much your insulin spiking up throughout the day to have effective fat loss so not not putting too much fruit in it so the first thing rock people tend to do it at the cleanse and they're not doing that right the second thing is you're doing it with too much fruit and then what else are they gone wrong and then I would say the last one is they're going to the store they don't have a juicer so they'll go to the store and they'll buy all these juices that have been HPP packed or pressurized and you lose all that the vitamins the enzymes the aminos the effectiveness of the juice when you're actually buying it from the store like that unless it's pressed and it lasts three to four days from a juicer and it hasn't been pressurized or anything like that's good juice but you're wasting a lot of money you're wasting ten to sometimes twelve fifteen bucks for a juice at the store you do that two or three times a day I mean it adds up quickly so do thing absolutely it's done the wrong way could be creating a problem however you can do it the right way and it adds a lot of value to us right so you don't go the wrong way just can we here's the money I share how was the right way to do sir absolutely so I think start small I would recommend just doing one juice a day and making sure you do it because at five six days something magical starts to happen you start to build up willpower and momentum to actually stick with that goal you there's some things that we talked about earlier about using a high amount of leafy green vegetables perhaps is that the main thing we want to get and what's interesting and I want to show you guys this because this is the amount that we would want to be eating if we were gonna actually eat it and the problem is most people and even me who loves vegetables I can't physically eat this all day long okay I would be literally eating this all day long so I have to look at options as either green powder or juicing because I can't physically eat this yeah this is a lot there's a lot though but this would be the right step did you yeah right a percent why do mushrooms get invited to all of all the vegetable parties no idea so now if we can't because we're gonna show you guys how to make a juice right but if you could not get all of them yeah the next best thing so after years of beating my head against the wall and going through TSA with my suitcase and my juicer and getting stuff every time like the weird juice guy we came up with an all organic non-gmo green juice that's actually sweetened with low hon and we added oskol ganda to it ashwagandha actually lowers your cortisol level in your body which cortisol is one of the primary things as women as you age that actually causes you to store body fat more effect and it's releasing your stress and it's released when you're stressed so can we show I want to show them what this looks like and how you would use it and would you use it instead of in addition to what I feel I personally use it in addition to I do try to juice every day and one scoop of this in water makes this so easy you literally just dump it in I usually mix it up without even a spoon or a fork okay because it's like perfect and it is the best tasting green juice on the planet but I think I mean I'm a little biased so you think you want to try it looks good yeah it's just tastes like tastes kind of like sweet tea right yeah like an iced tea what is that that's the matcha green tea and then it's also low hon with the coconut yeah yeah I'm gonna make a juice and then I want to compare that do I want to like okay try them out all right cool I want to do a few things mixed together alright let's do it alright hey drew how does the lemon ask for a hug Oh give us a squeeze all right here's the taste test this is the juice we just made and this is organifi corner we've got homemade you yeah what so we got parsley we got kale we got lemon we got lime we got dandelion greens what do you think see that beautiful green color red spicy spicy little ginger in there yeah it tastes totally different this is sweeter yep this is more vegetable lean yeah festively up good good they're good they're totally different thank you baby what do you think the majority of people are gonna like this wonderful swear yeah people like sweet stuff there's no fruit in this at all no root without added sugar you're getting a

thrill that was I know right Julie Newmar was in the house yeah wasn't it amazing are you okay yeah I'll emoji I'd yeah yeah Wow hey let me tell you there was a art of seduction with her in yeah Batman in that I mean the way she played that so well especially at the times yes such such a beautiful gonna grow up to be spectacular no nobody is attacked earlier no I'm saying I know in this series I'm saying well right now we have Natalie Jill and she's a nutritionist and trainer and the author of seven date jump start welcome back to our home nice to have you back you know so good I know that five years ago you decided to turn everything around and get a hold of your health again yeah what happened to you oh my gosh so I wasn't doing anything in fitness and nutrition at the time and I was the typical corporate working mom who gained a lot of weight when I was pregnant how much time did you go well I was 65 pounds heavier than I am now and I'm only 5 foot 2 so it was a lot and I did it not just from being pregnant hormones did it because I was depressed and I was comforting myself through junk food for sure and when I was going through a divorce and I financially hit a rock bottom and my whole world fell apart and in trying to get my own control back I dug deep into diet and fitness and I really noticed all this crazy information overload and I thought I've gotta figure this out I've got to figure out a way because it was the one thing I knew I could control and what did you film her out I figured out a way to eat and prepare recipes and to move my body that would be positive and not be a lot of crazy work and would still work on a limited budget and would still fit into my life LOL could work for any mom any busy percent music I mean I work working no sitting here nodding our heads like one we're in oh well why don't we bring the food in yeah yeah all of you can enjoy to work making sliders today with a Gatland yes they've either delicious these are so um so simple to make yeah okay let's get show me so they're so simple to make so all we I've done here is I've sliced some eggplant and I've added some salt to it and I let that sit for a while to get the bitterness out and then the sauce is so simple it's just pureed blackberries and then I've got olive oil interesting can I just make a comment about the air because most people don't know that you have to sweat the eggplant out in order it does it is bitter it's very better at all and sitting there we'll let that come out about it almost looks like a dessert but it my gosh well its got the sweetness because it's got the blackberry puree the olive oil balsamic vinegar where do you get blackberry puree can you make it it's very simple just blackberries a little bit of water and you cure a it you can soak it run it through a strainer and then if you want a little sweet I'd a little bit of agave nectar well there goes all over again it's not over no no so this is super simple I mean you're seeing it takes just a few backhands really does it's so easy yeah it so has so much flavor the like char on the eggplant so oh and then you just you just grill it looks like this for just a few minutes you're not room are you don't know you don't brush any olive oil on it or olive oil on the pan and you can drizzle some olive oil on here and just enough to get the grill marks and how long will that take to get dizzy if you don't cook eggplant through it gets a little crunch about four minute format sides on each side and just keeping it on a medium heat and this in heaven because this is what she you know so she's not even listening here there's no food I doubt she's looking at you literally have not stopped looking at like the whole time I'm just this association you and it's so soon anyway like the world are simple that's what's the word well this is but it's so delicious and it feels filling and that's the whole point behind all of the recipes and in my book it's 78 jumps are unprocess your diet my whole the whole thing I figured out was that it doesn't take these fancy crazy diets it's just eating real natural unprocessed whole food and when you combine the right ingredients there's so much flavor so much richness and it just it does everything I mean it's everybody labor of love like this together did you dedicate it to think of somebody when you're doing it do i do I think of my my entire book my entire business now everything comes around from my father who my dad died at age 49 I'm 44 so I always think back to he was not eating an unprocessed natural food diet he was eating out all the time he wasn't exercising he had all the excuses of why he was so busy and couldn't do things and and he died at 49 and left my mom and his kids and I always go back to that that you know my gosh I'm 44 and I saw myself going down that direction with the stress and the weight gain and I see so many others doing that too because of excuses and information overload and I just it's not that hard it's just a little bit of knowledge on processing your diet with the right foods and you can change everything some so what do we have made no I'm going to end because of because we're on TV of course we get the magic of it prepare to head all I'm gonna do is I'm gonna prepare a little one for you okay here and then we can do some goat cheese on here I like it oh geez and I Matias can we eat okay one but it all depends on your goal okay oh my god Wow my goal is you know the sideline i drizzle the sauce on you know some people like a little more than others other substitutions did you say did I miss that yeah of course they're substitution so this is just a this version is would be vegetarian it's not vegan because I do have the cheese but you don't have to use I'm gonna push this for instance if you don't want sweeteners the agave you don't have to use a sweetener you can leave that out you could use some honey if you wanted to substitute I didn't know what you're trying to substitute for the for the goat cheese that one I would just leave off the cheese and add you can add a vegan cheese if you wanted to make it more vegan this will shine at it this way she did say she'd put this on pretty really like you don't feel like you're missing out no and it's a meatless slider it's an option and and I know you said it tasted a little bit like a dessert but we I have another one for you to try to and that's the grape these are the great differs so those are meant to be this do I get Christina and it delicious everybody good

we've got a glute activation booty building workout today are you in I'm Natalie Jill license Mouser sports nutritionist functional fitness trainer and today we're working that booty and you can do this at home you could do it the gym anywhere you want all you need is some type of bench I'm gonna use a bench here if you don't have a bench you can use a park bench you can use an ottoman anything you don't mind standing on laying on I'm gonna use the bench you can find this at any gym if you're going to the gym so we're gonna start on our back back on the bench just like this and you can have your arms open here or across your chest and we're gonna do some glute bridges now here's the key when you do these I don't want you using your back and swinging this is all driven through that booty so you're gonna concentrate on pushing through your heels your whole body from here to here it's gonna work as one unit so abs are tight core engage ribs down and we're just lowering it down and back up you can lift your toes off the ground to help just down and up squeeze this is all booty and hamstrings down and up and I see a lot of people swinging and I don't want that I just want lower down back up do you got this ready go up now I want quality of these not quantity so it's not about doing a gazillion of them it's about doing them intense and really feeling it to go slow even it really squeeze at the top you'll really start to activate and engage that glue down and up give me three more right here nice last one whoa hold it hold it right there squeeze squeeze squeeze you're not done yet hold it whoo now we've got side step ups now we really want to concentrate on that leg that's stepping up and we're gonna keep it up and down but watch what I'm doing here with driving through that heel so your leg goes up we're gonna drive up and then we're just gonna tap down right here but this legs gonna stay here it's driving up and back down oh you're doing this right you're not using that straight leg to push off you're using your heel your glute the whole glute and hamstring muscle to push yourself up so it's a lot of concentration with driving up and back down up you can pick the pace but the key is to feel it in that glute not the quad not the other leg which is really driving it up so a lot of working out with those glutes is concentrating and making sure you're feeling it where you're supposed to up two more right here cool nice and we're gonna switch leg no this is too simple for you can always add weights to this but I want form over weight so if you get that form dial it in and you're concentrating on it you'll start to really feel it back loops we're gonna switch to the other side other leg plant that foot down drive it up tap back down up nice up this is a great glute activation exercise Oh two more right here more good jobs shake it out okay now we've got a modified donkey kick so we're gonna have our hands or forearms you choose I'm gonna pick it to hand and it's gonna be a slight kick up now here's the key here I don't want swinging because then we're getting into our lower back so everything is tight cores engaged back it's flat you're gonna drive up small movement not a big swing right here like you're pushing that feeling up ready you get up small movement really pushing and that feeling up cool three more right here tonight switch legs other side bring it up no swing I see so many people swinging and that is not working that glute small movement right here little movements make a big difference when you really concentrate on these going three more mini ones right here nice shake it out alright I've got one more move for you the split squat you're gonna put one leg up here's the key I don't want you way wide out here arching your back the small movement so you're squeezing that glute on that base leg when leg is up tuck here not arch talk to your and it's a small movement down and up just like this you want to play with your foot position until you can really isolate and feel it in that glute small movement down and up just like this you can always add weight but what I don't want is you having to strain yourself to arch to get straight because then we're getting into that lower back I'm just focusing on that glute Mountain up right here nice two more cool and then switching legs same thing my leg back does this new yourself core tight squeeze those glutes back straight down up concentrating just flowing needs to really start to feel it three more shake it out you did it so small movements using your own body weight and just a bench and you can really start to activate those glutes now this is key because how many people think to build a booty to get strong I've got to do these heavy squats and I'm not opposed to those but you want to make sure you have a strong foundation first and by doing these bodyweight exercises concentrating getting the right form down you can really build that base then you can start to add weight and go more intense I hope you'll join me for more of my videos see you next time bye

hey guys so I've been getting a lot of requests for my coffee recipes I've been posting so I'm gonna share a bunch of my favorite recipes below but I just want to show you how easy and quick this can be so all I'm gonna do with that and all I do it they took right here I've got about two cups of coffee I'm making two servings ravier and I'm just using a blender and using my Vitamix I don't have to use a Vitamix you can use any blender you want don't feel like that but coffee the nice what I do they take a scoop of whey protein and I you can use chocolate you can use vanilla for this one but to get the recipe I'm going to show you right now I'm using chocolate no I like way because it's fast digesting and it gives you quickly and I'm gonna have links below of my favorite brands but for this one right now I'm gonna use the Isuprel so I'm making serving for two so I'm going to use two scoops of my whey protein I'm going through then you you can either use coconut oil and some tea oil or I am using um I like brain octane but you can totally use coconut oil or mqt oil I'm going to use this and I do a tablespoon of serving so I'm going to do two tablespoons of this and then I'm gonna use ghee and ghee is just clarified butter but it has a sweeter taste so same thing I'm using about a tablespoon per service I'm gonna put two I make you two servings cure and the key to this is it's gonna make it have that really rich creamy and sweet taste which I love okay next I'm going to use my favorite you can add rocket cow my favorite brand is my upsell and that's what I'm gonna use here and I'm just gonna use teaspoon per serving so I've got two teaspoons of this okay and then you guys have choices period on this recipe that simple as this but what you can do is you can add some almond extract which I like to do sometimes especially I'm getting the vanilla you can use some peppermint anything to change it up and make it a little bit different but this ones are really chocolaty flavored one so I'm gonna add a little bit of peppermint too which makes you chocolate peppermint I'm just gonna use a little bit like I have a capital because extract goes a long way and then I cover your ears for this one I'm gonna blend it on high speed because I want to get it really creamy it's as simple as that and that's all you do this makes two super creamy servings it's like the perfect cup of coffee your batter that's so good and it keeps you full forever if you couldn't want to make a meal replacement from it all you'd have to do is add a small serving of fruit a small car by the side and you've got your perfect balance of protein fat and carbs and it's a perfect meal that keeps you full for hours my favorite coffee recipe 
so you want to get an Instagram worthy booty right so the problem was I wanted to build a booty and I didn't want to do it with surgery or any of the gimmicky gadgets or devices and I didn't want to have to use all the heavy equipment and join a gym and use all those machines I want to use my own body weight so I enlisted the help of my friend Ari and eat that so in order built a great butt you need two things the first thing is give a big layer of fat on your body you're not going to be able to see that the development of the butt muscles no matter how well developed they are right the second thing you need is you need resistance exercise program that will actually build and develop those butt muscles and you need both of those things in order to have a great butt so I was ready I said all right let's build this booty so I'm gonna take you through these six key factors that you need in order to develop a bun the first thing most important thing is tension get the tension on the gluts even to start the motion so already you're picking up your hips as high as they can go they're working hard in that position then as you curl in you're lifting the hips up even higher as high as you possibly can go then you're flexing the glutes at the top okay the second thing is you need a certain frequency of stimulation in order to develop your butt muscles you need not only the tension aspect but you need to be doing that with a certain frequency more than one time a week more than two times a week most likely in order to get optimal development of the butt the third thing is you need different planes of movements so what that means is you know if I move forward or five move sideways or if I move rotationally in order to get complete development of your booty you have to be using different exercises and different planes of movement and if you don't you're missing out on a key part of how to build a great butt the next factor is you need different rep ranges so depending on the rep range that you're doing whether you're doing something that you know is just five or six reps and it's really really hard for you to get even that many reps versus something that's ten reps versus something that's 18 or 20 or 25 reps okay these are going to see me different aspects of the muscle tissue so if you want optimal development you have to be cycling through different workouts that are using different rep ranges the next factor is progression so she needs to do a more advanced race and variation where she might come out and do a one leg variation or she might add a little you know piece of equipment on top of her to weight it or she might do it on a ball or a bench to get a bigger range of motion the key thing here is you have to be progressing you have to be doing new exercises to get more development then the last thing is you need the mind muscle connection so you have to be in the right position you have to have the right internal awareness you have to be conscious of how you're doing the movement in order to place the strain and the tension on the muscle that you're actually trying to build all of those different six factors in your program if you want to build a great foot so when you're ready to build your bootie go to the link below and you get everything you need to build your own fabulous bodyweight bootie with no equipment you can do this are you in

I'm going to show you a real-time full body workout that I did at the gym and you all know how hard it is to try to take a selfie of yourself at the gym well it's even harder to try to film a workout so bear with me on the quality here but I'm going to show you what I did my real-time workout so we're gonna start with some donkey kicks now if these want to really really squeeze those glutes and those hamstrings as you lift up and then once you're feeling that you'll move it to a straight blade kick so your leg is straight now even though you are arching your back a little bit you're really gonna concentrate on this blue and those hamstrings and then we're gonna go ahead and switch sides same thing on the other side driving up get your foot flat almost like you're pushing this feeling up so what I envision it that way really strong keeping those glutes and those hamstrings and then back of your leg strong and then bring it outside to a straight leg also you want to really make sure you're working at a feeling it you should feel a whole leg and primarily that glute muscle the cuts now what I like to call the foot by that area between your butt and your thighs okay mini quick rests going to take it up to a plank now with a plank you'll notice that I'm squeezing my glutes here I'm taking that c-curve out of my lower back really working those abs that core holding that tight and I'm gonna bring it up I'm gonna take it to a knee to an opposite wrist mean to opposite wrist and keep that going here so now you're working you've got your chest involved you've got your shoulders you've got your core and you're still using your legs so we're really working your full body right there it's or it's a great move for that full body and then keep it going as far as a magic number there's no magic number it's whatever is intense for you you want to challenge yourself so you're not looking like a flamingo just challenge yourself work it okay then taking it back to this time side to side we're working core but we're using a BOSU now both stands for both sides up and I love them they really help you with the core and then I'm gonna take it to walk in all the way up and back now you can do these on the floor you don't have to use it BOSU I like the BOSU cause it's gonna be extra challenge for your stability muscles up for your core and then I'm taking it to a side to side rock nacho side side rock and you'll really feel it in your arms and the core and then repeating that walk in back up and all the way out in and out it's an awesome awesome awesome adding core exercise I love this one and you don't have these the BOSU I just like it sure now same move as before but with this BOSU means the opposite elbow taking it up get really challenging awesome or great go though one of my favorite okay then you could take it the same size the same move that I'm going seem size their knees to elbow on that same size see you work those obliques you're working that core you're also looking little legs and upper body and then back to rock side to side look at that core everything I do I'm always working core and abs it all goes go that's total functional training right there when you do it this way hold and then a little mini rock front back small movement a lot of work and then a little tilt side hold and then the other side and hold but these tilts really help work those obliques our core that strength this is all working towards stronger getting you super strong functionally fit and then taking it back to walk in all the way up and all the way out full-body but mostly that core nap walk it in and back out keep it going nice then we're gonna take it back little to take it off the BOSU and back to in-and-out loops what we're taking it to in and out moves and working those lower abs now you can sit on the BOSU continual if you want to do it or you get to do the floor and then I'm taking it to flutter kicks right here this little mini move flutter kick you can lay all the way down and do it or keep on your forearms then I'm taking it back up so that original in-and-out move that we did in and out no BOSU just all the way walking it in that pike and then back out and then this is a challenging home this is a tricep shimmy one of my favorite exercises full body but also triceps I'm taking it down to a push-up I'm pushing it forward rocking it back and back up okay then we're gonna take it to lunges alright so this is just a simple lunge now when I do these i really suggest driving through your heel it's really work this with I spit up the beginning part to get these up front for you but these are just walking it's munted and you want to repeat these as long as you can go that you can do this without weight or you can add weight to make it more challenge so the key is to really drive through that heel and push up through that heel so you can really really work that this loses every single step and look those legs okay then I'm gonna start wrapping it up at this I'm going to TRS now with these I couldn't burn myself so I had to get my husband to come help here because it is a little bit challenging to pull myself so we're doing back here I love TRX because you it's still bodyweight but you're adding weight using your own body weight so I started with with little rows and then lifting up to these V ups and then I'm taking it all the way around and I'm just doing a little tricep extensions so this is all i was doing it's a super quick workout but it's challenging you're working your whole body so all I needed for this was the TRX the BOSU in my own body weight well then I'm gonna wrap it I'm gonna show you what I did to finalize this I just I did some handstands I love these I use a wall to do it and I do

hey guys I am excited today because guess who I've got with me I've got my friend Rachel Mads are from clean food crush and I am crushing on her story big time because oh I'm gonna let her tell about this know what I want to share first is she was one of my very first transformations with my seven-day jumpstart program and not only has she transformed her entire body and her how she feels everything but she literally took off on fire with her business clean free crash so I want to have her share in her own words how she went from being she's still a model for kids but a mom with four kids to having lost herself a little bit of nutrition and her weight and then dialing it back in and how that's truly changed around her entire life so thank you Rachel for being here cute Natalie this is it's like a dream come true it's like full circle I can't believe I'm here and so excited I love that I get to meet you in person because I mean I those of you that have followed me have seen me post your transformation probably a million times because I'm obsessed with it and I love watching how amazing your business is now and how you have a cookbook out now and everything just thriving and then laughs I just learned her Facebook has seven hundred thousand just hours counting I want to dig deeper because I know your story from emails back and forth and a little bit of talking but I would love to share more of this with everybody else especially people that are going through their own struggles right now and you if you don't mind taking me back a little bit to that place when you first started your journey I gave birth to four children within five years so they were literally boom boom boom your body goes through so many changes during the just just so many different things are happening and my youngest she was about a year old and I was thinking I'm getting older now this is just how you're supposed to feel and I'm baking a lot of cookies because that's what the moms on the commercials are doing I thought I'm being a really good mom by doing these things and um I was feeling like crap I had been following Natalie's Facebook page for maybe a year and finally I was like I've had it I've got to do something I ordered a jumpstart and I followed it exactly like that night that I ordered it I download it I printed it and I like made a plan and I'm like it is time to take this seriously within like a week I mean instantly I'm feeling better I have more energy and I'm noticing things internally I'm feeling different nobody else is really noticing yet within 30 days I'm everywhere I went the moms the ballet classes and stuff they're like what are you doing not only had my body changed but there was something about me that had changed too I was feeling better I had so much more energy actually one of the more difficult parts is that you're eating a lot of food you're eating a lot but you're eating the right things it's teaching you how to start eating healthy carbs to supply your energy instead of sugary when you're doing this though was it was it hard initially because you were making all these goodies for your kids how did you transition that was that did you have to say no to things because it's hard I remember it seems like it always happens days like three through five or something you kind of still crave the sugar and but you're feeling better mentally your head and you know you're doing something good for yourself so you push through and then there was just really no looking back once you once you start feeling so much better okay so you went from there I mean how did that go from you you're feeling down about yourself but you know you're liking to cook and you do my jump start planning you have this amazing transformation but how did that turn into clean food crush now so it's really interesting it never it wasn't a plan I wasn't like I'm gonna set out to turn it into a business it really just happened I joined a just a gym locally and I would talk to the moms and they're like well what are you eating and I'd be like oh I did lean Pizza on bell peppers and we made the peppers into pizza and the kids help me and that moms were like how in the world did you do that I'm like oh that's it and so I decided to start posting on Instagram and it was literally just for my friends I think after six months it climbed pretty fast to like 20,000 people hauling the thing that was more intriguing to me besides that number was that there are people from all over the world that it was and I love people I love connect people so it was so fun and then it just it's so interesting how just meeting the right people in the right connections it's became a business that I'm really proud of yeah I mean it's you have a cookbook out now yeah so and oh my gosh and her account if you're not following her accounts you've got to check them out because beautiful food and really creative ideas yeah and your kids like them too they really do they love to get involved and try to keep them try to make fun stuff that the kids can put together and the more their hands can get involved in the meal the more they're gonna eat so what advice would you give because there's a lot of people watching this right now that thankful my gosh I have four kids or maybe I just have one kid or you know and I'm busy and what happened in your mind that made you ready to change I think it's different for everybody but you really get to a place where the pain of staying how you are is it's so uncomfortable that you're willing to say no more to the cookies and no more she just want to feel better so you decided decide you're ready for change yes you just make that decision and it's possible and it's so worth it I love that you shared your story thank you I'm gonna put all of our information below where you can find Rachel I'll put information where you can find seven a jump start and then also where you can find Rachel's fabulous

hi guys we are talking bone broth today all about bone broth the benefits to our skin to our gut health - fat loss everything I know it's a trendy topic lately but I want to get deep into it today talking about all the benefits and I've got my friend chef Lance here today who owns a fabulous bone broth company but he's also a chef and I wanted him to share why he got into bone broth and why you should consider adding it to your diet stat and for those of you that don't know me there or that are new to my platforms I'm Natalie Jill I'm a licensed master sports nutritionist and a functional fitness trainer and what I do is I simplify fat loss and exercise for people like you and I love to bring on gifts and have products or programs they're books that fit right into my plans that I know you would find enjoyable and that's why I've got chef Lance here today so thanks for being here I'm so glad to be here thank you and do you mind sharing with my audience a little bit about why you even got into bone broth where did this even come from because I know that this was not something that it's so trendy now but it wasn't trying to eat when you got into it yeah wasn't ready for a long time not free it kind of came out of the history out of our diets around the beginning of processed food the processed food came in and kind of that stuff so in 2006 I was going through some transformation and I met a gentleman named Paul check ceiran Vista and he introduced me to the West a price foundation and this book nourishing traditions and said chef if you're gonna cook for my people you're gonna cook from this book and you're gonna gonna do real food for my okay and you're gonna eat real healthy food and have you heard of bone broth at the time how'd you do you know what this was well you know I've been a classically trained chef I've been a chef for 29 years so I started way back when and I was classically trained in stock stop making sauces all of which is awesome for broth so yeah a little difference for your audience stock is more of a way that this question stock is though is something that is made for cooking and broth is me for sipping and for drinking okay and so usually adds a little more meat a little more flavor with bone broth in particular it's cooked a certain amount of time so stocks can be cooked short but are or meat brah our bone broth cooked 18 hours for in 24 hours for beef and that's to extract all the beauty and the essence of the bones okay h2 bowls okay before that because I know you guys are probably thinking well I don't have 18 hours to cook bone broth and well what it says I want to get into some of the benefits and like and I shoot he's 95 and he looks just I'm just kidding he's not 95 but wait let's talk about the benefits cuz there's so many um and I can tell you I feel so much different since I started adding bone broth to my diet so share some of those sure absolutely well Wade you know I said a little bit back in 2008 we took up over Ofcom and that's kind of we got started on that one of the things was the benefits for GI health so the mission statement at bone broth comm is to heal the planet one GI tract at a time and as a horse nutritionist you know that the GI tract is the Center for the immune system so I created this trademark right here broth is good for you promotes a healthier you 2008 because it's synergistically all about synergies we helps all of the things you're doing it's not one single protocol that's gonna bone broth is not a panacea it's not a fix-all it's not a simple fix it's part of proper hydration regular exercise sure you know mental emotional health those type of things so it fits right into that protocol but the main thing as Luis hey and Heather date have said in their book the big deal is collagen okay and the big thing about collagen we're gonna talk a little bit about bone broth and the B in bone stands for bioavailability and bioavailability is what you get from food yes food food our bodies are molecular Paul check sat there with a cup and said this is hitting me at a molecular level because our body understands what food is what energy comes from the food the energy exchange and so the there's three types of collagen and what happens in bone broth simmering right here in the pot is simply you get all three types because you have all the different bones ligaments cartilage and the feet all those different things we're gonna make it a little later but the point being is you have type 1 type 2 type 3 all bioavailable in a cup of bone broth whether it be beef or chicken or another kind of animal or duck or whatever you're making but typically beef and chicken for the mean to and so that's the main thing and then the collagen is the building block of your body so I know a lot of people in the cosmetic industry they'll inject collagen itself this is you're eating it which is building things from the inside out so it's helping with your joints it's helping with your skin elasticity it's helping with your gut health so many things when you actually are eating it correct correct and again the other thing you get is a meal yeah I'm drinking right now by the way you eating delicious feeling you get this warm delicious cup of bone broth that you have in your hand you have sort of an experience yeah and people are calling this liquid gold lately that's like liquid gold and this is the liquid gold right here this stuff that's actually been simmered for 18 hours and you drink it this is just a tiny bit of salt in there and it's got beautiful mouthfeel delicious our broth has 10 grams of protein per cup on the chicken 11 to 12 on the top and so you've got like a protein supplement as well so some of the other things too like you were saying about skin helps with the collagen helps with the skin help hair nails are if they are are helpful so if you're that kind of thing but also with the vegetables that we usually get electrolytes so have a really for your athletic you know mean your fitting room fitness guru at this point and I think the for your Fitness fans out there and everyone's a fitness fan of yours it's a great replenish er there was a recent article written by Ben Greenfield in the Western a price journal in one of his go to ancient rent you know ancient was about ancient wisdom was the the fact that you had bone broth as after your your fitness exercise or even before the way someone would add like BCAAs they're doing it with bone broth though beginning right exactly exactly it's sort of and then you've got the other other benefits amino acids so there's lots of amino acids in minerals and again the main thing about all that is it's a complex ok it's not an isolated mineral time isolated amino acid and the they call them glucose amino glycans which are the the the glycogen czar something like that they call gags in short but those are the glucosamine hyaluronic acid okay those are the things that you find for joint health okay you're gonna get definite benefit to your joints fingers arthritis they have a lot of recovery with arthritis so those are some of the big benefits yeah that's a big reason I turned about broth was for joint pain for hip back all of that and then it definitely makes a difference okay so talk about how somebody would make it and then I personally I'm not making anything in my kitchen that involves chicken feet I just can't I want to pretend that my bone broth grows on trees so I want it but I want to tell for you guys listening because some of you do want to make it how do we make it and if we don't want to make it where do we get it exactly well you know I'm gonna just pour this out here this is just some bones I brought today from our mixture of bones so we can go through them but you can see in here there's going to be feet this is a chicken broth as well not a beef broth one of the differences Natalie with beef broth is you roast the bones ahead of time and we do use a mix of bones so I mean here we've got feet we've got carcass what they call frames the top part what you get is really nice because this is this beautiful piece of collagen right there or you know it's a cartilage connective tissue and that will melt when we cook the bone roll so literally what we have is we have a cacophony of different things and then we're going to finish with this so over here a couple of things we're gonna use we're gonna use carrots celery onions and ginger the main thing again for your audience the oh and bone broth is for organic okay so whenever you start making bone broth you're going to simmer for a long time you're going to want to make sure you use organic vegetables organic chickens preferably verified non-gmo like ours which is a really important character characteristic right now and then really good water this is pala bar mountain spring water so we use spring water at bone broth calm it's really important to us you know my mission is to heal the planet ones you impact at a time and we're talk about a healing protocol this simmers for 18 hours and and again there's you know that's one of the ingredients want to look for ours is again we're branding with them and we love that they're right up here and yeah an hour from here and San Diego so what we're gonna do we got the bone so the first thing we do is going to cover the bones with water this is just a gallon we don't have 18 hours to simmer it but we want to cover the bones once they've been rinsed and we're gonna cover them for with water that was a gala that's about four three to four pounds of bone broth three to four cows of bones we're gonna put a little pig we're gonna put a little splash of apple cider vinegar in there about two two ounces maybe four this much bone broth and what we would do again this is just kind of gonna be the process speed it up this would come to a simmer and we would skim the scum okay yeah would be called that's a skimming process and then we would add chopped vegetables over here we're just gonna chop some carrots celery onions so a little prep with that because you don't need to really you're just using him for this dog so you don't just shred the carrots right here so everything is washed everything is always watched you don't you want to use the skins the onion skins actually add a lot of a lot of color and flavor and you can even put them in bigger than that because they're going to be there for a long time we do take the not-so-nice parts off leave them out and you can just put those in there we're not going to cook this now or take the organic sticker off there but again we want to keep the skins in there okay this is gonna take a little butt end of my visitor in there we're just gonna cut this down here I don't cut them in four pieces is plenty we'll put this in here so this is B again this will be after the first simmer and then we're gonna go ahead we're going to add some ginger to our broth some fresh ginger put that in there we're gonna put a nice clover clover to a garlic in there I think it needs a great antioxidant and their viral antibacterial properties I like he just throws the whole garlic in there you throw it all in there now I like to cook just throw things in I don't know you know and make it look pretty it just you know that's perfect an acidic component does help to draw big girls out of the bone and but with the lemon it's more about flavor we got all that beautiful essential oil and the lemon zest and the fresh lemon just the whole thing goes right in there so the only thing missing for this pot is gonna be some peppercorns and bay leaves and you know it really depends so at the end we'd left now that would go we'd end up with this at about 18 hours so you're gonna see it how this is just really melted down you can see that all the bones you get the wingtips everything into the feet or just falling apart basically we just mush them down we end up with a bowl of mush the carrots are mushy and then to very end about 15 minutes for the end we take fresh parsley we just plunge it right in there beautiful fresh parsley in there and then we're gonna take some fresh thyme and put it in there as well and we're gonna let that thyme and parsley simmer for about 15 min okay then we're gonna then we're going to decant it or we're gonna strain it and this is the part too like we said a lot of our clients since 2008 have told us they believe in bone broth they make bone broth they drink bone broth but they're just glad you don't have to yeah that's me I love it I just want to again pretend and grows on trees and I don't want to do any of it like I said 95% we've been in we've been in businesses 2008 when we founded bone broth calm and when we founded the flavor chef and again this is this is a process we do every night with our chicken and a beef is slightly different especially people that are like if you think about it when we're eating and I'm somebody who is mindful when I'm eating chicken or fish like I want to finish everything I want to waste because I'm aware that that was you know animal and so I like that we're then using the bones we're using we're using every part and it makes me feel better to do that to you yeah part of part of the analogy was with the bone broth acronym was that the the that was part of the whole reason we did bone broth okay and again up until recently all's you could get was bone broth and really in essence it was the caregiver the caregiver in the household this is a cultural historical liquid this is used in many cultures around the globe Asian cultures Korea Korea Caribbean cultures South American cultures Native American cultures Mexican you know wherever you go there was always someone in the tribe so looking for the family they would you know harvest the animal and then they would say what are we gonna do boats for all these in the pot bring it to a simmer extract the final nutrients out of it and then of course the rest would go back waste into the earth as well okay so at that point you have a you drink the elixir elixir my good friend Chris Tareq do calls this a blood elixir because of the marrow extraction from the bones and that's one of the benefits as well so when you because I know next you're gonna strain it like you could take the bones then like I guess what I would probably do is grind them all up and in a blender and feed that to my dogs so you're still you good with the pet I mean we made a pet product recently that has no onions and no garlic depending on your taste like that's true because you don't want that names in garlic yeah so we have on you to garlic who we make a product without that but you could grind that as well and you would tell me that I actually better okay yeah for an idea say that bones like make it into little pate for and this is the part that people don't enjoy so say to eighteen hours later this is what we're gonna do we just start taking this up and put it through a strainer you know you can see there's a little fact a little fat on the top there we're just gonna let that get strained out and we're gonna move it into this again it was some kind of strainer into some kind of pot it could be a pot it could be a Bambury like this is I'm gonna keep straining that and then eventually when we have it all out you know it again you'll see all those bones in there you want to just gonna maybe squeeze those out you could take a little tong when you get to the bottom of it and you can just you can just sort of squeeze out the rest of the liquid and that would sort of knock out the laughs a little bit of nutrients in there I'm gonna get the last a little bit of flavor so I'm gonna you know notice the flavor chef and I have these little secrets and tics tips and tricks and that's one of them get the last little bit out there and then what we would do Natalie is take a nice little ball jar like this it's already been through the fine mesh strainer we'd simply fill up a ball jar or smaller jars and just fill this up and I'm gonna grab one from the fridge so yeah you're gonna see what's gonna happen and I'm gonna show you one I made yesterday we've we chilled this last night and again this is gonna be the key for you folks out there shopping for bone broth looking for a good bone broth company and you can see how much fat is on there oh yeah look at all that but when we strain ours and our product has no fat in it cuz it's very hard to thing so you want this this is what hey you want to jelly not yeah you want this is the chicken it's not quite as you like this is the beef but that's a very good joke ah yes and that's one day on once you heat it once again it kind of reduced a little bit now there's I want to tell people you're not losing heat bone broth no microwave to heat it on really do know you can like explain why yeah basically again you have a situation what we call denatured processed food denaturing of food and the microwave jumbles how the micro the molecules up really confuses them and they actually confuses your body okay so we not only don't recommend microwaves for bone broth but basically for anything may be heating up my wife which is all work for the heating the neck pillow yep you know you're doing something like this but the 9-yard opening and we do kick we do get questions about you know cooking bone broth quickly and all these different things that basically we recommend this long slow simmer and this is very safe as well and of course crock pots are great okay do it oh yeah that's a great and then and i'll say i reheat bone broth every night but I just do it on it takes literally a minute to heat it on the stove and then I drink it I make different soups with it I use it as like I all sip it throughout the day I love it it'll become this habit instead of grabbing coffee or tea or you could drink bone broth you're getting the benefits oh I'll steak make a public statement I was never the one to say replace coffee with bone broth so have coffee and then I did some people who are drinking coffee all day long or that you don't like anything it's moderation ya know you want to do everything in moderation I enjoy I'm not against coffee 50 cup in the morning and yeah then bone broth again in bone broth is like this you know again it's a satiating food you know dr. Kelly yeah we talked a little bit about her she were to book the bone broth diet so there's a way what she uses intermittent fasting with bone broth and you know they say bra thing now incident you think we're both again let's not throw the baby out was gonna rot broth bars open soon probably just make juice bar there are broth bars already over there I don't look for me to open one but in this article here broth is beautiful this is a fun little story brought this beautiful came out mm mm Gary one of my Sally found this was the article that sent me off on the path Wow and my vision came to me eleven 11:07 to actually bring this product this frozen probably right now we have because you can get these so natalie these were these were a vision i had and i had no idea what it would look like in the end on 11 1107 and sort of spurred on my sally family and Weston a price foundation and she predict him in here she said there'll be a brothel in every town so we changed it to the brothel we need to the brothel and we own the bra three as well as one of our trademarks and so we say when the flavor chef ake and we go into the broth really rough calm to get our bones so you guys think you got any want information I'm gonna throw the link and after two bit Natalie's your fitness calm for slash try - bone - broth and you can get redirected direct to where to get this it's in stores

can ship it over here anywhere so you can keep in your freezer in your fridge yep you spin 1000 you spin your freezer easy and again with bone broth like you said it's not a one-time shot that's something we want people to incorporate into their lives into their diets and we have found plenty of people who've written in this book nourishing broth which came out in 2014 around September of 2014 nourishing broth came out and there's testimonies in here all throughout the book there's these nice little beauty there's a test that all these only here's the chapter with sports and cancer cancer recovery recovery anti eat there's the thing over here what's interesting is people that say you know have chicken I don't know a whole thing about having chicken soup when you're not feeling well it really that's them from bone broth because she's having chicken soup without the bone broth part it's not the same benefit it's all those nutrients you're getting with the bone broth that was healing that we're helping you feel better yeah and what grandma was doing grandma was actually taking a whole chicken usually maybe even some parts if she could get him the butcher wherever she had him from definitely the feet sometimes the head as well and she was simmering that chicken pulling the meat off to eat simmering the bones and then like I said it was really this you know the Oh was organic the end was nourishment the II was excellence in experience and also energy there was an energy exchange there was a person in the home who said I love you and I want to feed you this product this beautiful thing I made to help you get better so it was really that was where the vision came from for me to help you know how am I gonna make an impact yeah and as a chef you know I got into my own business after eighteen years of cooking and for other people and I called the flavor chef so we we trademark love is the old spice you know we we went in and said yeah we're gonna fill all this food with love because we know everything is energy I mean even Einstein if you go there you know we're not gonna go there right now but essentially everything is energy molecules vibrating at certain levels and so the energy of love is the energy that goes into our food we do that with the power mountain spring water with the bones certified organic with all with the certification organic too and I wrote a note to talk about like some people there's a lot of products out there that are again look for USDA certified organic those folks have done the deed done the work I've done the work it's not as hard as people say it is the most important thing is that with that certification you get no GMOs no GMOs ya know and and and that could be causing more of the problems than some of the things there's they say are causing problems so so the broth itself again part of what we're in this movement as well as the basic broth basic return of traditional healing love it and I think this is awesome I do have a question cuz sure I do get questions sometimes I know somebody might be thinking what if I'm a vegan what if I'm a vegetarian I don't want to have bone broth and I've always said well unfortunately plants don't have bones but you actually have and I have an option for that for vegans yeah we have we have a vegan delicious vegan broth we are definitely working on the research on it we have a mushroom component and what are you using or using seaweed are you yeah we have a mushroom cavora seaweed component kale cauliflower and I mean if I unless I'm mistaken I'm assuming from what I understand that comes from the idea of like you get what fish are eating or you get what they're eating and you make the bone broth of that is that where the seaweed comes in play the seaweed has iodine component and we're getting seaweed from Maine coast so we're getting East Coast seaweed right now remain wild harvested and like I said there's for us at bow broth calm it's you know we had a call for it so we're sort of just in the public using tumeric root which of course is the anti everything and you know anti-inflammatory most importantly burdock root which is a liver and heart cleanser or something like this and so I want to work with nutritionists as well to figure out exactly what you put in there but we have about 20 ingredients awesome I love your being progressive and coming up with different options and you started this before it became such a trendy thing you know I hope you got I'm gonna I will make sure I put links so you guys all know where to

chocolate which does double duty but they have a surprise ingredient so you're not measuring flour and baking soda none of that we're gonna get it done in about three minutes and we're gonna bake them for about 12 minutes and then you'll be eating them so we're not using a box of brownie met they're not a package process gluten free brownie mix not that we're against that but it's not what we're going for these are healthy promise scratch super quick and yummy and you know here so you can use any cacao we like rocket cow but this is a brand I use and she's my friend so I'm gonna share her brand and I like it it's yummy so those of you who've been following me for a while now I talk about my talks a lot because it's like the super-powered raw cacao and I'm pretty much addicted to it at this point yeah it's does double duty it's gonna help yourselves it's gonna help with energy it's gonna help with recovery and if you're starting out on a new fitness plan it's gonna help you with that energy that you need to go each day to be motivated and it tastes amazing and there's nothing artificial it's all natural it's gluten free amazing recipes - it makes these okay so we're gonna make these you guys ready so what right cup okay you are we're gonna little freeze action but yeah it's coming back okay so what do we have here what are the ingredient okay it's super simple we're gonna use a nutribullet but you can use a blender we need a blender and we have one can you guys are gonna laugh but this is one of the ingredients what is that then I'll coffee beans work those are black beans or lack beans are going here so we've got fiber and protein happening absolutely so you're gonna drain one can of black beans if you can't do organic give me a do low-sodium that's great but just one can drive one can of black beans in here right let's do this should I make a mess in the kitchen could shoot we're gonna let her I liked how you were brown today to talk around just in case so if I get brown beams on me it just matches my shirt and you guys won't really know that's what makes it if I throw them so perfect right so then yeah okay Brown being in and to that we're gonna add my coke so cacao raw cacao how much do we have in here I believe that's about a third of a cup okay don't like that third of a cup rocket caliber using my toe XL so we're using this raw cacao which is my favorite brand okay add it there again wearing brown wear brown when making brown recipes morning is raw honey local raw honey raw honey with that done we can help with allergies and it gives you a healthy sweet okay I'm not using any processed sugar its raw honey raw honey okay don't worry this vanilla that's vanilla how much vanilla that's two teeth okay to to use the vanilla also brown devices bill it just blends right on in so yes gluten for you can still be a lot of carbs and I'm gonna cover that rose after but the goal is you're everything I share is lutein free because one of us celiac and I like things coming from an unprocessed natural food diet and when you use unprocessed natural foods those are naturally gluten-free your body recognizes but we're adding the vanilla how much we know did Yuri say that was I believe two teaspoons vanilla and then this is just a pinch of salt you can use Himalayan you can use sea salt whatever salt you have around just a pinch just pinch that in there GetGo he's lloyd how long did that take so far that was like two minutes is reconnecting up then we got some coconut oil right here coconut oil about to jump out of there lots of good stuff we're gonna get my dark falcon to be basking my to excel calm or on amazon okay perfect and so we're gonna put in our youtube link it's gonna be noisy really thank neighbor productivity Oh bonheur x3 eggs okay so three eggs could they you say they didn't want to you the egg that they're being in what can they do they can use a flaxseed boom ground up with some water in it how much would they use flaxseed meal probably about a third of a couple looking okay so you're vegan you he's used flax meal instead of eggs okay absolutely vegan yogurt it looks like I want to look at this is like frosting I did like it the other day yeah seriously really dangerous mmm-hmm nice guy sweet hmm right can you tell there's beans in there no my gosh I forgot there's big thing here you guys seriously don't even think about it now because it's just brownie batter now and so are we gonna have like below issue the beans you find or what do you find absolutely not when you make it like this the if it's such a minimal amount when you're eating just one or two brownies you're definitely not gonna have you and you get that extra fiber and protein so with young and then these because we want to mix up the flavor and not just be doing straight chocolate we're gonna add some mint essential oil peppermint essential oil so if they don't have essential oil or mint to use like peppermint extract you could absolutely soup our my next auction table of contents livre okay now don't lick the bowl when there's rotting right don't do that guys is so good you can't tell that I spilled it under my breath so we're gonna pop these into a greased baking pan Danny what did you grease it with coconut oil okay so coconut oil don't use olive oil you see the little coconut oil to reap it or some butter or ghee a little bit right and then watch them in the oven so you want to bake these at 350 for about 12 minutes okay keep an eye on them and that's it so we're gonna pretend that we're not on being like this how long we make it twelve minutes check it twelve minutes on 350 350 you can watch when it's done okay what we're gonna do we topped it with some chopped walnuts and some coconut flakes because it makes it look pretty and it's he's good adds a little bit more protein and some more good fats and makes umbilical look this is the finished product Leah all right you guys on a trial I'm not ready I'm trying for you guys think maybe you try try I cannot believe those beans in here it's just crazy you guys moist brownie oh my god you guys you have to make these you guys have your following turning my mouth full mmm if you're following my program these are proved you can eat these on my program not even better these should be in my cookbook is it good gonna comment with some links mmm make sure that we answer laughing I want to answer questions what do you guys have it for me or quirky or anything um corn you know we're gonna post recipe can you just run through really quick for those of you then that just jumped on or they're taking notes like younger what it was absolutely so you've got a cup of my to excel so raw cacao or what we use is my to excel which in my favorite brand and then you need a can of black beans preferably organic and lows so you have that correct white beans yes no vanilla wait wait time out how did you figure out black beans so it's a funny story my aunt actually has been a part of a cookbook for generations for 50 years and there was a black cream cake in there and I went that's weird cake and I had an experiment and they came up we're like brownies I think do you think it's the consistency it gives off that makes it that moist yeah that we're real dense and when they're boiled they make that that's real smooth they get all these off so okay so black beans what else a vanilla honey and three eggs so you guys not only that we've got the protein because we've added we have the eggs and we have the black beans plus we added some of the walnuts after so we up to that protein content to see these are healthy you guys I forgot coconut oil coconut healthy fat really good for your brain and your body will burn the fat if you're giving it faster so love coconut oil so and that is it's a very appealing thing what's the richer you guys a taste rich that tasted like unhealthy right like a cake that took all day to make but and that was unhealthy for you and that was good for us it was so moist and yummy so you guys have to try that it was awesome I love it somebody's saying either there's a low-fat box of brownies can i fat so you guys here's the thing I'm not a fan of the packet there's a couple brands I'd be okay with but for the most part I'm not a fan of the package stuff because you're looking at processed foods ends and I like as much as possible you want unprocessed natural foods if you buy something that comes in a bag or a box I want you to define the ingredients for example in my excel this is gonna bag but it's natural real food I know what every ingredient on here means so if you pick up a box or a package if you can define the ingredients that's a good sign so that's what I want you looking at and if you can make something from scratch that's so simple and so easy why not do that I mean it's better for you and this is an example of something it's super easy it's super healthy and everything comes you know it where it came from someone asked how much coconut oil it was a third of a cup and then the oil that we used was Young Living peppermint essential oil is that an Alyce Caron you guys are asked in Valerie for the recipe please we did pro repeat the recipe twice through this video but we will make sure that we comment in and do that when we're not on here and we'll

hi guys Natalie Jill here welcome back to healthy healthy and fit today I wanted to share three common exercises to build a booty with your own body weight that people tend to do wrong and I was guilty to doing these wrong at one time but what I want to do is show you what typically goes wrong with these because I see so many people doing these but they're not doing I'm gonna wait it's effectively gonna build it your booty so I've got my good friend Ari with me today because he's the co-author of my build a booty program and that's what we can show you the right and wrong way to do these No so the right way to do this exercise rather than the mindless way to go through it where you're just sort of going through the motions is you need to go out start here okay get the tension on the glutes even to start the motion so already you're picking up your hips as high as they can go they're working hard in that position then as you curl in you're lifting the hips up even higher as high as you possibly can go then you're flexing the glutes at the top that little differences like that can make all the difference when it comes to actually placing enough tension on the muscle to stimulate development so the right way to do this exercise is to put your awareness in the glute muscles and actually force them to do the work so a lot of people have something called synergistic dominance where their glutes are really inactive and they don't work very well and the hamstrings and the lower back muscles tend to take over and do a lot of the grunt work so when you do an exercise like this for a lot of people they're not even really stimulating their glutes at all so you have to first of all be pre activating the glutes and and start to get them to actually work so that when you do a movement like this the glutes are the ones doing the job instead of these other muscles the next thing is you have to have the proper alignment so a lot of people will make the mistake of you know being out here which will tend to activate the hamstrings more instead of the glutes or being too far in here which will tend to activate the quads more so you have to be in the right position you have to have the right internal awareness and you also have to have the right progression so for a lot of people like Natalie for example she's already fit enough to the point where an exercise like this isn't hard enough for her to actually do anything for the glutes so she needs to do a more advanced for a scene from variation where she might come out and do a one leg variation or she might add a little you know piece of equipment on top of her to weight it or she might do it on a ball or a bench to get a bigger range of motion so all of these different progressions that you can build into the movement to keep your body progressing and keep stimulating your butt muscles to develop even more so now instead of just propelling yourself off this back leg what you want to do is release the tension of the back leg and force yourself to get the motion all through the glute on that front leg so here all the tensions on the glute release this leg and now you're dragging yourself forward by activating that front leg glute muscles okay so there's a huge difference between just going through the motions and walking through this versus releasing the tension off that back leg and then forcing that front leg glute to do the work huge difference my three favorite exercises just make sure you're doing them in the correct way and you're well on your way to building that booty now if you want to get my very detailed build a booty program you can download that all the information that goes with it lots of exercises at the link below 
hey guys not only Jill here welcome back to happy healthy fit today I've got my friend Jason Rosell you might know him from Steve Harvey Show Jillian Michaels yeah his resume is so long I don't know that even I could permit her at all I'm know I'm everywhere I'm just trying to compete with Julie oh but look everybody knows her from the world I went this is how I found it I'm like holy crow I have to meet the one no Natalie Jill but listen the thing that we had so in common that I thought I've got to get him on here and share this with you is we both had the weight loss and dealt with the loose skin problem skin stretch marks skin and stretch marks a while back I shared a video with you guys that showed what happens with the skin after you have a baby and lose a lot of weight however what I couldn't speak on was the stretch marks or losing a lot of weight that's not related to pregnancy and that's where Jason comes in and he's a guy that's another thing I could not be yeah I always didn't look like this like I was taller on the phone I was 75 pounds overweight reaching 225 pounds so it was my whole life it wasn't like a lot of people that gain weight and lose weight until I was 21 I was that fat guy watching TV eating Oreo cookies till 3 o'clock in the morning so it was good but you didn't tell Kovacs absolutely and it got to the day where I couldn't even see anything besides my fat stomach yeah so I started doing simple workouts being that you know I'm also a music artist mixing my music with simple 10 12 minute workouts you know losing little by little and 75 pounds later now I'm hoping the lives of thousands of people online and and on television which I'm grateful you think but I also have a lot of extra skin and I want to talk about that with you guys yeah and I do want to show you and we're gonna actually do a little close-up but I want to show you about what extra skin looks like yeah because that is what people don't understand and what I showed you guys before on a video with that you can look like you have abs you could have abs I have them it's a strong muscle and you can lose that that but when you have the loose skin that is not something that you can just get rid of I mean I always joke that downward dog is just not pretty after losing a lot of weight while you can fix it you could do with surgery and some other things that we can talk about but if you don't want to do the surgery which neither one of us did the surgery um you it's just about losing the fat gaining the muscle and learning how to hide it well right but this skin is still there enough normal it's normal yeah and also I think it's also realizing that although I'm not perfect nor is Natalie at the end of the day you got to know if you've reached your best goal like this is as lean as I'm gonna get can I get leaner yes I can can you get leaner yes you can but then that also produces even more looser skin yes which what I try to tell people is once you've reached your best level know that you can look in the mirror and say I look awesome I feel awesome and most importantly I didn't do this with surgery you don't have scars and we're gonna get into this all the things that lipo and tummy tucks can do that can really harm you physically your experience is doing the mind because you lost it from a lot of lifestyle wait it wasn't pregnancy weight so it was kind of all over right did you ever think about doing the Skin surgery what was the pros and cons and what's your experience on that what do you know about that or not know what helped you with your decision losing all the weight was to me amazing from a size forty pan to the size twenty-nine thirty now back then when I lost all the weight I didn't have any muscles problem was I was saggy everywhere and I was my arms were just skinny and soft skinny fat yeah my stomach was flat but no definition right everything was very soft and I was like I told my mom I said mom you gotta give me you got a you know get me an appointment with a doctor to get all the skin removed this was the instinct yeah you know cuz you don't want that but then after like doing my research on my own because I try to go to trainers and all all trainers try to do is push you for that moment get out but most people don't care it takes one to know one I actually ran into somebody that used to be really overweight and he had muscles and I said how'd you do this he's like I built a muscle underneath this again to fill up the extra skin and it didn't make sense to me so I literally was weighing at one point a hundred and thirty-eight pounds right I'm not a tall guy I'm barely five six right so you do the math I was like I got so skinny and it was like gooey looking everything and then I started doing weights but very negative weights and building muscle and all of a sudden I start seeing definition all over my body and using that extra skin to my advantage make it a positive and that's honestly what I did I can easily get lipo if I wanted to I could have done a lot of things but let me tell you after seeing friends and clients that I worked with they lose a weight and once they gain it especially the lipo they gain it in different areas and you can see the spots and I'm like alright it doesn't interesting confident I'm certainly not a plastic surgeon I don't know but I guess from what I understand and correct me if I'm wrong if you have lipo you're removing the fat cells from an area so if you gain weight back you're gonna it's not going to go to that area but it's going to go someplace else absolutely so if we suck it out up so your lower ab apps right here right and we put it in a different area when you gain the weight you're going to get dimples as is one of the side effects in the back of your legs a lot of people do it different ways but for me I can sit here all day and flex for a shoot but as soon as I sit down I still have extra skin and I can't do nothing about it and it's not and I want it this is a great thing to tell the audience how to know if what you have is fat or skin yes how does somebody tell because I know when someone sends me a message and says I how do I go to my lower body fat lower belly fat that's my first question is it is it fat is it skin because there is a difference how would you gauge telling somebody that well usually what I do is like you know both your fingers your thumb next like literally grab like if you zoom in here you'll see this is all skin I'm pinching I can feel my fingers through my skin there's no fat there right I cannot say the same about my arms but what I'm saying is like I'm 9 percent body fat so that's pretty low for a guy it's pretty you know right but same thing goes for the stomach so let's see here if I pinch right this is skin there's like when you feel fat you would feel granules of fat this is just skin that's sitting there I can't do nothing about that as you can see this is my core I have abdominal muscles but this is just skin and you can't focus and what I'm try to tell the world are my clients don't focus on that extra skin if you look in the mirror you look 90 it may be 95 percent better than Society who gives two FS if you freaking have a little bit of extra skin now don't get me wrong because a lot of you out there watching say well I have a lot more skin that means we have to determine do you need to lose more fat okay or have they lost enough air that's good and I went out I do see people that lose massive mouth weighed 200 pounds you know massive amount that there is a lot of skin I mean it's just skin yeah what would you advise there because to me I would think surgery might be the only thing we do know that as long as they have done everything to their power prior to getting to surgery like let's talk about last resort I didn't do anything and everything to my last power I was ready hey mom I lost the weight sure let's go to the surgery bed so I can look better naked I didn't push myself because a lot of times people want the easy fix sometimes people don't even want to lose all the weight but back to your question for those that have lost such significant amounts of weight whether it be for money 75 to 100 200 pounds or even more make sure that you are actively working out three to five times a week based on your genetics age etc consult with your doctor but once you've built in a muscle and you're saying okay I built muscle but I still have fat yes that's when I say green light you look awesome everywhere else but you have a lot of skin you have to share with me I've accepted hey you know what who gives a crap I may not have a perfect stomach but I'm well-rounded everywhere maybe and gaining a lot of weight or just massive weight loss there's a few things that we would sound like we both advised to do the first thing is make sure you've lost the fat that you need to lose and you do that through the way you eat eating natural real unprocessed food um and from intensity and training and doing the right exercises that was the first thing you've got to lose the fat and that means a mix of cardio there's weight training there's eating right there's a whatever you do but you got to lose out fat the second thing is you have to build the muscle you have to develop the muscle you have to build a muscle underneath the skin what do you like it or no and then it's deciding what your reason is for wanting to go further because if you've done if you if you have lost the fat I don't have develop the muscle surgery is a very personal choice I'm not against it if that's what somebody chooses but just knowing your wife or that if it's aiming for perfection just know that there there's never perfection so whether you keep the skin or you have a surgery and you have scars there's never going to be perfection from that I'm glad you join me right now one thing we did not touch on was stretch marks no I I did not get them I know you did I want to let me share that and what you've done to minimize that or what's your opinion about that I do get questions about that a lot my personal experience I had purple and red so I guess you know there's different stages of it my heaviest is one that were pure purple that's when I was like even disgusted to like look in the mirror but I noticed as I was losing the weight it would be turned into like red and then eventually they would just become more see-through but let me explain what I did to soften this okay um so as you lose weight and you become smaller um you wanna not a lose the weight drastically I always tell us my clients they want and I'm sure you get it all the time I want to lose as much weight as quick as possible when you lose weight and like I was doing it at one point really fast your skin becomes even more loose and my stretch marks were becoming more visible can't keep up with it can't keep up it just can't keep up with it so what I did was instead of losing say average of four to six pounds a week because I was going to extreme mine yells a bigger guy so it's easier to lose more weight and I don't want you thinking watching this I'm I'm 15 pounds overweight that you're going to do that don't do that I'm saying for someone that's 60 pounds and above you can afford to lose three to six pounds week so what I did was I slowed it down I only was losing about two to four pounds a week and then every night before going to bed my grandmother taught me this concoction it's a pure olive oil with honey and a this filtered vinegar okay so she would put in a saran wrap for me but she would you know kind of like a brush yeah she would just brush it for me I would suck in my stomach true story and then wrap and I sorta got cuz I'll pull this pull this up in this video my stretch marks eat can you see here where they look like a little right cut all this all this was people stretch marks so okay nice oh it's normal first of all except it the skin lose the fat make sure you've done that and we're gonna share information low on how you can get help with that to work out the muscle underneath those fat and then I'm gonna put all the information down below on where you can find Jason and then from both of us where you can get stuff to help you lose it that build the muscle and

you don't want to write down these ingredients because these are yummy you don't wanna make them today okay okay what do we have here is it a chocolate mold I can get this online so any craft store and we've got some so many shows yeah so okay what if they don't have like a mold like this could you make little dollops of something you do you could do it cookie sheet lined with some okay that's the weekend so we can use a cookie sheet with some parchment oh right or you can get we wanted to make some hearts we bought a little candy sheet that has little chart kind of so yours in some sea salt on half of them and some rom and pieces all day so she sea salt and raw almonds because i'll just show them a little closer up right here and I see this so she just put inside some almonds on part and sea salt because we're making some that have sea salt flavor and some that are Alma Claver I guess you could get creative and do like chili pepper coming to like a native you can do chia seeds for that fun little crunch at the bottom million different things alright so we're we got where they are starting with our minor except way so far raw cacao cacao their ingredients that are actually going to help you boost your metabolism give you good energy and help with your incorrect so let's talk about this real quick so raw cacao in general has a lot of benefits however the brand that i use that i talked about a lot is this one right here you guys and the reason is because I other let her explain the technical side I just know I feel good when I a good time yeah okay tell them to tell the technique that my to excel is raw cacao which is really great for helping with your mitochondria what does that mean it takes your engine your cells engines and pump them up so it actually gives you more energy and makes your body run more efficiently this is what I've been putting in my coffee in the mornings to you guys I could it to you it gives you that little the caffeine does too you like an extra focus it's working in yourselves to actually help you go longer be stronger and recover faster from your workout so if you're just starting to work out you need a little extra boost okay yeah there's some other ingredients okay so we can use raw cacao the key is raw cacao the brand i use if you guys wanna know is this and we'll put a link in there okay so wrong pal with next so then we're gonna add some maple syrup when I think that's not too Mabel yes this is sugar I know but you guys were using a little bit of this okay so a little bit it's gonna make all of our using this is a sweetener so maple syrup and then we've got some melted coconut oil coconut oil you guys you know I talked about coconut oil all the time so healthy fat big fan of coconut oil gonna help keep us full it's going to help give us that yummy inside to this of the chocolate okay I'm gonna make your brain for you guys it makes your brain lot better she's a sign of person yeah and so we're dumping this all together super easy okay I show them it's going to turn into you get your line mixing from yeah we're just mixing making camp solver I got ok got a pink when you're on my husband's name there they go so once it turns into fluffy nice young so we got right here raw cacao my toe XL I'm we've got coconut oil i'm making a little mess here and now we're gonna make no see right whoops wait you guys oh my god okay I should I'm not I'm not allowed to do that all right meanwhile yeah I'm gonna keep mixing so once it's all mixed together you're gonna have a beautiful start pace you guys this is why I don't have my own cooking show because clearly i do think kind of messy I'd like a bra cacao all over me right now you guys really good I smell good yeah it's like a chocolate come on optimistic with all day on some ago I had a chocolate club alright so now these are going to get dipped into your fun little molds here or you can drop them like kisses on to either defeat it and you could you have to all right thumb outfit animal yeah and once it's in there hi guys what I got yeah it'll get run here when they make it at home it'll be nice alright and then you're gonna pop these but guilty like it look looks good like that pop them in the freezer for about an hour or overnight okay man just eat one in the afternoon when you're not chocolate fix needs to be okay so well Courtney's helping to dabble these things in there because she's more patient than me so just to kind of recap you guys we used little mold like this but you can just use wax paper and make your own little shapes or you go cookies cookie cutters you wanted to write ok and then shape it makes rocket cow is this is some how much people feared to be these two teams because Tamela whole batch you're going to have these for about a week so you if you just eat one a day that's not that much sugar okay I don't really need one you're so rich and yummy and then you've got your coconut oil in there super simple and then they freeze and I get nice like a basically like a really decadent Hershey bar or dev kiss you can kill me okay my saying Hershey bar doc cuz cuz these TZ how much better you guys seriously better and you can share them when your friends come over if you want if you want to that you could share them I would have it could not so I think we have so much hmm it's good just like that you guys all right all right right we're going to put we're going to start with these you guys to see this we're gonna put them in the freezer and I'm gonna show you guys I can hang out my teeth now that's tracker so we gonna show you what they look like I'm on trends over here I'm going to get into the cool Oh alright guys so we're gonna post the recipe in here for sure those are the I don't say my teeth Angie can you see that it's like totally in my teeth so you guys you would probably do better than me because I have cacao powder all over me I've chocolate in my pee she's nice explain and she's a pro with that didn't have another recipe so even other residents were good okay that was the first one these are good chocolate healthy sweets i'm going to show you what they look like after when they're when they're done after i put them in the freezer for so yummy and i have one every day usually in the afternoon when i get that sweet craving super easy to make you buy so the next one we're going to make is almond milk and the reason i wanted to do this is I was a big fan of almond milk but the one I was buying at the store had your Jean Ann in it which I'm not a fan of yeah you really don't know what you're getting when you're buying a store brand but I love to do the most natural things we do ourselves and unprocessed foods we can do at home so I use a lot of coconut milk and eggs a lot of almond milk but I want to learn how to do these myself so Courtney had a really simple quick way to do it and she has a way to do it and make it chocolate flavored almond milks of course so I'm going to show you how to do that one you guys ready okay so we have we started out with a cup of omens bra almond and they were soaked overnight or five hours whatever time you came so so why do we so come so almonds and most Nets have a ton of nutrients in them but by soaking them it makes it easier for our bodies to absorb so so keen the nuts is actually a good way for us to get more out of it so we're getting more nutrients from the almond if we soak the first we're going to digest the matter exactly so Iran arses and we soaked him overnight yes like this okay I'm water and then we trained you better okay see their little soft there commemorates they're like that feeding the masses ago so this is a wonderful of four cups of fresh water clean water by four cups water and then we're going to go around and then my favorite after me posted my favorite ain't nervous see ohhhhh dates you guys I love dates so we took out the pit in the middle and we've got some dates dates had time you vitamin a k lots of potassium great for working out and death those in there seven ok and then of course some chocolate my don't sell raw cacao again using my toe excel for this and we're going to use I didn't dump any money this time good job how much money for this this is about what we're going to do two capfuls which is a half a teaspoon of vanilla okay so she's using vanilla extract or making now do we have what happens if we don't need the vanilla would it get the idea behind a plane unflavored if you're not doing the chocolate i recommend you to a little more vanilla

than that I very easy so once then you can let this sit in your fridge for like a half an hour let it drip out where you can be like me I'm impatient will just squeeze it down and then what you guys

ingredients you guys in all in both these recipes so you can totally on the serve them to your kids I think they're gonna like them too how do you dry the to make it on and no i didn't know how do you dry it and make it all in the other wanna know hi sorry you can land on a cookie sheet you can put it on if you shoot in the oven on 250 for about an hour and just watch it it'll get dry or you can use it wet like that for the right into you because you're typically gonna mix of the wet ingredients anyway yeah right so it's okay so that's high so we now taught you three things you made on my meal um and almond milk chocolate on milk enemy candies yeah so you're ready to make it super easy super easy that's how much came out we still have a whole just okay you guys so okay where do you get the cacao for that chocolate tree wait this is my hair um my toe excel and I think that somebody from there has commented in the fridge this is the raw chocolate I prefer um the main reason is it's raw and because there's other stuff in it that makes me feel energized and it has echinacea echinacea keeps you help with helping trans-resveratrol which is from the red skin and the ribs oh yeah like what you would get from red wine but without having the wine so very girls Oh chocolate in but it's awesome i'm obsessive this if you don't have this you could totally use your own rocket cow but this is the brand that i use and they get this discount that they can use right there you have a coupon code Natalie Jill and check out and you get thirty percent off and you want there's also one on your website yeah and either way mine is my coupon or you could just go to their website and see the try it but I'm obsessed with this you guys I love it it's the best tasting I'm raw cacao and we put it in everything now even my coffee is the raw chocolate I don't sell non-gmo it is and it is made with organic cacao with me free non-gmo nothing artificial no soy and it's only five and use adium so very five grade am seeing very minimally processed and there's lots of they have lots of cool recipes i'm reading these now yeah ok so the ingredients on here are raw cacao echinacea Oh carnitine which is from when you get from green vegetables trust trans rose a trainer to roll when she's getting red wine or this alright cool I love it okay you guys questions questions where can you get seeds you can get them at any grocery store you guys um any I'm glad to have a Trader Joe's Whole Foods regular grocery stores you can always find dates there anywhere can we be a seller on this product can somebody sell the product I'm sure if you contact my toe excels could probably answer that better than I could because I don't know yes I'm sure that you could probably sell it send us an email send them sent Courtney over there anyone over there an email how much protein is in this I'm there all depends on how many almonds you're using what you are adding so if the the actual chocolate themself is not it's not a protein thing but it's going to have the healthy fat and the kokoa account it hey Kelly I'm a natural I'm a long-distance runner and usually use energy gels or jelly babies for energy on my long run any suggestions for cleaner alternatives I'm daler dairy aisle intolerant hi Kelly okay so here's the deal um there's two kinds of people there's fat burners and sugar burners and I'm going to break it down pretty simple like that but if you are a sugar burner then you have taught your body to rely on carbohydrates and sugars for your primary energy source people that are really good at being a fat burner I have trained their bodies to tap into fat stores for their primary energy source okay I like helping people to get to the point of being a fat burner and by doing that you do cut back on a lot of the process carbs and I'm not a fan of energy gels for that reason personally so if you're going to be if you want to train yourself to be more of a fat burner and somebody uses fat for energy you want to start training yourself to eat more fat eat more natural carbs in the form of fruits and vegetables eat more proteins and you can start to tap into that so when you're doing a lot of gels and carbs you're just burning that as soon as you eat it so the more you're eating snacks and foods with the good fats like coconut oil and other things that would be perfect for you so as far as your long run i would suggest starting to have snacks like this more I'm seeing yourself used to that not quitting cold turkey on the carbs but gradually working towards building up that way to make your body work that way okay um siege what can I say I don't know enough about that company so I can't say enough about that um I love you love my hair familia thank you thank you to a Pantene commercial next thank you I watched it this morning how about that I saw a post on Instagram this morning it made me laugh out loud it said by friday my hair is ninety percent dry shampoo which is typically me so i decided to get up and wash it so I didn't have to fall into that does it contain fish will know it does not contain fish oil I use coconut oil instead of fish oil for that and that what these were both completely dairy-free yes yeah you're both dairy-free let's see what other questions you guys um k Michelle I see you all right you guys are awesome so Kourtney's right here I can't see some of these questions coming through now and they kind of paused um I will take some time throughout the day and answer some of your questions in the threads if you didn't get them answered Courtney will go back and con man later with both recipes to make sure you have them and will make sure you know exactly where to get this stuff I'm an answer just a couple more questions Angela the more health care I eat my face breaks out is that normal no it's not normal I would want to find out what it is that you're eating sometimes people's definitions of healthy eating are not how we all define healthy eating so I don't know how you define healthy eating if you're getting natural unprocessed real foods that's how I define healthy eating so things at once grew think vegetables think fruits nuts seeds proteins if you're defining a healthy food as a lot of brains or artificial sweeteners that's not healthy and that could make you break out okay um yes I Kelly the recipes are going to be posted do i hear you say any more fat usable isabella a lot of fat yes i do a coconut oil Iggy I eat avocado oil avocados I eat nuts and seeds i get a lot of fat for sure is there a good brand of protein powder Monica if you go to Natalie Jill fitness com forward slash protein you will see the brands that I particularly like I'm a fan if you're going to use a protein powder make it natural and clean the most natural you can find i personally use to a clean version of a whey protein when i use it okay i'm hannah i can't eat soy dairy or gluten none of this had soy dairy or gluten and gotta tell you I don't eat soy dairy or gluten either i eat a little bit of dairy sometimes but I don't need soy and I don't eat gluten so lots of things you can get there in fact my my unprocess your diet book you guys right here woohoo all natural unprocessed foods no soy no gluten in this so you guys can get that at Natalie Joel fitness com Thor / and book and love you guys thanks for chiming in as always we'll be back hey I'm an olive pretty back on for sure because we all like her and she clearly is better at this than me that's exactly why I don't cook Michelle I'm just as messy I make a big ol mess and I may be back on later today you guys because I am headed up to LA I am meeting with some super cool people that you guys have met before but I'm a pop on if I can give it some to go live with me so thanks you guys love you bye

if you talk with most successful people they have done these same exercises I'm about to share with you this was a time where I had just had a baby I had one gains a ton of weight I was also going through a divorce I was in the worst possible financial shape I could have ever imagined being and I was somebody who had always been responsible had a good job I had never been in debt before and I got in way over my head I had a house that I could no longer afford I was going through a divorce everything was spiraling down at one time and I was consumed with knowing I was gonna be a single mom and worrying about how I was gonna take care of my daughter and how am I gonna afford child care and I had every stressor in the world weighing on me is what I felt like well a crazy thing happened I made this vision board I looked at it every day and I gradually started taking action one day at a time one moment at a time moving towards my vision and it was amazing because my wife started transitioning towards that board this is what crazy this is eight years later I found my vision board and what is so wild about this board is every single thing on this board has come to fruition eight years later every single thing my job is fitness and nutrition I'm happy I'm remarried the crazy thing the little girl in this picture looks about my daughter's age which is eight and it's interesting I found this eight years later the Golf Course Pete's view on the very top this was just eerie to me when I saw that I didn't even remember I have put that there and Here I am in a house with a golf course view a view almost identical to where I got married this summer the exact car that me and my husband just bought the exact car I mean how eerie is that everything on this board came to fruition so when someone says a vision board is hokey or it doesn't work you can't tell me that I mean this was just absolutely crazy this worked so how does what I could apply to you well when you can fine-tune your vision and look at it and work towards it every day your goals to become a reality are you ready to do this I'm gonna walk you through exactly how to create your vision your goals and how to not just make Sanna possibility but how to make them a reality I'm also gonna show you why just having goals without creating a vision falls short in the context of the mind-body connection I know what you might be thinking of course I'm gonna address also while some consider what I'm about to share about vision boards and goal is to be hokey and why they never create one I'm gonna show you why we can't listen to them and we've got to do this and you're ready to make your goals a reality here's the five-step process that I want you to implement right now the first thing you need to do is grab a stack of magazines I want you to grab things that are really appealing to you whether that's car magazines vacation ones Fitness ones anything that is visually appealing to you okay the next thing you're gonna want to do is you're gonna want to grab a piece of poster board the final thing I need you to grab with that is a pair of scissors and some glue or tape and you're ready to get started no I don't want you eating out anything I just want you cutting ripping tearing shapes that you like adding color if you want making it very visually appealing gluing it or taping it to your board okay so now you've had the fun creative craft part but now you've got to take that finished product and put it someplace you will see it every day so here's the deal this visual board process can be used for anyone including you no matter where you are in life now it doesn't mean you sit back and do nothing once you create it you still have to think about these images and take action actions that move you forward for instance once you have your vision do you choose to sit there watching mindless TV for 10 hours once you do but once you've set your goals or do you read books on the top I can look through the podcast on the topic and meet with and study other people who have reached that goal to gain more knowledge which one would best help you move towards your goal nothing against been watching TV we've all done that at some point but if you aren't where you want to be yet taking action once you that vision and having that look that image to look at and that vision daily is what reminds you to take that action because you've got to take that action successful people know that to achieve goals and make them reality you have to first get your mind right and decide it's possible now equally as important the body needs to follow you see without the right nutrition hydration levels fitness and health it is really not possible to reach your full potential of clarity stamina confidence drive and focused everybody's heard the saying where the mind goes the body will always follow but I like to add where your mind goes your body will follow and with that your goals become a reality when your mindset is in a good place it is a lot easier to get your body into peak shape and when the mind and body are in alignment well transformation and goal achievement is not only possible but it absolutely happens you're unstoppable are you ready

hi guys Natalie Jill here today we're doing an ab workout and we're gonna use a stability ball so you can do this anywhere now I've got six exercises and we're gonna start to combine them but the key to abs is really three parts one you've got to dial in your nutrition because we want to eat the right foods so we could get rid of that overall fat so we can see them second we've got to decide that it is possible because if you tell yourself you're never gonna have abs it's not possible for you you're not gonna get them and then the third thing is you've got to do the right exercises when you do the right exercises you get that core definition you get that flat belly you get those abs so when you do the other work with the diet the nutrition they start to show no I love bodyweight exercises and I love using a stability ball with them because it challenges your core even further so what you need for this is a stability ball you can get them lots of places and then a mat and I'm gonna full of my mat over just to protect my knees and we're gonna get started are you ready okay so the first exercise is just a simple knee roll out now what I want you to think of here is you're gonna squeeze your glutes core tight we're gonna put our elbows down on the ball and it's a slow roll out and and just like this just do one or two to feel what you want to feel I think you should not feel that in your lower back you want to feel it all in the ABS and we're gonna take it down ready to take it oh in now with here you don't want to just make this an arm workout if you're using your abs rolling out and in we're getting money to it there's no magic number of reps but if you wanna count let me get to leaf tedx so you want to really concentrate on feeling it that's what's important here give me three more right here nice okay same move but we're gonna start from the standing position and just rolling it all the way out and then back in whoo gets a little bit harder up here [Music] are you feelin ah-hah if this to advance you can stay from your needs and continue with me got three more right here nice all right mini break hey this one's gonna get a little bit more challenging are you ready we're gonna go to a plank position forearms on the ball but we're gonna circle it clockwise and counter-clockwise it'll look like this plank position and ready take it to a circle whoo keep your back flat no arching it core engaged should be feeling these a lot in those ABS they should be burning two more one direction pull it up switch it to the other direction this is an advanced move if this is too hard you can do this from your knees but you're gonna work up to getting it from your feet and you should be feeling these burn or holy ohan hey-oh three more circles pull shake it out aha okay we're gonna take this one now to a plank we're gonna put our feet up on the ball and we're challenging our core here we've got to stabilize the ball it's a simple move take some concentration so feet up on the ball plank position from your hands we've got it right here and we're just holding just simple hold right here now with that plank you don't want to kid down here tuck ribs down glutes tight core engage and it's just the hole just like that how long can you hold we're gonna go five minutes just kidding holding it here cool okay mini break now the goal is to get really good with these that you don't have to take that mini breaks you can just keep going in between but it's your first time doing it with me we're just gonna take a mini break and then we're gonna reset on that and we're gonna add on to that are you ready okay bring it back up to that plank this time hands plank we're gonna take it to a tuck it's gonna look just like this ready take it in Oh back out hang out made four more right here nice oh how are you feeling okay taking it up another notch because we're gonna progressively get harder on each move this time that same position we're gonna take it to a pike and then we're gonna do a little combo move over you're ready to go you got this okay on your hands feet on the ball is what it looks like take it to a pike up hold and then roll it all the way back here whoa you'll feel the head do it again up roll it out Oh give me three more just like this last one whoa snake job whoa how are you feeling all right if you got those down and you're able to do those without issues meaning you're feeling in your abs but you've got the right form now then you're ready for the combo move so for this one we're gonna take that plane cold and we're gonna do a top and a pike are you ready okay so reset hands feet on the ball looks like this tuck out Pike back out again tuck out pike roll out give me two more like this hug it out whoa last one [Music] whoa aah you did a good job so there's no magic number or rep with these you want to do it's intense for you you want to always feel it in those abs and stability ball adds that extra challenge because

hi guys we've got an arm toning workout today super brief quick workout we're just going to make it intense and you're going to feel it in those arms are you ready first exercise we're going to start with your hands on the ground plus on the ground to toes and fingertips point it forward and it's just a little bit of a lean back just like this it's getting those triceps warmed up the backs of those arms just a few of these until you start to really feel it then you have an option when you start to feel it you can keep it here if this is really hard or you can challenge your help by lifting it up here and taking it to a dip and we're going to keep going in this position just like this and you can keep it here because we're doing a lot of them or you can challenge yourself more and lift the leg up with me just like this bringing your core into the equation making a little bit harder keep skipping it and if your leg is up go ahead and switch legs just like that are you feeling it yet because I'm definitely feeling it right now keep it going now wherever you are if your legs are up or not put it down keep sipping just like this and then take it back down to that beginning position and just taking it back just like the plane you should really be feeling it in your arms at this point right now going full shake it out okay we often yet we're going to take it to crab crawl to that same position we're going to walk it forward back side to side are you ready so if you get forward back side to side now you can get all crazy with you if you want you could take a big long walk in different directions or you can keep it going front back side to side but the key here is you're working back to those arms and you're involving your core just a little bit too but you're distracting yourself from what you're actually doing while you're concentrating on these you're not thinking about the fact that you're really burning and working those arm muscles keep going keep crab crawling it so this points working around the dog plop plop can I do it with me one more set just like this front back side and side oh no I feel those it's a lot that was your spotty weight my point to these it doesn't take a lot of time and doesn't take a huge amount but you're really working in constant on that one muscle and you're focusing on what I supposed to feel like you can really get a good workout in a short amount of time my heart rates up feeling those muscles it's a great arm toning workout for more of my workouts check out my channel below and make sure you hit that subscribe button

gonna use bars now you don't have to use bars I'm gonna tell you what you can use instead but I love using liebert bars for this delievered equalizer bars because it really helps me accelerate my upper body workout so what we're gonna do I'm gonna take you through a series of five exercises and gonna show you modifications and you can do this every exercise I show you I'm gonna tell you what you can use instead but if you've got bars grab them because if you have leave word to equalizer bars you're gonna love this workout and if not we're gonna start that first exercise on you can get a sturdy chair or a low countertop or if you're gonna do this to the gym you can use a lowered squat rack that will work too but what we want to start with is some basic push ups now bear with me of your advances I'm gonna take you through the advanced move but for beginners we're gonna start your feet place slightly apart we're gonna start with a basic pushup this is a beginner right here and just working it up and you'll want to alternate legs here if you're a beginner if you are advanced even if you can do great push-ups I want you to start higher up here at this incline and get a motion going so you're either right here or your one foot in front to make it a little bit easier and if you don't have bars you could be using a chair or countertop or a lower squat rack but I just want to get everything warmed up right here because we're gonna really work that upper body today okay just a few more wherever you are sure you're breathing give me one more good one whew okay now we're gonna take it lower so with this one you could take it all the way to the floor or if you're using the levered equalizer bars with me I want you to turn it on the side here and you'll place your hands here this is good it helps you with your wrist if you're using a bar because you're grabbing versus placing it on the floor but either way got standard push ups it's gonna be a little bit harder than when we were at that standing incline I just take it down and up just like this and I love this especially for clients that have wrist issues because they can grab on and it really helps I love the bars for this a few more here if you need to make it easier you can always come down to your knees I just want you to get in this push-up have it right here take one more down up nice good job okay we're gonna take it to a tricep press so again you can use a chair or a lowered to Iraq or the Liebherr to equalizer I'm gonna take a mat fold it up to protect my knees right here we're gonna work the backs of our arms our triceps so what we've got here feed a little bit off the ground just a slight dip down just like this here we go go keep that core tight back flat down it up all that weight and force should be in a back of your arms bring it down nice squeeze down up whoo give me four more right here one more ha nice good job shake it out she feel that doesn't take a lot of these you just want to make sure you are feeling it no magic number our rep it's whatever's intense for you on whatever you're going to feel okay we're gonna take it to a standing position moving on with that upper body and the triceps now you can use a lowered squat rack you can use a lowered bench a chair for Jen I'm using liebhard equalizers now I'm gonna start here with my feet on the ground and I'm just gonna take it to a basic dip this is what it looks like right here now we're gonna start to do a dip just like this so that's option one option two is to lift your feet off the ground and take it to a dip just like this and then if you're really feeling it you can bring your feet forward and hold it like that okay people show everyone you're gonna do and we're gonna get set up and we're gonna take it down ready take it down and up nice no matter where you are beginner intermediate advanced take it from where you are you don't have to go all the way down just that small movement to feel it in the back to those arms down it up give me three more right here nice shake it out whoa little mini tri step step stretch right there cool we're gonna move on to our backs and this is a modified chin

my name is Lisa I am 53 years old and from the Portland Oregon area and I'd like to tell you a little bit about what I experienced in Natalie Joel's fat loss Academy and I'm having a little bit of a celebration because I've spotted my collarbone whoa I've not seen that in how long for me I averaged about a pound of weight loss a week throughout the eight weeks of the program I'm continuing to lose but more importantly it was like nine inches I had lost after eight weeks hi everyone my name is Anita Collier and I'm from Plainfield Indiana and I'm 53 years old ended up losing 20 pounds of seems like easy just effortless positive action I lost about 20 pounds hi my name is Lisa I'm 53 years old and from Plainfield Illinois I lost 16 pounds in 5 months I still have a little bit more to go but I'm in great shape I'm much happier a lot more energy I'm Angelique great about 13 pounds I hope I've lost since I started my name is Dina I live in Utica New York I'm 42 years old since I joined FLA I'm 12 pounds lighter I'm motivated I have healthier habits my name is Lori Bushnell I've lost 20 pounds 20 pounds so far and I feel so good my name is Corey boney I live in Christopher Florida I have faced many health challenges my entire life so I got to the point where I was a hundred pounds overweight my marriage fell apart I had two kids and that impacted my life my stamina my my confidence my emotional well-being I'm in the was in the same boat that many people have probably found themselves in where you look at your closet and you you realize that the clothes that used to fit it's not only that they don't fit right they just don't fit anymore you cannot zip them up you can't button them up my biggest challenge before SLA was constant food cravings constantly being hungry and I came to the point where I didn't enjoy my life anymore imagine you are being hungry 24/7 I did struggle with my weight and especially after I had my daughter I think that's classic for a lot of women after you have children and your body changes and you become involved in your family and your children and when I was at my heaviest I felt it in my joints I felt it in in my breathing and in my I really wanted to shed some fat three years ago I had to adjust to a life with autism as I raised my eight-year-old autistic grandson I became a very depressed person I began gaining weight from the stress the stress eating and on top of that I was going into menopause I'm hypothyroid I have low blood pressure so losing weight was a real battle and I was getting no support from my doctors they were all telling me you're over 50 this is just something you have to deal with I've been fighting a thyroid hypothyroidism now for the last few years in October my mother-in-law that lived with us for seven years had passed away and then in November my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer and there's all these stresses and I knew that was just not doing good with with all the stress coming into my life and that's what I do when I'm stressed I turned to food and not good food for that matter so I needed a change and I need to be right away you know at my age it seems to be harder to drop the fat you're going through menopause you have all these issues in the way her program really proved to work she never disappoints if you follow what she says it truly does work she gives you all the tools to solutions you don't feel bloated you don't feel tired you have energy I learned step by step how my body works how it reacts to food that I put in it and how I can change my diet and balance my meals without counting calories to get where I want to be I think the most important thing I learned was just the supplements what I was doing right what I was doing wrong and just to re-register and just her advice has just been amazing to me it changed my perspective in life it changed my perspective of nutrition and exercise I became emotionally stronger physically stronger something's working the energy level that I didn't have struggle just get out of bed you know my husband every day says how good I looked and he's proud of me as well as my kids I was on vacation last week and first time in a long time I felt great walking on the beach in that in a swimsuit I'm back in the clothes that were in my closet is like going shopping in my own closet it's incredible was able to change my mindset get rid of all the negative self-talk that I had that was holding me back I overcame my problem I'm no longer hungry I cannot stress enough how this is a program unlike anything I've ever seen before the one thing I like the bad FLA it was on my time I could go through the modules when it was convenient for me I didn't have to make an appointment to go see somebody the group at the support you know you feel like you're you're bonding with women that you've never met it's nice to have that I noticed the best part was my co-workers at work that were watching what I was eating which is great food it wasn't like diet food and just saying would you just seem like you're just shredding it's just coming off so easy so I think that's the key it's just an easy program to follow it makes sense it's just the way we should eat one of the biggest things I've taken away from it is just this peaceful serene confidence that I have now tackled it once and for all I know how to eat right I know how to workout and the weight issues are never it's never going to be an issue anymore for me when she said you can lose up to five to seven pounds in a week it really can happen it's a truly a lifestyle change it's not a a week or two or a month diet and then you're done it's one of those things that I would do over and over again I would recommend it to all my friends if you're on the fence about it believe me the only thing you're going to lose is weight fat and you're going to feel so much better I have more energy I highly recommend this to anybody who's been struggling and trying all the different programs all you have to do is decide to listen to Natalie and her team they are inspirational Natalie is like having a personal trainer a best friend a support

that to the help of Natalie Jill trusted in this team and you'll get where you want to be I promise you that I could keep going on and on about all the positive things that it did for me but it's something you have to experience as something only you can feel if you let yourself experience this you will never regret it it will change your life no one can force you to do it you have to decide to do it you have to come to that point you know you get sick and tired of it so do something about it
